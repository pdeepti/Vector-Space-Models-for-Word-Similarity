should online pharmacies be prohibited because they can undercut prices and drive out competition ?
the doc morris case has raised tough legal issues . a state administrative court in the state of saarland decided on wednesday that the dutch online pharmaceutical company doc morris has to shut down its first and only branch in germany until the european court of justice reaches a final verdict on the legality of the business . after opening in july , a doc morris branch in the city of saarbrücken met with immediate criticism from private pharmacists in the region .
they protested the legality of the online discounter on the grounds that they would n't be able to match its prices . critics also referenced a german law which stipulates that pharmacies may only be run by trained pharmacists , not by corporate entities . a final decision has yet to be made bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional pharmacies feel threatened by the discounter " the pharmacists want to do everything to push us out of the market , " said doc morris director ralf däinghaus . on aug .
9 the state court in saarbrücken rejected petitions for the closure of the german pharmaceutical branch , citing freedom of establishment under european law .
wednesday 's decision for its temporary closure was issued because three saarbrücken pharmacies have filed an appeal . the european court of justice will have to assess the apparent contradiction between germany 's pharmacy law and the european union 's freedom of establishment law . the state government in saarland is opposed to the administrative court 's decision and has said it considers it legal for doc morris to conduct business in germany . saarland 's minister of health josef hecken said the state government will appeal wednesday 's decision to the state 's higher administrative court . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court allows controversial discount pharmacy in germany a german court on wednesday ruled that a dutch internet pharmacy can operate a branch in germany .

he says both need to come down from the sky and take a look at the reality on the ground . dw-world.de : what did you think of pope benedict 's visit ? hans küng : i think many people here in germany have an ambivalent impression .
benedict has a very nice personality ; he 's shown himself as a very friendly person .
he 's also not a media pope like his predecessor .
he 's not an actor who is looking for applause . he concentrates on the central truths of christianity and faith in god .
on the other hand , he did n't accomplish any of the reforms to the catholic church that some people were looking for . which reforms ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : küng compared the pope to another leader , george w. bush there are a great many things .
if you take the situation around munich , a lot of parishes are without priests .
and just having a lot of people in the seats does n't mean that they are all believers . of course everybody finds it a very stimulating event to see the pope up close and lots of people are looking for a spiritual father and a more credible representative of moral integrity , justice and peace than many politicians today . but there were fewer people at the liturgy than had been expected .
we should not think that all those who were coming to see a star are now convinced and faithful catholic believers . why do n't you think that the great wave of enthusiasm that greeted the pope could have a vitalizing effect on the church ? it would be great if it had consistent consequences .
it is not enough to preach and have a big event .
the most recent public opinion poll by mckinsey asked whether the catholic church should be reformed and 43 percent said yes .
this is 40 percent more than before . in the same poll , 45 percent - nearly half of all germans - said they have no confidence in the catholic church as an institution . the people in munich were very happy - they have a german pope , a bavarian pope .
it the event had been held in magdeburg , in a new german state , where only 8 percent are registered as christians , we would have had a different image of germany . what do you think about the pope 's comments on the unity of the church ?
do you think he could influence more cooperation between the catholics and the protestants ? of course he could .
i was very pleased that the german president , horst köhler , who is a member of the global ethic foundation , said when the pope arrived : " in the name of many christians in this country , more ecumenical progress . "
and the pope answered in a very convincing way .
he said he would do everything to bring catholic and protestants together . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope blessed the organ but overlooked deeper issues , said küng afterwards , when he met with other christians all the controversial issues between catholics and protestants were just ignored .
most people here in germany would have to have a common eucharist , the acknowledgement of the ministers of the protestant churches .
they would have a solution for marriages from different churches , and of course the problem of papal jurisdiction and infallibility .
all this was practically ignored .
even the representatives of the protestant churches did n't have the courage to mention it . do you feel that the changes you 've mentioned , including unity among christians , will be possible during the tenure of the current pope ? i had a long conversation with him , which i 'm very grateful for .
i still hope that he will finally see that he can not only talk - he must finally take some action .
and i still hope that , after a certain time of reflection , he will do something . sometimes i have the impression he 's like president bush , who takes his air force one jet and flies over new orleans just to see how the situation is .
but finally he had to come down to the ground to see what the reality is . the diocese in regensburg , where the pope was , is probably the most divided diocese in germany .
the bishop of regensburg replaced practically all the elected members of the diocesan council in an authoritarian way with like-minded people .
and people could not understand why the pope just made comments about the organ in the regensburg church in the presence of this bishop . hans küng was professor of ecumenical theology and director of the institute for ecumenical research at the university of tübingen from 1960 until his retirement in 1996 .
he also served as official theological consultant to the second vatican council appointed by pope john xxiii .

benedict has a very nice personality ; he 's shown himself as a very friendly person .
he 's also not a media pope like his predecessor .
he 's not an actor who is looking for applause . he concentrates on the central truths of christianity and faith in god .
on the other hand , he did n't accomplish any of the reforms to the catholic church that some people were looking for . which reforms ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : küng compared the pope to another leader , george w. bush there are a great many things .
if you take the situation around munich , a lot of parishes are without priests .
and just having a lot of people in the seats does n't mean that they are all believers . of course everybody finds it a very stimulating event to see the pope up close and lots of people are looking for a spiritual father and a more credible representative of moral integrity , justice and peace than many politicians today . but there were fewer people at the liturgy than had been expected .
we should not think that all those who were coming to see a star are now convinced and faithful catholic believers . why do n't you think that the great wave of enthusiasm that greeted the pope could have a vitalizing effect on the church ? it would be great if it had consistent consequences .
it is not enough to preach and have a big event .
the most recent public opinion poll by mckinsey asked whether the catholic church should be reformed and 43 percent said yes .
this is 40 percent more than before . in the same poll , 45 percent - nearly half of all germans - said they have no confidence in the catholic church as an institution . the people in munich were very happy - they have a german pope , a bavarian pope .
it the event had been held in magdeburg , in a new german state , where only 8 percent are registered as christians , we would have had a different image of germany . what do you think about the pope 's comments on the unity of the church ?
do you think he could influence more cooperation between the catholics and the protestants ? of course he could .
i was very pleased that the german president , horst köhler , who is a member of the global ethic foundation , said when the pope arrived : " in the name of many christians in this country , more ecumenical progress . "

most people here in germany would have to have a common eucharist , the acknowledgement of the ministers of the protestant churches .
they would have a solution for marriages from different churches , and of course the problem of papal jurisdiction and infallibility .
all this was practically ignored .
even the representatives of the protestant churches did n't have the courage to mention it . do you feel that the changes you 've mentioned , including unity among christians , will be possible during the tenure of the current pope ? i had a long conversation with him , which i 'm very grateful for .
i still hope that he will finally see that he can not only talk - he must finally take some action .

should online pharmacies be prohibited because they can undercut prices and drive out competition ?
the doc morris case has raised tough legal issues . a state administrative court in the state of saarland decided on wednesday that the dutch online pharmaceutical company doc morris has to shut down its first and only branch in germany until the european court of justice reaches a final verdict on the legality of the business . after opening in july , a doc morris branch in the city of saarbrücken met with immediate criticism from private pharmacists in the region .
they protested the legality of the online discounter on the grounds that they would n't be able to match its prices . critics also referenced a german law which stipulates that pharmacies may only be run by trained pharmacists , not by corporate entities . a final decision has yet to be made bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional pharmacies feel threatened by the discounter " the pharmacists want to do everything to push us out of the market , " said doc morris director ralf däinghaus . on aug .
9 the state court in saarbrücken rejected petitions for the closure of the german pharmaceutical branch , citing freedom of establishment under european law .
wednesday 's decision for its temporary closure was issued because three saarbrücken pharmacies have filed an appeal . the european court of justice will have to assess the apparent contradiction between germany 's pharmacy law and the european union 's freedom of establishment law . the state government in saarland is opposed to the administrative court 's decision and has said it considers it legal for doc morris to conduct business in germany . saarland 's minister of health josef hecken said the state government will appeal wednesday 's decision to the state 's higher administrative court . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court allows controversial discount pharmacy in germany a german court on wednesday ruled that a dutch internet pharmacy can operate a branch in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.09.2006 opinion : it 's time to formulate the lebanon mission clearly großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german cabinet has agreed to send 2,400 troops to patrol the waters along lebanon 's coast .
but going there is easier than coming back , according to deutsche welle 's nina werkhäuser . it was a decision with " historical dimensions " for germany .
those were the words chancellor angela merkel used to describe the cabinet 's consent to send naval units to the middle east .
indeed , it is a historical decision to send armed german soldiers to the mideast .
for the last 60 years , such a mission would have been unthinkable because it was thought , for understandable historical reasons , that there should be as great a distance as possible between german troops and israel . that such a german foreign policy taboo could be broken may be astonishing .
but de facto , berlin had no other choice .
if germany had withdrawn from the mission , it would have laid the credibility of its foreign policy on the line and would have made berlin 's attempts to stabilize the situation in the mideast in the past few weeks seem absurd . israel explicitly wished for the bundeswehr 's participation .
that was not only the most important condition , it was an obligation .
without israel 's endorsement , angela merkel 's cabinet never would have approved of the mission . nevertheless , there is still a clearly defined line on the ground that the german government has decided not to cross : there will be no ground troops in the middle east .
other countries in the unifil mission should and will take over this responsibility .
they will have the difficult task of working together with the lebanese army to keep hezbollah in check .
how that should be done is still not clear , however . losing focus of peacekeeping mission purposes berlin is steering clear of that dilemma and is concentrating on its naval mission , which is supposed to hinder the delivery of arms via the sea to hezbollah militants .
it is difficult to say at this moment how effective that will be . germany will lead a european naval flotilla that has been granted a robust mandate ; it can stop and search incoming ships by force , if necessary .
despite the potential danger , the risk remains calculable .
yet only with this mandate will the parliament approve this week 's cabinet decision , when it comes up for a vote next week . that support nevertheless is guaranteed .
the vote will then turn the bundeswehr into an army that knows no borders .
but germany is paying a high price for this move , particularly when the choice of peacekeeping missions has become a bit random in nature .
the interests in the middle east are understandable .
but is a peacekeeping operation in the democratic republic of congo really necessary ? the large new mission in the middle east with up to 2,400 soldiers could , like the operations in kosovo and afghanistan , last for years .

but going there is easier than coming back , according to deutsche welle 's nina werkhäuser . it was a decision with " historical dimensions " for germany .
those were the words chancellor angela merkel used to describe the cabinet 's consent to send naval units to the middle east .
indeed , it is a historical decision to send armed german soldiers to the mideast .
for the last 60 years , such a mission would have been unthinkable because it was thought , for understandable historical reasons , that there should be as great a distance as possible between german troops and israel . that such a german foreign policy taboo could be broken may be astonishing .
but de facto , berlin had no other choice .
if germany had withdrawn from the mission , it would have laid the credibility of its foreign policy on the line and would have made berlin 's attempts to stabilize the situation in the mideast in the past few weeks seem absurd . israel explicitly wished for the bundeswehr 's participation .
that was not only the most important condition , it was an obligation .

" i had an image of him as being more distant than his predecessor , that has changed a lot , " baumgartner said . personal visit the visit is likely to be remembered as a sentimental stroll down memory lane in what the 79-year-old pope himself admitted may be his final major visit to his homeland . the emotional high point of the trip came on wednesday when the pontiff knelt in prayer at the graves of his mother , father and sister . the private prayers at the tiny ziegetsdorf cemetery outside the city of regensburg came on a day which the vatican said had been reserved for " private time " for the pope and his elder brother georg . following the 20-minute visit , the two brothers went the short distance to the house in the neighboring suburb of pentling , which the head of the roman catholic church has owned since he was a theology professor at regensburg university . pope focused on family in an earlier address , the pope had appealed for unity within the roman catholic church , where pressure groups have challenged his traditional views of marriage and the family . " just as in an organ an expert hand must constantly bring disharmony back to consonance , so we in the church ... always need to find anew , through our communion in faith , harmony in the praise of god and in fraternal love . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope , at a mass at the islinger field in regensburg on tuesday on tuesday benedict had hit the only political note of his visit , during which his addresses have been almost entirely spiritual , when he fleetingly criticised the islamic concept of " jihad .

" the muslim world is currently undergoing a deep crisis and any attack from the west can aggravate this crisis , " ahmad was quoted as saying by italy 's ansa news agency .

he says both need to come down from the sky and take a look at the reality on the ground . dw-world.de : what did you think of pope benedict 's visit ? hans küng : i think many people here in germany have an ambivalent impression .
benedict has a very nice personality ; he 's shown himself as a very friendly person .
he 's also not a media pope like his predecessor .
he 's not an actor who is looking for applause . he concentrates on the central truths of christianity and faith in god .
on the other hand , he did n't accomplish any of the reforms to the catholic church that some people were looking for . which reforms ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : küng compared the pope to another leader , george w. bush there are a great many things .
if you take the situation around munich , a lot of parishes are without priests .
and just having a lot of people in the seats does n't mean that they are all believers . of course everybody finds it a very stimulating event to see the pope up close and lots of people are looking for a spiritual father and a more credible representative of moral integrity , justice and peace than many politicians today . but there were fewer people at the liturgy than had been expected .
we should not think that all those who were coming to see a star are now convinced and faithful catholic believers . why do n't you think that the great wave of enthusiasm that greeted the pope could have a vitalizing effect on the church ? it would be great if it had consistent consequences .
it is not enough to preach and have a big event .
the most recent public opinion poll by mckinsey asked whether the catholic church should be reformed and 43 percent said yes .
this is 40 percent more than before . in the same poll , 45 percent - nearly half of all germans - said they have no confidence in the catholic church as an institution . the people in munich were very happy - they have a german pope , a bavarian pope .
it the event had been held in magdeburg , in a new german state , where only 8 percent are registered as christians , we would have had a different image of germany . what do you think about the pope 's comments on the unity of the church ?
do you think he could influence more cooperation between the catholics and the protestants ? of course he could .
i was very pleased that the german president , horst köhler , who is a member of the global ethic foundation , said when the pope arrived : " in the name of many christians in this country , more ecumenical progress . "
and the pope answered in a very convincing way .
he said he would do everything to bring catholic and protestants together . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope blessed the organ but overlooked deeper issues , said küng afterwards , when he met with other christians all the controversial issues between catholics and protestants were just ignored .
most people here in germany would have to have a common eucharist , the acknowledgement of the ministers of the protestant churches .
they would have a solution for marriages from different churches , and of course the problem of papal jurisdiction and infallibility .
all this was practically ignored .
even the representatives of the protestant churches did n't have the courage to mention it . do you feel that the changes you 've mentioned , including unity among christians , will be possible during the tenure of the current pope ? i had a long conversation with him , which i 'm very grateful for .
i still hope that he will finally see that he can not only talk - he must finally take some action .
and i still hope that , after a certain time of reflection , he will do something . sometimes i have the impression he 's like president bush , who takes his air force one jet and flies over new orleans just to see how the situation is .
but finally he had to come down to the ground to see what the reality is . the diocese in regensburg , where the pope was , is probably the most divided diocese in germany .
the bishop of regensburg replaced practically all the elected members of the diocesan council in an authoritarian way with like-minded people .
and people could not understand why the pope just made comments about the organ in the regensburg church in the presence of this bishop . hans küng was professor of ecumenical theology and director of the institute for ecumenical research at the university of tübingen from 1960 until his retirement in 1996 .
he also served as official theological consultant to the second vatican council appointed by pope john xxiii .

the german leader said she again raised human rights issues with the chinese leader and urged beijing to respect the freedom of the press . " in our discussions , we touched on human rights issues and i made it clear that these rights are inalienable and should be respected everywhere , " merkel told reporters at a press conference with wen . she said she had singled out the freedom of the press and stressed that journalists should be allowed to carry out their work during the 2008 olympic games in beijing .
merkel alluded to new media rules announced on sunday that require foreign media to seek approval to distribute news , pictures and graphics within china . " i said clearly that on this occasion too , the freedom of the press will play an important role and that we should continue to discuss the matter , " merkel said . her remarks follow the recent jailing of two journalists in what observers describe as a clampdown on the media ahead of the games and the 17th communist party congress next year .
the chinese government recently sentenced new york times researcher zhao yan to three years in prison for fraud and singapore straits times correspondent ching cheong to five years for allegedly spying for taiwan . intellectual property rights another area that has rankled many western politicians and business leaders is intellectual property rights -lrb- ipr -rrb- and the piracy of films and cds .
german and chinese officials took limited action on thursday by signing an ipr accord . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pirate software cds are common in chinese street stalls under the agreement , german experts will help train chinese patent officials and a series of exchanges are to be arranged for personnel from both countries . " this will help ensure that there is more reliability for those who in invest in china , " said merkel at the press conference . for his part , wen hailed the growth of german-chinese economic ties and said he expected the overall trade volume between both nations to reach $ 80 billion dollars -lrb- 63 billion euros -rrb- , after climbing to 70 billion dollars last year . a rms embargo merkel and wen also discussed the topic of the eu 's arms embargo imposed against china in 1989 after the bloody crackdown on pro-democracy protests at tiananmen square .
merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder , had together with france led calls in 2004 to lift the embargo but this was strongly opposed by both the us and japan , which say a resumption of european weapons sales to beijing will worsen tensions between china and taiwan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the violent crackdown on protests at tiananmen square led to the embargo merkel has said she will not go down schröder 's path .
with germany holding the eu presidency during the first half of 2007 , she said " the arms embargo theme is currently not on the agenda . " lifting the embargo was a question of " mutual respect and equality " said wen , adding that he hoped eu countries would have " enough vision and foresight " to tackle the issue . dw staff -lrb- afp / dpa / jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de china clamps down on counterfeit world cup goods chinese authorities have seized thousands of counterfeit world cup products , just over two weeks before soccer 's biggest event kicks off in germany , state media reported this week .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 14.09.2006 imf raises prognosis for german economy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german economy is on a solid foundation currently the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- has ramped up its forecast for the german economy .
europe 's largest economy has been resilient in spite of high oil prices , but the imf says hazards still lurk . germany 's stock market has been booming for more than three years .
the country 's companies have been enjoying better than average profits during that time .
now , it is starting to pay dividends and the international monetary fund , in its twice-yearly assessment of the global economy , has raised its 2006 economic growth forecasts for germany to 2 percent from its prediction of 1.3 percent in the spring . at its meeting in singapore , the imf 's chief economist raghuram rajan praised europe 's largest economy , saying " it was on a roll . " but berlin 's measures to lower spending , such as merging unemployment and welfare benefits were not having as much as an effect that had been expected , rajan said .
he suggested lowering income taxes to help spur private consumption , recommending more flexibility in the labor market and increased competition in the banking and utilities sectors . adding more kick to the economy , rajan said , alluding to reforms , would not necessarily mean lower incomes or the end of germany 's welfare state . europe should take advantage of growth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eurozone is expected to grow 2.4 percent the imf is not alone in its optimism regards germany .
the eu commission projects growth of 2.2 percent .
only berlin , possibly stung by overly rosy forecasts that went unmet in the recent past , sees more modest growth at 1.6 percent for the current year . a scheduled increase of germany 's value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- as of january will boost private spending until the end of this year .
after that , the imf expects growth to stagnate to 1.3 percent . the economy in the euro zone is experiencing growth not seen since the dot.com days , expected to hit 2.4 percent .
rajan views the stronger developments as an opportunity to pare down public deficits , in line with the eu 's stability and growth pact target to hold such shortfalls to 3.0 percent or less of total output .
as for germany , he echoed his calls for reforms to europe . " europe 's leaders need to find the will to take on vested interests in both labor and in the corporate sector , " said rajan .
" this necessary but difficult domestic battle is constantly postponed until after the next election , " he added . balancing inflation and interest rates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high oil prices will continue to threaten world economies rising oil prices have yet had a great effect on consumer prices but with a barrel of crude expected to hover around or above the $ 70 per barrel mark , inflation is a concern central banks around the world must face . the imf found that with euro zone inflation running " below but close to " the european central bank 's -lrb- ecb -rrb- 2.0 percent objective , " further interest rate increases will likely be needed to maintain price stability over the medium term if the expansion develops as expected . " the ecb since december has raised its benchmark rate four times , taking it from 2.0 to 3.0 percent , and has made clear it intends to carry on with monetary tightening .
but the imf cautioned : " with underlying inflationary pressures still well contained ... policymakers can afford to be cautious in tightening the monetary policy stance , all the more so given the risk of euro appreciation and weaker growth in the united states .

during a video conference with other coaches , he dropped a hint that he may be back soon . once a soccer player gets a taste of coaching , it can be difficult for him to leave it behind .
when jürgen klinsmann resigned this summer as germany 's head coach after a better-than-expected third-place performance , speculation immediately started that he would take a seat on a bench somewhere else . two months after the end of the world cup , he has made his first public appearance during a video conference at the end of a meeting of world cup managers organized by fifa in berlin and alluded to his desires none too clearly . " who knows , perhaps i 'll be a coach once again at the 2010 world cup -lrb- in south africa -rrb- , " he said . klinsmann , calling in to the conference from his home in california , still enjoys " taking -lrb- his -rrb- kids to school , " something he has more than ample time to do , having retired four days after guiding germany into third at this year 's world cup finals . coach for usa ?
or possibly an african country ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coaching a striker like ivory coast 's didier drogba could be enticing klinsmann 's logical new employer would be the united states soccer federation , which separated paths from bruce arena who had coached the american men 's team for eight years .
it would also be sensible for him considering that the team has its training quarters in southern california . klinsmann has consistently denied the connection with the us team and theo zwanziger , the newly elected president of the german football federation , raised another possible scenario for the 42-year-old who has always had a penchant for travel . zwanziger suggested recently that klinsmann " might take charge of a team in africa . " coaching just any old team on the sometimes times chaotic african continent , however , would be a risky undertaking considering that only the hosts south africa have a guaranteed ticket to the finals in four years .
at the 2006 tournament , all four sub-saharan teams - ivory coast , angola , ghana and togo - made their debuts , knocking out regular african favorites like cameroon , nigeria and south africa during qualifications . for the time being , klinsmann can continue to take his kids to school , and savor the fact that , as he said at the conference , " germany practically rediscovered itself " at the world cup this summer . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de coach klinsmann calls it quits in germany days after leading germany to third place in the 2006 world cup with a young team he personally put together , coach jürgen klinsmann has decided to step down .
he will be replaced by his assistant , joachim löw .

it was his last event on his personal six-day trip to his native bavaria homeland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many pilgrims spent the night at a field outside of regensburg for an outdoor mass on tuesday martina baumgarnter , a 22-year-old student from erding near munich , told ap news agency that the trip had shown her the warmer side of the 79-year-old former theologian who succeeded the charismatic john paul ii last year . " i had an image of him as being more distant than his predecessor , that has changed a lot , " baumgartner said . personal visit the visit is likely to be remembered as a sentimental stroll down memory lane in what the 79-year-old pope himself admitted may be his final major visit to his homeland . the emotional high point of the trip came on wednesday when the pontiff knelt in prayer at the graves of his mother , father and sister . the private prayers at the tiny ziegetsdorf cemetery outside the city of regensburg came on a day which the vatican said had been reserved for " private time " for the pope and his elder brother georg . following the 20-minute visit , the two brothers went the short distance to the house in the neighboring suburb of pentling , which the head of the roman catholic church has owned since he was a theology professor at regensburg university . pope focused on family in an earlier address , the pope had appealed for unity within the roman catholic church , where pressure groups have challenged his traditional views of marriage and the family . " just as in an organ an expert hand must constantly bring disharmony back to consonance , so we in the church ... always need to find anew , through our communion in faith , harmony in the praise of god and in fraternal love . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope , at a mass at the islinger field in regensburg on tuesday on tuesday benedict had hit the only political note of his visit , during which his addresses have been almost entirely spiritual , when he fleetingly criticised the islamic concept of " jihad . " " violence is incompatible with the nature of god and the nature of the soul , " the pope had said in a complex treatise on reason and faith . his comments drew criticism on wednesday from a leading muslim figure in italy .
ejaz ahmad , a member of an italian governmental consultative committee on islam , called on him to retract them . " the muslim world is currently undergoing a deep crisis and any attack from the west can aggravate this crisis , " ahmad was quoted as saying by italy 's ansa news agency . " in his speech the pope overlooks the fact that islam was the cradle of science and that muslims were the first to translate greek philosophers before they became part of european history , " he said . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope enjoys private time near end of german trip pope benedict xvi knelt in prayer at the graves of his mother , father and sister on wednesday in the emotional highpoint of his six-day visit to his native bavaria .

during a video conference with other coaches , he dropped a hint that he may be back soon . once a soccer player gets a taste of coaching , it can be difficult for him to leave it behind .
when jürgen klinsmann resigned this summer as germany 's head coach after a better-than-expected third-place performance , speculation immediately started that he would take a seat on a bench somewhere else . two months after the end of the world cup , he has made his first public appearance during a video conference at the end of a meeting of world cup managers organized by fifa in berlin and alluded to his desires none too clearly . " who knows , perhaps i 'll be a coach once again at the 2010 world cup -lrb- in south africa -rrb- , " he said . klinsmann , calling in to the conference from his home in california , still enjoys " taking -lrb- his -rrb- kids to school , " something he has more than ample time to do , having retired four days after guiding germany into third at this year 's world cup finals . coach for usa ?
or possibly an african country ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coaching a striker like ivory coast 's didier drogba could be enticing klinsmann 's logical new employer would be the united states soccer federation , which separated paths from bruce arena who had coached the american men 's team for eight years .
it would also be sensible for him considering that the team has its training quarters in southern california . klinsmann has consistently denied the connection with the us team and theo zwanziger , the newly elected president of the german football federation , raised another possible scenario for the 42-year-old who has always had a penchant for travel . zwanziger suggested recently that klinsmann " might take charge of a team in africa . " coaching just any old team on the sometimes times chaotic african continent , however , would be a risky undertaking considering that only the hosts south africa have a guaranteed ticket to the finals in four years .
at the 2006 tournament , all four sub-saharan teams - ivory coast , angola , ghana and togo - made their debuts , knocking out regular african favorites like cameroon , nigeria and south africa during qualifications . for the time being , klinsmann can continue to take his kids to school , and savor the fact that , as he said at the conference , " germany practically rediscovered itself " at the world cup this summer . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de coach klinsmann calls it quits in germany days after leading germany to third place in the 2006 world cup with a young team he personally put together , coach jürgen klinsmann has decided to step down .
he will be replaced by his assistant , joachim löw .
-lrb- july 12 , 2006 -rrb- germany wants klinsmann to stay hounded for poor performances before the world cup , jürgen klinsmann could have resigned and relieved a nation .
now after reaching the semi-finals on home soil , no one wants to let him leave any earlier than 2008 .

europe 's largest economy has been resilient in spite of high oil prices , but the imf says hazards still lurk . germany 's stock market has been booming for more than three years .
the country 's companies have been enjoying better than average profits during that time .
now , it is starting to pay dividends and the international monetary fund , in its twice-yearly assessment of the global economy , has raised its 2006 economic growth forecasts for germany to 2 percent from its prediction of 1.3 percent in the spring . at its meeting in singapore , the imf 's chief economist raghuram rajan praised europe 's largest economy , saying " it was on a roll . " but berlin 's measures to lower spending , such as merging unemployment and welfare benefits were not having as much as an effect that had been expected , rajan said .
he suggested lowering income taxes to help spur private consumption , recommending more flexibility in the labor market and increased competition in the banking and utilities sectors . adding more kick to the economy , rajan said , alluding to reforms , would not necessarily mean lower incomes or the end of germany 's welfare state . europe should take advantage of growth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eurozone is expected to grow 2.4 percent the imf is not alone in its optimism regards germany .
the eu commission projects growth of 2.2 percent .
only berlin , possibly stung by overly rosy forecasts that went unmet in the recent past , sees more modest growth at 1.6 percent for the current year . a scheduled increase of germany 's value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- as of january will boost private spending until the end of this year .
after that , the imf expects growth to stagnate to 1.3 percent . the economy in the euro zone is experiencing growth not seen since the dot.com days , expected to hit 2.4 percent .
rajan views the stronger developments as an opportunity to pare down public deficits , in line with the eu 's stability and growth pact target to hold such shortfalls to 3.0 percent or less of total output .
as for germany , he echoed his calls for reforms to europe . " europe 's leaders need to find the will to take on vested interests in both labor and in the corporate sector , " said rajan .
" this necessary but difficult domestic battle is constantly postponed until after the next election , " he added . balancing inflation and interest rates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high oil prices will continue to threaten world economies rising oil prices have yet had a great effect on consumer prices but with a barrel of crude expected to hover around or above the $ 70 per barrel mark , inflation is a concern central banks around the world must face . the imf found that with euro zone inflation running " below but close to " the european central bank 's -lrb- ecb -rrb- 2.0 percent objective , " further interest rate increases will likely be needed to maintain price stability over the medium term if the expansion develops as expected . " the ecb since december has raised its benchmark rate four times , taking it from 2.0 to 3.0 percent , and has made clear it intends to carry on with monetary tightening .
but the imf cautioned : " with underlying inflationary pressures still well contained ... policymakers can afford to be cautious in tightening the monetary policy stance , all the more so given the risk of euro appreciation and weaker growth in the united states .

europe 's largest economy has been resilient in spite of high oil prices , but the imf says hazards still lurk . germany 's stock market has been booming for more than three years .
the country 's companies have been enjoying better than average profits during that time .
now , it is starting to pay dividends and the international monetary fund , in its twice-yearly assessment of the global economy , has raised its 2006 economic growth forecasts for germany to 2 percent from its prediction of 1.3 percent in the spring . at its meeting in singapore , the imf 's chief economist raghuram rajan praised europe 's largest economy , saying " it was on a roll . " but berlin 's measures to lower spending , such as merging unemployment and welfare benefits were not having as much as an effect that had been expected , rajan said .
he suggested lowering income taxes to help spur private consumption , recommending more flexibility in the labor market and increased competition in the banking and utilities sectors . adding more kick to the economy , rajan said , alluding to reforms , would not necessarily mean lower incomes or the end of germany 's welfare state . europe should take advantage of growth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eurozone is expected to grow 2.4 percent the imf is not alone in its optimism regards germany .
the eu commission projects growth of 2.2 percent .
only berlin , possibly stung by overly rosy forecasts that went unmet in the recent past , sees more modest growth at 1.6 percent for the current year . a scheduled increase of germany 's value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- as of january will boost private spending until the end of this year .
after that , the imf expects growth to stagnate to 1.3 percent . the economy in the euro zone is experiencing growth not seen since the dot.com days , expected to hit 2.4 percent .
rajan views the stronger developments as an opportunity to pare down public deficits , in line with the eu 's stability and growth pact target to hold such shortfalls to 3.0 percent or less of total output .
as for germany , he echoed his calls for reforms to europe . " europe 's leaders need to find the will to take on vested interests in both labor and in the corporate sector , " said rajan .
" this necessary but difficult domestic battle is constantly postponed until after the next election , " he added . balancing inflation and interest rates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high oil prices will continue to threaten world economies rising oil prices have yet had a great effect on consumer prices but with a barrel of crude expected to hover around or above the $ 70 per barrel mark , inflation is a concern central banks around the world must face . the imf found that with euro zone inflation running " below but close to " the european central bank 's -lrb- ecb -rrb- 2.0 percent objective , " further interest rate increases will likely be needed to maintain price stability over the medium term if the expansion develops as expected . " the ecb since december has raised its benchmark rate four times , taking it from 2.0 to 3.0 percent , and has made clear it intends to carry on with monetary tightening .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.09.2006 opinion : it 's time to formulate the lebanon mission clearly großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german cabinet has agreed to send 2,400 troops to patrol the waters along lebanon 's coast .
but going there is easier than coming back , according to deutsche welle 's nina werkhäuser . it was a decision with " historical dimensions " for germany .
those were the words chancellor angela merkel used to describe the cabinet 's consent to send naval units to the middle east .
indeed , it is a historical decision to send armed german soldiers to the mideast .
for the last 60 years , such a mission would have been unthinkable because it was thought , for understandable historical reasons , that there should be as great a distance as possible between german troops and israel . that such a german foreign policy taboo could be broken may be astonishing .
but de facto , berlin had no other choice .
if germany had withdrawn from the mission , it would have laid the credibility of its foreign policy on the line and would have made berlin 's attempts to stabilize the situation in the mideast in the past few weeks seem absurd . israel explicitly wished for the bundeswehr 's participation .
that was not only the most important condition , it was an obligation .
without israel 's endorsement , angela merkel 's cabinet never would have approved of the mission . nevertheless , there is still a clearly defined line on the ground that the german government has decided not to cross : there will be no ground troops in the middle east .
other countries in the unifil mission should and will take over this responsibility .
they will have the difficult task of working together with the lebanese army to keep hezbollah in check .
how that should be done is still not clear , however . losing focus of peacekeeping mission purposes berlin is steering clear of that dilemma and is concentrating on its naval mission , which is supposed to hinder the delivery of arms via the sea to hezbollah militants .
it is difficult to say at this moment how effective that will be . germany will lead a european naval flotilla that has been granted a robust mandate ; it can stop and search incoming ships by force , if necessary .
despite the potential danger , the risk remains calculable .
yet only with this mandate will the parliament approve this week 's cabinet decision , when it comes up for a vote next week . that support nevertheless is guaranteed .
the vote will then turn the bundeswehr into an army that knows no borders .
but germany is paying a high price for this move , particularly when the choice of peacekeeping missions has become a bit random in nature .
the interests in the middle east are understandable .
but is a peacekeeping operation in the democratic republic of congo really necessary ? the large new mission in the middle east with up to 2,400 soldiers could , like the operations in kosovo and afghanistan , last for years .
and there is no guarantee for success .
such questions should make the german government clearly formulate its security policies .
this mission provides the opportunity to develop a definite exit strategy .
there is still time to do this . nina werkhäuser is dw radio 's correspondent to the german parliament in berlin . -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cabinet gives green light to lebanon mission germany 's cabinet authorized the deployment of ships to the middle east as part of the un force in lebanon .
parliament now must approve the measure before launching its first mission in the mideast since ww ii .

but going there is easier than coming back , according to deutsche welle 's nina werkhäuser . it was a decision with " historical dimensions " for germany .
those were the words chancellor angela merkel used to describe the cabinet 's consent to send naval units to the middle east .
indeed , it is a historical decision to send armed german soldiers to the mideast .
for the last 60 years , such a mission would have been unthinkable because it was thought , for understandable historical reasons , that there should be as great a distance as possible between german troops and israel . that such a german foreign policy taboo could be broken may be astonishing .
but de facto , berlin had no other choice .
if germany had withdrawn from the mission , it would have laid the credibility of its foreign policy on the line and would have made berlin 's attempts to stabilize the situation in the mideast in the past few weeks seem absurd . israel explicitly wished for the bundeswehr 's participation .
that was not only the most important condition , it was an obligation .
without israel 's endorsement , angela merkel 's cabinet never would have approved of the mission . nevertheless , there is still a clearly defined line on the ground that the german government has decided not to cross : there will be no ground troops in the middle east .
other countries in the unifil mission should and will take over this responsibility .
they will have the difficult task of working together with the lebanese army to keep hezbollah in check .
how that should be done is still not clear , however . losing focus of peacekeeping mission purposes berlin is steering clear of that dilemma and is concentrating on its naval mission , which is supposed to hinder the delivery of arms via the sea to hezbollah militants .
it is difficult to say at this moment how effective that will be . germany will lead a european naval flotilla that has been granted a robust mandate ; it can stop and search incoming ships by force , if necessary .
despite the potential danger , the risk remains calculable .
yet only with this mandate will the parliament approve this week 's cabinet decision , when it comes up for a vote next week . that support nevertheless is guaranteed .
the vote will then turn the bundeswehr into an army that knows no borders .
but germany is paying a high price for this move , particularly when the choice of peacekeeping missions has become a bit random in nature .
the interests in the middle east are understandable .
but is a peacekeeping operation in the democratic republic of congo really necessary ? the large new mission in the middle east with up to 2,400 soldiers could , like the operations in kosovo and afghanistan , last for years .
and there is no guarantee for success .
such questions should make the german government clearly formulate its security policies .
this mission provides the opportunity to develop a definite exit strategy .

should online pharmacies be prohibited because they can undercut prices and drive out competition ?
the doc morris case has raised tough legal issues . a state administrative court in the state of saarland decided on wednesday that the dutch online pharmaceutical company doc morris has to shut down its first and only branch in germany until the european court of justice reaches a final verdict on the legality of the business . after opening in july , a doc morris branch in the city of saarbrücken met with immediate criticism from private pharmacists in the region .
they protested the legality of the online discounter on the grounds that they would n't be able to match its prices . critics also referenced a german law which stipulates that pharmacies may only be run by trained pharmacists , not by corporate entities . a final decision has yet to be made bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional pharmacies feel threatened by the discounter " the pharmacists want to do everything to push us out of the market , " said doc morris director ralf däinghaus . on aug .
9 the state court in saarbrücken rejected petitions for the closure of the german pharmaceutical branch , citing freedom of establishment under european law .
wednesday 's decision for its temporary closure was issued because three saarbrücken pharmacies have filed an appeal . the european court of justice will have to assess the apparent contradiction between germany 's pharmacy law and the european union 's freedom of establishment law . the state government in saarland is opposed to the administrative court 's decision and has said it considers it legal for doc morris to conduct business in germany . saarland 's minister of health josef hecken said the state government will appeal wednesday 's decision to the state 's higher administrative court . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court allows controversial discount pharmacy in germany a german court on wednesday ruled that a dutch internet pharmacy can operate a branch in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.09.2006 opinion : it 's time to formulate the lebanon mission clearly großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german cabinet has agreed to send 2,400 troops to patrol the waters along lebanon 's coast .
but going there is easier than coming back , according to deutsche welle 's nina werkhäuser . it was a decision with " historical dimensions " for germany .
those were the words chancellor angela merkel used to describe the cabinet 's consent to send naval units to the middle east .
indeed , it is a historical decision to send armed german soldiers to the mideast .
for the last 60 years , such a mission would have been unthinkable because it was thought , for understandable historical reasons , that there should be as great a distance as possible between german troops and israel . that such a german foreign policy taboo could be broken may be astonishing .
but de facto , berlin had no other choice .
if germany had withdrawn from the mission , it would have laid the credibility of its foreign policy on the line and would have made berlin 's attempts to stabilize the situation in the mideast in the past few weeks seem absurd . israel explicitly wished for the bundeswehr 's participation .
that was not only the most important condition , it was an obligation .
without israel 's endorsement , angela merkel 's cabinet never would have approved of the mission . nevertheless , there is still a clearly defined line on the ground that the german government has decided not to cross : there will be no ground troops in the middle east .
other countries in the unifil mission should and will take over this responsibility .
they will have the difficult task of working together with the lebanese army to keep hezbollah in check .
how that should be done is still not clear , however . losing focus of peacekeeping mission purposes berlin is steering clear of that dilemma and is concentrating on its naval mission , which is supposed to hinder the delivery of arms via the sea to hezbollah militants .
it is difficult to say at this moment how effective that will be . germany will lead a european naval flotilla that has been granted a robust mandate ; it can stop and search incoming ships by force , if necessary .
despite the potential danger , the risk remains calculable .
yet only with this mandate will the parliament approve this week 's cabinet decision , when it comes up for a vote next week . that support nevertheless is guaranteed .
the vote will then turn the bundeswehr into an army that knows no borders .
but germany is paying a high price for this move , particularly when the choice of peacekeeping missions has become a bit random in nature .
the interests in the middle east are understandable .
but is a peacekeeping operation in the democratic republic of congo really necessary ? the large new mission in the middle east with up to 2,400 soldiers could , like the operations in kosovo and afghanistan , last for years .
and there is no guarantee for success .
such questions should make the german government clearly formulate its security policies .
this mission provides the opportunity to develop a definite exit strategy .
there is still time to do this . nina werkhäuser is dw radio 's correspondent to the german parliament in berlin . -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cabinet gives green light to lebanon mission germany 's cabinet authorized the deployment of ships to the middle east as part of the un force in lebanon .

of these , four came from rice produced in the us .
the origin of the other three positive samples is unknown . biotech rice is not allowed to be grown , sold or marketed in the eu . earlier eu reports of contaminated rice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace made initial claims in the aldi gm rice case the findings in baden-wurttemberg come just on the heels of reports concerning the discovery of ll601 in rice packages sold at the aldi nord supermarket chain in the northern regions of germany . the european federation of rice millers had tested 162 shipments of rice imported from the united states .
33 of them tested positive for genetically modified rice , the european commission said in a statement on monday . " any consignments which tested positive have already been recalled or withheld from the market and the federation 's members have committed to continuing such withdrawals for any positive findings , " the commission said monday . greenpeace genetics expert ulrike brendel said that the aldi products , sold under the bon-ri brand , had been contaminated with a strain of rice developed by german industrial giant bayer and tested in the united states . " we tested the samples at a respected and independent laboratory , " brendel said .
" the results show some of the rice has been modified using a method developed and published by bayer - there 's no doubt about it . " a tainted biotech product rice found in eight of aldi nord 's 35 sales areas contained traces of ll601 - a rice strain engineered by bayer to resist certain bayer herbicides . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both aldi and edeka have removed the rice products in question from shelves aldi nord said documentation for the rice imports showed no signs of shipments containing genetically modified rice , but it removed the affected products from its shelves and was testing the countries of origins of other similar products . the european commission 's findings suggested gm material had been finding its way into the european market for some time .
considering that germany imports about one quarter of its rice from the us , brendel thought it was inevitable that a number of products and supermarket chains would be affected . " this modified strain of rice was planted in the us in 2001 , but only as a test crop , " brendel said .
" the fact we 're finding it here in imports shows that industry is n't capable of controlling genetically modified crops .
we do n't know what human health or environmental risks involved .
if we want to keep food sources free of genetically modified material , then we ca n't afford to plant gm crops . " declaring war on biotech rice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany imported 46,500 tons of rice from the us in 2005 alone last month the european commission slapped stringent testing requirements on rice imports from the us to try and stop genetically modified varieties from entering the 25 country-bloc . at the end of august , germany 's federal ministry of consumer protection ordered state-level authorities to step up their detection efforts . france and sweden have also discovered traces of a banned genetically modified substance in imported us rice , in tests which must be confirmed by eu laboratories , a european commission source said tuesday . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu caution puts brakes on gm food legislation eu leaders thursday stressed the need for more information and experience before further legislation can be passed on genetically-modified organisms , at the end of a two-day conference on gmos in vienna .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 14.09.2006 german authorities confirm gm rice findings großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gentically modified rice is banned in the euopean union the discovery of genetically manipulated rice in supermarkets in southwestern germany has for the first time been officially confirmed by agricultural authorities , after eu reports of gm rice elsewhere in the country . traces of ll601 , a type of genetically manipulated rice from the us , were found in a product called " fit for fun trix reis-mix triathlon " sold at the edeka supermarket chain in the southwestern german state of baden-wurttemberg . the ministry of agriculture in stuttgart examined 46 rice samples , of which seven tested positive for genetically manipulated material , reported germany 's southwestern radio online .
of these , four came from rice produced in the us .
the origin of the other three positive samples is unknown . biotech rice is not allowed to be grown , sold or marketed in the eu . earlier eu reports of contaminated rice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace made initial claims in the aldi gm rice case the findings in baden-wurttemberg come just on the heels of reports concerning the discovery of ll601 in rice packages sold at the aldi nord supermarket chain in the northern regions of germany . the european federation of rice millers had tested 162 shipments of rice imported from the united states .
33 of them tested positive for genetically modified rice , the european commission said in a statement on monday . " any consignments which tested positive have already been recalled or withheld from the market and the federation 's members have committed to continuing such withdrawals for any positive findings , " the commission said monday . greenpeace genetics expert ulrike brendel said that the aldi products , sold under the bon-ri brand , had been contaminated with a strain of rice developed by german industrial giant bayer and tested in the united states . " we tested the samples at a respected and independent laboratory , " brendel said .
" the results show some of the rice has been modified using a method developed and published by bayer - there 's no doubt about it . " a tainted biotech product rice found in eight of aldi nord 's 35 sales areas contained traces of ll601 - a rice strain engineered by bayer to resist certain bayer herbicides . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both aldi and edeka have removed the rice products in question from shelves aldi nord said documentation for the rice imports showed no signs of shipments containing genetically modified rice , but it removed the affected products from its shelves and was testing the countries of origins of other similar products . the european commission 's findings suggested gm material had been finding its way into the european market for some time .
considering that germany imports about one quarter of its rice from the us , brendel thought it was inevitable that a number of products and supermarket chains would be affected . " this modified strain of rice was planted in the us in 2001 , but only as a test crop , " brendel said .
" the fact we 're finding it here in imports shows that industry is n't capable of controlling genetically modified crops .
we do n't know what human health or environmental risks involved .
if we want to keep food sources free of genetically modified material , then we ca n't afford to plant gm crops . " declaring war on biotech rice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany imported 46,500 tons of rice from the us in 2005 alone last month the european commission slapped stringent testing requirements on rice imports from the us to try and stop genetically modified varieties from entering the 25 country-bloc . at the end of august , germany 's federal ministry of consumer protection ordered state-level authorities to step up their detection efforts . france and sweden have also discovered traces of a banned genetically modified substance in imported us rice , in tests which must be confirmed by eu laboratories , a european commission source said tuesday . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu caution puts brakes on gm food legislation eu leaders thursday stressed the need for more information and experience before further legislation can be passed on genetically-modified organisms , at the end of a two-day conference on gmos in vienna .

the doc morris case has raised tough legal issues . a state administrative court in the state of saarland decided on wednesday that the dutch online pharmaceutical company doc morris has to shut down its first and only branch in germany until the european court of justice reaches a final verdict on the legality of the business . after opening in july , a doc morris branch in the city of saarbrücken met with immediate criticism from private pharmacists in the region .

should online pharmacies be prohibited because they can undercut prices and drive out competition ?
the doc morris case has raised tough legal issues . a state administrative court in the state of saarland decided on wednesday that the dutch online pharmaceutical company doc morris has to shut down its first and only branch in germany until the european court of justice reaches a final verdict on the legality of the business . after opening in july , a doc morris branch in the city of saarbrücken met with immediate criticism from private pharmacists in the region .
they protested the legality of the online discounter on the grounds that they would n't be able to match its prices . critics also referenced a german law which stipulates that pharmacies may only be run by trained pharmacists , not by corporate entities . a final decision has yet to be made bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional pharmacies feel threatened by the discounter " the pharmacists want to do everything to push us out of the market , " said doc morris director ralf däinghaus . on aug .
9 the state court in saarbrücken rejected petitions for the closure of the german pharmaceutical branch , citing freedom of establishment under european law .
wednesday 's decision for its temporary closure was issued because three saarbrücken pharmacies have filed an appeal . the european court of justice will have to assess the apparent contradiction between germany 's pharmacy law and the european union 's freedom of establishment law . the state government in saarland is opposed to the administrative court 's decision and has said it considers it legal for doc morris to conduct business in germany . saarland 's minister of health josef hecken said the state government will appeal wednesday 's decision to the state 's higher administrative court . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court allows controversial discount pharmacy in germany a german court on wednesday ruled that a dutch internet pharmacy can operate a branch in germany .

of these , four came from rice produced in the us .
the origin of the other three positive samples is unknown . biotech rice is not allowed to be grown , sold or marketed in the eu . earlier eu reports of contaminated rice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace made initial claims in the aldi gm rice case the findings in baden-wurttemberg come just on the heels of reports concerning the discovery of ll601 in rice packages sold at the aldi nord supermarket chain in the northern regions of germany . the european federation of rice millers had tested 162 shipments of rice imported from the united states .
33 of them tested positive for genetically modified rice , the european commission said in a statement on monday . " any consignments which tested positive have already been recalled or withheld from the market and the federation 's members have committed to continuing such withdrawals for any positive findings , " the commission said monday . greenpeace genetics expert ulrike brendel said that the aldi products , sold under the bon-ri brand , had been contaminated with a strain of rice developed by german industrial giant bayer and tested in the united states . " we tested the samples at a respected and independent laboratory , " brendel said .
" the results show some of the rice has been modified using a method developed and published by bayer - there 's no doubt about it . " a tainted biotech product rice found in eight of aldi nord 's 35 sales areas contained traces of ll601 - a rice strain engineered by bayer to resist certain bayer herbicides . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both aldi and edeka have removed the rice products in question from shelves aldi nord said documentation for the rice imports showed no signs of shipments containing genetically modified rice , but it removed the affected products from its shelves and was testing the countries of origins of other similar products . the european commission 's findings suggested gm material had been finding its way into the european market for some time .
considering that germany imports about one quarter of its rice from the us , brendel thought it was inevitable that a number of products and supermarket chains would be affected . " this modified strain of rice was planted in the us in 2001 , but only as a test crop , " brendel said .
" the fact we 're finding it here in imports shows that industry is n't capable of controlling genetically modified crops .
we do n't know what human health or environmental risks involved .
if we want to keep food sources free of genetically modified material , then we ca n't afford to plant gm crops . " declaring war on biotech rice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany imported 46,500 tons of rice from the us in 2005 alone last month the european commission slapped stringent testing requirements on rice imports from the us to try and stop genetically modified varieties from entering the 25 country-bloc . at the end of august , germany 's federal ministry of consumer protection ordered state-level authorities to step up their detection efforts . france and sweden have also discovered traces of a banned genetically modified substance in imported us rice , in tests which must be confirmed by eu laboratories , a european commission source said tuesday . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu caution puts brakes on gm food legislation eu leaders thursday stressed the need for more information and experience before further legislation can be passed on genetically-modified organisms , at the end of a two-day conference on gmos in vienna .

during a video conference with other coaches , he dropped a hint that he may be back soon . once a soccer player gets a taste of coaching , it can be difficult for him to leave it behind .
when jürgen klinsmann resigned this summer as germany 's head coach after a better-than-expected third-place performance , speculation immediately started that he would take a seat on a bench somewhere else . two months after the end of the world cup , he has made his first public appearance during a video conference at the end of a meeting of world cup managers organized by fifa in berlin and alluded to his desires none too clearly . " who knows , perhaps i 'll be a coach once again at the 2010 world cup -lrb- in south africa -rrb- , " he said . klinsmann , calling in to the conference from his home in california , still enjoys " taking -lrb- his -rrb- kids to school , " something he has more than ample time to do , having retired four days after guiding germany into third at this year 's world cup finals . coach for usa ?
or possibly an african country ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coaching a striker like ivory coast 's didier drogba could be enticing klinsmann 's logical new employer would be the united states soccer federation , which separated paths from bruce arena who had coached the american men 's team for eight years .
it would also be sensible for him considering that the team has its training quarters in southern california . klinsmann has consistently denied the connection with the us team and theo zwanziger , the newly elected president of the german football federation , raised another possible scenario for the 42-year-old who has always had a penchant for travel . zwanziger suggested recently that klinsmann " might take charge of a team in africa . " coaching just any old team on the sometimes times chaotic african continent , however , would be a risky undertaking considering that only the hosts south africa have a guaranteed ticket to the finals in four years .
at the 2006 tournament , all four sub-saharan teams - ivory coast , angola , ghana and togo - made their debuts , knocking out regular african favorites like cameroon , nigeria and south africa during qualifications . for the time being , klinsmann can continue to take his kids to school , and savor the fact that , as he said at the conference , " germany practically rediscovered itself " at the world cup this summer . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de coach klinsmann calls it quits in germany days after leading germany to third place in the 2006 world cup with a young team he personally put together , coach jürgen klinsmann has decided to step down .
he will be replaced by his assistant , joachim löw .
-lrb- july 12 , 2006 -rrb- germany wants klinsmann to stay hounded for poor performances before the world cup , jürgen klinsmann could have resigned and relieved a nation .
now after reaching the semi-finals on home soil , no one wants to let him leave any earlier than 2008 .

merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder , had together with france led calls in 2004 to lift the embargo but this was strongly opposed by both the us and japan , which say a resumption of european weapons sales to beijing will worsen tensions between china and taiwan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the violent crackdown on protests at tiananmen square led to the embargo merkel has said she will not go down schröder 's path .
with germany holding the eu presidency during the first half of 2007 , she said " the arms embargo theme is currently not on the agenda .

while braunau will honor two nazi victims on thursday , the austrian town still lacks a place that deals with its most infamous son .
sixty years after the end of world war ii , some say it 's still too early . braunau is almost a town like many others on the austrian-bavarian border .
a church spire towers over the city and youngsters meet up at a fountain in the town square , which is lined with shops and cafés that are famous for their strudels .
bookstores have decorated their windows with the works of pope benedict xvi . , who was born just around the corner , in marktl .
the village lies almost exactly between germany 's most important place of pilgrimage , altötting , and braunau , where adolf hitler was born - between heaven and hell , as some said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : braunau sits across the river inn from the bavarian town of simbach it 's definitely not a label that pleases most of the 17,300 braunauers , who have struggled with this burden of coincidence since 1945 .
they have lived with the stigma of coming from the same place as the man responsible for the murder of millions .
they know that it 's sometimes easier to tell people that they come from " near salzburg . "
while marktl likes to forget that the pope only lived there for two years and has no personal memories of his time there , braunauers take pains to point out that hitler left at around the same age .
a stone as tourist attraction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : braunau 's picturesque town square " believe me , i 'd much rather have the pope in braunau , " said klaus prexl , head of the local tourism office , who looks like one of the many tanned visitors who stop by on their bicycle tours through the region .
but prexl does n't have the catholic leader on offer and instead struggles to deal with continuing interest in hitler .
" every second or third guest asks about the house , " he said after one woman visiting from poland came in to find out how she could get to the building where the dictator was born .
like all the others , prexl sends her down the street , through the city tower , then it 'll come up on your left-hand side , watch out for the stone of admonition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stone 's still the only marker that hitler was born here " for peace , freedom and democracy , " reads the inscription on the stone , which comes from the nearby nazi concentration camp in mauthausen .
" never again fascism .
the millions of dead are a reminder . "
it 's the only reference to the fact that hitler was born here and , according to prexl , it 's not enough .
" i think it 's time for a documentation center , " said the 57-year-old .
" it exists in all the places where he committed crimes and we conceal it .
it 's been talked about forever , but there are local political influences that do n't want it . "
taking on responsibility far from it , countered gerhard skiba , braunau 's mayor since 1989 .
shortly after taking office , the self-declared socialist and member of austria 's social democratic party decided to place the stone in front of the house just in time for the 100th anniversary of hitler 's birthday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : braunau 's mayor gerhard skiba in his office " there were pretty serious protests , " skiba said , adding that he even received some death threats .
" people said : ' we do n't need that , the stone could be a target for attacks . " '
he also cleansed the town of hitler souvenirs such as beer mugs , ashtrays and wine bottles with the nazi leader 's image that were still sold at the time .
he hired streetworkers to deal with signs of right-wing extremism among teenagers and enthusiastically backed the placement of so-called stumbling stones that remember people killed by the nazis in front of the houses where they once lived .
two more of these will be placed on thursday .
skiba said he also wants to install a sign that identifies hitler 's birth house in front of the building in the very near future .
while the austrian government rents the landmarked structure , the owner has so far refused to agree to a plaque that 's directly attached to its walls .
ideal use of building the owners 's unwillingness to sell the house has also been one of the main reasons why a so-called house of responsibility has not been set up inside it , skiba said .
another reason is that the building is currently not open to the public as it is used by an organization called lebenshilfe , which offers people with mental and other disabilities a place to work .
" that 's an ideal use for the building , " skiba said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franciscan nuns recently named a park in braunau in jägerstetter 's honor while he said that he regrets that he failed to name a fountain , bridge or street after franz jägerstetter , who was murdered by the nazis for refusing to join the army , he will wholeheartedly back plans to transform hitler 's birthplace into a documentation center once it is no longer needed by its current tenants .
" among the things that i still want to do as mayor , this has top priority , " the 59-year-old said .
some , such as braunau 's catholic pastor , think that it might still take some time .
" i think it 's too fresh , " said 65-year-old stefan hofer , who has preached at st. stephan 's church , where hitler was baptized , for the past 34 years .
he added that braunau was currently taking responsibility via its days of contemporary history , which began in 1992 with a symposium called " undesired heritage " that looked at how cities such as braunau , auschwitz , vichy or stalin 's birthplace gori deal with their heritage .
waiting for the green light but the scientific adviser of that event said that mayor skiba just needs to give the political green light for the house of responsibility .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gifts made by mentally disabled people are currently sold inside the house " if he says yes , i 'll raise the money , " said andreas maislinger , a historian and political scientist , adding that the house should look at the past , present and future by giving visitors information about hitler and his crimes , offering space for organizations such as lebenshilfe and serving as a place that promotes intercultural understanding by inviting young chinese and japanese , indians and pakistanis , israelis and palestinians and others to get to know each other during a stay in braunau .
" we 're already doing that throughout the world , " said maislinger , who also founded an organization that offers young austrians an opportunity to complete their compulsory community service abroad .
" it 's all ready to go , " he said .
" i 'll start immediately when i get the go-ahead .

while braunau will honor two nazi victims on thursday , the austrian town still lacks a place that deals with its most infamous son .
sixty years after the end of world war ii , some say it 's still too early . braunau is almost a town like many others on the austrian-bavarian border .
a church spire towers over the city and youngsters meet up at a fountain in the town square , which is lined with shops and cafés that are famous for their strudels .
bookstores have decorated their windows with the works of pope benedict xvi . , who was born just around the corner , in marktl .
the village lies almost exactly between germany 's most important place of pilgrimage , altötting , and braunau , where adolf hitler was born - between heaven and hell , as some said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : braunau sits across the river inn from the bavarian town of simbach it 's definitely not a label that pleases most of the 17,300 braunauers , who have struggled with this burden of coincidence since 1945 .
they have lived with the stigma of coming from the same place as the man responsible for the murder of millions .
they know that it 's sometimes easier to tell people that they come from " near salzburg . "
while marktl likes to forget that the pope only lived there for two years and has no personal memories of his time there , braunauers take pains to point out that hitler left at around the same age .
a stone as tourist attraction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : braunau 's picturesque town square " believe me , i 'd much rather have the pope in braunau , " said klaus prexl , head of the local tourism office , who looks like one of the many tanned visitors who stop by on their bicycle tours through the region .
but prexl does n't have the catholic leader on offer and instead struggles to deal with continuing interest in hitler .
" every second or third guest asks about the house , " he said after one woman visiting from poland came in to find out how she could get to the building where the dictator was born .
like all the others , prexl sends her down the street , through the city tower , then it 'll come up on your left-hand side , watch out for the stone of admonition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stone 's still the only marker that hitler was born here " for peace , freedom and democracy , " reads the inscription on the stone , which comes from the nearby nazi concentration camp in mauthausen .
" never again fascism .
the millions of dead are a reminder . "
it 's the only reference to the fact that hitler was born here and , according to prexl , it 's not enough .
" i think it 's time for a documentation center , " said the 57-year-old .
" it exists in all the places where he committed crimes and we conceal it .
it 's been talked about forever , but there are local political influences that do n't want it . "
taking on responsibility far from it , countered gerhard skiba , braunau 's mayor since 1989 .
shortly after taking office , the self-declared socialist and member of austria 's social democratic party decided to place the stone in front of the house just in time for the 100th anniversary of hitler 's birthday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : braunau 's mayor gerhard skiba in his office " there were pretty serious protests , " skiba said , adding that he even received some death threats .
" people said : ' we do n't need that , the stone could be a target for attacks . " '
he also cleansed the town of hitler souvenirs such as beer mugs , ashtrays and wine bottles with the nazi leader 's image that were still sold at the time .
he hired streetworkers to deal with signs of right-wing extremism among teenagers and enthusiastically backed the placement of so-called stumbling stones that remember people killed by the nazis in front of the houses where they once lived .
two more of these will be placed on thursday .
skiba said he also wants to install a sign that identifies hitler 's birth house in front of the building in the very near future .
while the austrian government rents the landmarked structure , the owner has so far refused to agree to a plaque that 's directly attached to its walls .
ideal use of building the owners 's unwillingness to sell the house has also been one of the main reasons why a so-called house of responsibility has not been set up inside it , skiba said .
another reason is that the building is currently not open to the public as it is used by an organization called lebenshilfe , which offers people with mental and other disabilities a place to work .
" that 's an ideal use for the building , " skiba said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franciscan nuns recently named a park in braunau in jägerstetter 's honor while he said that he regrets that he failed to name a fountain , bridge or street after franz jägerstetter , who was murdered by the nazis for refusing to join the army , he will wholeheartedly back plans to transform hitler 's birthplace into a documentation center once it is no longer needed by its current tenants .
" among the things that i still want to do as mayor , this has top priority , " the 59-year-old said .
some , such as braunau 's catholic pastor , think that it might still take some time .
" i think it 's too fresh , " said 65-year-old stefan hofer , who has preached at st. stephan 's church , where hitler was baptized , for the past 34 years .
he added that braunau was currently taking responsibility via its days of contemporary history , which began in 1992 with a symposium called " undesired heritage " that looked at how cities such as braunau , auschwitz , vichy or stalin 's birthplace gori deal with their heritage .
waiting for the green light but the scientific adviser of that event said that mayor skiba just needs to give the political green light for the house of responsibility .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gifts made by mentally disabled people are currently sold inside the house " if he says yes , i 'll raise the money , " said andreas maislinger , a historian and political scientist , adding that the house should look at the past , present and future by giving visitors information about hitler and his crimes , offering space for organizations such as lebenshilfe and serving as a place that promotes intercultural understanding by inviting young chinese and japanese , indians and pakistanis , israelis and palestinians and others to get to know each other during a stay in braunau .
" we 're already doing that throughout the world , " said maislinger , who also founded an organization that offers young austrians an opportunity to complete their compulsory community service abroad .

while braunau will honor two nazi victims on thursday , the austrian town still lacks a place that deals with its most infamous son .
sixty years after the end of world war ii , some say it 's still too early . braunau is almost a town like many others on the austrian-bavarian border .
a church spire towers over the city and youngsters meet up at a fountain in the town square , which is lined with shops and cafés that are famous for their strudels .
bookstores have decorated their windows with the works of pope benedict xvi . , who was born just around the corner , in marktl .
the village lies almost exactly between germany 's most important place of pilgrimage , altötting , and braunau , where adolf hitler was born - between heaven and hell , as some said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : braunau sits across the river inn from the bavarian town of simbach it 's definitely not a label that pleases most of the 17,300 braunauers , who have struggled with this burden of coincidence since 1945 .
they have lived with the stigma of coming from the same place as the man responsible for the murder of millions .
they know that it 's sometimes easier to tell people that they come from " near salzburg . "
while marktl likes to forget that the pope only lived there for two years and has no personal memories of his time there , braunauers take pains to point out that hitler left at around the same age .
a stone as tourist attraction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : braunau 's picturesque town square " believe me , i 'd much rather have the pope in braunau , " said klaus prexl , head of the local tourism office , who looks like one of the many tanned visitors who stop by on their bicycle tours through the region .
but prexl does n't have the catholic leader on offer and instead struggles to deal with continuing interest in hitler .
" every second or third guest asks about the house , " he said after one woman visiting from poland came in to find out how she could get to the building where the dictator was born .
like all the others , prexl sends her down the street , through the city tower , then it 'll come up on your left-hand side , watch out for the stone of admonition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stone 's still the only marker that hitler was born here " for peace , freedom and democracy , " reads the inscription on the stone , which comes from the nearby nazi concentration camp in mauthausen .
" never again fascism .
the millions of dead are a reminder . "
it 's the only reference to the fact that hitler was born here and , according to prexl , it 's not enough .
" i think it 's time for a documentation center , " said the 57-year-old .
" it exists in all the places where he committed crimes and we conceal it .
it 's been talked about forever , but there are local political influences that do n't want it . "
taking on responsibility far from it , countered gerhard skiba , braunau 's mayor since 1989 .
shortly after taking office , the self-declared socialist and member of austria 's social democratic party decided to place the stone in front of the house just in time for the 100th anniversary of hitler 's birthday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : braunau 's mayor gerhard skiba in his office " there were pretty serious protests , " skiba said , adding that he even received some death threats .
" people said : ' we do n't need that , the stone could be a target for attacks . " '
he also cleansed the town of hitler souvenirs such as beer mugs , ashtrays and wine bottles with the nazi leader 's image that were still sold at the time .
he hired streetworkers to deal with signs of right-wing extremism among teenagers and enthusiastically backed the placement of so-called stumbling stones that remember people killed by the nazis in front of the houses where they once lived .
two more of these will be placed on thursday .
skiba said he also wants to install a sign that identifies hitler 's birth house in front of the building in the very near future .
while the austrian government rents the landmarked structure , the owner has so far refused to agree to a plaque that 's directly attached to its walls .
ideal use of building the owners 's unwillingness to sell the house has also been one of the main reasons why a so-called house of responsibility has not been set up inside it , skiba said .
another reason is that the building is currently not open to the public as it is used by an organization called lebenshilfe , which offers people with mental and other disabilities a place to work .
" that 's an ideal use for the building , " skiba said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franciscan nuns recently named a park in braunau in jägerstetter 's honor while he said that he regrets that he failed to name a fountain , bridge or street after franz jägerstetter , who was murdered by the nazis for refusing to join the army , he will wholeheartedly back plans to transform hitler 's birthplace into a documentation center once it is no longer needed by its current tenants .
" among the things that i still want to do as mayor , this has top priority , " the 59-year-old said .
some , such as braunau 's catholic pastor , think that it might still take some time .
" i think it 's too fresh , " said 65-year-old stefan hofer , who has preached at st. stephan 's church , where hitler was baptized , for the past 34 years .
he added that braunau was currently taking responsibility via its days of contemporary history , which began in 1992 with a symposium called " undesired heritage " that looked at how cities such as braunau , auschwitz , vichy or stalin 's birthplace gori deal with their heritage .
waiting for the green light but the scientific adviser of that event said that mayor skiba just needs to give the political green light for the house of responsibility .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gifts made by mentally disabled people are currently sold inside the house " if he says yes , i 'll raise the money , " said andreas maislinger , a historian and political scientist , adding that the house should look at the past , present and future by giving visitors information about hitler and his crimes , offering space for organizations such as lebenshilfe and serving as a place that promotes intercultural understanding by inviting young chinese and japanese , indians and pakistanis , israelis and palestinians and others to get to know each other during a stay in braunau .
" we 're already doing that throughout the world , " said maislinger , who also founded an organization that offers young austrians an opportunity to complete their compulsory community service abroad .
" it 's all ready to go , " he said .

the first rabbis to be ordained in germany since the nazi era will take their vows at a synagogue in dresden thursday . the three men involved have just completed a five-year course of study at the abraham geiger college , which was founded in berlin in 1999 amid reservations from many jews . " we are the only university-level training institute on continental europe , " the university 's rector , walter homolka , told dpa news service .
" there is an enormous demand for rabbis in europe and the rest of the world . " the last jewish seminary in germany was shut in 1942 and no rabbis have been ordained in the country since . bildunterschrift : since 1991 , the synagogue on oranienburger street in berlin has been a center of renewed jewish life after their ordination in dresden on thursday , the three rabbis will take up different posts .
czech-born tom kucera will be based in munich , daniel alter in oldenburg and south african malcolm matitani in cape town . showing reservation abraham geiger , the college 's namesake , was one of the most important thinkers in liberal judaism and was himself a rabbi in berlin from 1870 to 1875 . initially jewish organizations abroad expressed reservations about rabbis being trained in germany , according to homolka . " one colleague said he could not understand why we wanted to establish such an institution on the ashes of 6 million victims of the shoa -lrb- holocaust -rrb- , " the rector said . kucera , who comes from the czech republic and who was originally a biochemistry student , admits he had mixed feelings the first time he stood in front of berlin 's landmark brandenburg gate . " flashes from the past shot through my mind , " he says .
" of course the past has to be remembered , but today it 's more about the future . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rabbis have similar duties to priests - but not exactly the same .
for instance , no incense kucera , 35 , says he has experienced the growth of jewish communities in his native country , but without the presence of rabbis . " that was a major factor of motivation for me , " he said , adding that he also enjoys imparting knowledge to people . the college , which is attached to the university of potsdam , a 30-minute journey from the german capital , means that students no longer have to travel abroad to become a rabbi , homolka said .
many of those who went to london or the us for training never returned . practical training there are currently 12 students at the berlin college , where they learn the practical work of a rabbi 's duties . like a pastor or priest in the christian church , a rabbi leads one or more congregations , presiding over key lifetime ceremonies like weddings and funerals for its members .
he - or she , in some liberal congregations - leads worship services , offers counselling , and can even help to settle legal disputes among members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler says ordination is an ' important step ' the three rabbis completed their academic training at potsdam university , where there is a chair of rabbinical studies and liturgy . graduates can obtain a master 's degree in jewish studies - a course which takes in commentaries on jewish law , religious philosophy , religious history , sociology , liturgy , synagogue music and counselling .
there are also lessons in hebrew , aramaic and , on request , yiddish . students spend a year of the course studying at an israeli university , and also do practical work in jewish communities . köhler praises graduates germany today has a jewish population of 100,000 , compared to 600,000 before the start of world war ii .
there are some 100 jewish communities in the country today , served by around 25 rabbis . meanwhile , german president horst köhler called the first ordination of rabbis in germany in 64 years a special occasion . " after the holocaust , many people could not imagine that jewish life would one day blossom in germany again , " köhler said in a public statement . he called the ordinations " an important step " to a gradual normalization and less self-consciousness .

of these , four came from rice produced in the us .
the origin of the other three positive samples is unknown . biotech rice is not allowed to be grown , sold or marketed in the eu . earlier eu reports of contaminated rice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace made initial claims in the aldi gm rice case the findings in baden-wurttemberg come just on the heels of reports concerning the discovery of ll601 in rice packages sold at the aldi nord supermarket chain in the northern regions of germany . the european federation of rice millers had tested 162 shipments of rice imported from the united states .
33 of them tested positive for genetically modified rice , the european commission said in a statement on monday . " any consignments which tested positive have already been recalled or withheld from the market and the federation 's members have committed to continuing such withdrawals for any positive findings , " the commission said monday . greenpeace genetics expert ulrike brendel said that the aldi products , sold under the bon-ri brand , had been contaminated with a strain of rice developed by german industrial giant bayer and tested in the united states . " we tested the samples at a respected and independent laboratory , " brendel said .
" the results show some of the rice has been modified using a method developed and published by bayer - there 's no doubt about it . " a tainted biotech product rice found in eight of aldi nord 's 35 sales areas contained traces of ll601 - a rice strain engineered by bayer to resist certain bayer herbicides . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both aldi and edeka have removed the rice products in question from shelves aldi nord said documentation for the rice imports showed no signs of shipments containing genetically modified rice , but it removed the affected products from its shelves and was testing the countries of origins of other similar products . the european commission 's findings suggested gm material had been finding its way into the european market for some time .
considering that germany imports about one quarter of its rice from the us , brendel thought it was inevitable that a number of products and supermarket chains would be affected . " this modified strain of rice was planted in the us in 2001 , but only as a test crop , " brendel said .
" the fact we 're finding it here in imports shows that industry is n't capable of controlling genetically modified crops .
we do n't know what human health or environmental risks involved .
if we want to keep food sources free of genetically modified material , then we ca n't afford to plant gm crops . " declaring war on biotech rice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany imported 46,500 tons of rice from the us in 2005 alone last month the european commission slapped stringent testing requirements on rice imports from the us to try and stop genetically modified varieties from entering the 25 country-bloc . at the end of august , germany 's federal ministry of consumer protection ordered state-level authorities to step up their detection efforts . france and sweden have also discovered traces of a banned genetically modified substance in imported us rice , in tests which must be confirmed by eu laboratories , a european commission source said tuesday . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu caution puts brakes on gm food legislation eu leaders thursday stressed the need for more information and experience before further legislation can be passed on genetically-modified organisms , at the end of a two-day conference on gmos in vienna .

should online pharmacies be prohibited because they can undercut prices and drive out competition ?
the doc morris case has raised tough legal issues . a state administrative court in the state of saarland decided on wednesday that the dutch online pharmaceutical company doc morris has to shut down its first and only branch in germany until the european court of justice reaches a final verdict on the legality of the business . after opening in july , a doc morris branch in the city of saarbrücken met with immediate criticism from private pharmacists in the region .

wednesday 's decision for its temporary closure was issued because three saarbrücken pharmacies have filed an appeal . the european court of justice will have to assess the apparent contradiction between germany 's pharmacy law and the european union 's freedom of establishment law . the state government in saarland is opposed to the administrative court 's decision and has said it considers it legal for doc morris to conduct business in germany . saarland 's minister of health josef hecken said the state government will appeal wednesday 's decision to the state 's higher administrative court . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court allows controversial discount pharmacy in germany a german court on wednesday ruled that a dutch internet pharmacy can operate a branch in germany .

while braunau will honor two nazi victims on thursday , the austrian town still lacks a place that deals with its most infamous son .
sixty years after the end of world war ii , some say it 's still too early . braunau is almost a town like many others on the austrian-bavarian border .
a church spire towers over the city and youngsters meet up at a fountain in the town square , which is lined with shops and cafés that are famous for their strudels .
bookstores have decorated their windows with the works of pope benedict xvi . , who was born just around the corner , in marktl .
the village lies almost exactly between germany 's most important place of pilgrimage , altötting , and braunau , where adolf hitler was born - between heaven and hell , as some said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : braunau sits across the river inn from the bavarian town of simbach it 's definitely not a label that pleases most of the 17,300 braunauers , who have struggled with this burden of coincidence since 1945 .
they have lived with the stigma of coming from the same place as the man responsible for the murder of millions .
they know that it 's sometimes easier to tell people that they come from " near salzburg . "
while marktl likes to forget that the pope only lived there for two years and has no personal memories of his time there , braunauers take pains to point out that hitler left at around the same age .
a stone as tourist attraction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : braunau 's picturesque town square " believe me , i 'd much rather have the pope in braunau , " said klaus prexl , head of the local tourism office , who looks like one of the many tanned visitors who stop by on their bicycle tours through the region .
but prexl does n't have the catholic leader on offer and instead struggles to deal with continuing interest in hitler .
" every second or third guest asks about the house , " he said after one woman visiting from poland came in to find out how she could get to the building where the dictator was born .
like all the others , prexl sends her down the street , through the city tower , then it 'll come up on your left-hand side , watch out for the stone of admonition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stone 's still the only marker that hitler was born here " for peace , freedom and democracy , " reads the inscription on the stone , which comes from the nearby nazi concentration camp in mauthausen .
" never again fascism .
the millions of dead are a reminder . "
it 's the only reference to the fact that hitler was born here and , according to prexl , it 's not enough .
" i think it 's time for a documentation center , " said the 57-year-old .
" it exists in all the places where he committed crimes and we conceal it .
it 's been talked about forever , but there are local political influences that do n't want it . "
taking on responsibility far from it , countered gerhard skiba , braunau 's mayor since 1989 .
shortly after taking office , the self-declared socialist and member of austria 's social democratic party decided to place the stone in front of the house just in time for the 100th anniversary of hitler 's birthday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : braunau 's mayor gerhard skiba in his office " there were pretty serious protests , " skiba said , adding that he even received some death threats .
" people said : ' we do n't need that , the stone could be a target for attacks . " '
he also cleansed the town of hitler souvenirs such as beer mugs , ashtrays and wine bottles with the nazi leader 's image that were still sold at the time .
he hired streetworkers to deal with signs of right-wing extremism among teenagers and enthusiastically backed the placement of so-called stumbling stones that remember people killed by the nazis in front of the houses where they once lived .
two more of these will be placed on thursday .
skiba said he also wants to install a sign that identifies hitler 's birth house in front of the building in the very near future .
while the austrian government rents the landmarked structure , the owner has so far refused to agree to a plaque that 's directly attached to its walls .
ideal use of building the owners 's unwillingness to sell the house has also been one of the main reasons why a so-called house of responsibility has not been set up inside it , skiba said .
another reason is that the building is currently not open to the public as it is used by an organization called lebenshilfe , which offers people with mental and other disabilities a place to work .
" that 's an ideal use for the building , " skiba said .

" among the things that i still want to do as mayor , this has top priority , " the 59-year-old said .
some , such as braunau 's catholic pastor , think that it might still take some time .
" i think it 's too fresh , " said 65-year-old stefan hofer , who has preached at st. stephan 's church , where hitler was baptized , for the past 34 years .

while braunau will honor two nazi victims on thursday , the austrian town still lacks a place that deals with its most infamous son .
sixty years after the end of world war ii , some say it 's still too early . braunau is almost a town like many others on the austrian-bavarian border .
a church spire towers over the city and youngsters meet up at a fountain in the town square , which is lined with shops and cafés that are famous for their strudels .
bookstores have decorated their windows with the works of pope benedict xvi . , who was born just around the corner , in marktl .
the village lies almost exactly between germany 's most important place of pilgrimage , altötting , and braunau , where adolf hitler was born - between heaven and hell , as some said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : braunau sits across the river inn from the bavarian town of simbach it 's definitely not a label that pleases most of the 17,300 braunauers , who have struggled with this burden of coincidence since 1945 .
they have lived with the stigma of coming from the same place as the man responsible for the murder of millions .
they know that it 's sometimes easier to tell people that they come from " near salzburg . "
while marktl likes to forget that the pope only lived there for two years and has no personal memories of his time there , braunauers take pains to point out that hitler left at around the same age .

" i had an image of him as being more distant than his predecessor , that has changed a lot , " baumgartner said . personal visit the visit is likely to be remembered as a sentimental stroll down memory lane in what the 79-year-old pope himself admitted may be his final major visit to his homeland . the emotional high point of the trip came on wednesday when the pontiff knelt in prayer at the graves of his mother , father and sister . the private prayers at the tiny ziegetsdorf cemetery outside the city of regensburg came on a day which the vatican said had been reserved for " private time " for the pope and his elder brother georg . following the 20-minute visit , the two brothers went the short distance to the house in the neighboring suburb of pentling , which the head of the roman catholic church has owned since he was a theology professor at regensburg university . pope focused on family in an earlier address , the pope had appealed for unity within the roman catholic church , where pressure groups have challenged his traditional views of marriage and the family .

the first rabbis to be ordained in germany since the nazi era will take their vows at a synagogue in dresden thursday . the three men involved have just completed a five-year course of study at the abraham geiger college , which was founded in berlin in 1999 amid reservations from many jews . " we are the only university-level training institute on continental europe , " the university 's rector , walter homolka , told dpa news service .
" there is an enormous demand for rabbis in europe and the rest of the world . " the last jewish seminary in germany was shut in 1942 and no rabbis have been ordained in the country since . bildunterschrift : since 1991 , the synagogue on oranienburger street in berlin has been a center of renewed jewish life after their ordination in dresden on thursday , the three rabbis will take up different posts .
czech-born tom kucera will be based in munich , daniel alter in oldenburg and south african malcolm matitani in cape town . showing reservation abraham geiger , the college 's namesake , was one of the most important thinkers in liberal judaism and was himself a rabbi in berlin from 1870 to 1875 . initially jewish organizations abroad expressed reservations about rabbis being trained in germany , according to homolka . " one colleague said he could not understand why we wanted to establish such an institution on the ashes of 6 million victims of the shoa -lrb- holocaust -rrb- , " the rector said . kucera , who comes from the czech republic and who was originally a biochemistry student , admits he had mixed feelings the first time he stood in front of berlin 's landmark brandenburg gate . " flashes from the past shot through my mind , " he says .
" of course the past has to be remembered , but today it 's more about the future . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rabbis have similar duties to priests - but not exactly the same .
for instance , no incense kucera , 35 , says he has experienced the growth of jewish communities in his native country , but without the presence of rabbis . " that was a major factor of motivation for me , " he said , adding that he also enjoys imparting knowledge to people . the college , which is attached to the university of potsdam , a 30-minute journey from the german capital , means that students no longer have to travel abroad to become a rabbi , homolka said .
many of those who went to london or the us for training never returned . practical training there are currently 12 students at the berlin college , where they learn the practical work of a rabbi 's duties . like a pastor or priest in the christian church , a rabbi leads one or more congregations , presiding over key lifetime ceremonies like weddings and funerals for its members .
he - or she , in some liberal congregations - leads worship services , offers counselling , and can even help to settle legal disputes among members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler says ordination is an ' important step ' the three rabbis completed their academic training at potsdam university , where there is a chair of rabbinical studies and liturgy . graduates can obtain a master 's degree in jewish studies - a course which takes in commentaries on jewish law , religious philosophy , religious history , sociology , liturgy , synagogue music and counselling .
there are also lessons in hebrew , aramaic and , on request , yiddish . students spend a year of the course studying at an israeli university , and also do practical work in jewish communities . köhler praises graduates germany today has a jewish population of 100,000 , compared to 600,000 before the start of world war ii .
there are some 100 jewish communities in the country today , served by around 25 rabbis . meanwhile , german president horst köhler called the first ordination of rabbis in germany in 64 years a special occasion . " after the holocaust , many people could not imagine that jewish life would one day blossom in germany again , " köhler said in a public statement . he called the ordinations " an important step " to a gradual normalization and less self-consciousness .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 14.09.2006 klinsmann hints at return for next world cup großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann may want a little more world cup excitement germany soccer supporters were sad when national men 's head coach jürgen klinsmann took his hat after the world cup .
during a video conference with other coaches , he dropped a hint that he may be back soon . once a soccer player gets a taste of coaching , it can be difficult for him to leave it behind .
when jürgen klinsmann resigned this summer as germany 's head coach after a better-than-expected third-place performance , speculation immediately started that he would take a seat on a bench somewhere else . two months after the end of the world cup , he has made his first public appearance during a video conference at the end of a meeting of world cup managers organized by fifa in berlin and alluded to his desires none too clearly . " who knows , perhaps i 'll be a coach once again at the 2010 world cup -lrb- in south africa -rrb- , " he said . klinsmann , calling in to the conference from his home in california , still enjoys " taking -lrb- his -rrb- kids to school , " something he has more than ample time to do , having retired four days after guiding germany into third at this year 's world cup finals . coach for usa ?
or possibly an african country ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coaching a striker like ivory coast 's didier drogba could be enticing klinsmann 's logical new employer would be the united states soccer federation , which separated paths from bruce arena who had coached the american men 's team for eight years .
it would also be sensible for him considering that the team has its training quarters in southern california . klinsmann has consistently denied the connection with the us team and theo zwanziger , the newly elected president of the german football federation , raised another possible scenario for the 42-year-old who has always had a penchant for travel . zwanziger suggested recently that klinsmann " might take charge of a team in africa . " coaching just any old team on the sometimes times chaotic african continent , however , would be a risky undertaking considering that only the hosts south africa have a guaranteed ticket to the finals in four years .
at the 2006 tournament , all four sub-saharan teams - ivory coast , angola , ghana and togo - made their debuts , knocking out regular african favorites like cameroon , nigeria and south africa during qualifications . for the time being , klinsmann can continue to take his kids to school , and savor the fact that , as he said at the conference , " germany practically rediscovered itself " at the world cup this summer . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de coach klinsmann calls it quits in germany days after leading germany to third place in the 2006 world cup with a young team he personally put together , coach jürgen klinsmann has decided to step down .

it was his last event on his personal six-day trip to his native bavaria homeland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many pilgrims spent the night at a field outside of regensburg for an outdoor mass on tuesday martina baumgarnter , a 22-year-old student from erding near munich , told ap news agency that the trip had shown her the warmer side of the 79-year-old former theologian who succeeded the charismatic john paul ii last year . " i had an image of him as being more distant than his predecessor , that has changed a lot , " baumgartner said . personal visit the visit is likely to be remembered as a sentimental stroll down memory lane in what the 79-year-old pope himself admitted may be his final major visit to his homeland . the emotional high point of the trip came on wednesday when the pontiff knelt in prayer at the graves of his mother , father and sister . the private prayers at the tiny ziegetsdorf cemetery outside the city of regensburg came on a day which the vatican said had been reserved for " private time " for the pope and his elder brother georg . following the 20-minute visit , the two brothers went the short distance to the house in the neighboring suburb of pentling , which the head of the roman catholic church has owned since he was a theology professor at regensburg university . pope focused on family in an earlier address , the pope had appealed for unity within the roman catholic church , where pressure groups have challenged his traditional views of marriage and the family . " just as in an organ an expert hand must constantly bring disharmony back to consonance , so we in the church ... always need to find anew , through our communion in faith , harmony in the praise of god and in fraternal love . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope , at a mass at the islinger field in regensburg on tuesday on tuesday benedict had hit the only political note of his visit , during which his addresses have been almost entirely spiritual , when he fleetingly criticised the islamic concept of " jihad .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 14.09.2006 german authorities confirm gm rice findings großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gentically modified rice is banned in the euopean union the discovery of genetically manipulated rice in supermarkets in southwestern germany has for the first time been officially confirmed by agricultural authorities , after eu reports of gm rice elsewhere in the country . traces of ll601 , a type of genetically manipulated rice from the us , were found in a product called " fit for fun trix reis-mix triathlon " sold at the edeka supermarket chain in the southwestern german state of baden-wurttemberg . the ministry of agriculture in stuttgart examined 46 rice samples , of which seven tested positive for genetically manipulated material , reported germany 's southwestern radio online .
of these , four came from rice produced in the us .
the origin of the other three positive samples is unknown . biotech rice is not allowed to be grown , sold or marketed in the eu . earlier eu reports of contaminated rice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace made initial claims in the aldi gm rice case the findings in baden-wurttemberg come just on the heels of reports concerning the discovery of ll601 in rice packages sold at the aldi nord supermarket chain in the northern regions of germany . the european federation of rice millers had tested 162 shipments of rice imported from the united states .
33 of them tested positive for genetically modified rice , the european commission said in a statement on monday . " any consignments which tested positive have already been recalled or withheld from the market and the federation 's members have committed to continuing such withdrawals for any positive findings , " the commission said monday . greenpeace genetics expert ulrike brendel said that the aldi products , sold under the bon-ri brand , had been contaminated with a strain of rice developed by german industrial giant bayer and tested in the united states . " we tested the samples at a respected and independent laboratory , " brendel said .
" the results show some of the rice has been modified using a method developed and published by bayer - there 's no doubt about it . " a tainted biotech product rice found in eight of aldi nord 's 35 sales areas contained traces of ll601 - a rice strain engineered by bayer to resist certain bayer herbicides . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both aldi and edeka have removed the rice products in question from shelves aldi nord said documentation for the rice imports showed no signs of shipments containing genetically modified rice , but it removed the affected products from its shelves and was testing the countries of origins of other similar products . the european commission 's findings suggested gm material had been finding its way into the european market for some time .
considering that germany imports about one quarter of its rice from the us , brendel thought it was inevitable that a number of products and supermarket chains would be affected . " this modified strain of rice was planted in the us in 2001 , but only as a test crop , " brendel said .
" the fact we 're finding it here in imports shows that industry is n't capable of controlling genetically modified crops .
we do n't know what human health or environmental risks involved .
if we want to keep food sources free of genetically modified material , then we ca n't afford to plant gm crops . " declaring war on biotech rice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany imported 46,500 tons of rice from the us in 2005 alone last month the european commission slapped stringent testing requirements on rice imports from the us to try and stop genetically modified varieties from entering the 25 country-bloc . at the end of august , germany 's federal ministry of consumer protection ordered state-level authorities to step up their detection efforts . france and sweden have also discovered traces of a banned genetically modified substance in imported us rice , in tests which must be confirmed by eu laboratories , a european commission source said tuesday . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu caution puts brakes on gm food legislation eu leaders thursday stressed the need for more information and experience before further legislation can be passed on genetically-modified organisms , at the end of a two-day conference on gmos in vienna .

while braunau will honor two nazi victims on thursday , the austrian town still lacks a place that deals with its most infamous son .
sixty years after the end of world war ii , some say it 's still too early . braunau is almost a town like many others on the austrian-bavarian border .
a church spire towers over the city and youngsters meet up at a fountain in the town square , which is lined with shops and cafés that are famous for their strudels .
bookstores have decorated their windows with the works of pope benedict xvi . , who was born just around the corner , in marktl .
the village lies almost exactly between germany 's most important place of pilgrimage , altötting , and braunau , where adolf hitler was born - between heaven and hell , as some said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : braunau sits across the river inn from the bavarian town of simbach it 's definitely not a label that pleases most of the 17,300 braunauers , who have struggled with this burden of coincidence since 1945 .
they have lived with the stigma of coming from the same place as the man responsible for the murder of millions .
they know that it 's sometimes easier to tell people that they come from " near salzburg . "
while marktl likes to forget that the pope only lived there for two years and has no personal memories of his time there , braunauers take pains to point out that hitler left at around the same age .
a stone as tourist attraction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : braunau 's picturesque town square " believe me , i 'd much rather have the pope in braunau , " said klaus prexl , head of the local tourism office , who looks like one of the many tanned visitors who stop by on their bicycle tours through the region .
but prexl does n't have the catholic leader on offer and instead struggles to deal with continuing interest in hitler .
" every second or third guest asks about the house , " he said after one woman visiting from poland came in to find out how she could get to the building where the dictator was born .
like all the others , prexl sends her down the street , through the city tower , then it 'll come up on your left-hand side , watch out for the stone of admonition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stone 's still the only marker that hitler was born here " for peace , freedom and democracy , " reads the inscription on the stone , which comes from the nearby nazi concentration camp in mauthausen .
" never again fascism .
the millions of dead are a reminder . "
it 's the only reference to the fact that hitler was born here and , according to prexl , it 's not enough .
" i think it 's time for a documentation center , " said the 57-year-old .
" it exists in all the places where he committed crimes and we conceal it .
it 's been talked about forever , but there are local political influences that do n't want it . "
taking on responsibility far from it , countered gerhard skiba , braunau 's mayor since 1989 .
shortly after taking office , the self-declared socialist and member of austria 's social democratic party decided to place the stone in front of the house just in time for the 100th anniversary of hitler 's birthday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : braunau 's mayor gerhard skiba in his office " there were pretty serious protests , " skiba said , adding that he even received some death threats .
" people said : ' we do n't need that , the stone could be a target for attacks . " '
he also cleansed the town of hitler souvenirs such as beer mugs , ashtrays and wine bottles with the nazi leader 's image that were still sold at the time .
he hired streetworkers to deal with signs of right-wing extremism among teenagers and enthusiastically backed the placement of so-called stumbling stones that remember people killed by the nazis in front of the houses where they once lived .
two more of these will be placed on thursday .
skiba said he also wants to install a sign that identifies hitler 's birth house in front of the building in the very near future .
while the austrian government rents the landmarked structure , the owner has so far refused to agree to a plaque that 's directly attached to its walls .
ideal use of building the owners 's unwillingness to sell the house has also been one of the main reasons why a so-called house of responsibility has not been set up inside it , skiba said .
another reason is that the building is currently not open to the public as it is used by an organization called lebenshilfe , which offers people with mental and other disabilities a place to work .
" that 's an ideal use for the building , " skiba said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franciscan nuns recently named a park in braunau in jägerstetter 's honor while he said that he regrets that he failed to name a fountain , bridge or street after franz jägerstetter , who was murdered by the nazis for refusing to join the army , he will wholeheartedly back plans to transform hitler 's birthplace into a documentation center once it is no longer needed by its current tenants .
" among the things that i still want to do as mayor , this has top priority , " the 59-year-old said .
some , such as braunau 's catholic pastor , think that it might still take some time .
" i think it 's too fresh , " said 65-year-old stefan hofer , who has preached at st. stephan 's church , where hitler was baptized , for the past 34 years .
he added that braunau was currently taking responsibility via its days of contemporary history , which began in 1992 with a symposium called " undesired heritage " that looked at how cities such as braunau , auschwitz , vichy or stalin 's birthplace gori deal with their heritage .
waiting for the green light but the scientific adviser of that event said that mayor skiba just needs to give the political green light for the house of responsibility .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gifts made by mentally disabled people are currently sold inside the house " if he says yes , i 'll raise the money , " said andreas maislinger , a historian and political scientist , adding that the house should look at the past , present and future by giving visitors information about hitler and his crimes , offering space for organizations such as lebenshilfe and serving as a place that promotes intercultural understanding by inviting young chinese and japanese , indians and pakistanis , israelis and palestinians and others to get to know each other during a stay in braunau .
" we 're already doing that throughout the world , " said maislinger , who also founded an organization that offers young austrians an opportunity to complete their compulsory community service abroad .
" it 's all ready to go , " he said .
" i 'll start immediately when i get the go-ahead .

despite positive comments , solutions remained distant . a senior iranian envoy on thursday called contacts between tehran and the european union a " step in the right direction " in resolving the standoff over his country 's refusal to freeze uranium enrichment , but he accused the us of trying to sabotage the talks . ali ashgar soltanieh spoke as senior eu and iranian representatives met in a new round of negotiations on nuclear differences between tehran and the international community . that meeting , originally scheduled for paris , was moved in the last minute to geneva for " logistical reasons , " eu spokeswoman cristina gallach said , without elaboration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diplomatic talks are still continuing despite little progress only " the continuation of dialogue and negotiations free from any kind of threat , pressure or any preconditions can pave the way " to a negotiated solution of the impasse , soltanieh told a meeting of the international atomic energy agency 's 35-nation board shortly before the end of the four-day conference . us push for sanctions the meeting planned for thursday in paris between eu foreign policy chief javier solana and iran 's top nuclear negotiator ali larijani was postponed on short notice with no reason given . solana is negotiating with the iranians in the name of six major powers - the five permanent un security council members and germany - to encourage tehran to accept political and economic incentives to suspend uranium enrichment . the six powers , notably the us , fear iran is trying to develop nuclear weapons , a charge which tehran rejects saying it has only a civil nuclear power program . the us is pushing for un sanctions against iran for failing to honor an aug .

" on tuesday , the six nations failed to agree on a joint statement on iran at the iaea meeting due to the us call for sanctions and hesitance by russia and china to use that word , a western diplomat told news agencies . ' poisoned ' negotiations ? on thursday , an iranian official accused the us of " poisoning " the course of nuclear negotiations , the news agency isna reported . " the us intends to poison the course of the negotiations through constant antagonism , although iran has constantly stressed negotiations for realizing its nuclear rights , " foreign ministry spokesman mohammad-ali hosseini told dpa news service . comments in dakar iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad said thursday during a visit to dakar that iran would support unconditional talks on the nuclear dispute and that the issue could be settled as long as internationally-acknowledged laws were taken into consideration - a reference to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , which iran has signed . ahmadinejad will later this month travel to new york for the 61st session of the un general assembly , where he will once again challenge his american counterpart george w. bush to a television debate on both the nuclear dispute and the middle east conflict . dw staff -lrb- rar / jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sanctions against iran could cost 10,000 german jobs as world powers gear up for a new round of diplomacy to respond to iran 's refusal to halt uranium enrichment , germany 's main trade group said the country could lose 10,000 jobs if tehran is slapped with sanctions .

of these , four came from rice produced in the us .
the origin of the other three positive samples is unknown . biotech rice is not allowed to be grown , sold or marketed in the eu . earlier eu reports of contaminated rice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace made initial claims in the aldi gm rice case the findings in baden-wurttemberg come just on the heels of reports concerning the discovery of ll601 in rice packages sold at the aldi nord supermarket chain in the northern regions of germany . the european federation of rice millers had tested 162 shipments of rice imported from the united states .
33 of them tested positive for genetically modified rice , the european commission said in a statement on monday . " any consignments which tested positive have already been recalled or withheld from the market and the federation 's members have committed to continuing such withdrawals for any positive findings , " the commission said monday . greenpeace genetics expert ulrike brendel said that the aldi products , sold under the bon-ri brand , had been contaminated with a strain of rice developed by german industrial giant bayer and tested in the united states . " we tested the samples at a respected and independent laboratory , " brendel said .
" the results show some of the rice has been modified using a method developed and published by bayer - there 's no doubt about it . " a tainted biotech product rice found in eight of aldi nord 's 35 sales areas contained traces of ll601 - a rice strain engineered by bayer to resist certain bayer herbicides . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both aldi and edeka have removed the rice products in question from shelves aldi nord said documentation for the rice imports showed no signs of shipments containing genetically modified rice , but it removed the affected products from its shelves and was testing the countries of origins of other similar products . the european commission 's findings suggested gm material had been finding its way into the european market for some time .
considering that germany imports about one quarter of its rice from the us , brendel thought it was inevitable that a number of products and supermarket chains would be affected . " this modified strain of rice was planted in the us in 2001 , but only as a test crop , " brendel said .
" the fact we 're finding it here in imports shows that industry is n't capable of controlling genetically modified crops .
we do n't know what human health or environmental risks involved .
if we want to keep food sources free of genetically modified material , then we ca n't afford to plant gm crops . " declaring war on biotech rice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany imported 46,500 tons of rice from the us in 2005 alone last month the european commission slapped stringent testing requirements on rice imports from the us to try and stop genetically modified varieties from entering the 25 country-bloc . at the end of august , germany 's federal ministry of consumer protection ordered state-level authorities to step up their detection efforts . france and sweden have also discovered traces of a banned genetically modified substance in imported us rice , in tests which must be confirmed by eu laboratories , a european commission source said tuesday . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu caution puts brakes on gm food legislation eu leaders thursday stressed the need for more information and experience before further legislation can be passed on genetically-modified organisms , at the end of a two-day conference on gmos in vienna .

while braunau will honor two nazi victims on thursday , the austrian town still lacks a place that deals with its most infamous son .
sixty years after the end of world war ii , some say it 's still too early . braunau is almost a town like many others on the austrian-bavarian border .
a church spire towers over the city and youngsters meet up at a fountain in the town square , which is lined with shops and cafés that are famous for their strudels .
bookstores have decorated their windows with the works of pope benedict xvi . , who was born just around the corner , in marktl .
the village lies almost exactly between germany 's most important place of pilgrimage , altötting , and braunau , where adolf hitler was born - between heaven and hell , as some said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : braunau sits across the river inn from the bavarian town of simbach it 's definitely not a label that pleases most of the 17,300 braunauers , who have struggled with this burden of coincidence since 1945 .
they have lived with the stigma of coming from the same place as the man responsible for the murder of millions .
they know that it 's sometimes easier to tell people that they come from " near salzburg . "
while marktl likes to forget that the pope only lived there for two years and has no personal memories of his time there , braunauers take pains to point out that hitler left at around the same age .
a stone as tourist attraction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : braunau 's picturesque town square " believe me , i 'd much rather have the pope in braunau , " said klaus prexl , head of the local tourism office , who looks like one of the many tanned visitors who stop by on their bicycle tours through the region .
but prexl does n't have the catholic leader on offer and instead struggles to deal with continuing interest in hitler .
" every second or third guest asks about the house , " he said after one woman visiting from poland came in to find out how she could get to the building where the dictator was born .
like all the others , prexl sends her down the street , through the city tower , then it 'll come up on your left-hand side , watch out for the stone of admonition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stone 's still the only marker that hitler was born here " for peace , freedom and democracy , " reads the inscription on the stone , which comes from the nearby nazi concentration camp in mauthausen .
" never again fascism .
the millions of dead are a reminder . "
it 's the only reference to the fact that hitler was born here and , according to prexl , it 's not enough .
" i think it 's time for a documentation center , " said the 57-year-old .
" it exists in all the places where he committed crimes and we conceal it .
it 's been talked about forever , but there are local political influences that do n't want it . "
taking on responsibility far from it , countered gerhard skiba , braunau 's mayor since 1989 .
shortly after taking office , the self-declared socialist and member of austria 's social democratic party decided to place the stone in front of the house just in time for the 100th anniversary of hitler 's birthday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : braunau 's mayor gerhard skiba in his office " there were pretty serious protests , " skiba said , adding that he even received some death threats .
" people said : ' we do n't need that , the stone could be a target for attacks . " '
he also cleansed the town of hitler souvenirs such as beer mugs , ashtrays and wine bottles with the nazi leader 's image that were still sold at the time .
he hired streetworkers to deal with signs of right-wing extremism among teenagers and enthusiastically backed the placement of so-called stumbling stones that remember people killed by the nazis in front of the houses where they once lived .
two more of these will be placed on thursday .
skiba said he also wants to install a sign that identifies hitler 's birth house in front of the building in the very near future .
while the austrian government rents the landmarked structure , the owner has so far refused to agree to a plaque that 's directly attached to its walls .
ideal use of building the owners 's unwillingness to sell the house has also been one of the main reasons why a so-called house of responsibility has not been set up inside it , skiba said .
another reason is that the building is currently not open to the public as it is used by an organization called lebenshilfe , which offers people with mental and other disabilities a place to work .
" that 's an ideal use for the building , " skiba said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franciscan nuns recently named a park in braunau in jägerstetter 's honor while he said that he regrets that he failed to name a fountain , bridge or street after franz jägerstetter , who was murdered by the nazis for refusing to join the army , he will wholeheartedly back plans to transform hitler 's birthplace into a documentation center once it is no longer needed by its current tenants .
" among the things that i still want to do as mayor , this has top priority , " the 59-year-old said .
some , such as braunau 's catholic pastor , think that it might still take some time .
" i think it 's too fresh , " said 65-year-old stefan hofer , who has preached at st. stephan 's church , where hitler was baptized , for the past 34 years .
he added that braunau was currently taking responsibility via its days of contemporary history , which began in 1992 with a symposium called " undesired heritage " that looked at how cities such as braunau , auschwitz , vichy or stalin 's birthplace gori deal with their heritage .
waiting for the green light but the scientific adviser of that event said that mayor skiba just needs to give the political green light for the house of responsibility .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gifts made by mentally disabled people are currently sold inside the house " if he says yes , i 'll raise the money , " said andreas maislinger , a historian and political scientist , adding that the house should look at the past , present and future by giving visitors information about hitler and his crimes , offering space for organizations such as lebenshilfe and serving as a place that promotes intercultural understanding by inviting young chinese and japanese , indians and pakistanis , israelis and palestinians and others to get to know each other during a stay in braunau .

while braunau will honor two nazi victims on thursday , the austrian town still lacks a place that deals with its most infamous son .
sixty years after the end of world war ii , some say it 's still too early . braunau is almost a town like many others on the austrian-bavarian border .
a church spire towers over the city and youngsters meet up at a fountain in the town square , which is lined with shops and cafés that are famous for their strudels .
bookstores have decorated their windows with the works of pope benedict xvi . , who was born just around the corner , in marktl .
the village lies almost exactly between germany 's most important place of pilgrimage , altötting , and braunau , where adolf hitler was born - between heaven and hell , as some said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : braunau sits across the river inn from the bavarian town of simbach it 's definitely not a label that pleases most of the 17,300 braunauers , who have struggled with this burden of coincidence since 1945 .
they have lived with the stigma of coming from the same place as the man responsible for the murder of millions .
they know that it 's sometimes easier to tell people that they come from " near salzburg . "
while marktl likes to forget that the pope only lived there for two years and has no personal memories of his time there , braunauers take pains to point out that hitler left at around the same age .
a stone as tourist attraction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : braunau 's picturesque town square " believe me , i 'd much rather have the pope in braunau , " said klaus prexl , head of the local tourism office , who looks like one of the many tanned visitors who stop by on their bicycle tours through the region .
but prexl does n't have the catholic leader on offer and instead struggles to deal with continuing interest in hitler .
" every second or third guest asks about the house , " he said after one woman visiting from poland came in to find out how she could get to the building where the dictator was born .
like all the others , prexl sends her down the street , through the city tower , then it 'll come up on your left-hand side , watch out for the stone of admonition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stone 's still the only marker that hitler was born here " for peace , freedom and democracy , " reads the inscription on the stone , which comes from the nearby nazi concentration camp in mauthausen .
" never again fascism .
the millions of dead are a reminder . "
it 's the only reference to the fact that hitler was born here and , according to prexl , it 's not enough .
" i think it 's time for a documentation center , " said the 57-year-old .
" it exists in all the places where he committed crimes and we conceal it .
it 's been talked about forever , but there are local political influences that do n't want it . "
taking on responsibility far from it , countered gerhard skiba , braunau 's mayor since 1989 .
shortly after taking office , the self-declared socialist and member of austria 's social democratic party decided to place the stone in front of the house just in time for the 100th anniversary of hitler 's birthday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : braunau 's mayor gerhard skiba in his office " there were pretty serious protests , " skiba said , adding that he even received some death threats .
" people said : ' we do n't need that , the stone could be a target for attacks . " '
he also cleansed the town of hitler souvenirs such as beer mugs , ashtrays and wine bottles with the nazi leader 's image that were still sold at the time .
he hired streetworkers to deal with signs of right-wing extremism among teenagers and enthusiastically backed the placement of so-called stumbling stones that remember people killed by the nazis in front of the houses where they once lived .
two more of these will be placed on thursday .
skiba said he also wants to install a sign that identifies hitler 's birth house in front of the building in the very near future .
while the austrian government rents the landmarked structure , the owner has so far refused to agree to a plaque that 's directly attached to its walls .
ideal use of building the owners 's unwillingness to sell the house has also been one of the main reasons why a so-called house of responsibility has not been set up inside it , skiba said .
another reason is that the building is currently not open to the public as it is used by an organization called lebenshilfe , which offers people with mental and other disabilities a place to work .
" that 's an ideal use for the building , " skiba said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franciscan nuns recently named a park in braunau in jägerstetter 's honor while he said that he regrets that he failed to name a fountain , bridge or street after franz jägerstetter , who was murdered by the nazis for refusing to join the army , he will wholeheartedly back plans to transform hitler 's birthplace into a documentation center once it is no longer needed by its current tenants .
" among the things that i still want to do as mayor , this has top priority , " the 59-year-old said .
some , such as braunau 's catholic pastor , think that it might still take some time .
" i think it 's too fresh , " said 65-year-old stefan hofer , who has preached at st. stephan 's church , where hitler was baptized , for the past 34 years .
he added that braunau was currently taking responsibility via its days of contemporary history , which began in 1992 with a symposium called " undesired heritage " that looked at how cities such as braunau , auschwitz , vichy or stalin 's birthplace gori deal with their heritage .
waiting for the green light but the scientific adviser of that event said that mayor skiba just needs to give the political green light for the house of responsibility .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gifts made by mentally disabled people are currently sold inside the house " if he says yes , i 'll raise the money , " said andreas maislinger , a historian and political scientist , adding that the house should look at the past , present and future by giving visitors information about hitler and his crimes , offering space for organizations such as lebenshilfe and serving as a place that promotes intercultural understanding by inviting young chinese and japanese , indians and pakistanis , israelis and palestinians and others to get to know each other during a stay in braunau .
" we 're already doing that throughout the world , " said maislinger , who also founded an organization that offers young austrians an opportunity to complete their compulsory community service abroad .

but going there is easier than coming back , according to deutsche welle 's nina werkhäuser . it was a decision with " historical dimensions " for germany .
those were the words chancellor angela merkel used to describe the cabinet 's consent to send naval units to the middle east .
indeed , it is a historical decision to send armed german soldiers to the mideast .
for the last 60 years , such a mission would have been unthinkable because it was thought , for understandable historical reasons , that there should be as great a distance as possible between german troops and israel . that such a german foreign policy taboo could be broken may be astonishing .
but de facto , berlin had no other choice .
if germany had withdrawn from the mission , it would have laid the credibility of its foreign policy on the line and would have made berlin 's attempts to stabilize the situation in the mideast in the past few weeks seem absurd . israel explicitly wished for the bundeswehr 's participation .
that was not only the most important condition , it was an obligation .
without israel 's endorsement , angela merkel 's cabinet never would have approved of the mission . nevertheless , there is still a clearly defined line on the ground that the german government has decided not to cross : there will be no ground troops in the middle east .
other countries in the unifil mission should and will take over this responsibility .
they will have the difficult task of working together with the lebanese army to keep hezbollah in check .
how that should be done is still not clear , however . losing focus of peacekeeping mission purposes berlin is steering clear of that dilemma and is concentrating on its naval mission , which is supposed to hinder the delivery of arms via the sea to hezbollah militants .
it is difficult to say at this moment how effective that will be . germany will lead a european naval flotilla that has been granted a robust mandate ; it can stop and search incoming ships by force , if necessary .
despite the potential danger , the risk remains calculable .
yet only with this mandate will the parliament approve this week 's cabinet decision , when it comes up for a vote next week . that support nevertheless is guaranteed .
the vote will then turn the bundeswehr into an army that knows no borders .
but germany is paying a high price for this move , particularly when the choice of peacekeeping missions has become a bit random in nature .
the interests in the middle east are understandable .
but is a peacekeeping operation in the democratic republic of congo really necessary ? the large new mission in the middle east with up to 2,400 soldiers could , like the operations in kosovo and afghanistan , last for years .
and there is no guarantee for success .
such questions should make the german government clearly formulate its security policies .
this mission provides the opportunity to develop a definite exit strategy .

he says both need to come down from the sky and take a look at the reality on the ground . dw-world.de : what did you think of pope benedict 's visit ? hans küng : i think many people here in germany have an ambivalent impression .
benedict has a very nice personality ; he 's shown himself as a very friendly person .
he 's also not a media pope like his predecessor .
he 's not an actor who is looking for applause . he concentrates on the central truths of christianity and faith in god .
on the other hand , he did n't accomplish any of the reforms to the catholic church that some people were looking for . which reforms ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : küng compared the pope to another leader , george w. bush there are a great many things .
if you take the situation around munich , a lot of parishes are without priests .
and just having a lot of people in the seats does n't mean that they are all believers . of course everybody finds it a very stimulating event to see the pope up close and lots of people are looking for a spiritual father and a more credible representative of moral integrity , justice and peace than many politicians today . but there were fewer people at the liturgy than had been expected .
we should not think that all those who were coming to see a star are now convinced and faithful catholic believers . why do n't you think that the great wave of enthusiasm that greeted the pope could have a vitalizing effect on the church ? it would be great if it had consistent consequences .
it is not enough to preach and have a big event .
the most recent public opinion poll by mckinsey asked whether the catholic church should be reformed and 43 percent said yes .
this is 40 percent more than before . in the same poll , 45 percent - nearly half of all germans - said they have no confidence in the catholic church as an institution . the people in munich were very happy - they have a german pope , a bavarian pope .
it the event had been held in magdeburg , in a new german state , where only 8 percent are registered as christians , we would have had a different image of germany . what do you think about the pope 's comments on the unity of the church ?
do you think he could influence more cooperation between the catholics and the protestants ? of course he could .
i was very pleased that the german president , horst köhler , who is a member of the global ethic foundation , said when the pope arrived : " in the name of many christians in this country , more ecumenical progress . "
and the pope answered in a very convincing way .
he said he would do everything to bring catholic and protestants together . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope blessed the organ but overlooked deeper issues , said küng afterwards , when he met with other christians all the controversial issues between catholics and protestants were just ignored .
most people here in germany would have to have a common eucharist , the acknowledgement of the ministers of the protestant churches .
they would have a solution for marriages from different churches , and of course the problem of papal jurisdiction and infallibility .
all this was practically ignored .
even the representatives of the protestant churches did n't have the courage to mention it . do you feel that the changes you 've mentioned , including unity among christians , will be possible during the tenure of the current pope ? i had a long conversation with him , which i 'm very grateful for .
i still hope that he will finally see that he can not only talk - he must finally take some action .
and i still hope that , after a certain time of reflection , he will do something . sometimes i have the impression he 's like president bush , who takes his air force one jet and flies over new orleans just to see how the situation is .
but finally he had to come down to the ground to see what the reality is . the diocese in regensburg , where the pope was , is probably the most divided diocese in germany .
the bishop of regensburg replaced practically all the elected members of the diocesan council in an authoritarian way with like-minded people .
and people could not understand why the pope just made comments about the organ in the regensburg church in the presence of this bishop . hans küng was professor of ecumenical theology and director of the institute for ecumenical research at the university of tübingen from 1960 until his retirement in 1996 .
he also served as official theological consultant to the second vatican council appointed by pope john xxiii .

the german leader said she again raised human rights issues with the chinese leader and urged beijing to respect the freedom of the press . " in our discussions , we touched on human rights issues and i made it clear that these rights are inalienable and should be respected everywhere , " merkel told reporters at a press conference with wen . she said she had singled out the freedom of the press and stressed that journalists should be allowed to carry out their work during the 2008 olympic games in beijing .
merkel alluded to new media rules announced on sunday that require foreign media to seek approval to distribute news , pictures and graphics within china . " i said clearly that on this occasion too , the freedom of the press will play an important role and that we should continue to discuss the matter , " merkel said . her remarks follow the recent jailing of two journalists in what observers describe as a clampdown on the media ahead of the games and the 17th communist party congress next year .
the chinese government recently sentenced new york times researcher zhao yan to three years in prison for fraud and singapore straits times correspondent ching cheong to five years for allegedly spying for taiwan . intellectual property rights another area that has rankled many western politicians and business leaders is intellectual property rights -lrb- ipr -rrb- and the piracy of films and cds .
german and chinese officials took limited action on thursday by signing an ipr accord . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pirate software cds are common in chinese street stalls under the agreement , german experts will help train chinese patent officials and a series of exchanges are to be arranged for personnel from both countries . " this will help ensure that there is more reliability for those who in invest in china , " said merkel at the press conference . for his part , wen hailed the growth of german-chinese economic ties and said he expected the overall trade volume between both nations to reach $ 80 billion dollars -lrb- 63 billion euros -rrb- , after climbing to 70 billion dollars last year . a rms embargo merkel and wen also discussed the topic of the eu 's arms embargo imposed against china in 1989 after the bloody crackdown on pro-democracy protests at tiananmen square .
merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder , had together with france led calls in 2004 to lift the embargo but this was strongly opposed by both the us and japan , which say a resumption of european weapons sales to beijing will worsen tensions between china and taiwan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the violent crackdown on protests at tiananmen square led to the embargo merkel has said she will not go down schröder 's path .

the german leader said she again raised human rights issues with the chinese leader and urged beijing to respect the freedom of the press . " in our discussions , we touched on human rights issues and i made it clear that these rights are inalienable and should be respected everywhere , " merkel told reporters at a press conference with wen . she said she had singled out the freedom of the press and stressed that journalists should be allowed to carry out their work during the 2008 olympic games in beijing .
merkel alluded to new media rules announced on sunday that require foreign media to seek approval to distribute news , pictures and graphics within china . " i said clearly that on this occasion too , the freedom of the press will play an important role and that we should continue to discuss the matter , " merkel said . her remarks follow the recent jailing of two journalists in what observers describe as a clampdown on the media ahead of the games and the 17th communist party congress next year .

he says both need to come down from the sky and take a look at the reality on the ground . dw-world.de : what did you think of pope benedict 's visit ? hans küng : i think many people here in germany have an ambivalent impression .
benedict has a very nice personality ; he 's shown himself as a very friendly person .
he 's also not a media pope like his predecessor .
he 's not an actor who is looking for applause . he concentrates on the central truths of christianity and faith in god .
on the other hand , he did n't accomplish any of the reforms to the catholic church that some people were looking for . which reforms ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : küng compared the pope to another leader , george w. bush there are a great many things .
if you take the situation around munich , a lot of parishes are without priests .
and just having a lot of people in the seats does n't mean that they are all believers . of course everybody finds it a very stimulating event to see the pope up close and lots of people are looking for a spiritual father and a more credible representative of moral integrity , justice and peace than many politicians today . but there were fewer people at the liturgy than had been expected .
we should not think that all those who were coming to see a star are now convinced and faithful catholic believers . why do n't you think that the great wave of enthusiasm that greeted the pope could have a vitalizing effect on the church ? it would be great if it had consistent consequences .
it is not enough to preach and have a big event .
the most recent public opinion poll by mckinsey asked whether the catholic church should be reformed and 43 percent said yes .
this is 40 percent more than before . in the same poll , 45 percent - nearly half of all germans - said they have no confidence in the catholic church as an institution . the people in munich were very happy - they have a german pope , a bavarian pope .
it the event had been held in magdeburg , in a new german state , where only 8 percent are registered as christians , we would have had a different image of germany . what do you think about the pope 's comments on the unity of the church ?
do you think he could influence more cooperation between the catholics and the protestants ? of course he could .
i was very pleased that the german president , horst köhler , who is a member of the global ethic foundation , said when the pope arrived : " in the name of many christians in this country , more ecumenical progress . "
and the pope answered in a very convincing way .
he said he would do everything to bring catholic and protestants together . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope blessed the organ but overlooked deeper issues , said küng afterwards , when he met with other christians all the controversial issues between catholics and protestants were just ignored .
most people here in germany would have to have a common eucharist , the acknowledgement of the ministers of the protestant churches .
they would have a solution for marriages from different churches , and of course the problem of papal jurisdiction and infallibility .
all this was practically ignored .

benedict has a very nice personality ; he 's shown himself as a very friendly person .
he 's also not a media pope like his predecessor .
he 's not an actor who is looking for applause . he concentrates on the central truths of christianity and faith in god .
on the other hand , he did n't accomplish any of the reforms to the catholic church that some people were looking for . which reforms ?

we should not think that all those who were coming to see a star are now convinced and faithful catholic believers . why do n't you think that the great wave of enthusiasm that greeted the pope could have a vitalizing effect on the church ? it would be great if it had consistent consequences .
it is not enough to preach and have a big event .
the most recent public opinion poll by mckinsey asked whether the catholic church should be reformed and 43 percent said yes .
this is 40 percent more than before . in the same poll , 45 percent - nearly half of all germans - said they have no confidence in the catholic church as an institution . the people in munich were very happy - they have a german pope , a bavarian pope .

do you think he could influence more cooperation between the catholics and the protestants ? of course he could .
i was very pleased that the german president , horst köhler , who is a member of the global ethic foundation , said when the pope arrived : " in the name of many christians in this country , more ecumenical progress . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 14.09.2006 german authorities confirm gm rice findings großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gentically modified rice is banned in the euopean union the discovery of genetically manipulated rice in supermarkets in southwestern germany has for the first time been officially confirmed by agricultural authorities , after eu reports of gm rice elsewhere in the country . traces of ll601 , a type of genetically manipulated rice from the us , were found in a product called " fit for fun trix reis-mix triathlon " sold at the edeka supermarket chain in the southwestern german state of baden-wurttemberg . the ministry of agriculture in stuttgart examined 46 rice samples , of which seven tested positive for genetically manipulated material , reported germany 's southwestern radio online .
of these , four came from rice produced in the us .
the origin of the other three positive samples is unknown . biotech rice is not allowed to be grown , sold or marketed in the eu . earlier eu reports of contaminated rice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace made initial claims in the aldi gm rice case the findings in baden-wurttemberg come just on the heels of reports concerning the discovery of ll601 in rice packages sold at the aldi nord supermarket chain in the northern regions of germany . the european federation of rice millers had tested 162 shipments of rice imported from the united states .
33 of them tested positive for genetically modified rice , the european commission said in a statement on monday . " any consignments which tested positive have already been recalled or withheld from the market and the federation 's members have committed to continuing such withdrawals for any positive findings , " the commission said monday . greenpeace genetics expert ulrike brendel said that the aldi products , sold under the bon-ri brand , had been contaminated with a strain of rice developed by german industrial giant bayer and tested in the united states . " we tested the samples at a respected and independent laboratory , " brendel said .
" the results show some of the rice has been modified using a method developed and published by bayer - there 's no doubt about it . " a tainted biotech product rice found in eight of aldi nord 's 35 sales areas contained traces of ll601 - a rice strain engineered by bayer to resist certain bayer herbicides . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both aldi and edeka have removed the rice products in question from shelves aldi nord said documentation for the rice imports showed no signs of shipments containing genetically modified rice , but it removed the affected products from its shelves and was testing the countries of origins of other similar products . the european commission 's findings suggested gm material had been finding its way into the european market for some time .
considering that germany imports about one quarter of its rice from the us , brendel thought it was inevitable that a number of products and supermarket chains would be affected . " this modified strain of rice was planted in the us in 2001 , but only as a test crop , " brendel said .
" the fact we 're finding it here in imports shows that industry is n't capable of controlling genetically modified crops .
we do n't know what human health or environmental risks involved .
if we want to keep food sources free of genetically modified material , then we ca n't afford to plant gm crops . " declaring war on biotech rice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany imported 46,500 tons of rice from the us in 2005 alone last month the european commission slapped stringent testing requirements on rice imports from the us to try and stop genetically modified varieties from entering the 25 country-bloc . at the end of august , germany 's federal ministry of consumer protection ordered state-level authorities to step up their detection efforts . france and sweden have also discovered traces of a banned genetically modified substance in imported us rice , in tests which must be confirmed by eu laboratories , a european commission source said tuesday . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu caution puts brakes on gm food legislation eu leaders thursday stressed the need for more information and experience before further legislation can be passed on genetically-modified organisms , at the end of a two-day conference on gmos in vienna .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.09.2006 opinion : it 's time to formulate the lebanon mission clearly großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german cabinet has agreed to send 2,400 troops to patrol the waters along lebanon 's coast .
but going there is easier than coming back , according to deutsche welle 's nina werkhäuser . it was a decision with " historical dimensions " for germany .
those were the words chancellor angela merkel used to describe the cabinet 's consent to send naval units to the middle east .
indeed , it is a historical decision to send armed german soldiers to the mideast .
for the last 60 years , such a mission would have been unthinkable because it was thought , for understandable historical reasons , that there should be as great a distance as possible between german troops and israel . that such a german foreign policy taboo could be broken may be astonishing .
but de facto , berlin had no other choice .
if germany had withdrawn from the mission , it would have laid the credibility of its foreign policy on the line and would have made berlin 's attempts to stabilize the situation in the mideast in the past few weeks seem absurd . israel explicitly wished for the bundeswehr 's participation .
that was not only the most important condition , it was an obligation .
without israel 's endorsement , angela merkel 's cabinet never would have approved of the mission . nevertheless , there is still a clearly defined line on the ground that the german government has decided not to cross : there will be no ground troops in the middle east .
other countries in the unifil mission should and will take over this responsibility .
they will have the difficult task of working together with the lebanese army to keep hezbollah in check .
how that should be done is still not clear , however . losing focus of peacekeeping mission purposes berlin is steering clear of that dilemma and is concentrating on its naval mission , which is supposed to hinder the delivery of arms via the sea to hezbollah militants .
it is difficult to say at this moment how effective that will be . germany will lead a european naval flotilla that has been granted a robust mandate ; it can stop and search incoming ships by force , if necessary .
despite the potential danger , the risk remains calculable .
yet only with this mandate will the parliament approve this week 's cabinet decision , when it comes up for a vote next week . that support nevertheless is guaranteed .
the vote will then turn the bundeswehr into an army that knows no borders .
but germany is paying a high price for this move , particularly when the choice of peacekeeping missions has become a bit random in nature .
the interests in the middle east are understandable .
but is a peacekeeping operation in the democratic republic of congo really necessary ? the large new mission in the middle east with up to 2,400 soldiers could , like the operations in kosovo and afghanistan , last for years .
and there is no guarantee for success .
such questions should make the german government clearly formulate its security policies .
this mission provides the opportunity to develop a definite exit strategy .
there is still time to do this . nina werkhäuser is dw radio 's correspondent to the german parliament in berlin . -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cabinet gives green light to lebanon mission germany 's cabinet authorized the deployment of ships to the middle east as part of the un force in lebanon .

it was his last event on his personal six-day trip to his native bavaria homeland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many pilgrims spent the night at a field outside of regensburg for an outdoor mass on tuesday martina baumgarnter , a 22-year-old student from erding near munich , told ap news agency that the trip had shown her the warmer side of the 79-year-old former theologian who succeeded the charismatic john paul ii last year . " i had an image of him as being more distant than his predecessor , that has changed a lot , " baumgartner said . personal visit the visit is likely to be remembered as a sentimental stroll down memory lane in what the 79-year-old pope himself admitted may be his final major visit to his homeland . the emotional high point of the trip came on wednesday when the pontiff knelt in prayer at the graves of his mother , father and sister . the private prayers at the tiny ziegetsdorf cemetery outside the city of regensburg came on a day which the vatican said had been reserved for " private time " for the pope and his elder brother georg . following the 20-minute visit , the two brothers went the short distance to the house in the neighboring suburb of pentling , which the head of the roman catholic church has owned since he was a theology professor at regensburg university . pope focused on family in an earlier address , the pope had appealed for unity within the roman catholic church , where pressure groups have challenged his traditional views of marriage and the family . " just as in an organ an expert hand must constantly bring disharmony back to consonance , so we in the church ... always need to find anew , through our communion in faith , harmony in the praise of god and in fraternal love . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope , at a mass at the islinger field in regensburg on tuesday on tuesday benedict had hit the only political note of his visit , during which his addresses have been almost entirely spiritual , when he fleetingly criticised the islamic concept of " jihad . " " violence is incompatible with the nature of god and the nature of the soul , " the pope had said in a complex treatise on reason and faith . his comments drew criticism on wednesday from a leading muslim figure in italy .
ejaz ahmad , a member of an italian governmental consultative committee on islam , called on him to retract them . " the muslim world is currently undergoing a deep crisis and any attack from the west can aggravate this crisis , " ahmad was quoted as saying by italy 's ansa news agency . " in his speech the pope overlooks the fact that islam was the cradle of science and that muslims were the first to translate greek philosophers before they became part of european history , " he said . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope enjoys private time near end of german trip pope benedict xvi knelt in prayer at the graves of his mother , father and sister on wednesday in the emotional highpoint of his six-day visit to his native bavaria .

it was his last event on his personal six-day trip to his native bavaria homeland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many pilgrims spent the night at a field outside of regensburg for an outdoor mass on tuesday martina baumgarnter , a 22-year-old student from erding near munich , told ap news agency that the trip had shown her the warmer side of the 79-year-old former theologian who succeeded the charismatic john paul ii last year . " i had an image of him as being more distant than his predecessor , that has changed a lot , " baumgartner said . personal visit the visit is likely to be remembered as a sentimental stroll down memory lane in what the 79-year-old pope himself admitted may be his final major visit to his homeland . the emotional high point of the trip came on wednesday when the pontiff knelt in prayer at the graves of his mother , father and sister . the private prayers at the tiny ziegetsdorf cemetery outside the city of regensburg came on a day which the vatican said had been reserved for " private time " for the pope and his elder brother georg . following the 20-minute visit , the two brothers went the short distance to the house in the neighboring suburb of pentling , which the head of the roman catholic church has owned since he was a theology professor at regensburg university . pope focused on family in an earlier address , the pope had appealed for unity within the roman catholic church , where pressure groups have challenged his traditional views of marriage and the family . " just as in an organ an expert hand must constantly bring disharmony back to consonance , so we in the church ... always need to find anew , through our communion in faith , harmony in the praise of god and in fraternal love . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope , at a mass at the islinger field in regensburg on tuesday on tuesday benedict had hit the only political note of his visit , during which his addresses have been almost entirely spiritual , when he fleetingly criticised the islamic concept of " jihad . " " violence is incompatible with the nature of god and the nature of the soul , " the pope had said in a complex treatise on reason and faith . his comments drew criticism on wednesday from a leading muslim figure in italy .
ejaz ahmad , a member of an italian governmental consultative committee on islam , called on him to retract them . " the muslim world is currently undergoing a deep crisis and any attack from the west can aggravate this crisis , " ahmad was quoted as saying by italy 's ansa news agency . " in his speech the pope overlooks the fact that islam was the cradle of science and that muslims were the first to translate greek philosophers before they became part of european history , " he said . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope enjoys private time near end of german trip pope benedict xvi knelt in prayer at the graves of his mother , father and sister on wednesday in the emotional highpoint of his six-day visit to his native bavaria .

but going there is easier than coming back , according to deutsche welle 's nina werkhäuser . it was a decision with " historical dimensions " for germany .
those were the words chancellor angela merkel used to describe the cabinet 's consent to send naval units to the middle east .
indeed , it is a historical decision to send armed german soldiers to the mideast .
for the last 60 years , such a mission would have been unthinkable because it was thought , for understandable historical reasons , that there should be as great a distance as possible between german troops and israel . that such a german foreign policy taboo could be broken may be astonishing .
but de facto , berlin had no other choice .
if germany had withdrawn from the mission , it would have laid the credibility of its foreign policy on the line and would have made berlin 's attempts to stabilize the situation in the mideast in the past few weeks seem absurd . israel explicitly wished for the bundeswehr 's participation .
that was not only the most important condition , it was an obligation .
without israel 's endorsement , angela merkel 's cabinet never would have approved of the mission . nevertheless , there is still a clearly defined line on the ground that the german government has decided not to cross : there will be no ground troops in the middle east .
other countries in the unifil mission should and will take over this responsibility .
they will have the difficult task of working together with the lebanese army to keep hezbollah in check .
how that should be done is still not clear , however . losing focus of peacekeeping mission purposes berlin is steering clear of that dilemma and is concentrating on its naval mission , which is supposed to hinder the delivery of arms via the sea to hezbollah militants .
it is difficult to say at this moment how effective that will be . germany will lead a european naval flotilla that has been granted a robust mandate ; it can stop and search incoming ships by force , if necessary .
despite the potential danger , the risk remains calculable .
yet only with this mandate will the parliament approve this week 's cabinet decision , when it comes up for a vote next week . that support nevertheless is guaranteed .
the vote will then turn the bundeswehr into an army that knows no borders .
but germany is paying a high price for this move , particularly when the choice of peacekeeping missions has become a bit random in nature .
the interests in the middle east are understandable .
but is a peacekeeping operation in the democratic republic of congo really necessary ? the large new mission in the middle east with up to 2,400 soldiers could , like the operations in kosovo and afghanistan , last for years .

should online pharmacies be prohibited because they can undercut prices and drive out competition ?
the doc morris case has raised tough legal issues . a state administrative court in the state of saarland decided on wednesday that the dutch online pharmaceutical company doc morris has to shut down its first and only branch in germany until the european court of justice reaches a final verdict on the legality of the business . after opening in july , a doc morris branch in the city of saarbrücken met with immediate criticism from private pharmacists in the region .
they protested the legality of the online discounter on the grounds that they would n't be able to match its prices . critics also referenced a german law which stipulates that pharmacies may only be run by trained pharmacists , not by corporate entities . a final decision has yet to be made bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional pharmacies feel threatened by the discounter " the pharmacists want to do everything to push us out of the market , " said doc morris director ralf däinghaus . on aug .

wednesday 's decision for its temporary closure was issued because three saarbrücken pharmacies have filed an appeal . the european court of justice will have to assess the apparent contradiction between germany 's pharmacy law and the european union 's freedom of establishment law . the state government in saarland is opposed to the administrative court 's decision and has said it considers it legal for doc morris to conduct business in germany . saarland 's minister of health josef hecken said the state government will appeal wednesday 's decision to the state 's higher administrative court . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court allows controversial discount pharmacy in germany a german court on wednesday ruled that a dutch internet pharmacy can operate a branch in germany .

europe 's largest economy has been resilient in spite of high oil prices , but the imf says hazards still lurk . germany 's stock market has been booming for more than three years .
the country 's companies have been enjoying better than average profits during that time .
now , it is starting to pay dividends and the international monetary fund , in its twice-yearly assessment of the global economy , has raised its 2006 economic growth forecasts for germany to 2 percent from its prediction of 1.3 percent in the spring . at its meeting in singapore , the imf 's chief economist raghuram rajan praised europe 's largest economy , saying " it was on a roll . " but berlin 's measures to lower spending , such as merging unemployment and welfare benefits were not having as much as an effect that had been expected , rajan said .
he suggested lowering income taxes to help spur private consumption , recommending more flexibility in the labor market and increased competition in the banking and utilities sectors . adding more kick to the economy , rajan said , alluding to reforms , would not necessarily mean lower incomes or the end of germany 's welfare state . europe should take advantage of growth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eurozone is expected to grow 2.4 percent the imf is not alone in its optimism regards germany .
the eu commission projects growth of 2.2 percent .
only berlin , possibly stung by overly rosy forecasts that went unmet in the recent past , sees more modest growth at 1.6 percent for the current year . a scheduled increase of germany 's value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- as of january will boost private spending until the end of this year .
after that , the imf expects growth to stagnate to 1.3 percent . the economy in the euro zone is experiencing growth not seen since the dot.com days , expected to hit 2.4 percent .
rajan views the stronger developments as an opportunity to pare down public deficits , in line with the eu 's stability and growth pact target to hold such shortfalls to 3.0 percent or less of total output .
as for germany , he echoed his calls for reforms to europe . " europe 's leaders need to find the will to take on vested interests in both labor and in the corporate sector , " said rajan .
" this necessary but difficult domestic battle is constantly postponed until after the next election , " he added . balancing inflation and interest rates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high oil prices will continue to threaten world economies rising oil prices have yet had a great effect on consumer prices but with a barrel of crude expected to hover around or above the $ 70 per barrel mark , inflation is a concern central banks around the world must face . the imf found that with euro zone inflation running " below but close to " the european central bank 's -lrb- ecb -rrb- 2.0 percent objective , " further interest rate increases will likely be needed to maintain price stability over the medium term if the expansion develops as expected . " the ecb since december has raised its benchmark rate four times , taking it from 2.0 to 3.0 percent , and has made clear it intends to carry on with monetary tightening .
but the imf cautioned : " with underlying inflationary pressures still well contained ... policymakers can afford to be cautious in tightening the monetary policy stance , all the more so given the risk of euro appreciation and weaker growth in the united states .

during a video conference with other coaches , he dropped a hint that he may be back soon . once a soccer player gets a taste of coaching , it can be difficult for him to leave it behind .
when jürgen klinsmann resigned this summer as germany 's head coach after a better-than-expected third-place performance , speculation immediately started that he would take a seat on a bench somewhere else . two months after the end of the world cup , he has made his first public appearance during a video conference at the end of a meeting of world cup managers organized by fifa in berlin and alluded to his desires none too clearly . " who knows , perhaps i 'll be a coach once again at the 2010 world cup -lrb- in south africa -rrb- , " he said . klinsmann , calling in to the conference from his home in california , still enjoys " taking -lrb- his -rrb- kids to school , " something he has more than ample time to do , having retired four days after guiding germany into third at this year 's world cup finals . coach for usa ?
or possibly an african country ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coaching a striker like ivory coast 's didier drogba could be enticing klinsmann 's logical new employer would be the united states soccer federation , which separated paths from bruce arena who had coached the american men 's team for eight years .
it would also be sensible for him considering that the team has its training quarters in southern california . klinsmann has consistently denied the connection with the us team and theo zwanziger , the newly elected president of the german football federation , raised another possible scenario for the 42-year-old who has always had a penchant for travel . zwanziger suggested recently that klinsmann " might take charge of a team in africa . " coaching just any old team on the sometimes times chaotic african continent , however , would be a risky undertaking considering that only the hosts south africa have a guaranteed ticket to the finals in four years .
at the 2006 tournament , all four sub-saharan teams - ivory coast , angola , ghana and togo - made their debuts , knocking out regular african favorites like cameroon , nigeria and south africa during qualifications . for the time being , klinsmann can continue to take his kids to school , and savor the fact that , as he said at the conference , " germany practically rediscovered itself " at the world cup this summer . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de coach klinsmann calls it quits in germany days after leading germany to third place in the 2006 world cup with a young team he personally put together , coach jürgen klinsmann has decided to step down .
he will be replaced by his assistant , joachim löw .

europe 's largest economy has been resilient in spite of high oil prices , but the imf says hazards still lurk . germany 's stock market has been booming for more than three years .
the country 's companies have been enjoying better than average profits during that time .
now , it is starting to pay dividends and the international monetary fund , in its twice-yearly assessment of the global economy , has raised its 2006 economic growth forecasts for germany to 2 percent from its prediction of 1.3 percent in the spring . at its meeting in singapore , the imf 's chief economist raghuram rajan praised europe 's largest economy , saying " it was on a roll . " but berlin 's measures to lower spending , such as merging unemployment and welfare benefits were not having as much as an effect that had been expected , rajan said .
he suggested lowering income taxes to help spur private consumption , recommending more flexibility in the labor market and increased competition in the banking and utilities sectors . adding more kick to the economy , rajan said , alluding to reforms , would not necessarily mean lower incomes or the end of germany 's welfare state . europe should take advantage of growth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eurozone is expected to grow 2.4 percent the imf is not alone in its optimism regards germany .
the eu commission projects growth of 2.2 percent .
only berlin , possibly stung by overly rosy forecasts that went unmet in the recent past , sees more modest growth at 1.6 percent for the current year . a scheduled increase of germany 's value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- as of january will boost private spending until the end of this year .
after that , the imf expects growth to stagnate to 1.3 percent . the economy in the euro zone is experiencing growth not seen since the dot.com days , expected to hit 2.4 percent .
rajan views the stronger developments as an opportunity to pare down public deficits , in line with the eu 's stability and growth pact target to hold such shortfalls to 3.0 percent or less of total output .
as for germany , he echoed his calls for reforms to europe . " europe 's leaders need to find the will to take on vested interests in both labor and in the corporate sector , " said rajan .
" this necessary but difficult domestic battle is constantly postponed until after the next election , " he added . balancing inflation and interest rates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high oil prices will continue to threaten world economies rising oil prices have yet had a great effect on consumer prices but with a barrel of crude expected to hover around or above the $ 70 per barrel mark , inflation is a concern central banks around the world must face . the imf found that with euro zone inflation running " below but close to " the european central bank 's -lrb- ecb -rrb- 2.0 percent objective , " further interest rate increases will likely be needed to maintain price stability over the medium term if the expansion develops as expected . " the ecb since december has raised its benchmark rate four times , taking it from 2.0 to 3.0 percent , and has made clear it intends to carry on with monetary tightening .
but the imf cautioned : " with underlying inflationary pressures still well contained ... policymakers can afford to be cautious in tightening the monetary policy stance , all the more so given the risk of euro appreciation and weaker growth in the united states .

it was his last event on his personal six-day trip to his native bavaria homeland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many pilgrims spent the night at a field outside of regensburg for an outdoor mass on tuesday martina baumgarnter , a 22-year-old student from erding near munich , told ap news agency that the trip had shown her the warmer side of the 79-year-old former theologian who succeeded the charismatic john paul ii last year . " i had an image of him as being more distant than his predecessor , that has changed a lot , " baumgartner said . personal visit the visit is likely to be remembered as a sentimental stroll down memory lane in what the 79-year-old pope himself admitted may be his final major visit to his homeland . the emotional high point of the trip came on wednesday when the pontiff knelt in prayer at the graves of his mother , father and sister . the private prayers at the tiny ziegetsdorf cemetery outside the city of regensburg came on a day which the vatican said had been reserved for " private time " for the pope and his elder brother georg . following the 20-minute visit , the two brothers went the short distance to the house in the neighboring suburb of pentling , which the head of the roman catholic church has owned since he was a theology professor at regensburg university . pope focused on family in an earlier address , the pope had appealed for unity within the roman catholic church , where pressure groups have challenged his traditional views of marriage and the family . " just as in an organ an expert hand must constantly bring disharmony back to consonance , so we in the church ... always need to find anew , through our communion in faith , harmony in the praise of god and in fraternal love .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 14.09.2006 imf raises prognosis for german economy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german economy is on a solid foundation currently the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- has ramped up its forecast for the german economy .
europe 's largest economy has been resilient in spite of high oil prices , but the imf says hazards still lurk . germany 's stock market has been booming for more than three years .
the country 's companies have been enjoying better than average profits during that time .
now , it is starting to pay dividends and the international monetary fund , in its twice-yearly assessment of the global economy , has raised its 2006 economic growth forecasts for germany to 2 percent from its prediction of 1.3 percent in the spring . at its meeting in singapore , the imf 's chief economist raghuram rajan praised europe 's largest economy , saying " it was on a roll . " but berlin 's measures to lower spending , such as merging unemployment and welfare benefits were not having as much as an effect that had been expected , rajan said .
he suggested lowering income taxes to help spur private consumption , recommending more flexibility in the labor market and increased competition in the banking and utilities sectors . adding more kick to the economy , rajan said , alluding to reforms , would not necessarily mean lower incomes or the end of germany 's welfare state . europe should take advantage of growth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eurozone is expected to grow 2.4 percent the imf is not alone in its optimism regards germany .
the eu commission projects growth of 2.2 percent .
only berlin , possibly stung by overly rosy forecasts that went unmet in the recent past , sees more modest growth at 1.6 percent for the current year . a scheduled increase of germany 's value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- as of january will boost private spending until the end of this year .
after that , the imf expects growth to stagnate to 1.3 percent . the economy in the euro zone is experiencing growth not seen since the dot.com days , expected to hit 2.4 percent .
rajan views the stronger developments as an opportunity to pare down public deficits , in line with the eu 's stability and growth pact target to hold such shortfalls to 3.0 percent or less of total output .
as for germany , he echoed his calls for reforms to europe . " europe 's leaders need to find the will to take on vested interests in both labor and in the corporate sector , " said rajan .
" this necessary but difficult domestic battle is constantly postponed until after the next election , " he added . balancing inflation and interest rates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high oil prices will continue to threaten world economies rising oil prices have yet had a great effect on consumer prices but with a barrel of crude expected to hover around or above the $ 70 per barrel mark , inflation is a concern central banks around the world must face . the imf found that with euro zone inflation running " below but close to " the european central bank 's -lrb- ecb -rrb- 2.0 percent objective , " further interest rate increases will likely be needed to maintain price stability over the medium term if the expansion develops as expected . " the ecb since december has raised its benchmark rate four times , taking it from 2.0 to 3.0 percent , and has made clear it intends to carry on with monetary tightening .
but the imf cautioned : " with underlying inflationary pressures still well contained ... policymakers can afford to be cautious in tightening the monetary policy stance , all the more so given the risk of euro appreciation and weaker growth in the united states .

while braunau will honor two nazi victims on thursday , the austrian town still lacks a place that deals with its most infamous son .
sixty years after the end of world war ii , some say it 's still too early . braunau is almost a town like many others on the austrian-bavarian border .
a church spire towers over the city and youngsters meet up at a fountain in the town square , which is lined with shops and cafés that are famous for their strudels .
bookstores have decorated their windows with the works of pope benedict xvi . , who was born just around the corner , in marktl .
the village lies almost exactly between germany 's most important place of pilgrimage , altötting , and braunau , where adolf hitler was born - between heaven and hell , as some said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : braunau sits across the river inn from the bavarian town of simbach it 's definitely not a label that pleases most of the 17,300 braunauers , who have struggled with this burden of coincidence since 1945 .
they have lived with the stigma of coming from the same place as the man responsible for the murder of millions .
they know that it 's sometimes easier to tell people that they come from " near salzburg . "
while marktl likes to forget that the pope only lived there for two years and has no personal memories of his time there , braunauers take pains to point out that hitler left at around the same age .
a stone as tourist attraction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : braunau 's picturesque town square " believe me , i 'd much rather have the pope in braunau , " said klaus prexl , head of the local tourism office , who looks like one of the many tanned visitors who stop by on their bicycle tours through the region .
but prexl does n't have the catholic leader on offer and instead struggles to deal with continuing interest in hitler .
" every second or third guest asks about the house , " he said after one woman visiting from poland came in to find out how she could get to the building where the dictator was born .
like all the others , prexl sends her down the street , through the city tower , then it 'll come up on your left-hand side , watch out for the stone of admonition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stone 's still the only marker that hitler was born here " for peace , freedom and democracy , " reads the inscription on the stone , which comes from the nearby nazi concentration camp in mauthausen .
" never again fascism .
the millions of dead are a reminder . "
it 's the only reference to the fact that hitler was born here and , according to prexl , it 's not enough .
" i think it 's time for a documentation center , " said the 57-year-old .
" it exists in all the places where he committed crimes and we conceal it .
it 's been talked about forever , but there are local political influences that do n't want it . "
taking on responsibility far from it , countered gerhard skiba , braunau 's mayor since 1989 .
shortly after taking office , the self-declared socialist and member of austria 's social democratic party decided to place the stone in front of the house just in time for the 100th anniversary of hitler 's birthday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : braunau 's mayor gerhard skiba in his office " there were pretty serious protests , " skiba said , adding that he even received some death threats .
" people said : ' we do n't need that , the stone could be a target for attacks . " '
he also cleansed the town of hitler souvenirs such as beer mugs , ashtrays and wine bottles with the nazi leader 's image that were still sold at the time .
he hired streetworkers to deal with signs of right-wing extremism among teenagers and enthusiastically backed the placement of so-called stumbling stones that remember people killed by the nazis in front of the houses where they once lived .
two more of these will be placed on thursday .
skiba said he also wants to install a sign that identifies hitler 's birth house in front of the building in the very near future .
while the austrian government rents the landmarked structure , the owner has so far refused to agree to a plaque that 's directly attached to its walls .
ideal use of building the owners 's unwillingness to sell the house has also been one of the main reasons why a so-called house of responsibility has not been set up inside it , skiba said .
another reason is that the building is currently not open to the public as it is used by an organization called lebenshilfe , which offers people with mental and other disabilities a place to work .
" that 's an ideal use for the building , " skiba said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franciscan nuns recently named a park in braunau in jägerstetter 's honor while he said that he regrets that he failed to name a fountain , bridge or street after franz jägerstetter , who was murdered by the nazis for refusing to join the army , he will wholeheartedly back plans to transform hitler 's birthplace into a documentation center once it is no longer needed by its current tenants .
" among the things that i still want to do as mayor , this has top priority , " the 59-year-old said .
some , such as braunau 's catholic pastor , think that it might still take some time .
" i think it 's too fresh , " said 65-year-old stefan hofer , who has preached at st. stephan 's church , where hitler was baptized , for the past 34 years .
he added that braunau was currently taking responsibility via its days of contemporary history , which began in 1992 with a symposium called " undesired heritage " that looked at how cities such as braunau , auschwitz , vichy or stalin 's birthplace gori deal with their heritage .
waiting for the green light but the scientific adviser of that event said that mayor skiba just needs to give the political green light for the house of responsibility .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gifts made by mentally disabled people are currently sold inside the house " if he says yes , i 'll raise the money , " said andreas maislinger , a historian and political scientist , adding that the house should look at the past , present and future by giving visitors information about hitler and his crimes , offering space for organizations such as lebenshilfe and serving as a place that promotes intercultural understanding by inviting young chinese and japanese , indians and pakistanis , israelis and palestinians and others to get to know each other during a stay in braunau .
" we 're already doing that throughout the world , " said maislinger , who also founded an organization that offers young austrians an opportunity to complete their compulsory community service abroad .
" it 's all ready to go , " he said .
" i 'll start immediately when i get the go-ahead .

it was his last event on his personal six-day trip to his native bavaria homeland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many pilgrims spent the night at a field outside of regensburg for an outdoor mass on tuesday martina baumgarnter , a 22-year-old student from erding near munich , told ap news agency that the trip had shown her the warmer side of the 79-year-old former theologian who succeeded the charismatic john paul ii last year . " i had an image of him as being more distant than his predecessor , that has changed a lot , " baumgartner said . personal visit the visit is likely to be remembered as a sentimental stroll down memory lane in what the 79-year-old pope himself admitted may be his final major visit to his homeland . the emotional high point of the trip came on wednesday when the pontiff knelt in prayer at the graves of his mother , father and sister . the private prayers at the tiny ziegetsdorf cemetery outside the city of regensburg came on a day which the vatican said had been reserved for " private time " for the pope and his elder brother georg . following the 20-minute visit , the two brothers went the short distance to the house in the neighboring suburb of pentling , which the head of the roman catholic church has owned since he was a theology professor at regensburg university . pope focused on family in an earlier address , the pope had appealed for unity within the roman catholic church , where pressure groups have challenged his traditional views of marriage and the family . " just as in an organ an expert hand must constantly bring disharmony back to consonance , so we in the church ... always need to find anew , through our communion in faith , harmony in the praise of god and in fraternal love .

" " violence is incompatible with the nature of god and the nature of the soul , " the pope had said in a complex treatise on reason and faith . his comments drew criticism on wednesday from a leading muslim figure in italy .
ejaz ahmad , a member of an italian governmental consultative committee on islam , called on him to retract them . " the muslim world is currently undergoing a deep crisis and any attack from the west can aggravate this crisis , " ahmad was quoted as saying by italy 's ansa news agency .

the german leader said she again raised human rights issues with the chinese leader and urged beijing to respect the freedom of the press . " in our discussions , we touched on human rights issues and i made it clear that these rights are inalienable and should be respected everywhere , " merkel told reporters at a press conference with wen . she said she had singled out the freedom of the press and stressed that journalists should be allowed to carry out their work during the 2008 olympic games in beijing .
merkel alluded to new media rules announced on sunday that require foreign media to seek approval to distribute news , pictures and graphics within china . " i said clearly that on this occasion too , the freedom of the press will play an important role and that we should continue to discuss the matter , " merkel said . her remarks follow the recent jailing of two journalists in what observers describe as a clampdown on the media ahead of the games and the 17th communist party congress next year .
the chinese government recently sentenced new york times researcher zhao yan to three years in prison for fraud and singapore straits times correspondent ching cheong to five years for allegedly spying for taiwan . intellectual property rights another area that has rankled many western politicians and business leaders is intellectual property rights -lrb- ipr -rrb- and the piracy of films and cds .
german and chinese officials took limited action on thursday by signing an ipr accord . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pirate software cds are common in chinese street stalls under the agreement , german experts will help train chinese patent officials and a series of exchanges are to be arranged for personnel from both countries . " this will help ensure that there is more reliability for those who in invest in china , " said merkel at the press conference . for his part , wen hailed the growth of german-chinese economic ties and said he expected the overall trade volume between both nations to reach $ 80 billion dollars -lrb- 63 billion euros -rrb- , after climbing to 70 billion dollars last year . a rms embargo merkel and wen also discussed the topic of the eu 's arms embargo imposed against china in 1989 after the bloody crackdown on pro-democracy protests at tiananmen square .
merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder , had together with france led calls in 2004 to lift the embargo but this was strongly opposed by both the us and japan , which say a resumption of european weapons sales to beijing will worsen tensions between china and taiwan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the violent crackdown on protests at tiananmen square led to the embargo merkel has said she will not go down schröder 's path .
with germany holding the eu presidency during the first half of 2007 , she said " the arms embargo theme is currently not on the agenda . " lifting the embargo was a question of " mutual respect and equality " said wen , adding that he hoped eu countries would have " enough vision and foresight " to tackle the issue . dw staff -lrb- afp / dpa / jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de china clamps down on counterfeit world cup goods chinese authorities have seized thousands of counterfeit world cup products , just over two weeks before soccer 's biggest event kicks off in germany , state media reported this week .

while braunau will honor two nazi victims on thursday , the austrian town still lacks a place that deals with its most infamous son .
sixty years after the end of world war ii , some say it 's still too early . braunau is almost a town like many others on the austrian-bavarian border .
a church spire towers over the city and youngsters meet up at a fountain in the town square , which is lined with shops and cafés that are famous for their strudels .
bookstores have decorated their windows with the works of pope benedict xvi . , who was born just around the corner , in marktl .
the village lies almost exactly between germany 's most important place of pilgrimage , altötting , and braunau , where adolf hitler was born - between heaven and hell , as some said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : braunau sits across the river inn from the bavarian town of simbach it 's definitely not a label that pleases most of the 17,300 braunauers , who have struggled with this burden of coincidence since 1945 .
they have lived with the stigma of coming from the same place as the man responsible for the murder of millions .
they know that it 's sometimes easier to tell people that they come from " near salzburg . "
while marktl likes to forget that the pope only lived there for two years and has no personal memories of his time there , braunauers take pains to point out that hitler left at around the same age .
a stone as tourist attraction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : braunau 's picturesque town square " believe me , i 'd much rather have the pope in braunau , " said klaus prexl , head of the local tourism office , who looks like one of the many tanned visitors who stop by on their bicycle tours through the region .
but prexl does n't have the catholic leader on offer and instead struggles to deal with continuing interest in hitler .
" every second or third guest asks about the house , " he said after one woman visiting from poland came in to find out how she could get to the building where the dictator was born .
like all the others , prexl sends her down the street , through the city tower , then it 'll come up on your left-hand side , watch out for the stone of admonition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stone 's still the only marker that hitler was born here " for peace , freedom and democracy , " reads the inscription on the stone , which comes from the nearby nazi concentration camp in mauthausen .
" never again fascism .
the millions of dead are a reminder . "
it 's the only reference to the fact that hitler was born here and , according to prexl , it 's not enough .
" i think it 's time for a documentation center , " said the 57-year-old .
" it exists in all the places where he committed crimes and we conceal it .
it 's been talked about forever , but there are local political influences that do n't want it . "
taking on responsibility far from it , countered gerhard skiba , braunau 's mayor since 1989 .
shortly after taking office , the self-declared socialist and member of austria 's social democratic party decided to place the stone in front of the house just in time for the 100th anniversary of hitler 's birthday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : braunau 's mayor gerhard skiba in his office " there were pretty serious protests , " skiba said , adding that he even received some death threats .
" people said : ' we do n't need that , the stone could be a target for attacks . " '
he also cleansed the town of hitler souvenirs such as beer mugs , ashtrays and wine bottles with the nazi leader 's image that were still sold at the time .
he hired streetworkers to deal with signs of right-wing extremism among teenagers and enthusiastically backed the placement of so-called stumbling stones that remember people killed by the nazis in front of the houses where they once lived .
two more of these will be placed on thursday .
skiba said he also wants to install a sign that identifies hitler 's birth house in front of the building in the very near future .
while the austrian government rents the landmarked structure , the owner has so far refused to agree to a plaque that 's directly attached to its walls .
ideal use of building the owners 's unwillingness to sell the house has also been one of the main reasons why a so-called house of responsibility has not been set up inside it , skiba said .
another reason is that the building is currently not open to the public as it is used by an organization called lebenshilfe , which offers people with mental and other disabilities a place to work .
" that 's an ideal use for the building , " skiba said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franciscan nuns recently named a park in braunau in jägerstetter 's honor while he said that he regrets that he failed to name a fountain , bridge or street after franz jägerstetter , who was murdered by the nazis for refusing to join the army , he will wholeheartedly back plans to transform hitler 's birthplace into a documentation center once it is no longer needed by its current tenants .
" among the things that i still want to do as mayor , this has top priority , " the 59-year-old said .
some , such as braunau 's catholic pastor , think that it might still take some time .
" i think it 's too fresh , " said 65-year-old stefan hofer , who has preached at st. stephan 's church , where hitler was baptized , for the past 34 years .
he added that braunau was currently taking responsibility via its days of contemporary history , which began in 1992 with a symposium called " undesired heritage " that looked at how cities such as braunau , auschwitz , vichy or stalin 's birthplace gori deal with their heritage .
waiting for the green light but the scientific adviser of that event said that mayor skiba just needs to give the political green light for the house of responsibility .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gifts made by mentally disabled people are currently sold inside the house " if he says yes , i 'll raise the money , " said andreas maislinger , a historian and political scientist , adding that the house should look at the past , present and future by giving visitors information about hitler and his crimes , offering space for organizations such as lebenshilfe and serving as a place that promotes intercultural understanding by inviting young chinese and japanese , indians and pakistanis , israelis and palestinians and others to get to know each other during a stay in braunau .
" we 're already doing that throughout the world , " said maislinger , who also founded an organization that offers young austrians an opportunity to complete their compulsory community service abroad .
" it 's all ready to go , " he said .
" i 'll start immediately when i get the go-ahead .

but going there is easier than coming back , according to deutsche welle 's nina werkhäuser . it was a decision with " historical dimensions " for germany .
those were the words chancellor angela merkel used to describe the cabinet 's consent to send naval units to the middle east .
indeed , it is a historical decision to send armed german soldiers to the mideast .
for the last 60 years , such a mission would have been unthinkable because it was thought , for understandable historical reasons , that there should be as great a distance as possible between german troops and israel . that such a german foreign policy taboo could be broken may be astonishing .
but de facto , berlin had no other choice .
if germany had withdrawn from the mission , it would have laid the credibility of its foreign policy on the line and would have made berlin 's attempts to stabilize the situation in the mideast in the past few weeks seem absurd . israel explicitly wished for the bundeswehr 's participation .
that was not only the most important condition , it was an obligation .
without israel 's endorsement , angela merkel 's cabinet never would have approved of the mission . nevertheless , there is still a clearly defined line on the ground that the german government has decided not to cross : there will be no ground troops in the middle east .
other countries in the unifil mission should and will take over this responsibility .
they will have the difficult task of working together with the lebanese army to keep hezbollah in check .
how that should be done is still not clear , however . losing focus of peacekeeping mission purposes berlin is steering clear of that dilemma and is concentrating on its naval mission , which is supposed to hinder the delivery of arms via the sea to hezbollah militants .
it is difficult to say at this moment how effective that will be . germany will lead a european naval flotilla that has been granted a robust mandate ; it can stop and search incoming ships by force , if necessary .
despite the potential danger , the risk remains calculable .
yet only with this mandate will the parliament approve this week 's cabinet decision , when it comes up for a vote next week . that support nevertheless is guaranteed .
the vote will then turn the bundeswehr into an army that knows no borders .
but germany is paying a high price for this move , particularly when the choice of peacekeeping missions has become a bit random in nature .
the interests in the middle east are understandable .
but is a peacekeeping operation in the democratic republic of congo really necessary ? the large new mission in the middle east with up to 2,400 soldiers could , like the operations in kosovo and afghanistan , last for years .
and there is no guarantee for success .
such questions should make the german government clearly formulate its security policies .
this mission provides the opportunity to develop a definite exit strategy .

but going there is easier than coming back , according to deutsche welle 's nina werkhäuser . it was a decision with " historical dimensions " for germany .
those were the words chancellor angela merkel used to describe the cabinet 's consent to send naval units to the middle east .
indeed , it is a historical decision to send armed german soldiers to the mideast .
for the last 60 years , such a mission would have been unthinkable because it was thought , for understandable historical reasons , that there should be as great a distance as possible between german troops and israel . that such a german foreign policy taboo could be broken may be astonishing .
but de facto , berlin had no other choice .
if germany had withdrawn from the mission , it would have laid the credibility of its foreign policy on the line and would have made berlin 's attempts to stabilize the situation in the mideast in the past few weeks seem absurd . israel explicitly wished for the bundeswehr 's participation .
that was not only the most important condition , it was an obligation .
without israel 's endorsement , angela merkel 's cabinet never would have approved of the mission . nevertheless , there is still a clearly defined line on the ground that the german government has decided not to cross : there will be no ground troops in the middle east .
other countries in the unifil mission should and will take over this responsibility .
they will have the difficult task of working together with the lebanese army to keep hezbollah in check .
how that should be done is still not clear , however . losing focus of peacekeeping mission purposes berlin is steering clear of that dilemma and is concentrating on its naval mission , which is supposed to hinder the delivery of arms via the sea to hezbollah militants .
it is difficult to say at this moment how effective that will be . germany will lead a european naval flotilla that has been granted a robust mandate ; it can stop and search incoming ships by force , if necessary .
despite the potential danger , the risk remains calculable .
yet only with this mandate will the parliament approve this week 's cabinet decision , when it comes up for a vote next week . that support nevertheless is guaranteed .
the vote will then turn the bundeswehr into an army that knows no borders .
but germany is paying a high price for this move , particularly when the choice of peacekeeping missions has become a bit random in nature .
the interests in the middle east are understandable .
but is a peacekeeping operation in the democratic republic of congo really necessary ? the large new mission in the middle east with up to 2,400 soldiers could , like the operations in kosovo and afghanistan , last for years .
and there is no guarantee for success .

the german leader said she again raised human rights issues with the chinese leader and urged beijing to respect the freedom of the press . " in our discussions , we touched on human rights issues and i made it clear that these rights are inalienable and should be respected everywhere , " merkel told reporters at a press conference with wen . she said she had singled out the freedom of the press and stressed that journalists should be allowed to carry out their work during the 2008 olympic games in beijing .
merkel alluded to new media rules announced on sunday that require foreign media to seek approval to distribute news , pictures and graphics within china . " i said clearly that on this occasion too , the freedom of the press will play an important role and that we should continue to discuss the matter , " merkel said . her remarks follow the recent jailing of two journalists in what observers describe as a clampdown on the media ahead of the games and the 17th communist party congress next year .
the chinese government recently sentenced new york times researcher zhao yan to three years in prison for fraud and singapore straits times correspondent ching cheong to five years for allegedly spying for taiwan . intellectual property rights another area that has rankled many western politicians and business leaders is intellectual property rights -lrb- ipr -rrb- and the piracy of films and cds .

merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder , had together with france led calls in 2004 to lift the embargo but this was strongly opposed by both the us and japan , which say a resumption of european weapons sales to beijing will worsen tensions between china and taiwan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the violent crackdown on protests at tiananmen square led to the embargo merkel has said she will not go down schröder 's path .
with germany holding the eu presidency during the first half of 2007 , she said " the arms embargo theme is currently not on the agenda .

during a video conference with other coaches , he dropped a hint that he may be back soon . once a soccer player gets a taste of coaching , it can be difficult for him to leave it behind .
when jürgen klinsmann resigned this summer as germany 's head coach after a better-than-expected third-place performance , speculation immediately started that he would take a seat on a bench somewhere else . two months after the end of the world cup , he has made his first public appearance during a video conference at the end of a meeting of world cup managers organized by fifa in berlin and alluded to his desires none too clearly . " who knows , perhaps i 'll be a coach once again at the 2010 world cup -lrb- in south africa -rrb- , " he said . klinsmann , calling in to the conference from his home in california , still enjoys " taking -lrb- his -rrb- kids to school , " something he has more than ample time to do , having retired four days after guiding germany into third at this year 's world cup finals . coach for usa ?
or possibly an african country ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coaching a striker like ivory coast 's didier drogba could be enticing klinsmann 's logical new employer would be the united states soccer federation , which separated paths from bruce arena who had coached the american men 's team for eight years .
it would also be sensible for him considering that the team has its training quarters in southern california . klinsmann has consistently denied the connection with the us team and theo zwanziger , the newly elected president of the german football federation , raised another possible scenario for the 42-year-old who has always had a penchant for travel . zwanziger suggested recently that klinsmann " might take charge of a team in africa . " coaching just any old team on the sometimes times chaotic african continent , however , would be a risky undertaking considering that only the hosts south africa have a guaranteed ticket to the finals in four years .
at the 2006 tournament , all four sub-saharan teams - ivory coast , angola , ghana and togo - made their debuts , knocking out regular african favorites like cameroon , nigeria and south africa during qualifications . for the time being , klinsmann can continue to take his kids to school , and savor the fact that , as he said at the conference , " germany practically rediscovered itself " at the world cup this summer . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de coach klinsmann calls it quits in germany days after leading germany to third place in the 2006 world cup with a young team he personally put together , coach jürgen klinsmann has decided to step down .

he says both need to come down from the sky and take a look at the reality on the ground . dw-world.de : what did you think of pope benedict 's visit ? hans küng : i think many people here in germany have an ambivalent impression .
benedict has a very nice personality ; he 's shown himself as a very friendly person .
he 's also not a media pope like his predecessor .
he 's not an actor who is looking for applause . he concentrates on the central truths of christianity and faith in god .
on the other hand , he did n't accomplish any of the reforms to the catholic church that some people were looking for . which reforms ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : küng compared the pope to another leader , george w. bush there are a great many things .
if you take the situation around munich , a lot of parishes are without priests .
and just having a lot of people in the seats does n't mean that they are all believers . of course everybody finds it a very stimulating event to see the pope up close and lots of people are looking for a spiritual father and a more credible representative of moral integrity , justice and peace than many politicians today . but there were fewer people at the liturgy than had been expected .
we should not think that all those who were coming to see a star are now convinced and faithful catholic believers . why do n't you think that the great wave of enthusiasm that greeted the pope could have a vitalizing effect on the church ? it would be great if it had consistent consequences .
it is not enough to preach and have a big event .
the most recent public opinion poll by mckinsey asked whether the catholic church should be reformed and 43 percent said yes .
this is 40 percent more than before . in the same poll , 45 percent - nearly half of all germans - said they have no confidence in the catholic church as an institution . the people in munich were very happy - they have a german pope , a bavarian pope .
it the event had been held in magdeburg , in a new german state , where only 8 percent are registered as christians , we would have had a different image of germany . what do you think about the pope 's comments on the unity of the church ?
do you think he could influence more cooperation between the catholics and the protestants ? of course he could .
i was very pleased that the german president , horst köhler , who is a member of the global ethic foundation , said when the pope arrived : " in the name of many christians in this country , more ecumenical progress . "
and the pope answered in a very convincing way .
he said he would do everything to bring catholic and protestants together . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope blessed the organ but overlooked deeper issues , said küng afterwards , when he met with other christians all the controversial issues between catholics and protestants were just ignored .
most people here in germany would have to have a common eucharist , the acknowledgement of the ministers of the protestant churches .
they would have a solution for marriages from different churches , and of course the problem of papal jurisdiction and infallibility .
all this was practically ignored .
even the representatives of the protestant churches did n't have the courage to mention it . do you feel that the changes you 've mentioned , including unity among christians , will be possible during the tenure of the current pope ? i had a long conversation with him , which i 'm very grateful for .
i still hope that he will finally see that he can not only talk - he must finally take some action .
and i still hope that , after a certain time of reflection , he will do something . sometimes i have the impression he 's like president bush , who takes his air force one jet and flies over new orleans just to see how the situation is .
but finally he had to come down to the ground to see what the reality is . the diocese in regensburg , where the pope was , is probably the most divided diocese in germany .
the bishop of regensburg replaced practically all the elected members of the diocesan council in an authoritarian way with like-minded people .
and people could not understand why the pope just made comments about the organ in the regensburg church in the presence of this bishop . hans küng was professor of ecumenical theology and director of the institute for ecumenical research at the university of tübingen from 1960 until his retirement in 1996 .
he also served as official theological consultant to the second vatican council appointed by pope john xxiii .
küng has published numerous books on christianity , the catholic church and ethics . rob turner interviewed hans küng -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope urges faithful to stand up for beliefs against " fanaticism " pope benedict xvi urged pilgrims at a giant open-air mass in regensburg to stand up for their beliefs in the face of the " hatred and fanaticism " tarnishing religion .

he says both need to come down from the sky and take a look at the reality on the ground . dw-world.de : what did you think of pope benedict 's visit ? hans küng : i think many people here in germany have an ambivalent impression .
benedict has a very nice personality ; he 's shown himself as a very friendly person .
he 's also not a media pope like his predecessor .
he 's not an actor who is looking for applause . he concentrates on the central truths of christianity and faith in god .
on the other hand , he did n't accomplish any of the reforms to the catholic church that some people were looking for . which reforms ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : küng compared the pope to another leader , george w. bush there are a great many things .
if you take the situation around munich , a lot of parishes are without priests .
and just having a lot of people in the seats does n't mean that they are all believers . of course everybody finds it a very stimulating event to see the pope up close and lots of people are looking for a spiritual father and a more credible representative of moral integrity , justice and peace than many politicians today . but there were fewer people at the liturgy than had been expected .
we should not think that all those who were coming to see a star are now convinced and faithful catholic believers . why do n't you think that the great wave of enthusiasm that greeted the pope could have a vitalizing effect on the church ? it would be great if it had consistent consequences .
it is not enough to preach and have a big event .
the most recent public opinion poll by mckinsey asked whether the catholic church should be reformed and 43 percent said yes .
this is 40 percent more than before . in the same poll , 45 percent - nearly half of all germans - said they have no confidence in the catholic church as an institution . the people in munich were very happy - they have a german pope , a bavarian pope .
it the event had been held in magdeburg , in a new german state , where only 8 percent are registered as christians , we would have had a different image of germany . what do you think about the pope 's comments on the unity of the church ?
do you think he could influence more cooperation between the catholics and the protestants ? of course he could .
i was very pleased that the german president , horst köhler , who is a member of the global ethic foundation , said when the pope arrived : " in the name of many christians in this country , more ecumenical progress . "
and the pope answered in a very convincing way .
he said he would do everything to bring catholic and protestants together . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope blessed the organ but overlooked deeper issues , said küng afterwards , when he met with other christians all the controversial issues between catholics and protestants were just ignored .
most people here in germany would have to have a common eucharist , the acknowledgement of the ministers of the protestant churches .
they would have a solution for marriages from different churches , and of course the problem of papal jurisdiction and infallibility .
all this was practically ignored .
even the representatives of the protestant churches did n't have the courage to mention it . do you feel that the changes you 've mentioned , including unity among christians , will be possible during the tenure of the current pope ? i had a long conversation with him , which i 'm very grateful for .
i still hope that he will finally see that he can not only talk - he must finally take some action .
and i still hope that , after a certain time of reflection , he will do something . sometimes i have the impression he 's like president bush , who takes his air force one jet and flies over new orleans just to see how the situation is .
but finally he had to come down to the ground to see what the reality is . the diocese in regensburg , where the pope was , is probably the most divided diocese in germany .
the bishop of regensburg replaced practically all the elected members of the diocesan council in an authoritarian way with like-minded people .
and people could not understand why the pope just made comments about the organ in the regensburg church in the presence of this bishop . hans küng was professor of ecumenical theology and director of the institute for ecumenical research at the university of tübingen from 1960 until his retirement in 1996 .
he also served as official theological consultant to the second vatican council appointed by pope john xxiii .

benedict has a very nice personality ; he 's shown himself as a very friendly person .
he 's also not a media pope like his predecessor .
he 's not an actor who is looking for applause . he concentrates on the central truths of christianity and faith in god .

if you take the situation around munich , a lot of parishes are without priests .
and just having a lot of people in the seats does n't mean that they are all believers . of course everybody finds it a very stimulating event to see the pope up close and lots of people are looking for a spiritual father and a more credible representative of moral integrity , justice and peace than many politicians today . but there were fewer people at the liturgy than had been expected .
we should not think that all those who were coming to see a star are now convinced and faithful catholic believers . why do n't you think that the great wave of enthusiasm that greeted the pope could have a vitalizing effect on the church ? it would be great if it had consistent consequences .
it is not enough to preach and have a big event .
the most recent public opinion poll by mckinsey asked whether the catholic church should be reformed and 43 percent said yes .
this is 40 percent more than before . in the same poll , 45 percent - nearly half of all germans - said they have no confidence in the catholic church as an institution . the people in munich were very happy - they have a german pope , a bavarian pope .
it the event had been held in magdeburg , in a new german state , where only 8 percent are registered as christians , we would have had a different image of germany . what do you think about the pope 's comments on the unity of the church ?
do you think he could influence more cooperation between the catholics and the protestants ? of course he could .
i was very pleased that the german president , horst köhler , who is a member of the global ethic foundation , said when the pope arrived : " in the name of many christians in this country , more ecumenical progress . "
and the pope answered in a very convincing way .
he said he would do everything to bring catholic and protestants together . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope blessed the organ but overlooked deeper issues , said küng afterwards , when he met with other christians all the controversial issues between catholics and protestants were just ignored .
most people here in germany would have to have a common eucharist , the acknowledgement of the ministers of the protestant churches .
they would have a solution for marriages from different churches , and of course the problem of papal jurisdiction and infallibility .
all this was practically ignored .
even the representatives of the protestant churches did n't have the courage to mention it . do you feel that the changes you 've mentioned , including unity among christians , will be possible during the tenure of the current pope ? i had a long conversation with him , which i 'm very grateful for .
i still hope that he will finally see that he can not only talk - he must finally take some action .
and i still hope that , after a certain time of reflection , he will do something . sometimes i have the impression he 's like president bush , who takes his air force one jet and flies over new orleans just to see how the situation is .
but finally he had to come down to the ground to see what the reality is . the diocese in regensburg , where the pope was , is probably the most divided diocese in germany .
the bishop of regensburg replaced practically all the elected members of the diocesan council in an authoritarian way with like-minded people .
and people could not understand why the pope just made comments about the organ in the regensburg church in the presence of this bishop . hans küng was professor of ecumenical theology and director of the institute for ecumenical research at the university of tübingen from 1960 until his retirement in 1996 .

while braunau will honor two nazi victims on thursday , the austrian town still lacks a place that deals with its most infamous son .
sixty years after the end of world war ii , some say it 's still too early . braunau is almost a town like many others on the austrian-bavarian border .
a church spire towers over the city and youngsters meet up at a fountain in the town square , which is lined with shops and cafés that are famous for their strudels .
bookstores have decorated their windows with the works of pope benedict xvi . , who was born just around the corner , in marktl .
the village lies almost exactly between germany 's most important place of pilgrimage , altötting , and braunau , where adolf hitler was born - between heaven and hell , as some said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : braunau sits across the river inn from the bavarian town of simbach it 's definitely not a label that pleases most of the 17,300 braunauers , who have struggled with this burden of coincidence since 1945 .
they have lived with the stigma of coming from the same place as the man responsible for the murder of millions .
they know that it 's sometimes easier to tell people that they come from " near salzburg . "
while marktl likes to forget that the pope only lived there for two years and has no personal memories of his time there , braunauers take pains to point out that hitler left at around the same age .
a stone as tourist attraction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : braunau 's picturesque town square " believe me , i 'd much rather have the pope in braunau , " said klaus prexl , head of the local tourism office , who looks like one of the many tanned visitors who stop by on their bicycle tours through the region .
but prexl does n't have the catholic leader on offer and instead struggles to deal with continuing interest in hitler .
" every second or third guest asks about the house , " he said after one woman visiting from poland came in to find out how she could get to the building where the dictator was born .
like all the others , prexl sends her down the street , through the city tower , then it 'll come up on your left-hand side , watch out for the stone of admonition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stone 's still the only marker that hitler was born here " for peace , freedom and democracy , " reads the inscription on the stone , which comes from the nearby nazi concentration camp in mauthausen .
" never again fascism .
the millions of dead are a reminder . "
it 's the only reference to the fact that hitler was born here and , according to prexl , it 's not enough .
" i think it 's time for a documentation center , " said the 57-year-old .
" it exists in all the places where he committed crimes and we conceal it .
it 's been talked about forever , but there are local political influences that do n't want it . "
taking on responsibility far from it , countered gerhard skiba , braunau 's mayor since 1989 .
shortly after taking office , the self-declared socialist and member of austria 's social democratic party decided to place the stone in front of the house just in time for the 100th anniversary of hitler 's birthday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : braunau 's mayor gerhard skiba in his office " there were pretty serious protests , " skiba said , adding that he even received some death threats .
" people said : ' we do n't need that , the stone could be a target for attacks . " '
he also cleansed the town of hitler souvenirs such as beer mugs , ashtrays and wine bottles with the nazi leader 's image that were still sold at the time .
he hired streetworkers to deal with signs of right-wing extremism among teenagers and enthusiastically backed the placement of so-called stumbling stones that remember people killed by the nazis in front of the houses where they once lived .
two more of these will be placed on thursday .
skiba said he also wants to install a sign that identifies hitler 's birth house in front of the building in the very near future .
while the austrian government rents the landmarked structure , the owner has so far refused to agree to a plaque that 's directly attached to its walls .
ideal use of building the owners 's unwillingness to sell the house has also been one of the main reasons why a so-called house of responsibility has not been set up inside it , skiba said .
another reason is that the building is currently not open to the public as it is used by an organization called lebenshilfe , which offers people with mental and other disabilities a place to work .
" that 's an ideal use for the building , " skiba said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franciscan nuns recently named a park in braunau in jägerstetter 's honor while he said that he regrets that he failed to name a fountain , bridge or street after franz jägerstetter , who was murdered by the nazis for refusing to join the army , he will wholeheartedly back plans to transform hitler 's birthplace into a documentation center once it is no longer needed by its current tenants .
" among the things that i still want to do as mayor , this has top priority , " the 59-year-old said .
some , such as braunau 's catholic pastor , think that it might still take some time .
" i think it 's too fresh , " said 65-year-old stefan hofer , who has preached at st. stephan 's church , where hitler was baptized , for the past 34 years .
he added that braunau was currently taking responsibility via its days of contemporary history , which began in 1992 with a symposium called " undesired heritage " that looked at how cities such as braunau , auschwitz , vichy or stalin 's birthplace gori deal with their heritage .
waiting for the green light but the scientific adviser of that event said that mayor skiba just needs to give the political green light for the house of responsibility .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gifts made by mentally disabled people are currently sold inside the house " if he says yes , i 'll raise the money , " said andreas maislinger , a historian and political scientist , adding that the house should look at the past , present and future by giving visitors information about hitler and his crimes , offering space for organizations such as lebenshilfe and serving as a place that promotes intercultural understanding by inviting young chinese and japanese , indians and pakistanis , israelis and palestinians and others to get to know each other during a stay in braunau .
" we 're already doing that throughout the world , " said maislinger , who also founded an organization that offers young austrians an opportunity to complete their compulsory community service abroad .

europe 's largest economy has been resilient in spite of high oil prices , but the imf says hazards still lurk . germany 's stock market has been booming for more than three years .
the country 's companies have been enjoying better than average profits during that time .
now , it is starting to pay dividends and the international monetary fund , in its twice-yearly assessment of the global economy , has raised its 2006 economic growth forecasts for germany to 2 percent from its prediction of 1.3 percent in the spring . at its meeting in singapore , the imf 's chief economist raghuram rajan praised europe 's largest economy , saying " it was on a roll . " but berlin 's measures to lower spending , such as merging unemployment and welfare benefits were not having as much as an effect that had been expected , rajan said .
he suggested lowering income taxes to help spur private consumption , recommending more flexibility in the labor market and increased competition in the banking and utilities sectors . adding more kick to the economy , rajan said , alluding to reforms , would not necessarily mean lower incomes or the end of germany 's welfare state . europe should take advantage of growth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eurozone is expected to grow 2.4 percent the imf is not alone in its optimism regards germany .
the eu commission projects growth of 2.2 percent .
only berlin , possibly stung by overly rosy forecasts that went unmet in the recent past , sees more modest growth at 1.6 percent for the current year . a scheduled increase of germany 's value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- as of january will boost private spending until the end of this year .
after that , the imf expects growth to stagnate to 1.3 percent . the economy in the euro zone is experiencing growth not seen since the dot.com days , expected to hit 2.4 percent .
rajan views the stronger developments as an opportunity to pare down public deficits , in line with the eu 's stability and growth pact target to hold such shortfalls to 3.0 percent or less of total output .
as for germany , he echoed his calls for reforms to europe . " europe 's leaders need to find the will to take on vested interests in both labor and in the corporate sector , " said rajan .
" this necessary but difficult domestic battle is constantly postponed until after the next election , " he added . balancing inflation and interest rates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high oil prices will continue to threaten world economies rising oil prices have yet had a great effect on consumer prices but with a barrel of crude expected to hover around or above the $ 70 per barrel mark , inflation is a concern central banks around the world must face . the imf found that with euro zone inflation running " below but close to " the european central bank 's -lrb- ecb -rrb- 2.0 percent objective , " further interest rate increases will likely be needed to maintain price stability over the medium term if the expansion develops as expected . " the ecb since december has raised its benchmark rate four times , taking it from 2.0 to 3.0 percent , and has made clear it intends to carry on with monetary tightening .
but the imf cautioned : " with underlying inflationary pressures still well contained ... policymakers can afford to be cautious in tightening the monetary policy stance , all the more so given the risk of euro appreciation and weaker growth in the united states .

while braunau will honor two nazi victims on thursday , the austrian town still lacks a place that deals with its most infamous son .
sixty years after the end of world war ii , some say it 's still too early . braunau is almost a town like many others on the austrian-bavarian border .
a church spire towers over the city and youngsters meet up at a fountain in the town square , which is lined with shops and cafés that are famous for their strudels .
bookstores have decorated their windows with the works of pope benedict xvi . , who was born just around the corner , in marktl .
the village lies almost exactly between germany 's most important place of pilgrimage , altötting , and braunau , where adolf hitler was born - between heaven and hell , as some said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : braunau sits across the river inn from the bavarian town of simbach it 's definitely not a label that pleases most of the 17,300 braunauers , who have struggled with this burden of coincidence since 1945 .
they have lived with the stigma of coming from the same place as the man responsible for the murder of millions .
they know that it 's sometimes easier to tell people that they come from " near salzburg . "
while marktl likes to forget that the pope only lived there for two years and has no personal memories of his time there , braunauers take pains to point out that hitler left at around the same age .
a stone as tourist attraction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : braunau 's picturesque town square " believe me , i 'd much rather have the pope in braunau , " said klaus prexl , head of the local tourism office , who looks like one of the many tanned visitors who stop by on their bicycle tours through the region .
but prexl does n't have the catholic leader on offer and instead struggles to deal with continuing interest in hitler .
" every second or third guest asks about the house , " he said after one woman visiting from poland came in to find out how she could get to the building where the dictator was born .
like all the others , prexl sends her down the street , through the city tower , then it 'll come up on your left-hand side , watch out for the stone of admonition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stone 's still the only marker that hitler was born here " for peace , freedom and democracy , " reads the inscription on the stone , which comes from the nearby nazi concentration camp in mauthausen .
" never again fascism .
the millions of dead are a reminder . "
it 's the only reference to the fact that hitler was born here and , according to prexl , it 's not enough .
" i think it 's time for a documentation center , " said the 57-year-old .
" it exists in all the places where he committed crimes and we conceal it .
it 's been talked about forever , but there are local political influences that do n't want it . "
taking on responsibility far from it , countered gerhard skiba , braunau 's mayor since 1989 .
shortly after taking office , the self-declared socialist and member of austria 's social democratic party decided to place the stone in front of the house just in time for the 100th anniversary of hitler 's birthday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : braunau 's mayor gerhard skiba in his office " there were pretty serious protests , " skiba said , adding that he even received some death threats .
" people said : ' we do n't need that , the stone could be a target for attacks . " '
he also cleansed the town of hitler souvenirs such as beer mugs , ashtrays and wine bottles with the nazi leader 's image that were still sold at the time .
he hired streetworkers to deal with signs of right-wing extremism among teenagers and enthusiastically backed the placement of so-called stumbling stones that remember people killed by the nazis in front of the houses where they once lived .
two more of these will be placed on thursday .
skiba said he also wants to install a sign that identifies hitler 's birth house in front of the building in the very near future .
while the austrian government rents the landmarked structure , the owner has so far refused to agree to a plaque that 's directly attached to its walls .
ideal use of building the owners 's unwillingness to sell the house has also been one of the main reasons why a so-called house of responsibility has not been set up inside it , skiba said .
another reason is that the building is currently not open to the public as it is used by an organization called lebenshilfe , which offers people with mental and other disabilities a place to work .
" that 's an ideal use for the building , " skiba said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franciscan nuns recently named a park in braunau in jägerstetter 's honor while he said that he regrets that he failed to name a fountain , bridge or street after franz jägerstetter , who was murdered by the nazis for refusing to join the army , he will wholeheartedly back plans to transform hitler 's birthplace into a documentation center once it is no longer needed by its current tenants .
" among the things that i still want to do as mayor , this has top priority , " the 59-year-old said .
some , such as braunau 's catholic pastor , think that it might still take some time .
" i think it 's too fresh , " said 65-year-old stefan hofer , who has preached at st. stephan 's church , where hitler was baptized , for the past 34 years .
he added that braunau was currently taking responsibility via its days of contemporary history , which began in 1992 with a symposium called " undesired heritage " that looked at how cities such as braunau , auschwitz , vichy or stalin 's birthplace gori deal with their heritage .
waiting for the green light but the scientific adviser of that event said that mayor skiba just needs to give the political green light for the house of responsibility .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gifts made by mentally disabled people are currently sold inside the house " if he says yes , i 'll raise the money , " said andreas maislinger , a historian and political scientist , adding that the house should look at the past , present and future by giving visitors information about hitler and his crimes , offering space for organizations such as lebenshilfe and serving as a place that promotes intercultural understanding by inviting young chinese and japanese , indians and pakistanis , israelis and palestinians and others to get to know each other during a stay in braunau .
" we 're already doing that throughout the world , " said maislinger , who also founded an organization that offers young austrians an opportunity to complete their compulsory community service abroad .

shortly after taking office , the self-declared socialist and member of austria 's social democratic party decided to place the stone in front of the house just in time for the 100th anniversary of hitler 's birthday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : braunau 's mayor gerhard skiba in his office " there were pretty serious protests , " skiba said , adding that he even received some death threats .
" people said : ' we do n't need that , the stone could be a target for attacks . " '
he also cleansed the town of hitler souvenirs such as beer mugs , ashtrays and wine bottles with the nazi leader 's image that were still sold at the time .
he hired streetworkers to deal with signs of right-wing extremism among teenagers and enthusiastically backed the placement of so-called stumbling stones that remember people killed by the nazis in front of the houses where they once lived .
two more of these will be placed on thursday .
skiba said he also wants to install a sign that identifies hitler 's birth house in front of the building in the very near future .
while the austrian government rents the landmarked structure , the owner has so far refused to agree to a plaque that 's directly attached to its walls .
ideal use of building the owners 's unwillingness to sell the house has also been one of the main reasons why a so-called house of responsibility has not been set up inside it , skiba said .
another reason is that the building is currently not open to the public as it is used by an organization called lebenshilfe , which offers people with mental and other disabilities a place to work .

while braunau will honor two nazi victims on thursday , the austrian town still lacks a place that deals with its most infamous son .
sixty years after the end of world war ii , some say it 's still too early . braunau is almost a town like many others on the austrian-bavarian border .
a church spire towers over the city and youngsters meet up at a fountain in the town square , which is lined with shops and cafés that are famous for their strudels .
bookstores have decorated their windows with the works of pope benedict xvi . , who was born just around the corner , in marktl .
the village lies almost exactly between germany 's most important place of pilgrimage , altötting , and braunau , where adolf hitler was born - between heaven and hell , as some said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : braunau sits across the river inn from the bavarian town of simbach it 's definitely not a label that pleases most of the 17,300 braunauers , who have struggled with this burden of coincidence since 1945 .
they have lived with the stigma of coming from the same place as the man responsible for the murder of millions .
they know that it 's sometimes easier to tell people that they come from " near salzburg . "
while marktl likes to forget that the pope only lived there for two years and has no personal memories of his time there , braunauers take pains to point out that hitler left at around the same age .

but going there is easier than coming back , according to deutsche welle 's nina werkhäuser . it was a decision with " historical dimensions " for germany .
those were the words chancellor angela merkel used to describe the cabinet 's consent to send naval units to the middle east .
indeed , it is a historical decision to send armed german soldiers to the mideast .
for the last 60 years , such a mission would have been unthinkable because it was thought , for understandable historical reasons , that there should be as great a distance as possible between german troops and israel . that such a german foreign policy taboo could be broken may be astonishing .
but de facto , berlin had no other choice .
if germany had withdrawn from the mission , it would have laid the credibility of its foreign policy on the line and would have made berlin 's attempts to stabilize the situation in the mideast in the past few weeks seem absurd . israel explicitly wished for the bundeswehr 's participation .
that was not only the most important condition , it was an obligation .
without israel 's endorsement , angela merkel 's cabinet never would have approved of the mission . nevertheless , there is still a clearly defined line on the ground that the german government has decided not to cross : there will be no ground troops in the middle east .
other countries in the unifil mission should and will take over this responsibility .
they will have the difficult task of working together with the lebanese army to keep hezbollah in check .
how that should be done is still not clear , however . losing focus of peacekeeping mission purposes berlin is steering clear of that dilemma and is concentrating on its naval mission , which is supposed to hinder the delivery of arms via the sea to hezbollah militants .
it is difficult to say at this moment how effective that will be . germany will lead a european naval flotilla that has been granted a robust mandate ; it can stop and search incoming ships by force , if necessary .
despite the potential danger , the risk remains calculable .
yet only with this mandate will the parliament approve this week 's cabinet decision , when it comes up for a vote next week . that support nevertheless is guaranteed .
the vote will then turn the bundeswehr into an army that knows no borders .
but germany is paying a high price for this move , particularly when the choice of peacekeeping missions has become a bit random in nature .
the interests in the middle east are understandable .
but is a peacekeeping operation in the democratic republic of congo really necessary ? the large new mission in the middle east with up to 2,400 soldiers could , like the operations in kosovo and afghanistan , last for years .
and there is no guarantee for success .
such questions should make the german government clearly formulate its security policies .
this mission provides the opportunity to develop a definite exit strategy .
there is still time to do this . nina werkhäuser is dw radio 's correspondent to the german parliament in berlin . -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cabinet gives green light to lebanon mission germany 's cabinet authorized the deployment of ships to the middle east as part of the un force in lebanon .

despite positive comments , solutions remained distant . a senior iranian envoy on thursday called contacts between tehran and the european union a " step in the right direction " in resolving the standoff over his country 's refusal to freeze uranium enrichment , but he accused the us of trying to sabotage the talks . ali ashgar soltanieh spoke as senior eu and iranian representatives met in a new round of negotiations on nuclear differences between tehran and the international community . that meeting , originally scheduled for paris , was moved in the last minute to geneva for " logistical reasons , " eu spokeswoman cristina gallach said , without elaboration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diplomatic talks are still continuing despite little progress only " the continuation of dialogue and negotiations free from any kind of threat , pressure or any preconditions can pave the way " to a negotiated solution of the impasse , soltanieh told a meeting of the international atomic energy agency 's 35-nation board shortly before the end of the four-day conference . us push for sanctions the meeting planned for thursday in paris between eu foreign policy chief javier solana and iran 's top nuclear negotiator ali larijani was postponed on short notice with no reason given . solana is negotiating with the iranians in the name of six major powers - the five permanent un security council members and germany - to encourage tehran to accept political and economic incentives to suspend uranium enrichment . the six powers , notably the us , fear iran is trying to develop nuclear weapons , a charge which tehran rejects saying it has only a civil nuclear power program . the us is pushing for un sanctions against iran for failing to honor an aug .

" on tuesday , the six nations failed to agree on a joint statement on iran at the iaea meeting due to the us call for sanctions and hesitance by russia and china to use that word , a western diplomat told news agencies . ' poisoned ' negotiations ? on thursday , an iranian official accused the us of " poisoning " the course of nuclear negotiations , the news agency isna reported . " the us intends to poison the course of the negotiations through constant antagonism , although iran has constantly stressed negotiations for realizing its nuclear rights , " foreign ministry spokesman mohammad-ali hosseini told dpa news service . comments in dakar iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad said thursday during a visit to dakar that iran would support unconditional talks on the nuclear dispute and that the issue could be settled as long as internationally-acknowledged laws were taken into consideration - a reference to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , which iran has signed . ahmadinejad will later this month travel to new york for the 61st session of the un general assembly , where he will once again challenge his american counterpart george w. bush to a television debate on both the nuclear dispute and the middle east conflict . dw staff -lrb- rar / jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sanctions against iran could cost 10,000 german jobs as world powers gear up for a new round of diplomacy to respond to iran 's refusal to halt uranium enrichment , germany 's main trade group said the country could lose 10,000 jobs if tehran is slapped with sanctions .

despite positive comments , solutions remained distant . a senior iranian envoy on thursday called contacts between tehran and the european union a " step in the right direction " in resolving the standoff over his country 's refusal to freeze uranium enrichment , but he accused the us of trying to sabotage the talks . ali ashgar soltanieh spoke as senior eu and iranian representatives met in a new round of negotiations on nuclear differences between tehran and the international community . that meeting , originally scheduled for paris , was moved in the last minute to geneva for " logistical reasons , " eu spokeswoman cristina gallach said , without elaboration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diplomatic talks are still continuing despite little progress only " the continuation of dialogue and negotiations free from any kind of threat , pressure or any preconditions can pave the way " to a negotiated solution of the impasse , soltanieh told a meeting of the international atomic energy agency 's 35-nation board shortly before the end of the four-day conference . us push for sanctions the meeting planned for thursday in paris between eu foreign policy chief javier solana and iran 's top nuclear negotiator ali larijani was postponed on short notice with no reason given . solana is negotiating with the iranians in the name of six major powers - the five permanent un security council members and germany - to encourage tehran to accept political and economic incentives to suspend uranium enrichment . the six powers , notably the us , fear iran is trying to develop nuclear weapons , a charge which tehran rejects saying it has only a civil nuclear power program . the us is pushing for un sanctions against iran for failing to honor an aug .
31 un deadline for it to halt the strategic nuclear fuel work , but russia and china want to give more time for talks to get iran to comply . negotiation vs. confrontation us ambassador gregory schulte had wednesday told the iaea that " iran 's refusal to suspend and its refusal to cooperate is a choice of confrontation over one of negotiation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad says he is open to discussion finland , speaking for the 25 eu states at the iaea , said iran had to suspend enrichment , not as " a voluntary confidence-building measure , but as an international obligation . " on tuesday , the six nations failed to agree on a joint statement on iran at the iaea meeting due to the us call for sanctions and hesitance by russia and china to use that word , a western diplomat told news agencies . ' poisoned ' negotiations ? on thursday , an iranian official accused the us of " poisoning " the course of nuclear negotiations , the news agency isna reported . " the us intends to poison the course of the negotiations through constant antagonism , although iran has constantly stressed negotiations for realizing its nuclear rights , " foreign ministry spokesman mohammad-ali hosseini told dpa news service . comments in dakar iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad said thursday during a visit to dakar that iran would support unconditional talks on the nuclear dispute and that the issue could be settled as long as internationally-acknowledged laws were taken into consideration - a reference to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , which iran has signed . ahmadinejad will later this month travel to new york for the 61st session of the un general assembly , where he will once again challenge his american counterpart george w. bush to a television debate on both the nuclear dispute and the middle east conflict . dw staff -lrb- rar / jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sanctions against iran could cost 10,000 german jobs as world powers gear up for a new round of diplomacy to respond to iran 's refusal to halt uranium enrichment , germany 's main trade group said the country could lose 10,000 jobs if tehran is slapped with sanctions .

the german leader said she again raised human rights issues with the chinese leader and urged beijing to respect the freedom of the press . " in our discussions , we touched on human rights issues and i made it clear that these rights are inalienable and should be respected everywhere , " merkel told reporters at a press conference with wen . she said she had singled out the freedom of the press and stressed that journalists should be allowed to carry out their work during the 2008 olympic games in beijing .
merkel alluded to new media rules announced on sunday that require foreign media to seek approval to distribute news , pictures and graphics within china . " i said clearly that on this occasion too , the freedom of the press will play an important role and that we should continue to discuss the matter , " merkel said . her remarks follow the recent jailing of two journalists in what observers describe as a clampdown on the media ahead of the games and the 17th communist party congress next year .

merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder , had together with france led calls in 2004 to lift the embargo but this was strongly opposed by both the us and japan , which say a resumption of european weapons sales to beijing will worsen tensions between china and taiwan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the violent crackdown on protests at tiananmen square led to the embargo merkel has said she will not go down schröder 's path .
with germany holding the eu presidency during the first half of 2007 , she said " the arms embargo theme is currently not on the agenda .

but going there is easier than coming back , according to deutsche welle 's nina werkhäuser . it was a decision with " historical dimensions " for germany .
those were the words chancellor angela merkel used to describe the cabinet 's consent to send naval units to the middle east .
indeed , it is a historical decision to send armed german soldiers to the mideast .
for the last 60 years , such a mission would have been unthinkable because it was thought , for understandable historical reasons , that there should be as great a distance as possible between german troops and israel . that such a german foreign policy taboo could be broken may be astonishing .
but de facto , berlin had no other choice .
if germany had withdrawn from the mission , it would have laid the credibility of its foreign policy on the line and would have made berlin 's attempts to stabilize the situation in the mideast in the past few weeks seem absurd . israel explicitly wished for the bundeswehr 's participation .
that was not only the most important condition , it was an obligation .
without israel 's endorsement , angela merkel 's cabinet never would have approved of the mission . nevertheless , there is still a clearly defined line on the ground that the german government has decided not to cross : there will be no ground troops in the middle east .
other countries in the unifil mission should and will take over this responsibility .
they will have the difficult task of working together with the lebanese army to keep hezbollah in check .
how that should be done is still not clear , however . losing focus of peacekeeping mission purposes berlin is steering clear of that dilemma and is concentrating on its naval mission , which is supposed to hinder the delivery of arms via the sea to hezbollah militants .
it is difficult to say at this moment how effective that will be . germany will lead a european naval flotilla that has been granted a robust mandate ; it can stop and search incoming ships by force , if necessary .
despite the potential danger , the risk remains calculable .
yet only with this mandate will the parliament approve this week 's cabinet decision , when it comes up for a vote next week . that support nevertheless is guaranteed .
the vote will then turn the bundeswehr into an army that knows no borders .
but germany is paying a high price for this move , particularly when the choice of peacekeeping missions has become a bit random in nature .
the interests in the middle east are understandable .
but is a peacekeeping operation in the democratic republic of congo really necessary ? the large new mission in the middle east with up to 2,400 soldiers could , like the operations in kosovo and afghanistan , last for years .
and there is no guarantee for success .
such questions should make the german government clearly formulate its security policies .
this mission provides the opportunity to develop a definite exit strategy .

while braunau will honor two nazi victims on thursday , the austrian town still lacks a place that deals with its most infamous son .
sixty years after the end of world war ii , some say it 's still too early . braunau is almost a town like many others on the austrian-bavarian border .
a church spire towers over the city and youngsters meet up at a fountain in the town square , which is lined with shops and cafés that are famous for their strudels .
bookstores have decorated their windows with the works of pope benedict xvi . , who was born just around the corner , in marktl .
the village lies almost exactly between germany 's most important place of pilgrimage , altötting , and braunau , where adolf hitler was born - between heaven and hell , as some said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : braunau sits across the river inn from the bavarian town of simbach it 's definitely not a label that pleases most of the 17,300 braunauers , who have struggled with this burden of coincidence since 1945 .
they have lived with the stigma of coming from the same place as the man responsible for the murder of millions .
they know that it 's sometimes easier to tell people that they come from " near salzburg . "
while marktl likes to forget that the pope only lived there for two years and has no personal memories of his time there , braunauers take pains to point out that hitler left at around the same age .
a stone as tourist attraction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : braunau 's picturesque town square " believe me , i 'd much rather have the pope in braunau , " said klaus prexl , head of the local tourism office , who looks like one of the many tanned visitors who stop by on their bicycle tours through the region .
but prexl does n't have the catholic leader on offer and instead struggles to deal with continuing interest in hitler .
" every second or third guest asks about the house , " he said after one woman visiting from poland came in to find out how she could get to the building where the dictator was born .
like all the others , prexl sends her down the street , through the city tower , then it 'll come up on your left-hand side , watch out for the stone of admonition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stone 's still the only marker that hitler was born here " for peace , freedom and democracy , " reads the inscription on the stone , which comes from the nearby nazi concentration camp in mauthausen .
" never again fascism .
the millions of dead are a reminder . "
it 's the only reference to the fact that hitler was born here and , according to prexl , it 's not enough .
" i think it 's time for a documentation center , " said the 57-year-old .
" it exists in all the places where he committed crimes and we conceal it .
it 's been talked about forever , but there are local political influences that do n't want it . "
taking on responsibility far from it , countered gerhard skiba , braunau 's mayor since 1989 .
shortly after taking office , the self-declared socialist and member of austria 's social democratic party decided to place the stone in front of the house just in time for the 100th anniversary of hitler 's birthday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : braunau 's mayor gerhard skiba in his office " there were pretty serious protests , " skiba said , adding that he even received some death threats .
" people said : ' we do n't need that , the stone could be a target for attacks . " '
he also cleansed the town of hitler souvenirs such as beer mugs , ashtrays and wine bottles with the nazi leader 's image that were still sold at the time .
he hired streetworkers to deal with signs of right-wing extremism among teenagers and enthusiastically backed the placement of so-called stumbling stones that remember people killed by the nazis in front of the houses where they once lived .
two more of these will be placed on thursday .
skiba said he also wants to install a sign that identifies hitler 's birth house in front of the building in the very near future .
while the austrian government rents the landmarked structure , the owner has so far refused to agree to a plaque that 's directly attached to its walls .
ideal use of building the owners 's unwillingness to sell the house has also been one of the main reasons why a so-called house of responsibility has not been set up inside it , skiba said .
another reason is that the building is currently not open to the public as it is used by an organization called lebenshilfe , which offers people with mental and other disabilities a place to work .
" that 's an ideal use for the building , " skiba said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franciscan nuns recently named a park in braunau in jägerstetter 's honor while he said that he regrets that he failed to name a fountain , bridge or street after franz jägerstetter , who was murdered by the nazis for refusing to join the army , he will wholeheartedly back plans to transform hitler 's birthplace into a documentation center once it is no longer needed by its current tenants .
" among the things that i still want to do as mayor , this has top priority , " the 59-year-old said .
some , such as braunau 's catholic pastor , think that it might still take some time .
" i think it 's too fresh , " said 65-year-old stefan hofer , who has preached at st. stephan 's church , where hitler was baptized , for the past 34 years .
he added that braunau was currently taking responsibility via its days of contemporary history , which began in 1992 with a symposium called " undesired heritage " that looked at how cities such as braunau , auschwitz , vichy or stalin 's birthplace gori deal with their heritage .
waiting for the green light but the scientific adviser of that event said that mayor skiba just needs to give the political green light for the house of responsibility .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gifts made by mentally disabled people are currently sold inside the house " if he says yes , i 'll raise the money , " said andreas maislinger , a historian and political scientist , adding that the house should look at the past , present and future by giving visitors information about hitler and his crimes , offering space for organizations such as lebenshilfe and serving as a place that promotes intercultural understanding by inviting young chinese and japanese , indians and pakistanis , israelis and palestinians and others to get to know each other during a stay in braunau .
" we 're already doing that throughout the world , " said maislinger , who also founded an organization that offers young austrians an opportunity to complete their compulsory community service abroad .
" it 's all ready to go , " he said .
" i 'll start immediately when i get the go-ahead .

he says both need to come down from the sky and take a look at the reality on the ground . dw-world.de : what did you think of pope benedict 's visit ? hans küng : i think many people here in germany have an ambivalent impression .
benedict has a very nice personality ; he 's shown himself as a very friendly person .
he 's also not a media pope like his predecessor .
he 's not an actor who is looking for applause . he concentrates on the central truths of christianity and faith in god .
on the other hand , he did n't accomplish any of the reforms to the catholic church that some people were looking for . which reforms ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : küng compared the pope to another leader , george w. bush there are a great many things .
if you take the situation around munich , a lot of parishes are without priests .
and just having a lot of people in the seats does n't mean that they are all believers . of course everybody finds it a very stimulating event to see the pope up close and lots of people are looking for a spiritual father and a more credible representative of moral integrity , justice and peace than many politicians today . but there were fewer people at the liturgy than had been expected .
we should not think that all those who were coming to see a star are now convinced and faithful catholic believers . why do n't you think that the great wave of enthusiasm that greeted the pope could have a vitalizing effect on the church ? it would be great if it had consistent consequences .
it is not enough to preach and have a big event .
the most recent public opinion poll by mckinsey asked whether the catholic church should be reformed and 43 percent said yes .
this is 40 percent more than before . in the same poll , 45 percent - nearly half of all germans - said they have no confidence in the catholic church as an institution . the people in munich were very happy - they have a german pope , a bavarian pope .
it the event had been held in magdeburg , in a new german state , where only 8 percent are registered as christians , we would have had a different image of germany . what do you think about the pope 's comments on the unity of the church ?
do you think he could influence more cooperation between the catholics and the protestants ? of course he could .
i was very pleased that the german president , horst köhler , who is a member of the global ethic foundation , said when the pope arrived : " in the name of many christians in this country , more ecumenical progress . "
and the pope answered in a very convincing way .
he said he would do everything to bring catholic and protestants together . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope blessed the organ but overlooked deeper issues , said küng afterwards , when he met with other christians all the controversial issues between catholics and protestants were just ignored .
most people here in germany would have to have a common eucharist , the acknowledgement of the ministers of the protestant churches .
they would have a solution for marriages from different churches , and of course the problem of papal jurisdiction and infallibility .
all this was practically ignored .

he says both need to come down from the sky and take a look at the reality on the ground . dw-world.de : what did you think of pope benedict 's visit ? hans küng : i think many people here in germany have an ambivalent impression .
benedict has a very nice personality ; he 's shown himself as a very friendly person .
he 's also not a media pope like his predecessor .
he 's not an actor who is looking for applause . he concentrates on the central truths of christianity and faith in god .
on the other hand , he did n't accomplish any of the reforms to the catholic church that some people were looking for . which reforms ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : küng compared the pope to another leader , george w. bush there are a great many things .
if you take the situation around munich , a lot of parishes are without priests .
and just having a lot of people in the seats does n't mean that they are all believers . of course everybody finds it a very stimulating event to see the pope up close and lots of people are looking for a spiritual father and a more credible representative of moral integrity , justice and peace than many politicians today . but there were fewer people at the liturgy than had been expected .
we should not think that all those who were coming to see a star are now convinced and faithful catholic believers . why do n't you think that the great wave of enthusiasm that greeted the pope could have a vitalizing effect on the church ? it would be great if it had consistent consequences .
it is not enough to preach and have a big event .
the most recent public opinion poll by mckinsey asked whether the catholic church should be reformed and 43 percent said yes .
this is 40 percent more than before . in the same poll , 45 percent - nearly half of all germans - said they have no confidence in the catholic church as an institution . the people in munich were very happy - they have a german pope , a bavarian pope .
it the event had been held in magdeburg , in a new german state , where only 8 percent are registered as christians , we would have had a different image of germany . what do you think about the pope 's comments on the unity of the church ?
do you think he could influence more cooperation between the catholics and the protestants ? of course he could .
i was very pleased that the german president , horst köhler , who is a member of the global ethic foundation , said when the pope arrived : " in the name of many christians in this country , more ecumenical progress . "
and the pope answered in a very convincing way .
he said he would do everything to bring catholic and protestants together . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope blessed the organ but overlooked deeper issues , said küng afterwards , when he met with other christians all the controversial issues between catholics and protestants were just ignored .
most people here in germany would have to have a common eucharist , the acknowledgement of the ministers of the protestant churches .
they would have a solution for marriages from different churches , and of course the problem of papal jurisdiction and infallibility .
all this was practically ignored .
even the representatives of the protestant churches did n't have the courage to mention it . do you feel that the changes you 've mentioned , including unity among christians , will be possible during the tenure of the current pope ? i had a long conversation with him , which i 'm very grateful for .
i still hope that he will finally see that he can not only talk - he must finally take some action .

it was his last event on his personal six-day trip to his native bavaria homeland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many pilgrims spent the night at a field outside of regensburg for an outdoor mass on tuesday martina baumgarnter , a 22-year-old student from erding near munich , told ap news agency that the trip had shown her the warmer side of the 79-year-old former theologian who succeeded the charismatic john paul ii last year . " i had an image of him as being more distant than his predecessor , that has changed a lot , " baumgartner said . personal visit the visit is likely to be remembered as a sentimental stroll down memory lane in what the 79-year-old pope himself admitted may be his final major visit to his homeland . the emotional high point of the trip came on wednesday when the pontiff knelt in prayer at the graves of his mother , father and sister . the private prayers at the tiny ziegetsdorf cemetery outside the city of regensburg came on a day which the vatican said had been reserved for " private time " for the pope and his elder brother georg . following the 20-minute visit , the two brothers went the short distance to the house in the neighboring suburb of pentling , which the head of the roman catholic church has owned since he was a theology professor at regensburg university . pope focused on family in an earlier address , the pope had appealed for unity within the roman catholic church , where pressure groups have challenged his traditional views of marriage and the family . " just as in an organ an expert hand must constantly bring disharmony back to consonance , so we in the church ... always need to find anew , through our communion in faith , harmony in the praise of god and in fraternal love . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope , at a mass at the islinger field in regensburg on tuesday on tuesday benedict had hit the only political note of his visit , during which his addresses have been almost entirely spiritual , when he fleetingly criticised the islamic concept of " jihad . " " violence is incompatible with the nature of god and the nature of the soul , " the pope had said in a complex treatise on reason and faith . his comments drew criticism on wednesday from a leading muslim figure in italy .
ejaz ahmad , a member of an italian governmental consultative committee on islam , called on him to retract them . " the muslim world is currently undergoing a deep crisis and any attack from the west can aggravate this crisis , " ahmad was quoted as saying by italy 's ansa news agency . " in his speech the pope overlooks the fact that islam was the cradle of science and that muslims were the first to translate greek philosophers before they became part of european history , " he said . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope enjoys private time near end of german trip pope benedict xvi knelt in prayer at the graves of his mother , father and sister on wednesday in the emotional highpoint of his six-day visit to his native bavaria .

europe 's largest economy has been resilient in spite of high oil prices , but the imf says hazards still lurk . germany 's stock market has been booming for more than three years .
the country 's companies have been enjoying better than average profits during that time .
now , it is starting to pay dividends and the international monetary fund , in its twice-yearly assessment of the global economy , has raised its 2006 economic growth forecasts for germany to 2 percent from its prediction of 1.3 percent in the spring . at its meeting in singapore , the imf 's chief economist raghuram rajan praised europe 's largest economy , saying " it was on a roll . " but berlin 's measures to lower spending , such as merging unemployment and welfare benefits were not having as much as an effect that had been expected , rajan said .
he suggested lowering income taxes to help spur private consumption , recommending more flexibility in the labor market and increased competition in the banking and utilities sectors . adding more kick to the economy , rajan said , alluding to reforms , would not necessarily mean lower incomes or the end of germany 's welfare state . europe should take advantage of growth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eurozone is expected to grow 2.4 percent the imf is not alone in its optimism regards germany .
the eu commission projects growth of 2.2 percent .
only berlin , possibly stung by overly rosy forecasts that went unmet in the recent past , sees more modest growth at 1.6 percent for the current year . a scheduled increase of germany 's value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- as of january will boost private spending until the end of this year .
after that , the imf expects growth to stagnate to 1.3 percent . the economy in the euro zone is experiencing growth not seen since the dot.com days , expected to hit 2.4 percent .
rajan views the stronger developments as an opportunity to pare down public deficits , in line with the eu 's stability and growth pact target to hold such shortfalls to 3.0 percent or less of total output .
as for germany , he echoed his calls for reforms to europe . " europe 's leaders need to find the will to take on vested interests in both labor and in the corporate sector , " said rajan .
" this necessary but difficult domestic battle is constantly postponed until after the next election , " he added . balancing inflation and interest rates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high oil prices will continue to threaten world economies rising oil prices have yet had a great effect on consumer prices but with a barrel of crude expected to hover around or above the $ 70 per barrel mark , inflation is a concern central banks around the world must face . the imf found that with euro zone inflation running " below but close to " the european central bank 's -lrb- ecb -rrb- 2.0 percent objective , " further interest rate increases will likely be needed to maintain price stability over the medium term if the expansion develops as expected . " the ecb since december has raised its benchmark rate four times , taking it from 2.0 to 3.0 percent , and has made clear it intends to carry on with monetary tightening .

despite positive comments , solutions remained distant . a senior iranian envoy on thursday called contacts between tehran and the european union a " step in the right direction " in resolving the standoff over his country 's refusal to freeze uranium enrichment , but he accused the us of trying to sabotage the talks . ali ashgar soltanieh spoke as senior eu and iranian representatives met in a new round of negotiations on nuclear differences between tehran and the international community . that meeting , originally scheduled for paris , was moved in the last minute to geneva for " logistical reasons , " eu spokeswoman cristina gallach said , without elaboration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diplomatic talks are still continuing despite little progress only " the continuation of dialogue and negotiations free from any kind of threat , pressure or any preconditions can pave the way " to a negotiated solution of the impasse , soltanieh told a meeting of the international atomic energy agency 's 35-nation board shortly before the end of the four-day conference . us push for sanctions the meeting planned for thursday in paris between eu foreign policy chief javier solana and iran 's top nuclear negotiator ali larijani was postponed on short notice with no reason given . solana is negotiating with the iranians in the name of six major powers - the five permanent un security council members and germany - to encourage tehran to accept political and economic incentives to suspend uranium enrichment . the six powers , notably the us , fear iran is trying to develop nuclear weapons , a charge which tehran rejects saying it has only a civil nuclear power program . the us is pushing for un sanctions against iran for failing to honor an aug .

" on tuesday , the six nations failed to agree on a joint statement on iran at the iaea meeting due to the us call for sanctions and hesitance by russia and china to use that word , a western diplomat told news agencies . ' poisoned ' negotiations ? on thursday , an iranian official accused the us of " poisoning " the course of nuclear negotiations , the news agency isna reported . " the us intends to poison the course of the negotiations through constant antagonism , although iran has constantly stressed negotiations for realizing its nuclear rights , " foreign ministry spokesman mohammad-ali hosseini told dpa news service . comments in dakar iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad said thursday during a visit to dakar that iran would support unconditional talks on the nuclear dispute and that the issue could be settled as long as internationally-acknowledged laws were taken into consideration - a reference to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , which iran has signed . ahmadinejad will later this month travel to new york for the 61st session of the un general assembly , where he will once again challenge his american counterpart george w. bush to a television debate on both the nuclear dispute and the middle east conflict . dw staff -lrb- rar / jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sanctions against iran could cost 10,000 german jobs as world powers gear up for a new round of diplomacy to respond to iran 's refusal to halt uranium enrichment , germany 's main trade group said the country could lose 10,000 jobs if tehran is slapped with sanctions .

europe 's largest economy has been resilient in spite of high oil prices , but the imf says hazards still lurk . germany 's stock market has been booming for more than three years .
the country 's companies have been enjoying better than average profits during that time .
now , it is starting to pay dividends and the international monetary fund , in its twice-yearly assessment of the global economy , has raised its 2006 economic growth forecasts for germany to 2 percent from its prediction of 1.3 percent in the spring . at its meeting in singapore , the imf 's chief economist raghuram rajan praised europe 's largest economy , saying " it was on a roll . " but berlin 's measures to lower spending , such as merging unemployment and welfare benefits were not having as much as an effect that had been expected , rajan said .
he suggested lowering income taxes to help spur private consumption , recommending more flexibility in the labor market and increased competition in the banking and utilities sectors . adding more kick to the economy , rajan said , alluding to reforms , would not necessarily mean lower incomes or the end of germany 's welfare state . europe should take advantage of growth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eurozone is expected to grow 2.4 percent the imf is not alone in its optimism regards germany .
the eu commission projects growth of 2.2 percent .
only berlin , possibly stung by overly rosy forecasts that went unmet in the recent past , sees more modest growth at 1.6 percent for the current year . a scheduled increase of germany 's value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- as of january will boost private spending until the end of this year .
after that , the imf expects growth to stagnate to 1.3 percent . the economy in the euro zone is experiencing growth not seen since the dot.com days , expected to hit 2.4 percent .
rajan views the stronger developments as an opportunity to pare down public deficits , in line with the eu 's stability and growth pact target to hold such shortfalls to 3.0 percent or less of total output .
as for germany , he echoed his calls for reforms to europe . " europe 's leaders need to find the will to take on vested interests in both labor and in the corporate sector , " said rajan .
" this necessary but difficult domestic battle is constantly postponed until after the next election , " he added . balancing inflation and interest rates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high oil prices will continue to threaten world economies rising oil prices have yet had a great effect on consumer prices but with a barrel of crude expected to hover around or above the $ 70 per barrel mark , inflation is a concern central banks around the world must face . the imf found that with euro zone inflation running " below but close to " the european central bank 's -lrb- ecb -rrb- 2.0 percent objective , " further interest rate increases will likely be needed to maintain price stability over the medium term if the expansion develops as expected . " the ecb since december has raised its benchmark rate four times , taking it from 2.0 to 3.0 percent , and has made clear it intends to carry on with monetary tightening .
but the imf cautioned : " with underlying inflationary pressures still well contained ... policymakers can afford to be cautious in tightening the monetary policy stance , all the more so given the risk of euro appreciation and weaker growth in the united states .

he says both need to come down from the sky and take a look at the reality on the ground . dw-world.de : what did you think of pope benedict 's visit ? hans küng : i think many people here in germany have an ambivalent impression .
benedict has a very nice personality ; he 's shown himself as a very friendly person .
he 's also not a media pope like his predecessor .
he 's not an actor who is looking for applause . he concentrates on the central truths of christianity and faith in god .
on the other hand , he did n't accomplish any of the reforms to the catholic church that some people were looking for . which reforms ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : küng compared the pope to another leader , george w. bush there are a great many things .
if you take the situation around munich , a lot of parishes are without priests .
and just having a lot of people in the seats does n't mean that they are all believers . of course everybody finds it a very stimulating event to see the pope up close and lots of people are looking for a spiritual father and a more credible representative of moral integrity , justice and peace than many politicians today . but there were fewer people at the liturgy than had been expected .
we should not think that all those who were coming to see a star are now convinced and faithful catholic believers . why do n't you think that the great wave of enthusiasm that greeted the pope could have a vitalizing effect on the church ? it would be great if it had consistent consequences .
it is not enough to preach and have a big event .
the most recent public opinion poll by mckinsey asked whether the catholic church should be reformed and 43 percent said yes .
this is 40 percent more than before . in the same poll , 45 percent - nearly half of all germans - said they have no confidence in the catholic church as an institution . the people in munich were very happy - they have a german pope , a bavarian pope .
it the event had been held in magdeburg , in a new german state , where only 8 percent are registered as christians , we would have had a different image of germany . what do you think about the pope 's comments on the unity of the church ?
do you think he could influence more cooperation between the catholics and the protestants ? of course he could .
i was very pleased that the german president , horst köhler , who is a member of the global ethic foundation , said when the pope arrived : " in the name of many christians in this country , more ecumenical progress . "
and the pope answered in a very convincing way .
he said he would do everything to bring catholic and protestants together . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope blessed the organ but overlooked deeper issues , said küng afterwards , when he met with other christians all the controversial issues between catholics and protestants were just ignored .
most people here in germany would have to have a common eucharist , the acknowledgement of the ministers of the protestant churches .
they would have a solution for marriages from different churches , and of course the problem of papal jurisdiction and infallibility .
all this was practically ignored .
even the representatives of the protestant churches did n't have the courage to mention it . do you feel that the changes you 've mentioned , including unity among christians , will be possible during the tenure of the current pope ? i had a long conversation with him , which i 'm very grateful for .
i still hope that he will finally see that he can not only talk - he must finally take some action .
and i still hope that , after a certain time of reflection , he will do something . sometimes i have the impression he 's like president bush , who takes his air force one jet and flies over new orleans just to see how the situation is .
but finally he had to come down to the ground to see what the reality is . the diocese in regensburg , where the pope was , is probably the most divided diocese in germany .
the bishop of regensburg replaced practically all the elected members of the diocesan council in an authoritarian way with like-minded people .
and people could not understand why the pope just made comments about the organ in the regensburg church in the presence of this bishop . hans küng was professor of ecumenical theology and director of the institute for ecumenical research at the university of tübingen from 1960 until his retirement in 1996 .
he also served as official theological consultant to the second vatican council appointed by pope john xxiii .
küng has published numerous books on christianity , the catholic church and ethics . rob turner interviewed hans küng -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope urges faithful to stand up for beliefs against " fanaticism " pope benedict xvi urged pilgrims at a giant open-air mass in regensburg to stand up for their beliefs in the face of the " hatred and fanaticism " tarnishing religion .

while braunau will honor two nazi victims on thursday , the austrian town still lacks a place that deals with its most infamous son .
sixty years after the end of world war ii , some say it 's still too early . braunau is almost a town like many others on the austrian-bavarian border .
a church spire towers over the city and youngsters meet up at a fountain in the town square , which is lined with shops and cafés that are famous for their strudels .
bookstores have decorated their windows with the works of pope benedict xvi . , who was born just around the corner , in marktl .
the village lies almost exactly between germany 's most important place of pilgrimage , altötting , and braunau , where adolf hitler was born - between heaven and hell , as some said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : braunau sits across the river inn from the bavarian town of simbach it 's definitely not a label that pleases most of the 17,300 braunauers , who have struggled with this burden of coincidence since 1945 .
they have lived with the stigma of coming from the same place as the man responsible for the murder of millions .
they know that it 's sometimes easier to tell people that they come from " near salzburg . "
while marktl likes to forget that the pope only lived there for two years and has no personal memories of his time there , braunauers take pains to point out that hitler left at around the same age .
a stone as tourist attraction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : braunau 's picturesque town square " believe me , i 'd much rather have the pope in braunau , " said klaus prexl , head of the local tourism office , who looks like one of the many tanned visitors who stop by on their bicycle tours through the region .
but prexl does n't have the catholic leader on offer and instead struggles to deal with continuing interest in hitler .
" every second or third guest asks about the house , " he said after one woman visiting from poland came in to find out how she could get to the building where the dictator was born .
like all the others , prexl sends her down the street , through the city tower , then it 'll come up on your left-hand side , watch out for the stone of admonition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stone 's still the only marker that hitler was born here " for peace , freedom and democracy , " reads the inscription on the stone , which comes from the nearby nazi concentration camp in mauthausen .
" never again fascism .
the millions of dead are a reminder . "
it 's the only reference to the fact that hitler was born here and , according to prexl , it 's not enough .
" i think it 's time for a documentation center , " said the 57-year-old .
" it exists in all the places where he committed crimes and we conceal it .
it 's been talked about forever , but there are local political influences that do n't want it . "
taking on responsibility far from it , countered gerhard skiba , braunau 's mayor since 1989 .
shortly after taking office , the self-declared socialist and member of austria 's social democratic party decided to place the stone in front of the house just in time for the 100th anniversary of hitler 's birthday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : braunau 's mayor gerhard skiba in his office " there were pretty serious protests , " skiba said , adding that he even received some death threats .
" people said : ' we do n't need that , the stone could be a target for attacks . " '
he also cleansed the town of hitler souvenirs such as beer mugs , ashtrays and wine bottles with the nazi leader 's image that were still sold at the time .
he hired streetworkers to deal with signs of right-wing extremism among teenagers and enthusiastically backed the placement of so-called stumbling stones that remember people killed by the nazis in front of the houses where they once lived .
two more of these will be placed on thursday .
skiba said he also wants to install a sign that identifies hitler 's birth house in front of the building in the very near future .
while the austrian government rents the landmarked structure , the owner has so far refused to agree to a plaque that 's directly attached to its walls .
ideal use of building the owners 's unwillingness to sell the house has also been one of the main reasons why a so-called house of responsibility has not been set up inside it , skiba said .
another reason is that the building is currently not open to the public as it is used by an organization called lebenshilfe , which offers people with mental and other disabilities a place to work .
" that 's an ideal use for the building , " skiba said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franciscan nuns recently named a park in braunau in jägerstetter 's honor while he said that he regrets that he failed to name a fountain , bridge or street after franz jägerstetter , who was murdered by the nazis for refusing to join the army , he will wholeheartedly back plans to transform hitler 's birthplace into a documentation center once it is no longer needed by its current tenants .
" among the things that i still want to do as mayor , this has top priority , " the 59-year-old said .
some , such as braunau 's catholic pastor , think that it might still take some time .
" i think it 's too fresh , " said 65-year-old stefan hofer , who has preached at st. stephan 's church , where hitler was baptized , for the past 34 years .
he added that braunau was currently taking responsibility via its days of contemporary history , which began in 1992 with a symposium called " undesired heritage " that looked at how cities such as braunau , auschwitz , vichy or stalin 's birthplace gori deal with their heritage .
waiting for the green light but the scientific adviser of that event said that mayor skiba just needs to give the political green light for the house of responsibility .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gifts made by mentally disabled people are currently sold inside the house " if he says yes , i 'll raise the money , " said andreas maislinger , a historian and political scientist , adding that the house should look at the past , present and future by giving visitors information about hitler and his crimes , offering space for organizations such as lebenshilfe and serving as a place that promotes intercultural understanding by inviting young chinese and japanese , indians and pakistanis , israelis and palestinians and others to get to know each other during a stay in braunau .
" we 're already doing that throughout the world , " said maislinger , who also founded an organization that offers young austrians an opportunity to complete their compulsory community service abroad .
" it 's all ready to go , " he said .

the german leader said she again raised human rights issues with the chinese leader and urged beijing to respect the freedom of the press . " in our discussions , we touched on human rights issues and i made it clear that these rights are inalienable and should be respected everywhere , " merkel told reporters at a press conference with wen . she said she had singled out the freedom of the press and stressed that journalists should be allowed to carry out their work during the 2008 olympic games in beijing .
merkel alluded to new media rules announced on sunday that require foreign media to seek approval to distribute news , pictures and graphics within china . " i said clearly that on this occasion too , the freedom of the press will play an important role and that we should continue to discuss the matter , " merkel said . her remarks follow the recent jailing of two journalists in what observers describe as a clampdown on the media ahead of the games and the 17th communist party congress next year .
the chinese government recently sentenced new york times researcher zhao yan to three years in prison for fraud and singapore straits times correspondent ching cheong to five years for allegedly spying for taiwan . intellectual property rights another area that has rankled many western politicians and business leaders is intellectual property rights -lrb- ipr -rrb- and the piracy of films and cds .
german and chinese officials took limited action on thursday by signing an ipr accord . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pirate software cds are common in chinese street stalls under the agreement , german experts will help train chinese patent officials and a series of exchanges are to be arranged for personnel from both countries . " this will help ensure that there is more reliability for those who in invest in china , " said merkel at the press conference . for his part , wen hailed the growth of german-chinese economic ties and said he expected the overall trade volume between both nations to reach $ 80 billion dollars -lrb- 63 billion euros -rrb- , after climbing to 70 billion dollars last year . a rms embargo merkel and wen also discussed the topic of the eu 's arms embargo imposed against china in 1989 after the bloody crackdown on pro-democracy protests at tiananmen square .
merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder , had together with france led calls in 2004 to lift the embargo but this was strongly opposed by both the us and japan , which say a resumption of european weapons sales to beijing will worsen tensions between china and taiwan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the violent crackdown on protests at tiananmen square led to the embargo merkel has said she will not go down schröder 's path .
with germany holding the eu presidency during the first half of 2007 , she said " the arms embargo theme is currently not on the agenda . " lifting the embargo was a question of " mutual respect and equality " said wen , adding that he hoped eu countries would have " enough vision and foresight " to tackle the issue . dw staff -lrb- afp / dpa / jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de china clamps down on counterfeit world cup goods chinese authorities have seized thousands of counterfeit world cup products , just over two weeks before soccer 's biggest event kicks off in germany , state media reported this week .

during a video conference with other coaches , he dropped a hint that he may be back soon . once a soccer player gets a taste of coaching , it can be difficult for him to leave it behind .
when jürgen klinsmann resigned this summer as germany 's head coach after a better-than-expected third-place performance , speculation immediately started that he would take a seat on a bench somewhere else . two months after the end of the world cup , he has made his first public appearance during a video conference at the end of a meeting of world cup managers organized by fifa in berlin and alluded to his desires none too clearly . " who knows , perhaps i 'll be a coach once again at the 2010 world cup -lrb- in south africa -rrb- , " he said . klinsmann , calling in to the conference from his home in california , still enjoys " taking -lrb- his -rrb- kids to school , " something he has more than ample time to do , having retired four days after guiding germany into third at this year 's world cup finals . coach for usa ?
or possibly an african country ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coaching a striker like ivory coast 's didier drogba could be enticing klinsmann 's logical new employer would be the united states soccer federation , which separated paths from bruce arena who had coached the american men 's team for eight years .
it would also be sensible for him considering that the team has its training quarters in southern california . klinsmann has consistently denied the connection with the us team and theo zwanziger , the newly elected president of the german football federation , raised another possible scenario for the 42-year-old who has always had a penchant for travel . zwanziger suggested recently that klinsmann " might take charge of a team in africa .

europe 's largest economy has been resilient in spite of high oil prices , but the imf says hazards still lurk . germany 's stock market has been booming for more than three years .
the country 's companies have been enjoying better than average profits during that time .
now , it is starting to pay dividends and the international monetary fund , in its twice-yearly assessment of the global economy , has raised its 2006 economic growth forecasts for germany to 2 percent from its prediction of 1.3 percent in the spring . at its meeting in singapore , the imf 's chief economist raghuram rajan praised europe 's largest economy , saying " it was on a roll . " but berlin 's measures to lower spending , such as merging unemployment and welfare benefits were not having as much as an effect that had been expected , rajan said .
he suggested lowering income taxes to help spur private consumption , recommending more flexibility in the labor market and increased competition in the banking and utilities sectors . adding more kick to the economy , rajan said , alluding to reforms , would not necessarily mean lower incomes or the end of germany 's welfare state . europe should take advantage of growth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eurozone is expected to grow 2.4 percent the imf is not alone in its optimism regards germany .

after that , the imf expects growth to stagnate to 1.3 percent . the economy in the euro zone is experiencing growth not seen since the dot.com days , expected to hit 2.4 percent .
rajan views the stronger developments as an opportunity to pare down public deficits , in line with the eu 's stability and growth pact target to hold such shortfalls to 3.0 percent or less of total output .
as for germany , he echoed his calls for reforms to europe . " europe 's leaders need to find the will to take on vested interests in both labor and in the corporate sector , " said rajan .

" the ecb since december has raised its benchmark rate four times , taking it from 2.0 to 3.0 percent , and has made clear it intends to carry on with monetary tightening .

despite positive comments , solutions remained distant . a senior iranian envoy on thursday called contacts between tehran and the european union a " step in the right direction " in resolving the standoff over his country 's refusal to freeze uranium enrichment , but he accused the us of trying to sabotage the talks . ali ashgar soltanieh spoke as senior eu and iranian representatives met in a new round of negotiations on nuclear differences between tehran and the international community . that meeting , originally scheduled for paris , was moved in the last minute to geneva for " logistical reasons , " eu spokeswoman cristina gallach said , without elaboration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diplomatic talks are still continuing despite little progress only " the continuation of dialogue and negotiations free from any kind of threat , pressure or any preconditions can pave the way " to a negotiated solution of the impasse , soltanieh told a meeting of the international atomic energy agency 's 35-nation board shortly before the end of the four-day conference . us push for sanctions the meeting planned for thursday in paris between eu foreign policy chief javier solana and iran 's top nuclear negotiator ali larijani was postponed on short notice with no reason given . solana is negotiating with the iranians in the name of six major powers - the five permanent un security council members and germany - to encourage tehran to accept political and economic incentives to suspend uranium enrichment . the six powers , notably the us , fear iran is trying to develop nuclear weapons , a charge which tehran rejects saying it has only a civil nuclear power program . the us is pushing for un sanctions against iran for failing to honor an aug .

" the us intends to poison the course of the negotiations through constant antagonism , although iran has constantly stressed negotiations for realizing its nuclear rights , " foreign ministry spokesman mohammad-ali hosseini told dpa news service . comments in dakar iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad said thursday during a visit to dakar that iran would support unconditional talks on the nuclear dispute and that the issue could be settled as long as internationally-acknowledged laws were taken into consideration - a reference to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , which iran has signed . ahmadinejad will later this month travel to new york for the 61st session of the un general assembly , where he will once again challenge his american counterpart george w. bush to a television debate on both the nuclear dispute and the middle east conflict . dw staff -lrb- rar / jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sanctions against iran could cost 10,000 german jobs as world powers gear up for a new round of diplomacy to respond to iran 's refusal to halt uranium enrichment , germany 's main trade group said the country could lose 10,000 jobs if tehran is slapped with sanctions .

while braunau will honor two nazi victims on thursday , the austrian town still lacks a place that deals with its most infamous son .
sixty years after the end of world war ii , some say it 's still too early . braunau is almost a town like many others on the austrian-bavarian border .
a church spire towers over the city and youngsters meet up at a fountain in the town square , which is lined with shops and cafés that are famous for their strudels .
bookstores have decorated their windows with the works of pope benedict xvi . , who was born just around the corner , in marktl .
the village lies almost exactly between germany 's most important place of pilgrimage , altötting , and braunau , where adolf hitler was born - between heaven and hell , as some said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : braunau sits across the river inn from the bavarian town of simbach it 's definitely not a label that pleases most of the 17,300 braunauers , who have struggled with this burden of coincidence since 1945 .
they have lived with the stigma of coming from the same place as the man responsible for the murder of millions .
they know that it 's sometimes easier to tell people that they come from " near salzburg . "
while marktl likes to forget that the pope only lived there for two years and has no personal memories of his time there , braunauers take pains to point out that hitler left at around the same age .
a stone as tourist attraction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : braunau 's picturesque town square " believe me , i 'd much rather have the pope in braunau , " said klaus prexl , head of the local tourism office , who looks like one of the many tanned visitors who stop by on their bicycle tours through the region .
but prexl does n't have the catholic leader on offer and instead struggles to deal with continuing interest in hitler .
" every second or third guest asks about the house , " he said after one woman visiting from poland came in to find out how she could get to the building where the dictator was born .
like all the others , prexl sends her down the street , through the city tower , then it 'll come up on your left-hand side , watch out for the stone of admonition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stone 's still the only marker that hitler was born here " for peace , freedom and democracy , " reads the inscription on the stone , which comes from the nearby nazi concentration camp in mauthausen .
" never again fascism .
the millions of dead are a reminder . "
it 's the only reference to the fact that hitler was born here and , according to prexl , it 's not enough .
" i think it 's time for a documentation center , " said the 57-year-old .
" it exists in all the places where he committed crimes and we conceal it .
it 's been talked about forever , but there are local political influences that do n't want it . "
taking on responsibility far from it , countered gerhard skiba , braunau 's mayor since 1989 .
shortly after taking office , the self-declared socialist and member of austria 's social democratic party decided to place the stone in front of the house just in time for the 100th anniversary of hitler 's birthday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : braunau 's mayor gerhard skiba in his office " there were pretty serious protests , " skiba said , adding that he even received some death threats .
" people said : ' we do n't need that , the stone could be a target for attacks . " '
he also cleansed the town of hitler souvenirs such as beer mugs , ashtrays and wine bottles with the nazi leader 's image that were still sold at the time .
he hired streetworkers to deal with signs of right-wing extremism among teenagers and enthusiastically backed the placement of so-called stumbling stones that remember people killed by the nazis in front of the houses where they once lived .
two more of these will be placed on thursday .
skiba said he also wants to install a sign that identifies hitler 's birth house in front of the building in the very near future .
while the austrian government rents the landmarked structure , the owner has so far refused to agree to a plaque that 's directly attached to its walls .
ideal use of building the owners 's unwillingness to sell the house has also been one of the main reasons why a so-called house of responsibility has not been set up inside it , skiba said .
another reason is that the building is currently not open to the public as it is used by an organization called lebenshilfe , which offers people with mental and other disabilities a place to work .
" that 's an ideal use for the building , " skiba said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franciscan nuns recently named a park in braunau in jägerstetter 's honor while he said that he regrets that he failed to name a fountain , bridge or street after franz jägerstetter , who was murdered by the nazis for refusing to join the army , he will wholeheartedly back plans to transform hitler 's birthplace into a documentation center once it is no longer needed by its current tenants .
" among the things that i still want to do as mayor , this has top priority , " the 59-year-old said .
some , such as braunau 's catholic pastor , think that it might still take some time .
" i think it 's too fresh , " said 65-year-old stefan hofer , who has preached at st. stephan 's church , where hitler was baptized , for the past 34 years .
he added that braunau was currently taking responsibility via its days of contemporary history , which began in 1992 with a symposium called " undesired heritage " that looked at how cities such as braunau , auschwitz , vichy or stalin 's birthplace gori deal with their heritage .
waiting for the green light but the scientific adviser of that event said that mayor skiba just needs to give the political green light for the house of responsibility .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gifts made by mentally disabled people are currently sold inside the house " if he says yes , i 'll raise the money , " said andreas maislinger , a historian and political scientist , adding that the house should look at the past , present and future by giving visitors information about hitler and his crimes , offering space for organizations such as lebenshilfe and serving as a place that promotes intercultural understanding by inviting young chinese and japanese , indians and pakistanis , israelis and palestinians and others to get to know each other during a stay in braunau .
" we 're already doing that throughout the world , " said maislinger , who also founded an organization that offers young austrians an opportunity to complete their compulsory community service abroad .
" it 's all ready to go , " he said .
" i 'll start immediately when i get the go-ahead .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.09.2006 opinion : it 's time to formulate the lebanon mission clearly großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german cabinet has agreed to send 2,400 troops to patrol the waters along lebanon 's coast .
but going there is easier than coming back , according to deutsche welle 's nina werkhäuser . it was a decision with " historical dimensions " for germany .
those were the words chancellor angela merkel used to describe the cabinet 's consent to send naval units to the middle east .
indeed , it is a historical decision to send armed german soldiers to the mideast .
for the last 60 years , such a mission would have been unthinkable because it was thought , for understandable historical reasons , that there should be as great a distance as possible between german troops and israel . that such a german foreign policy taboo could be broken may be astonishing .
but de facto , berlin had no other choice .
if germany had withdrawn from the mission , it would have laid the credibility of its foreign policy on the line and would have made berlin 's attempts to stabilize the situation in the mideast in the past few weeks seem absurd . israel explicitly wished for the bundeswehr 's participation .
that was not only the most important condition , it was an obligation .
without israel 's endorsement , angela merkel 's cabinet never would have approved of the mission . nevertheless , there is still a clearly defined line on the ground that the german government has decided not to cross : there will be no ground troops in the middle east .
other countries in the unifil mission should and will take over this responsibility .
they will have the difficult task of working together with the lebanese army to keep hezbollah in check .
how that should be done is still not clear , however . losing focus of peacekeeping mission purposes berlin is steering clear of that dilemma and is concentrating on its naval mission , which is supposed to hinder the delivery of arms via the sea to hezbollah militants .
it is difficult to say at this moment how effective that will be . germany will lead a european naval flotilla that has been granted a robust mandate ; it can stop and search incoming ships by force , if necessary .
despite the potential danger , the risk remains calculable .
yet only with this mandate will the parliament approve this week 's cabinet decision , when it comes up for a vote next week . that support nevertheless is guaranteed .
the vote will then turn the bundeswehr into an army that knows no borders .
but germany is paying a high price for this move , particularly when the choice of peacekeeping missions has become a bit random in nature .
the interests in the middle east are understandable .
but is a peacekeeping operation in the democratic republic of congo really necessary ? the large new mission in the middle east with up to 2,400 soldiers could , like the operations in kosovo and afghanistan , last for years .
and there is no guarantee for success .
such questions should make the german government clearly formulate its security policies .
this mission provides the opportunity to develop a definite exit strategy .
there is still time to do this . nina werkhäuser is dw radio 's correspondent to the german parliament in berlin . -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cabinet gives green light to lebanon mission germany 's cabinet authorized the deployment of ships to the middle east as part of the un force in lebanon .

he says both need to come down from the sky and take a look at the reality on the ground . dw-world.de : what did you think of pope benedict 's visit ? hans küng : i think many people here in germany have an ambivalent impression .
benedict has a very nice personality ; he 's shown himself as a very friendly person .
he 's also not a media pope like his predecessor .
he 's not an actor who is looking for applause . he concentrates on the central truths of christianity and faith in god .
on the other hand , he did n't accomplish any of the reforms to the catholic church that some people were looking for . which reforms ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : küng compared the pope to another leader , george w. bush there are a great many things .
if you take the situation around munich , a lot of parishes are without priests .
and just having a lot of people in the seats does n't mean that they are all believers . of course everybody finds it a very stimulating event to see the pope up close and lots of people are looking for a spiritual father and a more credible representative of moral integrity , justice and peace than many politicians today . but there were fewer people at the liturgy than had been expected .
we should not think that all those who were coming to see a star are now convinced and faithful catholic believers . why do n't you think that the great wave of enthusiasm that greeted the pope could have a vitalizing effect on the church ? it would be great if it had consistent consequences .
it is not enough to preach and have a big event .
the most recent public opinion poll by mckinsey asked whether the catholic church should be reformed and 43 percent said yes .
this is 40 percent more than before . in the same poll , 45 percent - nearly half of all germans - said they have no confidence in the catholic church as an institution . the people in munich were very happy - they have a german pope , a bavarian pope .
it the event had been held in magdeburg , in a new german state , where only 8 percent are registered as christians , we would have had a different image of germany . what do you think about the pope 's comments on the unity of the church ?
do you think he could influence more cooperation between the catholics and the protestants ? of course he could .
i was very pleased that the german president , horst köhler , who is a member of the global ethic foundation , said when the pope arrived : " in the name of many christians in this country , more ecumenical progress . "
and the pope answered in a very convincing way .
he said he would do everything to bring catholic and protestants together . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope blessed the organ but overlooked deeper issues , said küng afterwards , when he met with other christians all the controversial issues between catholics and protestants were just ignored .
most people here in germany would have to have a common eucharist , the acknowledgement of the ministers of the protestant churches .
they would have a solution for marriages from different churches , and of course the problem of papal jurisdiction and infallibility .
all this was practically ignored .
even the representatives of the protestant churches did n't have the courage to mention it . do you feel that the changes you 've mentioned , including unity among christians , will be possible during the tenure of the current pope ? i had a long conversation with him , which i 'm very grateful for .
i still hope that he will finally see that he can not only talk - he must finally take some action .
and i still hope that , after a certain time of reflection , he will do something . sometimes i have the impression he 's like president bush , who takes his air force one jet and flies over new orleans just to see how the situation is .
but finally he had to come down to the ground to see what the reality is . the diocese in regensburg , where the pope was , is probably the most divided diocese in germany .
the bishop of regensburg replaced practically all the elected members of the diocesan council in an authoritarian way with like-minded people .
and people could not understand why the pope just made comments about the organ in the regensburg church in the presence of this bishop . hans küng was professor of ecumenical theology and director of the institute for ecumenical research at the university of tübingen from 1960 until his retirement in 1996 .
he also served as official theological consultant to the second vatican council appointed by pope john xxiii .

he 's not an actor who is looking for applause . he concentrates on the central truths of christianity and faith in god .
on the other hand , he did n't accomplish any of the reforms to the catholic church that some people were looking for . which reforms ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : küng compared the pope to another leader , george w. bush there are a great many things .
if you take the situation around munich , a lot of parishes are without priests .
and just having a lot of people in the seats does n't mean that they are all believers . of course everybody finds it a very stimulating event to see the pope up close and lots of people are looking for a spiritual father and a more credible representative of moral integrity , justice and peace than many politicians today . but there were fewer people at the liturgy than had been expected .
we should not think that all those who were coming to see a star are now convinced and faithful catholic believers . why do n't you think that the great wave of enthusiasm that greeted the pope could have a vitalizing effect on the church ? it would be great if it had consistent consequences .
it is not enough to preach and have a big event .
the most recent public opinion poll by mckinsey asked whether the catholic church should be reformed and 43 percent said yes .
this is 40 percent more than before . in the same poll , 45 percent - nearly half of all germans - said they have no confidence in the catholic church as an institution . the people in munich were very happy - they have a german pope , a bavarian pope .
it the event had been held in magdeburg , in a new german state , where only 8 percent are registered as christians , we would have had a different image of germany . what do you think about the pope 's comments on the unity of the church ?
do you think he could influence more cooperation between the catholics and the protestants ? of course he could .
i was very pleased that the german president , horst köhler , who is a member of the global ethic foundation , said when the pope arrived : " in the name of many christians in this country , more ecumenical progress . "
and the pope answered in a very convincing way .
he said he would do everything to bring catholic and protestants together . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope blessed the organ but overlooked deeper issues , said küng afterwards , when he met with other christians all the controversial issues between catholics and protestants were just ignored .
most people here in germany would have to have a common eucharist , the acknowledgement of the ministers of the protestant churches .
they would have a solution for marriages from different churches , and of course the problem of papal jurisdiction and infallibility .
all this was practically ignored .
even the representatives of the protestant churches did n't have the courage to mention it . do you feel that the changes you 've mentioned , including unity among christians , will be possible during the tenure of the current pope ? i had a long conversation with him , which i 'm very grateful for .
i still hope that he will finally see that he can not only talk - he must finally take some action .
and i still hope that , after a certain time of reflection , he will do something . sometimes i have the impression he 's like president bush , who takes his air force one jet and flies over new orleans just to see how the situation is .
but finally he had to come down to the ground to see what the reality is . the diocese in regensburg , where the pope was , is probably the most divided diocese in germany .
the bishop of regensburg replaced practically all the elected members of the diocesan council in an authoritarian way with like-minded people .
and people could not understand why the pope just made comments about the organ in the regensburg church in the presence of this bishop . hans küng was professor of ecumenical theology and director of the institute for ecumenical research at the university of tübingen from 1960 until his retirement in 1996 .
he also served as official theological consultant to the second vatican council appointed by pope john xxiii .
küng has published numerous books on christianity , the catholic church and ethics . rob turner interviewed hans küng -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope urges faithful to stand up for beliefs against " fanaticism " pope benedict xvi urged pilgrims at a giant open-air mass in regensburg to stand up for their beliefs in the face of the " hatred and fanaticism " tarnishing religion .

while braunau will honor two nazi victims on thursday , the austrian town still lacks a place that deals with its most infamous son .
sixty years after the end of world war ii , some say it 's still too early . braunau is almost a town like many others on the austrian-bavarian border .
a church spire towers over the city and youngsters meet up at a fountain in the town square , which is lined with shops and cafés that are famous for their strudels .
bookstores have decorated their windows with the works of pope benedict xvi . , who was born just around the corner , in marktl .
the village lies almost exactly between germany 's most important place of pilgrimage , altötting , and braunau , where adolf hitler was born - between heaven and hell , as some said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : braunau sits across the river inn from the bavarian town of simbach it 's definitely not a label that pleases most of the 17,300 braunauers , who have struggled with this burden of coincidence since 1945 .
they have lived with the stigma of coming from the same place as the man responsible for the murder of millions .
they know that it 's sometimes easier to tell people that they come from " near salzburg . "
while marktl likes to forget that the pope only lived there for two years and has no personal memories of his time there , braunauers take pains to point out that hitler left at around the same age .
a stone as tourist attraction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : braunau 's picturesque town square " believe me , i 'd much rather have the pope in braunau , " said klaus prexl , head of the local tourism office , who looks like one of the many tanned visitors who stop by on their bicycle tours through the region .
but prexl does n't have the catholic leader on offer and instead struggles to deal with continuing interest in hitler .
" every second or third guest asks about the house , " he said after one woman visiting from poland came in to find out how she could get to the building where the dictator was born .
like all the others , prexl sends her down the street , through the city tower , then it 'll come up on your left-hand side , watch out for the stone of admonition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stone 's still the only marker that hitler was born here " for peace , freedom and democracy , " reads the inscription on the stone , which comes from the nearby nazi concentration camp in mauthausen .
" never again fascism .
the millions of dead are a reminder . "
it 's the only reference to the fact that hitler was born here and , according to prexl , it 's not enough .
" i think it 's time for a documentation center , " said the 57-year-old .
" it exists in all the places where he committed crimes and we conceal it .
it 's been talked about forever , but there are local political influences that do n't want it . "
taking on responsibility far from it , countered gerhard skiba , braunau 's mayor since 1989 .
shortly after taking office , the self-declared socialist and member of austria 's social democratic party decided to place the stone in front of the house just in time for the 100th anniversary of hitler 's birthday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : braunau 's mayor gerhard skiba in his office " there were pretty serious protests , " skiba said , adding that he even received some death threats .
" people said : ' we do n't need that , the stone could be a target for attacks . " '
he also cleansed the town of hitler souvenirs such as beer mugs , ashtrays and wine bottles with the nazi leader 's image that were still sold at the time .
he hired streetworkers to deal with signs of right-wing extremism among teenagers and enthusiastically backed the placement of so-called stumbling stones that remember people killed by the nazis in front of the houses where they once lived .
two more of these will be placed on thursday .
skiba said he also wants to install a sign that identifies hitler 's birth house in front of the building in the very near future .
while the austrian government rents the landmarked structure , the owner has so far refused to agree to a plaque that 's directly attached to its walls .
ideal use of building the owners 's unwillingness to sell the house has also been one of the main reasons why a so-called house of responsibility has not been set up inside it , skiba said .
another reason is that the building is currently not open to the public as it is used by an organization called lebenshilfe , which offers people with mental and other disabilities a place to work .
" that 's an ideal use for the building , " skiba said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franciscan nuns recently named a park in braunau in jägerstetter 's honor while he said that he regrets that he failed to name a fountain , bridge or street after franz jägerstetter , who was murdered by the nazis for refusing to join the army , he will wholeheartedly back plans to transform hitler 's birthplace into a documentation center once it is no longer needed by its current tenants .
" among the things that i still want to do as mayor , this has top priority , " the 59-year-old said .
some , such as braunau 's catholic pastor , think that it might still take some time .
" i think it 's too fresh , " said 65-year-old stefan hofer , who has preached at st. stephan 's church , where hitler was baptized , for the past 34 years .
he added that braunau was currently taking responsibility via its days of contemporary history , which began in 1992 with a symposium called " undesired heritage " that looked at how cities such as braunau , auschwitz , vichy or stalin 's birthplace gori deal with their heritage .
waiting for the green light but the scientific adviser of that event said that mayor skiba just needs to give the political green light for the house of responsibility .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gifts made by mentally disabled people are currently sold inside the house " if he says yes , i 'll raise the money , " said andreas maislinger , a historian and political scientist , adding that the house should look at the past , present and future by giving visitors information about hitler and his crimes , offering space for organizations such as lebenshilfe and serving as a place that promotes intercultural understanding by inviting young chinese and japanese , indians and pakistanis , israelis and palestinians and others to get to know each other during a stay in braunau .
" we 're already doing that throughout the world , " said maislinger , who also founded an organization that offers young austrians an opportunity to complete their compulsory community service abroad .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.09.2006 opinion : it 's time to formulate the lebanon mission clearly großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german cabinet has agreed to send 2,400 troops to patrol the waters along lebanon 's coast .
but going there is easier than coming back , according to deutsche welle 's nina werkhäuser . it was a decision with " historical dimensions " for germany .
those were the words chancellor angela merkel used to describe the cabinet 's consent to send naval units to the middle east .
indeed , it is a historical decision to send armed german soldiers to the mideast .
for the last 60 years , such a mission would have been unthinkable because it was thought , for understandable historical reasons , that there should be as great a distance as possible between german troops and israel . that such a german foreign policy taboo could be broken may be astonishing .
but de facto , berlin had no other choice .
if germany had withdrawn from the mission , it would have laid the credibility of its foreign policy on the line and would have made berlin 's attempts to stabilize the situation in the mideast in the past few weeks seem absurd . israel explicitly wished for the bundeswehr 's participation .
that was not only the most important condition , it was an obligation .
without israel 's endorsement , angela merkel 's cabinet never would have approved of the mission . nevertheless , there is still a clearly defined line on the ground that the german government has decided not to cross : there will be no ground troops in the middle east .
other countries in the unifil mission should and will take over this responsibility .
they will have the difficult task of working together with the lebanese army to keep hezbollah in check .
how that should be done is still not clear , however . losing focus of peacekeeping mission purposes berlin is steering clear of that dilemma and is concentrating on its naval mission , which is supposed to hinder the delivery of arms via the sea to hezbollah militants .
it is difficult to say at this moment how effective that will be . germany will lead a european naval flotilla that has been granted a robust mandate ; it can stop and search incoming ships by force , if necessary .
despite the potential danger , the risk remains calculable .
yet only with this mandate will the parliament approve this week 's cabinet decision , when it comes up for a vote next week . that support nevertheless is guaranteed .
the vote will then turn the bundeswehr into an army that knows no borders .
but germany is paying a high price for this move , particularly when the choice of peacekeeping missions has become a bit random in nature .
the interests in the middle east are understandable .
but is a peacekeeping operation in the democratic republic of congo really necessary ? the large new mission in the middle east with up to 2,400 soldiers could , like the operations in kosovo and afghanistan , last for years .
and there is no guarantee for success .
such questions should make the german government clearly formulate its security policies .
this mission provides the opportunity to develop a definite exit strategy .
there is still time to do this . nina werkhäuser is dw radio 's correspondent to the german parliament in berlin . -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cabinet gives green light to lebanon mission germany 's cabinet authorized the deployment of ships to the middle east as part of the un force in lebanon .

the first rabbis to be ordained in germany since the nazi era will take their vows at a synagogue in dresden thursday . the three men involved have just completed a five-year course of study at the abraham geiger college , which was founded in berlin in 1999 amid reservations from many jews . " we are the only university-level training institute on continental europe , " the university 's rector , walter homolka , told dpa news service .
" there is an enormous demand for rabbis in europe and the rest of the world . " the last jewish seminary in germany was shut in 1942 and no rabbis have been ordained in the country since . bildunterschrift : since 1991 , the synagogue on oranienburger street in berlin has been a center of renewed jewish life after their ordination in dresden on thursday , the three rabbis will take up different posts .
czech-born tom kucera will be based in munich , daniel alter in oldenburg and south african malcolm matitani in cape town . showing reservation abraham geiger , the college 's namesake , was one of the most important thinkers in liberal judaism and was himself a rabbi in berlin from 1870 to 1875 . initially jewish organizations abroad expressed reservations about rabbis being trained in germany , according to homolka . " one colleague said he could not understand why we wanted to establish such an institution on the ashes of 6 million victims of the shoa -lrb- holocaust -rrb- , " the rector said . kucera , who comes from the czech republic and who was originally a biochemistry student , admits he had mixed feelings the first time he stood in front of berlin 's landmark brandenburg gate . " flashes from the past shot through my mind , " he says .
" of course the past has to be remembered , but today it 's more about the future . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rabbis have similar duties to priests - but not exactly the same .
for instance , no incense kucera , 35 , says he has experienced the growth of jewish communities in his native country , but without the presence of rabbis . " that was a major factor of motivation for me , " he said , adding that he also enjoys imparting knowledge to people . the college , which is attached to the university of potsdam , a 30-minute journey from the german capital , means that students no longer have to travel abroad to become a rabbi , homolka said .
many of those who went to london or the us for training never returned . practical training there are currently 12 students at the berlin college , where they learn the practical work of a rabbi 's duties . like a pastor or priest in the christian church , a rabbi leads one or more congregations , presiding over key lifetime ceremonies like weddings and funerals for its members .
he - or she , in some liberal congregations - leads worship services , offers counselling , and can even help to settle legal disputes among members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler says ordination is an ' important step ' the three rabbis completed their academic training at potsdam university , where there is a chair of rabbinical studies and liturgy . graduates can obtain a master 's degree in jewish studies - a course which takes in commentaries on jewish law , religious philosophy , religious history , sociology , liturgy , synagogue music and counselling .
there are also lessons in hebrew , aramaic and , on request , yiddish . students spend a year of the course studying at an israeli university , and also do practical work in jewish communities . köhler praises graduates germany today has a jewish population of 100,000 , compared to 600,000 before the start of world war ii .
there are some 100 jewish communities in the country today , served by around 25 rabbis . meanwhile , german president horst köhler called the first ordination of rabbis in germany in 64 years a special occasion . " after the holocaust , many people could not imagine that jewish life would one day blossom in germany again , " köhler said in a public statement . he called the ordinations " an important step " to a gradual normalization and less self-consciousness .
" together we must make sure that we achieve this ; remain open for change , but also continue to remember the bitter past . " dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " germany should lead fight against anti-semitism " more than 60 years after the holocaust , jewish life is beginning to flourish again in germany .

the first rabbis to be ordained in germany since the nazi era will take their vows at a synagogue in dresden thursday . the three men involved have just completed a five-year course of study at the abraham geiger college , which was founded in berlin in 1999 amid reservations from many jews . " we are the only university-level training institute on continental europe , " the university 's rector , walter homolka , told dpa news service .
" there is an enormous demand for rabbis in europe and the rest of the world . " the last jewish seminary in germany was shut in 1942 and no rabbis have been ordained in the country since . bildunterschrift : since 1991 , the synagogue on oranienburger street in berlin has been a center of renewed jewish life after their ordination in dresden on thursday , the three rabbis will take up different posts .
czech-born tom kucera will be based in munich , daniel alter in oldenburg and south african malcolm matitani in cape town . showing reservation abraham geiger , the college 's namesake , was one of the most important thinkers in liberal judaism and was himself a rabbi in berlin from 1870 to 1875 . initially jewish organizations abroad expressed reservations about rabbis being trained in germany , according to homolka . " one colleague said he could not understand why we wanted to establish such an institution on the ashes of 6 million victims of the shoa -lrb- holocaust -rrb- , " the rector said . kucera , who comes from the czech republic and who was originally a biochemistry student , admits he had mixed feelings the first time he stood in front of berlin 's landmark brandenburg gate . " flashes from the past shot through my mind , " he says .
" of course the past has to be remembered , but today it 's more about the future . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rabbis have similar duties to priests - but not exactly the same .
for instance , no incense kucera , 35 , says he has experienced the growth of jewish communities in his native country , but without the presence of rabbis . " that was a major factor of motivation for me , " he said , adding that he also enjoys imparting knowledge to people . the college , which is attached to the university of potsdam , a 30-minute journey from the german capital , means that students no longer have to travel abroad to become a rabbi , homolka said .
many of those who went to london or the us for training never returned . practical training there are currently 12 students at the berlin college , where they learn the practical work of a rabbi 's duties . like a pastor or priest in the christian church , a rabbi leads one or more congregations , presiding over key lifetime ceremonies like weddings and funerals for its members .
he - or she , in some liberal congregations - leads worship services , offers counselling , and can even help to settle legal disputes among members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler says ordination is an ' important step ' the three rabbis completed their academic training at potsdam university , where there is a chair of rabbinical studies and liturgy . graduates can obtain a master 's degree in jewish studies - a course which takes in commentaries on jewish law , religious philosophy , religious history , sociology , liturgy , synagogue music and counselling .
there are also lessons in hebrew , aramaic and , on request , yiddish . students spend a year of the course studying at an israeli university , and also do practical work in jewish communities . köhler praises graduates germany today has a jewish population of 100,000 , compared to 600,000 before the start of world war ii .
there are some 100 jewish communities in the country today , served by around 25 rabbis . meanwhile , german president horst köhler called the first ordination of rabbis in germany in 64 years a special occasion . " after the holocaust , many people could not imagine that jewish life would one day blossom in germany again , " köhler said in a public statement . he called the ordinations " an important step " to a gradual normalization and less self-consciousness .
" together we must make sure that we achieve this ; remain open for change , but also continue to remember the bitter past . " dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " germany should lead fight against anti-semitism " more than 60 years after the holocaust , jewish life is beginning to flourish again in germany .

it was his last event on his personal six-day trip to his native bavaria homeland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many pilgrims spent the night at a field outside of regensburg for an outdoor mass on tuesday martina baumgarnter , a 22-year-old student from erding near munich , told ap news agency that the trip had shown her the warmer side of the 79-year-old former theologian who succeeded the charismatic john paul ii last year . " i had an image of him as being more distant than his predecessor , that has changed a lot , " baumgartner said . personal visit the visit is likely to be remembered as a sentimental stroll down memory lane in what the 79-year-old pope himself admitted may be his final major visit to his homeland . the emotional high point of the trip came on wednesday when the pontiff knelt in prayer at the graves of his mother , father and sister . the private prayers at the tiny ziegetsdorf cemetery outside the city of regensburg came on a day which the vatican said had been reserved for " private time " for the pope and his elder brother georg . following the 20-minute visit , the two brothers went the short distance to the house in the neighboring suburb of pentling , which the head of the roman catholic church has owned since he was a theology professor at regensburg university . pope focused on family in an earlier address , the pope had appealed for unity within the roman catholic church , where pressure groups have challenged his traditional views of marriage and the family . " just as in an organ an expert hand must constantly bring disharmony back to consonance , so we in the church ... always need to find anew , through our communion in faith , harmony in the praise of god and in fraternal love . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope , at a mass at the islinger field in regensburg on tuesday on tuesday benedict had hit the only political note of his visit , during which his addresses have been almost entirely spiritual , when he fleetingly criticised the islamic concept of " jihad . " " violence is incompatible with the nature of god and the nature of the soul , " the pope had said in a complex treatise on reason and faith . his comments drew criticism on wednesday from a leading muslim figure in italy .

should online pharmacies be prohibited because they can undercut prices and drive out competition ?
the doc morris case has raised tough legal issues . a state administrative court in the state of saarland decided on wednesday that the dutch online pharmaceutical company doc morris has to shut down its first and only branch in germany until the european court of justice reaches a final verdict on the legality of the business . after opening in july , a doc morris branch in the city of saarbrücken met with immediate criticism from private pharmacists in the region .
they protested the legality of the online discounter on the grounds that they would n't be able to match its prices . critics also referenced a german law which stipulates that pharmacies may only be run by trained pharmacists , not by corporate entities . a final decision has yet to be made bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional pharmacies feel threatened by the discounter " the pharmacists want to do everything to push us out of the market , " said doc morris director ralf däinghaus . on aug .
9 the state court in saarbrücken rejected petitions for the closure of the german pharmaceutical branch , citing freedom of establishment under european law .
wednesday 's decision for its temporary closure was issued because three saarbrücken pharmacies have filed an appeal . the european court of justice will have to assess the apparent contradiction between germany 's pharmacy law and the european union 's freedom of establishment law . the state government in saarland is opposed to the administrative court 's decision and has said it considers it legal for doc morris to conduct business in germany . saarland 's minister of health josef hecken said the state government will appeal wednesday 's decision to the state 's higher administrative court . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court allows controversial discount pharmacy in germany a german court on wednesday ruled that a dutch internet pharmacy can operate a branch in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the pope in bavaria opinion : a calculated risk pope benedict xvi : " we have a positive idea to offer " the pope as pop star in bavaria pope benedict confounds critics with kinder , gentler image germany -pipe- 14.09.2006 " he must finally take some action " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : küng is the president of the foundation for global ethics hans küng , a respected scholar of theology and philosophy , likens pope benedict xvi in some ways to us president george bush .
he says both need to come down from the sky and take a look at the reality on the ground . dw-world.de : what did you think of pope benedict 's visit ? hans küng : i think many people here in germany have an ambivalent impression .
benedict has a very nice personality ; he 's shown himself as a very friendly person .
he 's also not a media pope like his predecessor .
he 's not an actor who is looking for applause . he concentrates on the central truths of christianity and faith in god .
on the other hand , he did n't accomplish any of the reforms to the catholic church that some people were looking for . which reforms ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : küng compared the pope to another leader , george w. bush there are a great many things .
if you take the situation around munich , a lot of parishes are without priests .
and just having a lot of people in the seats does n't mean that they are all believers . of course everybody finds it a very stimulating event to see the pope up close and lots of people are looking for a spiritual father and a more credible representative of moral integrity , justice and peace than many politicians today . but there were fewer people at the liturgy than had been expected .
we should not think that all those who were coming to see a star are now convinced and faithful catholic believers . why do n't you think that the great wave of enthusiasm that greeted the pope could have a vitalizing effect on the church ? it would be great if it had consistent consequences .
it is not enough to preach and have a big event .
the most recent public opinion poll by mckinsey asked whether the catholic church should be reformed and 43 percent said yes .
this is 40 percent more than before . in the same poll , 45 percent - nearly half of all germans - said they have no confidence in the catholic church as an institution . the people in munich were very happy - they have a german pope , a bavarian pope .
it the event had been held in magdeburg , in a new german state , where only 8 percent are registered as christians , we would have had a different image of germany . what do you think about the pope 's comments on the unity of the church ?
do you think he could influence more cooperation between the catholics and the protestants ? of course he could .
i was very pleased that the german president , horst köhler , who is a member of the global ethic foundation , said when the pope arrived : " in the name of many christians in this country , more ecumenical progress . "
and the pope answered in a very convincing way .
he said he would do everything to bring catholic and protestants together . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope blessed the organ but overlooked deeper issues , said küng afterwards , when he met with other christians all the controversial issues between catholics and protestants were just ignored .
most people here in germany would have to have a common eucharist , the acknowledgement of the ministers of the protestant churches .
they would have a solution for marriages from different churches , and of course the problem of papal jurisdiction and infallibility .
all this was practically ignored .
even the representatives of the protestant churches did n't have the courage to mention it . do you feel that the changes you 've mentioned , including unity among christians , will be possible during the tenure of the current pope ? i had a long conversation with him , which i 'm very grateful for .
i still hope that he will finally see that he can not only talk - he must finally take some action .
and i still hope that , after a certain time of reflection , he will do something . sometimes i have the impression he 's like president bush , who takes his air force one jet and flies over new orleans just to see how the situation is .
but finally he had to come down to the ground to see what the reality is . the diocese in regensburg , where the pope was , is probably the most divided diocese in germany .
the bishop of regensburg replaced practically all the elected members of the diocesan council in an authoritarian way with like-minded people .
and people could not understand why the pope just made comments about the organ in the regensburg church in the presence of this bishop . hans küng was professor of ecumenical theology and director of the institute for ecumenical research at the university of tübingen from 1960 until his retirement in 1996 .
he also served as official theological consultant to the second vatican council appointed by pope john xxiii .
küng has published numerous books on christianity , the catholic church and ethics . rob turner interviewed hans küng -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope urges faithful to stand up for beliefs against " fanaticism " pope benedict xvi urged pilgrims at a giant open-air mass in regensburg to stand up for their beliefs in the face of the " hatred and fanaticism " tarnishing religion .

it was his last event on his personal six-day trip to his native bavaria homeland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many pilgrims spent the night at a field outside of regensburg for an outdoor mass on tuesday martina baumgarnter , a 22-year-old student from erding near munich , told ap news agency that the trip had shown her the warmer side of the 79-year-old former theologian who succeeded the charismatic john paul ii last year . " i had an image of him as being more distant than his predecessor , that has changed a lot , " baumgartner said . personal visit the visit is likely to be remembered as a sentimental stroll down memory lane in what the 79-year-old pope himself admitted may be his final major visit to his homeland . the emotional high point of the trip came on wednesday when the pontiff knelt in prayer at the graves of his mother , father and sister . the private prayers at the tiny ziegetsdorf cemetery outside the city of regensburg came on a day which the vatican said had been reserved for " private time " for the pope and his elder brother georg . following the 20-minute visit , the two brothers went the short distance to the house in the neighboring suburb of pentling , which the head of the roman catholic church has owned since he was a theology professor at regensburg university . pope focused on family in an earlier address , the pope had appealed for unity within the roman catholic church , where pressure groups have challenged his traditional views of marriage and the family . " just as in an organ an expert hand must constantly bring disharmony back to consonance , so we in the church ... always need to find anew , through our communion in faith , harmony in the praise of god and in fraternal love . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope , at a mass at the islinger field in regensburg on tuesday on tuesday benedict had hit the only political note of his visit , during which his addresses have been almost entirely spiritual , when he fleetingly criticised the islamic concept of " jihad . " " violence is incompatible with the nature of god and the nature of the soul , " the pope had said in a complex treatise on reason and faith . his comments drew criticism on wednesday from a leading muslim figure in italy .
ejaz ahmad , a member of an italian governmental consultative committee on islam , called on him to retract them . " the muslim world is currently undergoing a deep crisis and any attack from the west can aggravate this crisis , " ahmad was quoted as saying by italy 's ansa news agency . " in his speech the pope overlooks the fact that islam was the cradle of science and that muslims were the first to translate greek philosophers before they became part of european history , " he said . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope enjoys private time near end of german trip pope benedict xvi knelt in prayer at the graves of his mother , father and sister on wednesday in the emotional highpoint of his six-day visit to his native bavaria .

europe 's largest economy has been resilient in spite of high oil prices , but the imf says hazards still lurk . germany 's stock market has been booming for more than three years .
the country 's companies have been enjoying better than average profits during that time .

" but berlin 's measures to lower spending , such as merging unemployment and welfare benefits were not having as much as an effect that had been expected , rajan said .
he suggested lowering income taxes to help spur private consumption , recommending more flexibility in the labor market and increased competition in the banking and utilities sectors . adding more kick to the economy , rajan said , alluding to reforms , would not necessarily mean lower incomes or the end of germany 's welfare state . europe should take advantage of growth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eurozone is expected to grow 2.4 percent the imf is not alone in its optimism regards germany .

after that , the imf expects growth to stagnate to 1.3 percent . the economy in the euro zone is experiencing growth not seen since the dot.com days , expected to hit 2.4 percent .
rajan views the stronger developments as an opportunity to pare down public deficits , in line with the eu 's stability and growth pact target to hold such shortfalls to 3.0 percent or less of total output .
as for germany , he echoed his calls for reforms to europe . " europe 's leaders need to find the will to take on vested interests in both labor and in the corporate sector , " said rajan .

while braunau will honor two nazi victims on thursday , the austrian town still lacks a place that deals with its most infamous son .
sixty years after the end of world war ii , some say it 's still too early . braunau is almost a town like many others on the austrian-bavarian border .
a church spire towers over the city and youngsters meet up at a fountain in the town square , which is lined with shops and cafés that are famous for their strudels .
bookstores have decorated their windows with the works of pope benedict xvi . , who was born just around the corner , in marktl .
the village lies almost exactly between germany 's most important place of pilgrimage , altötting , and braunau , where adolf hitler was born - between heaven and hell , as some said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : braunau sits across the river inn from the bavarian town of simbach it 's definitely not a label that pleases most of the 17,300 braunauers , who have struggled with this burden of coincidence since 1945 .
they have lived with the stigma of coming from the same place as the man responsible for the murder of millions .
they know that it 's sometimes easier to tell people that they come from " near salzburg . "
while marktl likes to forget that the pope only lived there for two years and has no personal memories of his time there , braunauers take pains to point out that hitler left at around the same age .
a stone as tourist attraction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : braunau 's picturesque town square " believe me , i 'd much rather have the pope in braunau , " said klaus prexl , head of the local tourism office , who looks like one of the many tanned visitors who stop by on their bicycle tours through the region .
but prexl does n't have the catholic leader on offer and instead struggles to deal with continuing interest in hitler .
" every second or third guest asks about the house , " he said after one woman visiting from poland came in to find out how she could get to the building where the dictator was born .
like all the others , prexl sends her down the street , through the city tower , then it 'll come up on your left-hand side , watch out for the stone of admonition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stone 's still the only marker that hitler was born here " for peace , freedom and democracy , " reads the inscription on the stone , which comes from the nearby nazi concentration camp in mauthausen .
" never again fascism .
the millions of dead are a reminder . "
it 's the only reference to the fact that hitler was born here and , according to prexl , it 's not enough .
" i think it 's time for a documentation center , " said the 57-year-old .
" it exists in all the places where he committed crimes and we conceal it .
it 's been talked about forever , but there are local political influences that do n't want it . "
taking on responsibility far from it , countered gerhard skiba , braunau 's mayor since 1989 .
shortly after taking office , the self-declared socialist and member of austria 's social democratic party decided to place the stone in front of the house just in time for the 100th anniversary of hitler 's birthday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : braunau 's mayor gerhard skiba in his office " there were pretty serious protests , " skiba said , adding that he even received some death threats .
" people said : ' we do n't need that , the stone could be a target for attacks . " '
he also cleansed the town of hitler souvenirs such as beer mugs , ashtrays and wine bottles with the nazi leader 's image that were still sold at the time .
he hired streetworkers to deal with signs of right-wing extremism among teenagers and enthusiastically backed the placement of so-called stumbling stones that remember people killed by the nazis in front of the houses where they once lived .
two more of these will be placed on thursday .
skiba said he also wants to install a sign that identifies hitler 's birth house in front of the building in the very near future .
while the austrian government rents the landmarked structure , the owner has so far refused to agree to a plaque that 's directly attached to its walls .
ideal use of building the owners 's unwillingness to sell the house has also been one of the main reasons why a so-called house of responsibility has not been set up inside it , skiba said .
another reason is that the building is currently not open to the public as it is used by an organization called lebenshilfe , which offers people with mental and other disabilities a place to work .
" that 's an ideal use for the building , " skiba said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franciscan nuns recently named a park in braunau in jägerstetter 's honor while he said that he regrets that he failed to name a fountain , bridge or street after franz jägerstetter , who was murdered by the nazis for refusing to join the army , he will wholeheartedly back plans to transform hitler 's birthplace into a documentation center once it is no longer needed by its current tenants .
" among the things that i still want to do as mayor , this has top priority , " the 59-year-old said .
some , such as braunau 's catholic pastor , think that it might still take some time .
" i think it 's too fresh , " said 65-year-old stefan hofer , who has preached at st. stephan 's church , where hitler was baptized , for the past 34 years .
he added that braunau was currently taking responsibility via its days of contemporary history , which began in 1992 with a symposium called " undesired heritage " that looked at how cities such as braunau , auschwitz , vichy or stalin 's birthplace gori deal with their heritage .
waiting for the green light but the scientific adviser of that event said that mayor skiba just needs to give the political green light for the house of responsibility .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gifts made by mentally disabled people are currently sold inside the house " if he says yes , i 'll raise the money , " said andreas maislinger , a historian and political scientist , adding that the house should look at the past , present and future by giving visitors information about hitler and his crimes , offering space for organizations such as lebenshilfe and serving as a place that promotes intercultural understanding by inviting young chinese and japanese , indians and pakistanis , israelis and palestinians and others to get to know each other during a stay in braunau .
" we 're already doing that throughout the world , " said maislinger , who also founded an organization that offers young austrians an opportunity to complete their compulsory community service abroad .
" it 's all ready to go , " he said .

but prexl does n't have the catholic leader on offer and instead struggles to deal with continuing interest in hitler .
" every second or third guest asks about the house , " he said after one woman visiting from poland came in to find out how she could get to the building where the dictator was born .
like all the others , prexl sends her down the street , through the city tower , then it 'll come up on your left-hand side , watch out for the stone of admonition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stone 's still the only marker that hitler was born here " for peace , freedom and democracy , " reads the inscription on the stone , which comes from the nearby nazi concentration camp in mauthausen .
" never again fascism .
the millions of dead are a reminder . "
it 's the only reference to the fact that hitler was born here and , according to prexl , it 's not enough .
" i think it 's time for a documentation center , " said the 57-year-old .
" it exists in all the places where he committed crimes and we conceal it .
it 's been talked about forever , but there are local political influences that do n't want it . "
taking on responsibility far from it , countered gerhard skiba , braunau 's mayor since 1989 .
shortly after taking office , the self-declared socialist and member of austria 's social democratic party decided to place the stone in front of the house just in time for the 100th anniversary of hitler 's birthday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : braunau 's mayor gerhard skiba in his office " there were pretty serious protests , " skiba said , adding that he even received some death threats .
" people said : ' we do n't need that , the stone could be a target for attacks . " '
he also cleansed the town of hitler souvenirs such as beer mugs , ashtrays and wine bottles with the nazi leader 's image that were still sold at the time .
he hired streetworkers to deal with signs of right-wing extremism among teenagers and enthusiastically backed the placement of so-called stumbling stones that remember people killed by the nazis in front of the houses where they once lived .
two more of these will be placed on thursday .
skiba said he also wants to install a sign that identifies hitler 's birth house in front of the building in the very near future .
while the austrian government rents the landmarked structure , the owner has so far refused to agree to a plaque that 's directly attached to its walls .
ideal use of building the owners 's unwillingness to sell the house has also been one of the main reasons why a so-called house of responsibility has not been set up inside it , skiba said .
another reason is that the building is currently not open to the public as it is used by an organization called lebenshilfe , which offers people with mental and other disabilities a place to work .
" that 's an ideal use for the building , " skiba said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franciscan nuns recently named a park in braunau in jägerstetter 's honor while he said that he regrets that he failed to name a fountain , bridge or street after franz jägerstetter , who was murdered by the nazis for refusing to join the army , he will wholeheartedly back plans to transform hitler 's birthplace into a documentation center once it is no longer needed by its current tenants .
" among the things that i still want to do as mayor , this has top priority , " the 59-year-old said .
some , such as braunau 's catholic pastor , think that it might still take some time .
" i think it 's too fresh , " said 65-year-old stefan hofer , who has preached at st. stephan 's church , where hitler was baptized , for the past 34 years .
he added that braunau was currently taking responsibility via its days of contemporary history , which began in 1992 with a symposium called " undesired heritage " that looked at how cities such as braunau , auschwitz , vichy or stalin 's birthplace gori deal with their heritage .
waiting for the green light but the scientific adviser of that event said that mayor skiba just needs to give the political green light for the house of responsibility .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gifts made by mentally disabled people are currently sold inside the house " if he says yes , i 'll raise the money , " said andreas maislinger , a historian and political scientist , adding that the house should look at the past , present and future by giving visitors information about hitler and his crimes , offering space for organizations such as lebenshilfe and serving as a place that promotes intercultural understanding by inviting young chinese and japanese , indians and pakistanis , israelis and palestinians and others to get to know each other during a stay in braunau .
" we 're already doing that throughout the world , " said maislinger , who also founded an organization that offers young austrians an opportunity to complete their compulsory community service abroad .

while braunau will honor two nazi victims on thursday , the austrian town still lacks a place that deals with its most infamous son .
sixty years after the end of world war ii , some say it 's still too early . braunau is almost a town like many others on the austrian-bavarian border .
a church spire towers over the city and youngsters meet up at a fountain in the town square , which is lined with shops and cafés that are famous for their strudels .
bookstores have decorated their windows with the works of pope benedict xvi . , who was born just around the corner , in marktl .
the village lies almost exactly between germany 's most important place of pilgrimage , altötting , and braunau , where adolf hitler was born - between heaven and hell , as some said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : braunau sits across the river inn from the bavarian town of simbach it 's definitely not a label that pleases most of the 17,300 braunauers , who have struggled with this burden of coincidence since 1945 .
they have lived with the stigma of coming from the same place as the man responsible for the murder of millions .
they know that it 's sometimes easier to tell people that they come from " near salzburg . "
while marktl likes to forget that the pope only lived there for two years and has no personal memories of his time there , braunauers take pains to point out that hitler left at around the same age .

he says both need to come down from the sky and take a look at the reality on the ground . dw-world.de : what did you think of pope benedict 's visit ? hans küng : i think many people here in germany have an ambivalent impression .
benedict has a very nice personality ; he 's shown himself as a very friendly person .
he 's also not a media pope like his predecessor .
he 's not an actor who is looking for applause . he concentrates on the central truths of christianity and faith in god .
on the other hand , he did n't accomplish any of the reforms to the catholic church that some people were looking for . which reforms ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : küng compared the pope to another leader , george w. bush there are a great many things .
if you take the situation around munich , a lot of parishes are without priests .
and just having a lot of people in the seats does n't mean that they are all believers . of course everybody finds it a very stimulating event to see the pope up close and lots of people are looking for a spiritual father and a more credible representative of moral integrity , justice and peace than many politicians today . but there were fewer people at the liturgy than had been expected .
we should not think that all those who were coming to see a star are now convinced and faithful catholic believers . why do n't you think that the great wave of enthusiasm that greeted the pope could have a vitalizing effect on the church ? it would be great if it had consistent consequences .
it is not enough to preach and have a big event .
the most recent public opinion poll by mckinsey asked whether the catholic church should be reformed and 43 percent said yes .
this is 40 percent more than before . in the same poll , 45 percent - nearly half of all germans - said they have no confidence in the catholic church as an institution . the people in munich were very happy - they have a german pope , a bavarian pope .
it the event had been held in magdeburg , in a new german state , where only 8 percent are registered as christians , we would have had a different image of germany . what do you think about the pope 's comments on the unity of the church ?
do you think he could influence more cooperation between the catholics and the protestants ? of course he could .
i was very pleased that the german president , horst köhler , who is a member of the global ethic foundation , said when the pope arrived : " in the name of many christians in this country , more ecumenical progress . "
and the pope answered in a very convincing way .
he said he would do everything to bring catholic and protestants together . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope blessed the organ but overlooked deeper issues , said küng afterwards , when he met with other christians all the controversial issues between catholics and protestants were just ignored .
most people here in germany would have to have a common eucharist , the acknowledgement of the ministers of the protestant churches .
they would have a solution for marriages from different churches , and of course the problem of papal jurisdiction and infallibility .
all this was practically ignored .
even the representatives of the protestant churches did n't have the courage to mention it . do you feel that the changes you 've mentioned , including unity among christians , will be possible during the tenure of the current pope ? i had a long conversation with him , which i 'm very grateful for .
i still hope that he will finally see that he can not only talk - he must finally take some action .
and i still hope that , after a certain time of reflection , he will do something . sometimes i have the impression he 's like president bush , who takes his air force one jet and flies over new orleans just to see how the situation is .
but finally he had to come down to the ground to see what the reality is . the diocese in regensburg , where the pope was , is probably the most divided diocese in germany .
the bishop of regensburg replaced practically all the elected members of the diocesan council in an authoritarian way with like-minded people .
and people could not understand why the pope just made comments about the organ in the regensburg church in the presence of this bishop . hans küng was professor of ecumenical theology and director of the institute for ecumenical research at the university of tübingen from 1960 until his retirement in 1996 .
he also served as official theological consultant to the second vatican council appointed by pope john xxiii .

he says both need to come down from the sky and take a look at the reality on the ground . dw-world.de : what did you think of pope benedict 's visit ? hans küng : i think many people here in germany have an ambivalent impression .
benedict has a very nice personality ; he 's shown himself as a very friendly person .
he 's also not a media pope like his predecessor .
he 's not an actor who is looking for applause . he concentrates on the central truths of christianity and faith in god .
on the other hand , he did n't accomplish any of the reforms to the catholic church that some people were looking for . which reforms ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : küng compared the pope to another leader , george w. bush there are a great many things .
if you take the situation around munich , a lot of parishes are without priests .
and just having a lot of people in the seats does n't mean that they are all believers . of course everybody finds it a very stimulating event to see the pope up close and lots of people are looking for a spiritual father and a more credible representative of moral integrity , justice and peace than many politicians today . but there were fewer people at the liturgy than had been expected .
we should not think that all those who were coming to see a star are now convinced and faithful catholic believers . why do n't you think that the great wave of enthusiasm that greeted the pope could have a vitalizing effect on the church ? it would be great if it had consistent consequences .
it is not enough to preach and have a big event .
the most recent public opinion poll by mckinsey asked whether the catholic church should be reformed and 43 percent said yes .
this is 40 percent more than before . in the same poll , 45 percent - nearly half of all germans - said they have no confidence in the catholic church as an institution . the people in munich were very happy - they have a german pope , a bavarian pope .
it the event had been held in magdeburg , in a new german state , where only 8 percent are registered as christians , we would have had a different image of germany . what do you think about the pope 's comments on the unity of the church ?
do you think he could influence more cooperation between the catholics and the protestants ? of course he could .
i was very pleased that the german president , horst köhler , who is a member of the global ethic foundation , said when the pope arrived : " in the name of many christians in this country , more ecumenical progress . "
and the pope answered in a very convincing way .
he said he would do everything to bring catholic and protestants together . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope blessed the organ but overlooked deeper issues , said küng afterwards , when he met with other christians all the controversial issues between catholics and protestants were just ignored .
most people here in germany would have to have a common eucharist , the acknowledgement of the ministers of the protestant churches .
they would have a solution for marriages from different churches , and of course the problem of papal jurisdiction and infallibility .
all this was practically ignored .
even the representatives of the protestant churches did n't have the courage to mention it . do you feel that the changes you 've mentioned , including unity among christians , will be possible during the tenure of the current pope ? i had a long conversation with him , which i 'm very grateful for .
i still hope that he will finally see that he can not only talk - he must finally take some action .
and i still hope that , after a certain time of reflection , he will do something . sometimes i have the impression he 's like president bush , who takes his air force one jet and flies over new orleans just to see how the situation is .
but finally he had to come down to the ground to see what the reality is . the diocese in regensburg , where the pope was , is probably the most divided diocese in germany .
the bishop of regensburg replaced practically all the elected members of the diocesan council in an authoritarian way with like-minded people .
and people could not understand why the pope just made comments about the organ in the regensburg church in the presence of this bishop . hans küng was professor of ecumenical theology and director of the institute for ecumenical research at the university of tübingen from 1960 until his retirement in 1996 .
he also served as official theological consultant to the second vatican council appointed by pope john xxiii .

europe 's largest economy has been resilient in spite of high oil prices , but the imf says hazards still lurk . germany 's stock market has been booming for more than three years .
the country 's companies have been enjoying better than average profits during that time .
now , it is starting to pay dividends and the international monetary fund , in its twice-yearly assessment of the global economy , has raised its 2006 economic growth forecasts for germany to 2 percent from its prediction of 1.3 percent in the spring . at its meeting in singapore , the imf 's chief economist raghuram rajan praised europe 's largest economy , saying " it was on a roll . " but berlin 's measures to lower spending , such as merging unemployment and welfare benefits were not having as much as an effect that had been expected , rajan said .
he suggested lowering income taxes to help spur private consumption , recommending more flexibility in the labor market and increased competition in the banking and utilities sectors . adding more kick to the economy , rajan said , alluding to reforms , would not necessarily mean lower incomes or the end of germany 's welfare state . europe should take advantage of growth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eurozone is expected to grow 2.4 percent the imf is not alone in its optimism regards germany .
the eu commission projects growth of 2.2 percent .
only berlin , possibly stung by overly rosy forecasts that went unmet in the recent past , sees more modest growth at 1.6 percent for the current year . a scheduled increase of germany 's value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- as of january will boost private spending until the end of this year .
after that , the imf expects growth to stagnate to 1.3 percent . the economy in the euro zone is experiencing growth not seen since the dot.com days , expected to hit 2.4 percent .
rajan views the stronger developments as an opportunity to pare down public deficits , in line with the eu 's stability and growth pact target to hold such shortfalls to 3.0 percent or less of total output .
as for germany , he echoed his calls for reforms to europe . " europe 's leaders need to find the will to take on vested interests in both labor and in the corporate sector , " said rajan .

" the ecb since december has raised its benchmark rate four times , taking it from 2.0 to 3.0 percent , and has made clear it intends to carry on with monetary tightening .

while braunau will honor two nazi victims on thursday , the austrian town still lacks a place that deals with its most infamous son .
sixty years after the end of world war ii , some say it 's still too early . braunau is almost a town like many others on the austrian-bavarian border .
a church spire towers over the city and youngsters meet up at a fountain in the town square , which is lined with shops and cafés that are famous for their strudels .
bookstores have decorated their windows with the works of pope benedict xvi . , who was born just around the corner , in marktl .
the village lies almost exactly between germany 's most important place of pilgrimage , altötting , and braunau , where adolf hitler was born - between heaven and hell , as some said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : braunau sits across the river inn from the bavarian town of simbach it 's definitely not a label that pleases most of the 17,300 braunauers , who have struggled with this burden of coincidence since 1945 .
they have lived with the stigma of coming from the same place as the man responsible for the murder of millions .
they know that it 's sometimes easier to tell people that they come from " near salzburg . "
while marktl likes to forget that the pope only lived there for two years and has no personal memories of his time there , braunauers take pains to point out that hitler left at around the same age .
a stone as tourist attraction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : braunau 's picturesque town square " believe me , i 'd much rather have the pope in braunau , " said klaus prexl , head of the local tourism office , who looks like one of the many tanned visitors who stop by on their bicycle tours through the region .
but prexl does n't have the catholic leader on offer and instead struggles to deal with continuing interest in hitler .
" every second or third guest asks about the house , " he said after one woman visiting from poland came in to find out how she could get to the building where the dictator was born .
like all the others , prexl sends her down the street , through the city tower , then it 'll come up on your left-hand side , watch out for the stone of admonition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stone 's still the only marker that hitler was born here " for peace , freedom and democracy , " reads the inscription on the stone , which comes from the nearby nazi concentration camp in mauthausen .
" never again fascism .
the millions of dead are a reminder . "
it 's the only reference to the fact that hitler was born here and , according to prexl , it 's not enough .
" i think it 's time for a documentation center , " said the 57-year-old .
" it exists in all the places where he committed crimes and we conceal it .
it 's been talked about forever , but there are local political influences that do n't want it . "
taking on responsibility far from it , countered gerhard skiba , braunau 's mayor since 1989 .
shortly after taking office , the self-declared socialist and member of austria 's social democratic party decided to place the stone in front of the house just in time for the 100th anniversary of hitler 's birthday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : braunau 's mayor gerhard skiba in his office " there were pretty serious protests , " skiba said , adding that he even received some death threats .
" people said : ' we do n't need that , the stone could be a target for attacks . " '
he also cleansed the town of hitler souvenirs such as beer mugs , ashtrays and wine bottles with the nazi leader 's image that were still sold at the time .
he hired streetworkers to deal with signs of right-wing extremism among teenagers and enthusiastically backed the placement of so-called stumbling stones that remember people killed by the nazis in front of the houses where they once lived .
two more of these will be placed on thursday .
skiba said he also wants to install a sign that identifies hitler 's birth house in front of the building in the very near future .
while the austrian government rents the landmarked structure , the owner has so far refused to agree to a plaque that 's directly attached to its walls .
ideal use of building the owners 's unwillingness to sell the house has also been one of the main reasons why a so-called house of responsibility has not been set up inside it , skiba said .
another reason is that the building is currently not open to the public as it is used by an organization called lebenshilfe , which offers people with mental and other disabilities a place to work .
" that 's an ideal use for the building , " skiba said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franciscan nuns recently named a park in braunau in jägerstetter 's honor while he said that he regrets that he failed to name a fountain , bridge or street after franz jägerstetter , who was murdered by the nazis for refusing to join the army , he will wholeheartedly back plans to transform hitler 's birthplace into a documentation center once it is no longer needed by its current tenants .
" among the things that i still want to do as mayor , this has top priority , " the 59-year-old said .
some , such as braunau 's catholic pastor , think that it might still take some time .
" i think it 's too fresh , " said 65-year-old stefan hofer , who has preached at st. stephan 's church , where hitler was baptized , for the past 34 years .
he added that braunau was currently taking responsibility via its days of contemporary history , which began in 1992 with a symposium called " undesired heritage " that looked at how cities such as braunau , auschwitz , vichy or stalin 's birthplace gori deal with their heritage .
waiting for the green light but the scientific adviser of that event said that mayor skiba just needs to give the political green light for the house of responsibility .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gifts made by mentally disabled people are currently sold inside the house " if he says yes , i 'll raise the money , " said andreas maislinger , a historian and political scientist , adding that the house should look at the past , present and future by giving visitors information about hitler and his crimes , offering space for organizations such as lebenshilfe and serving as a place that promotes intercultural understanding by inviting young chinese and japanese , indians and pakistanis , israelis and palestinians and others to get to know each other during a stay in braunau .
" we 're already doing that throughout the world , " said maislinger , who also founded an organization that offers young austrians an opportunity to complete their compulsory community service abroad .

while braunau will honor two nazi victims on thursday , the austrian town still lacks a place that deals with its most infamous son .
sixty years after the end of world war ii , some say it 's still too early . braunau is almost a town like many others on the austrian-bavarian border .
a church spire towers over the city and youngsters meet up at a fountain in the town square , which is lined with shops and cafés that are famous for their strudels .
bookstores have decorated their windows with the works of pope benedict xvi . , who was born just around the corner , in marktl .
the village lies almost exactly between germany 's most important place of pilgrimage , altötting , and braunau , where adolf hitler was born - between heaven and hell , as some said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : braunau sits across the river inn from the bavarian town of simbach it 's definitely not a label that pleases most of the 17,300 braunauers , who have struggled with this burden of coincidence since 1945 .
they have lived with the stigma of coming from the same place as the man responsible for the murder of millions .
they know that it 's sometimes easier to tell people that they come from " near salzburg . "
while marktl likes to forget that the pope only lived there for two years and has no personal memories of his time there , braunauers take pains to point out that hitler left at around the same age .
a stone as tourist attraction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : braunau 's picturesque town square " believe me , i 'd much rather have the pope in braunau , " said klaus prexl , head of the local tourism office , who looks like one of the many tanned visitors who stop by on their bicycle tours through the region .
but prexl does n't have the catholic leader on offer and instead struggles to deal with continuing interest in hitler .
" every second or third guest asks about the house , " he said after one woman visiting from poland came in to find out how she could get to the building where the dictator was born .
like all the others , prexl sends her down the street , through the city tower , then it 'll come up on your left-hand side , watch out for the stone of admonition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stone 's still the only marker that hitler was born here " for peace , freedom and democracy , " reads the inscription on the stone , which comes from the nearby nazi concentration camp in mauthausen .

he also cleansed the town of hitler souvenirs such as beer mugs , ashtrays and wine bottles with the nazi leader 's image that were still sold at the time .
he hired streetworkers to deal with signs of right-wing extremism among teenagers and enthusiastically backed the placement of so-called stumbling stones that remember people killed by the nazis in front of the houses where they once lived .
two more of these will be placed on thursday .
skiba said he also wants to install a sign that identifies hitler 's birth house in front of the building in the very near future .

of these , four came from rice produced in the us .
the origin of the other three positive samples is unknown . biotech rice is not allowed to be grown , sold or marketed in the eu . earlier eu reports of contaminated rice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace made initial claims in the aldi gm rice case the findings in baden-wurttemberg come just on the heels of reports concerning the discovery of ll601 in rice packages sold at the aldi nord supermarket chain in the northern regions of germany . the european federation of rice millers had tested 162 shipments of rice imported from the united states .
33 of them tested positive for genetically modified rice , the european commission said in a statement on monday . " any consignments which tested positive have already been recalled or withheld from the market and the federation 's members have committed to continuing such withdrawals for any positive findings , " the commission said monday . greenpeace genetics expert ulrike brendel said that the aldi products , sold under the bon-ri brand , had been contaminated with a strain of rice developed by german industrial giant bayer and tested in the united states . " we tested the samples at a respected and independent laboratory , " brendel said .

" a tainted biotech product rice found in eight of aldi nord 's 35 sales areas contained traces of ll601 - a rice strain engineered by bayer to resist certain bayer herbicides . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both aldi and edeka have removed the rice products in question from shelves aldi nord said documentation for the rice imports showed no signs of shipments containing genetically modified rice , but it removed the affected products from its shelves and was testing the countries of origins of other similar products . the european commission 's findings suggested gm material had been finding its way into the european market for some time .
considering that germany imports about one quarter of its rice from the us , brendel thought it was inevitable that a number of products and supermarket chains would be affected . " this modified strain of rice was planted in the us in 2001 , but only as a test crop , " brendel said .
" the fact we 're finding it here in imports shows that industry is n't capable of controlling genetically modified crops .

but going there is easier than coming back , according to deutsche welle 's nina werkhäuser . it was a decision with " historical dimensions " for germany .
those were the words chancellor angela merkel used to describe the cabinet 's consent to send naval units to the middle east .
indeed , it is a historical decision to send armed german soldiers to the mideast .
for the last 60 years , such a mission would have been unthinkable because it was thought , for understandable historical reasons , that there should be as great a distance as possible between german troops and israel . that such a german foreign policy taboo could be broken may be astonishing .
but de facto , berlin had no other choice .
if germany had withdrawn from the mission , it would have laid the credibility of its foreign policy on the line and would have made berlin 's attempts to stabilize the situation in the mideast in the past few weeks seem absurd . israel explicitly wished for the bundeswehr 's participation .
that was not only the most important condition , it was an obligation .
without israel 's endorsement , angela merkel 's cabinet never would have approved of the mission . nevertheless , there is still a clearly defined line on the ground that the german government has decided not to cross : there will be no ground troops in the middle east .
other countries in the unifil mission should and will take over this responsibility .

despite positive comments , solutions remained distant . a senior iranian envoy on thursday called contacts between tehran and the european union a " step in the right direction " in resolving the standoff over his country 's refusal to freeze uranium enrichment , but he accused the us of trying to sabotage the talks . ali ashgar soltanieh spoke as senior eu and iranian representatives met in a new round of negotiations on nuclear differences between tehran and the international community . that meeting , originally scheduled for paris , was moved in the last minute to geneva for " logistical reasons , " eu spokeswoman cristina gallach said , without elaboration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diplomatic talks are still continuing despite little progress only " the continuation of dialogue and negotiations free from any kind of threat , pressure or any preconditions can pave the way " to a negotiated solution of the impasse , soltanieh told a meeting of the international atomic energy agency 's 35-nation board shortly before the end of the four-day conference . us push for sanctions the meeting planned for thursday in paris between eu foreign policy chief javier solana and iran 's top nuclear negotiator ali larijani was postponed on short notice with no reason given . solana is negotiating with the iranians in the name of six major powers - the five permanent un security council members and germany - to encourage tehran to accept political and economic incentives to suspend uranium enrichment . the six powers , notably the us , fear iran is trying to develop nuclear weapons , a charge which tehran rejects saying it has only a civil nuclear power program . the us is pushing for un sanctions against iran for failing to honor an aug .

" on tuesday , the six nations failed to agree on a joint statement on iran at the iaea meeting due to the us call for sanctions and hesitance by russia and china to use that word , a western diplomat told news agencies . ' poisoned ' negotiations ? on thursday , an iranian official accused the us of " poisoning " the course of nuclear negotiations , the news agency isna reported . " the us intends to poison the course of the negotiations through constant antagonism , although iran has constantly stressed negotiations for realizing its nuclear rights , " foreign ministry spokesman mohammad-ali hosseini told dpa news service . comments in dakar iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad said thursday during a visit to dakar that iran would support unconditional talks on the nuclear dispute and that the issue could be settled as long as internationally-acknowledged laws were taken into consideration - a reference to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , which iran has signed . ahmadinejad will later this month travel to new york for the 61st session of the un general assembly , where he will once again challenge his american counterpart george w. bush to a television debate on both the nuclear dispute and the middle east conflict . dw staff -lrb- rar / jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sanctions against iran could cost 10,000 german jobs as world powers gear up for a new round of diplomacy to respond to iran 's refusal to halt uranium enrichment , germany 's main trade group said the country could lose 10,000 jobs if tehran is slapped with sanctions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 14.09.2006 german authorities confirm gm rice findings großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gentically modified rice is banned in the euopean union the discovery of genetically manipulated rice in supermarkets in southwestern germany has for the first time been officially confirmed by agricultural authorities , after eu reports of gm rice elsewhere in the country . traces of ll601 , a type of genetically manipulated rice from the us , were found in a product called " fit for fun trix reis-mix triathlon " sold at the edeka supermarket chain in the southwestern german state of baden-wurttemberg . the ministry of agriculture in stuttgart examined 46 rice samples , of which seven tested positive for genetically manipulated material , reported germany 's southwestern radio online .
of these , four came from rice produced in the us .
the origin of the other three positive samples is unknown . biotech rice is not allowed to be grown , sold or marketed in the eu . earlier eu reports of contaminated rice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace made initial claims in the aldi gm rice case the findings in baden-wurttemberg come just on the heels of reports concerning the discovery of ll601 in rice packages sold at the aldi nord supermarket chain in the northern regions of germany . the european federation of rice millers had tested 162 shipments of rice imported from the united states .
33 of them tested positive for genetically modified rice , the european commission said in a statement on monday . " any consignments which tested positive have already been recalled or withheld from the market and the federation 's members have committed to continuing such withdrawals for any positive findings , " the commission said monday . greenpeace genetics expert ulrike brendel said that the aldi products , sold under the bon-ri brand , had been contaminated with a strain of rice developed by german industrial giant bayer and tested in the united states . " we tested the samples at a respected and independent laboratory , " brendel said .
" the results show some of the rice has been modified using a method developed and published by bayer - there 's no doubt about it . " a tainted biotech product rice found in eight of aldi nord 's 35 sales areas contained traces of ll601 - a rice strain engineered by bayer to resist certain bayer herbicides . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both aldi and edeka have removed the rice products in question from shelves aldi nord said documentation for the rice imports showed no signs of shipments containing genetically modified rice , but it removed the affected products from its shelves and was testing the countries of origins of other similar products . the european commission 's findings suggested gm material had been finding its way into the european market for some time .
considering that germany imports about one quarter of its rice from the us , brendel thought it was inevitable that a number of products and supermarket chains would be affected . " this modified strain of rice was planted in the us in 2001 , but only as a test crop , " brendel said .
" the fact we 're finding it here in imports shows that industry is n't capable of controlling genetically modified crops .

" the results show some of the rice has been modified using a method developed and published by bayer - there 's no doubt about it .

europe 's largest economy has been resilient in spite of high oil prices , but the imf says hazards still lurk . germany 's stock market has been booming for more than three years .
the country 's companies have been enjoying better than average profits during that time .
now , it is starting to pay dividends and the international monetary fund , in its twice-yearly assessment of the global economy , has raised its 2006 economic growth forecasts for germany to 2 percent from its prediction of 1.3 percent in the spring . at its meeting in singapore , the imf 's chief economist raghuram rajan praised europe 's largest economy , saying " it was on a roll . " but berlin 's measures to lower spending , such as merging unemployment and welfare benefits were not having as much as an effect that had been expected , rajan said .
he suggested lowering income taxes to help spur private consumption , recommending more flexibility in the labor market and increased competition in the banking and utilities sectors . adding more kick to the economy , rajan said , alluding to reforms , would not necessarily mean lower incomes or the end of germany 's welfare state . europe should take advantage of growth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eurozone is expected to grow 2.4 percent the imf is not alone in its optimism regards germany .
the eu commission projects growth of 2.2 percent .
only berlin , possibly stung by overly rosy forecasts that went unmet in the recent past , sees more modest growth at 1.6 percent for the current year . a scheduled increase of germany 's value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- as of january will boost private spending until the end of this year .
after that , the imf expects growth to stagnate to 1.3 percent . the economy in the euro zone is experiencing growth not seen since the dot.com days , expected to hit 2.4 percent .
rajan views the stronger developments as an opportunity to pare down public deficits , in line with the eu 's stability and growth pact target to hold such shortfalls to 3.0 percent or less of total output .
as for germany , he echoed his calls for reforms to europe . " europe 's leaders need to find the will to take on vested interests in both labor and in the corporate sector , " said rajan .
" this necessary but difficult domestic battle is constantly postponed until after the next election , " he added . balancing inflation and interest rates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high oil prices will continue to threaten world economies rising oil prices have yet had a great effect on consumer prices but with a barrel of crude expected to hover around or above the $ 70 per barrel mark , inflation is a concern central banks around the world must face . the imf found that with euro zone inflation running " below but close to " the european central bank 's -lrb- ecb -rrb- 2.0 percent objective , " further interest rate increases will likely be needed to maintain price stability over the medium term if the expansion develops as expected . " the ecb since december has raised its benchmark rate four times , taking it from 2.0 to 3.0 percent , and has made clear it intends to carry on with monetary tightening .
but the imf cautioned : " with underlying inflationary pressures still well contained ... policymakers can afford to be cautious in tightening the monetary policy stance , all the more so given the risk of euro appreciation and weaker growth in the united states .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.09.2006 opinion : it 's time to formulate the lebanon mission clearly großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german cabinet has agreed to send 2,400 troops to patrol the waters along lebanon 's coast .
but going there is easier than coming back , according to deutsche welle 's nina werkhäuser . it was a decision with " historical dimensions " for germany .
those were the words chancellor angela merkel used to describe the cabinet 's consent to send naval units to the middle east .
indeed , it is a historical decision to send armed german soldiers to the mideast .
for the last 60 years , such a mission would have been unthinkable because it was thought , for understandable historical reasons , that there should be as great a distance as possible between german troops and israel . that such a german foreign policy taboo could be broken may be astonishing .
but de facto , berlin had no other choice .
if germany had withdrawn from the mission , it would have laid the credibility of its foreign policy on the line and would have made berlin 's attempts to stabilize the situation in the mideast in the past few weeks seem absurd . israel explicitly wished for the bundeswehr 's participation .
that was not only the most important condition , it was an obligation .
without israel 's endorsement , angela merkel 's cabinet never would have approved of the mission . nevertheless , there is still a clearly defined line on the ground that the german government has decided not to cross : there will be no ground troops in the middle east .
other countries in the unifil mission should and will take over this responsibility .
they will have the difficult task of working together with the lebanese army to keep hezbollah in check .
how that should be done is still not clear , however . losing focus of peacekeeping mission purposes berlin is steering clear of that dilemma and is concentrating on its naval mission , which is supposed to hinder the delivery of arms via the sea to hezbollah militants .
it is difficult to say at this moment how effective that will be . germany will lead a european naval flotilla that has been granted a robust mandate ; it can stop and search incoming ships by force , if necessary .
despite the potential danger , the risk remains calculable .
yet only with this mandate will the parliament approve this week 's cabinet decision , when it comes up for a vote next week . that support nevertheless is guaranteed .
the vote will then turn the bundeswehr into an army that knows no borders .
but germany is paying a high price for this move , particularly when the choice of peacekeeping missions has become a bit random in nature .
the interests in the middle east are understandable .
but is a peacekeeping operation in the democratic republic of congo really necessary ? the large new mission in the middle east with up to 2,400 soldiers could , like the operations in kosovo and afghanistan , last for years .
and there is no guarantee for success .
such questions should make the german government clearly formulate its security policies .
this mission provides the opportunity to develop a definite exit strategy .
there is still time to do this . nina werkhäuser is dw radio 's correspondent to the german parliament in berlin . -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cabinet gives green light to lebanon mission germany 's cabinet authorized the deployment of ships to the middle east as part of the un force in lebanon .

should online pharmacies be prohibited because they can undercut prices and drive out competition ?
the doc morris case has raised tough legal issues . a state administrative court in the state of saarland decided on wednesday that the dutch online pharmaceutical company doc morris has to shut down its first and only branch in germany until the european court of justice reaches a final verdict on the legality of the business . after opening in july , a doc morris branch in the city of saarbrücken met with immediate criticism from private pharmacists in the region .
they protested the legality of the online discounter on the grounds that they would n't be able to match its prices . critics also referenced a german law which stipulates that pharmacies may only be run by trained pharmacists , not by corporate entities . a final decision has yet to be made bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional pharmacies feel threatened by the discounter " the pharmacists want to do everything to push us out of the market , " said doc morris director ralf däinghaus . on aug .
9 the state court in saarbrücken rejected petitions for the closure of the german pharmaceutical branch , citing freedom of establishment under european law .
wednesday 's decision for its temporary closure was issued because three saarbrücken pharmacies have filed an appeal . the european court of justice will have to assess the apparent contradiction between germany 's pharmacy law and the european union 's freedom of establishment law . the state government in saarland is opposed to the administrative court 's decision and has said it considers it legal for doc morris to conduct business in germany . saarland 's minister of health josef hecken said the state government will appeal wednesday 's decision to the state 's higher administrative court . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court allows controversial discount pharmacy in germany a german court on wednesday ruled that a dutch internet pharmacy can operate a branch in germany .

should online pharmacies be prohibited because they can undercut prices and drive out competition ?
the doc morris case has raised tough legal issues . a state administrative court in the state of saarland decided on wednesday that the dutch online pharmaceutical company doc morris has to shut down its first and only branch in germany until the european court of justice reaches a final verdict on the legality of the business . after opening in july , a doc morris branch in the city of saarbrücken met with immediate criticism from private pharmacists in the region .
they protested the legality of the online discounter on the grounds that they would n't be able to match its prices . critics also referenced a german law which stipulates that pharmacies may only be run by trained pharmacists , not by corporate entities . a final decision has yet to be made bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional pharmacies feel threatened by the discounter " the pharmacists want to do everything to push us out of the market , " said doc morris director ralf däinghaus . on aug .
9 the state court in saarbrücken rejected petitions for the closure of the german pharmaceutical branch , citing freedom of establishment under european law .
wednesday 's decision for its temporary closure was issued because three saarbrücken pharmacies have filed an appeal . the european court of justice will have to assess the apparent contradiction between germany 's pharmacy law and the european union 's freedom of establishment law . the state government in saarland is opposed to the administrative court 's decision and has said it considers it legal for doc morris to conduct business in germany . saarland 's minister of health josef hecken said the state government will appeal wednesday 's decision to the state 's higher administrative court . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court allows controversial discount pharmacy in germany a german court on wednesday ruled that a dutch internet pharmacy can operate a branch in germany .

of these , four came from rice produced in the us .
the origin of the other three positive samples is unknown . biotech rice is not allowed to be grown , sold or marketed in the eu . earlier eu reports of contaminated rice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace made initial claims in the aldi gm rice case the findings in baden-wurttemberg come just on the heels of reports concerning the discovery of ll601 in rice packages sold at the aldi nord supermarket chain in the northern regions of germany . the european federation of rice millers had tested 162 shipments of rice imported from the united states .
33 of them tested positive for genetically modified rice , the european commission said in a statement on monday . " any consignments which tested positive have already been recalled or withheld from the market and the federation 's members have committed to continuing such withdrawals for any positive findings , " the commission said monday . greenpeace genetics expert ulrike brendel said that the aldi products , sold under the bon-ri brand , had been contaminated with a strain of rice developed by german industrial giant bayer and tested in the united states . " we tested the samples at a respected and independent laboratory , " brendel said .
" the results show some of the rice has been modified using a method developed and published by bayer - there 's no doubt about it . " a tainted biotech product rice found in eight of aldi nord 's 35 sales areas contained traces of ll601 - a rice strain engineered by bayer to resist certain bayer herbicides . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both aldi and edeka have removed the rice products in question from shelves aldi nord said documentation for the rice imports showed no signs of shipments containing genetically modified rice , but it removed the affected products from its shelves and was testing the countries of origins of other similar products . the european commission 's findings suggested gm material had been finding its way into the european market for some time .
considering that germany imports about one quarter of its rice from the us , brendel thought it was inevitable that a number of products and supermarket chains would be affected . " this modified strain of rice was planted in the us in 2001 , but only as a test crop , " brendel said .
" the fact we 're finding it here in imports shows that industry is n't capable of controlling genetically modified crops .
we do n't know what human health or environmental risks involved .
if we want to keep food sources free of genetically modified material , then we ca n't afford to plant gm crops . " declaring war on biotech rice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany imported 46,500 tons of rice from the us in 2005 alone last month the european commission slapped stringent testing requirements on rice imports from the us to try and stop genetically modified varieties from entering the 25 country-bloc . at the end of august , germany 's federal ministry of consumer protection ordered state-level authorities to step up their detection efforts . france and sweden have also discovered traces of a banned genetically modified substance in imported us rice , in tests which must be confirmed by eu laboratories , a european commission source said tuesday . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu caution puts brakes on gm food legislation eu leaders thursday stressed the need for more information and experience before further legislation can be passed on genetically-modified organisms , at the end of a two-day conference on gmos in vienna .

it was his last event on his personal six-day trip to his native bavaria homeland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many pilgrims spent the night at a field outside of regensburg for an outdoor mass on tuesday martina baumgarnter , a 22-year-old student from erding near munich , told ap news agency that the trip had shown her the warmer side of the 79-year-old former theologian who succeeded the charismatic john paul ii last year . " i had an image of him as being more distant than his predecessor , that has changed a lot , " baumgartner said . personal visit the visit is likely to be remembered as a sentimental stroll down memory lane in what the 79-year-old pope himself admitted may be his final major visit to his homeland . the emotional high point of the trip came on wednesday when the pontiff knelt in prayer at the graves of his mother , father and sister . the private prayers at the tiny ziegetsdorf cemetery outside the city of regensburg came on a day which the vatican said had been reserved for " private time " for the pope and his elder brother georg . following the 20-minute visit , the two brothers went the short distance to the house in the neighboring suburb of pentling , which the head of the roman catholic church has owned since he was a theology professor at regensburg university . pope focused on family in an earlier address , the pope had appealed for unity within the roman catholic church , where pressure groups have challenged his traditional views of marriage and the family . " just as in an organ an expert hand must constantly bring disharmony back to consonance , so we in the church ... always need to find anew , through our communion in faith , harmony in the praise of god and in fraternal love . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope , at a mass at the islinger field in regensburg on tuesday on tuesday benedict had hit the only political note of his visit , during which his addresses have been almost entirely spiritual , when he fleetingly criticised the islamic concept of " jihad . " " violence is incompatible with the nature of god and the nature of the soul , " the pope had said in a complex treatise on reason and faith . his comments drew criticism on wednesday from a leading muslim figure in italy .
ejaz ahmad , a member of an italian governmental consultative committee on islam , called on him to retract them . " the muslim world is currently undergoing a deep crisis and any attack from the west can aggravate this crisis , " ahmad was quoted as saying by italy 's ansa news agency . " in his speech the pope overlooks the fact that islam was the cradle of science and that muslims were the first to translate greek philosophers before they became part of european history , " he said . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope enjoys private time near end of german trip pope benedict xvi knelt in prayer at the graves of his mother , father and sister on wednesday in the emotional highpoint of his six-day visit to his native bavaria .

" any consignments which tested positive have already been recalled or withheld from the market and the federation 's members have committed to continuing such withdrawals for any positive findings , " the commission said monday . greenpeace genetics expert ulrike brendel said that the aldi products , sold under the bon-ri brand , had been contaminated with a strain of rice developed by german industrial giant bayer and tested in the united states .

of these , four came from rice produced in the us .
the origin of the other three positive samples is unknown . biotech rice is not allowed to be grown , sold or marketed in the eu . earlier eu reports of contaminated rice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace made initial claims in the aldi gm rice case the findings in baden-wurttemberg come just on the heels of reports concerning the discovery of ll601 in rice packages sold at the aldi nord supermarket chain in the northern regions of germany . the european federation of rice millers had tested 162 shipments of rice imported from the united states .
33 of them tested positive for genetically modified rice , the european commission said in a statement on monday . " any consignments which tested positive have already been recalled or withheld from the market and the federation 's members have committed to continuing such withdrawals for any positive findings , " the commission said monday . greenpeace genetics expert ulrike brendel said that the aldi products , sold under the bon-ri brand , had been contaminated with a strain of rice developed by german industrial giant bayer and tested in the united states . " we tested the samples at a respected and independent laboratory , " brendel said .
" the results show some of the rice has been modified using a method developed and published by bayer - there 's no doubt about it . " a tainted biotech product rice found in eight of aldi nord 's 35 sales areas contained traces of ll601 - a rice strain engineered by bayer to resist certain bayer herbicides . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both aldi and edeka have removed the rice products in question from shelves aldi nord said documentation for the rice imports showed no signs of shipments containing genetically modified rice , but it removed the affected products from its shelves and was testing the countries of origins of other similar products . the european commission 's findings suggested gm material had been finding its way into the european market for some time .
considering that germany imports about one quarter of its rice from the us , brendel thought it was inevitable that a number of products and supermarket chains would be affected . " this modified strain of rice was planted in the us in 2001 , but only as a test crop , " brendel said .
" the fact we 're finding it here in imports shows that industry is n't capable of controlling genetically modified crops .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.09.2006 germany to ordain first rabbis since nazi era großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : groundbreaking trio : -lrb- front row , left to right -rrb- , new rabbis daniel alter , malcolm mattitiani , and tomas kucera .
the first rabbis to be ordained in germany since the nazi era will take their vows at a synagogue in dresden thursday . the three men involved have just completed a five-year course of study at the abraham geiger college , which was founded in berlin in 1999 amid reservations from many jews . " we are the only university-level training institute on continental europe , " the university 's rector , walter homolka , told dpa news service .
" there is an enormous demand for rabbis in europe and the rest of the world . " the last jewish seminary in germany was shut in 1942 and no rabbis have been ordained in the country since . bildunterschrift : since 1991 , the synagogue on oranienburger street in berlin has been a center of renewed jewish life after their ordination in dresden on thursday , the three rabbis will take up different posts .
czech-born tom kucera will be based in munich , daniel alter in oldenburg and south african malcolm matitani in cape town . showing reservation abraham geiger , the college 's namesake , was one of the most important thinkers in liberal judaism and was himself a rabbi in berlin from 1870 to 1875 . initially jewish organizations abroad expressed reservations about rabbis being trained in germany , according to homolka . " one colleague said he could not understand why we wanted to establish such an institution on the ashes of 6 million victims of the shoa -lrb- holocaust -rrb- , " the rector said . kucera , who comes from the czech republic and who was originally a biochemistry student , admits he had mixed feelings the first time he stood in front of berlin 's landmark brandenburg gate . " flashes from the past shot through my mind , " he says .
" of course the past has to be remembered , but today it 's more about the future . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rabbis have similar duties to priests - but not exactly the same .
for instance , no incense kucera , 35 , says he has experienced the growth of jewish communities in his native country , but without the presence of rabbis . " that was a major factor of motivation for me , " he said , adding that he also enjoys imparting knowledge to people . the college , which is attached to the university of potsdam , a 30-minute journey from the german capital , means that students no longer have to travel abroad to become a rabbi , homolka said .
many of those who went to london or the us for training never returned . practical training there are currently 12 students at the berlin college , where they learn the practical work of a rabbi 's duties . like a pastor or priest in the christian church , a rabbi leads one or more congregations , presiding over key lifetime ceremonies like weddings and funerals for its members .
he - or she , in some liberal congregations - leads worship services , offers counselling , and can even help to settle legal disputes among members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler says ordination is an ' important step ' the three rabbis completed their academic training at potsdam university , where there is a chair of rabbinical studies and liturgy . graduates can obtain a master 's degree in jewish studies - a course which takes in commentaries on jewish law , religious philosophy , religious history , sociology , liturgy , synagogue music and counselling .

the first rabbis to be ordained in germany since the nazi era will take their vows at a synagogue in dresden thursday . the three men involved have just completed a five-year course of study at the abraham geiger college , which was founded in berlin in 1999 amid reservations from many jews . " we are the only university-level training institute on continental europe , " the university 's rector , walter homolka , told dpa news service .
" there is an enormous demand for rabbis in europe and the rest of the world . " the last jewish seminary in germany was shut in 1942 and no rabbis have been ordained in the country since . bildunterschrift : since 1991 , the synagogue on oranienburger street in berlin has been a center of renewed jewish life after their ordination in dresden on thursday , the three rabbis will take up different posts .
czech-born tom kucera will be based in munich , daniel alter in oldenburg and south african malcolm matitani in cape town . showing reservation abraham geiger , the college 's namesake , was one of the most important thinkers in liberal judaism and was himself a rabbi in berlin from 1870 to 1875 . initially jewish organizations abroad expressed reservations about rabbis being trained in germany , according to homolka . " one colleague said he could not understand why we wanted to establish such an institution on the ashes of 6 million victims of the shoa -lrb- holocaust -rrb- , " the rector said . kucera , who comes from the czech republic and who was originally a biochemistry student , admits he had mixed feelings the first time he stood in front of berlin 's landmark brandenburg gate . " flashes from the past shot through my mind , " he says .
" of course the past has to be remembered , but today it 's more about the future . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rabbis have similar duties to priests - but not exactly the same .
for instance , no incense kucera , 35 , says he has experienced the growth of jewish communities in his native country , but without the presence of rabbis . " that was a major factor of motivation for me , " he said , adding that he also enjoys imparting knowledge to people . the college , which is attached to the university of potsdam , a 30-minute journey from the german capital , means that students no longer have to travel abroad to become a rabbi , homolka said .
many of those who went to london or the us for training never returned . practical training there are currently 12 students at the berlin college , where they learn the practical work of a rabbi 's duties . like a pastor or priest in the christian church , a rabbi leads one or more congregations , presiding over key lifetime ceremonies like weddings and funerals for its members .
he - or she , in some liberal congregations - leads worship services , offers counselling , and can even help to settle legal disputes among members . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler says ordination is an ' important step ' the three rabbis completed their academic training at potsdam university , where there is a chair of rabbinical studies and liturgy . graduates can obtain a master 's degree in jewish studies - a course which takes in commentaries on jewish law , religious philosophy , religious history , sociology , liturgy , synagogue music and counselling .
there are also lessons in hebrew , aramaic and , on request , yiddish . students spend a year of the course studying at an israeli university , and also do practical work in jewish communities . köhler praises graduates germany today has a jewish population of 100,000 , compared to 600,000 before the start of world war ii .
there are some 100 jewish communities in the country today , served by around 25 rabbis . meanwhile , german president horst köhler called the first ordination of rabbis in germany in 64 years a special occasion . " after the holocaust , many people could not imagine that jewish life would one day blossom in germany again , " köhler said in a public statement . he called the ordinations " an important step " to a gradual normalization and less self-consciousness .
" together we must make sure that we achieve this ; remain open for change , but also continue to remember the bitter past .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 14.09.2006 klinsmann hints at return for next world cup großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann may want a little more world cup excitement germany soccer supporters were sad when national men 's head coach jürgen klinsmann took his hat after the world cup .
during a video conference with other coaches , he dropped a hint that he may be back soon . once a soccer player gets a taste of coaching , it can be difficult for him to leave it behind .
when jürgen klinsmann resigned this summer as germany 's head coach after a better-than-expected third-place performance , speculation immediately started that he would take a seat on a bench somewhere else . two months after the end of the world cup , he has made his first public appearance during a video conference at the end of a meeting of world cup managers organized by fifa in berlin and alluded to his desires none too clearly . " who knows , perhaps i 'll be a coach once again at the 2010 world cup -lrb- in south africa -rrb- , " he said . klinsmann , calling in to the conference from his home in california , still enjoys " taking -lrb- his -rrb- kids to school , " something he has more than ample time to do , having retired four days after guiding germany into third at this year 's world cup finals . coach for usa ?
or possibly an african country ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coaching a striker like ivory coast 's didier drogba could be enticing klinsmann 's logical new employer would be the united states soccer federation , which separated paths from bruce arena who had coached the american men 's team for eight years .
it would also be sensible for him considering that the team has its training quarters in southern california . klinsmann has consistently denied the connection with the us team and theo zwanziger , the newly elected president of the german football federation , raised another possible scenario for the 42-year-old who has always had a penchant for travel . zwanziger suggested recently that klinsmann " might take charge of a team in africa . " coaching just any old team on the sometimes times chaotic african continent , however , would be a risky undertaking considering that only the hosts south africa have a guaranteed ticket to the finals in four years .
at the 2006 tournament , all four sub-saharan teams - ivory coast , angola , ghana and togo - made their debuts , knocking out regular african favorites like cameroon , nigeria and south africa during qualifications . for the time being , klinsmann can continue to take his kids to school , and savor the fact that , as he said at the conference , " germany practically rediscovered itself " at the world cup this summer . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de coach klinsmann calls it quits in germany days after leading germany to third place in the 2006 world cup with a young team he personally put together , coach jürgen klinsmann has decided to step down .
he will be replaced by his assistant , joachim löw .
-lrb- july 12 , 2006 -rrb- germany wants klinsmann to stay hounded for poor performances before the world cup , jürgen klinsmann could have resigned and relieved a nation .
now after reaching the semi-finals on home soil , no one wants to let him leave any earlier than 2008 .

should online pharmacies be prohibited because they can undercut prices and drive out competition ?
the doc morris case has raised tough legal issues . a state administrative court in the state of saarland decided on wednesday that the dutch online pharmaceutical company doc morris has to shut down its first and only branch in germany until the european court of justice reaches a final verdict on the legality of the business . after opening in july , a doc morris branch in the city of saarbrücken met with immediate criticism from private pharmacists in the region .
they protested the legality of the online discounter on the grounds that they would n't be able to match its prices . critics also referenced a german law which stipulates that pharmacies may only be run by trained pharmacists , not by corporate entities . a final decision has yet to be made bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional pharmacies feel threatened by the discounter " the pharmacists want to do everything to push us out of the market , " said doc morris director ralf däinghaus . on aug .
9 the state court in saarbrücken rejected petitions for the closure of the german pharmaceutical branch , citing freedom of establishment under european law .
wednesday 's decision for its temporary closure was issued because three saarbrücken pharmacies have filed an appeal . the european court of justice will have to assess the apparent contradiction between germany 's pharmacy law and the european union 's freedom of establishment law . the state government in saarland is opposed to the administrative court 's decision and has said it considers it legal for doc morris to conduct business in germany . saarland 's minister of health josef hecken said the state government will appeal wednesday 's decision to the state 's higher administrative court . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court allows controversial discount pharmacy in germany a german court on wednesday ruled that a dutch internet pharmacy can operate a branch in germany .

but going there is easier than coming back , according to deutsche welle 's nina werkhäuser . it was a decision with " historical dimensions " for germany .
those were the words chancellor angela merkel used to describe the cabinet 's consent to send naval units to the middle east .
indeed , it is a historical decision to send armed german soldiers to the mideast .
for the last 60 years , such a mission would have been unthinkable because it was thought , for understandable historical reasons , that there should be as great a distance as possible between german troops and israel . that such a german foreign policy taboo could be broken may be astonishing .
but de facto , berlin had no other choice .
if germany had withdrawn from the mission , it would have laid the credibility of its foreign policy on the line and would have made berlin 's attempts to stabilize the situation in the mideast in the past few weeks seem absurd . israel explicitly wished for the bundeswehr 's participation .
that was not only the most important condition , it was an obligation .
without israel 's endorsement , angela merkel 's cabinet never would have approved of the mission . nevertheless , there is still a clearly defined line on the ground that the german government has decided not to cross : there will be no ground troops in the middle east .
other countries in the unifil mission should and will take over this responsibility .
they will have the difficult task of working together with the lebanese army to keep hezbollah in check .
how that should be done is still not clear , however . losing focus of peacekeeping mission purposes berlin is steering clear of that dilemma and is concentrating on its naval mission , which is supposed to hinder the delivery of arms via the sea to hezbollah militants .
it is difficult to say at this moment how effective that will be . germany will lead a european naval flotilla that has been granted a robust mandate ; it can stop and search incoming ships by force , if necessary .
despite the potential danger , the risk remains calculable .
yet only with this mandate will the parliament approve this week 's cabinet decision , when it comes up for a vote next week . that support nevertheless is guaranteed .
the vote will then turn the bundeswehr into an army that knows no borders .
but germany is paying a high price for this move , particularly when the choice of peacekeeping missions has become a bit random in nature .
the interests in the middle east are understandable .
but is a peacekeeping operation in the democratic republic of congo really necessary ? the large new mission in the middle east with up to 2,400 soldiers could , like the operations in kosovo and afghanistan , last for years .
and there is no guarantee for success .
such questions should make the german government clearly formulate its security policies .

it is difficult to say at this moment how effective that will be . germany will lead a european naval flotilla that has been granted a robust mandate ; it can stop and search incoming ships by force , if necessary .
despite the potential danger , the risk remains calculable .
yet only with this mandate will the parliament approve this week 's cabinet decision , when it comes up for a vote next week . that support nevertheless is guaranteed .
the vote will then turn the bundeswehr into an army that knows no borders .
but germany is paying a high price for this move , particularly when the choice of peacekeeping missions has become a bit random in nature .
the interests in the middle east are understandable .
but is a peacekeeping operation in the democratic republic of congo really necessary ? the large new mission in the middle east with up to 2,400 soldiers could , like the operations in kosovo and afghanistan , last for years .
and there is no guarantee for success .
such questions should make the german government clearly formulate its security policies .
this mission provides the opportunity to develop a definite exit strategy .
there is still time to do this . nina werkhäuser is dw radio 's correspondent to the german parliament in berlin . -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cabinet gives green light to lebanon mission germany 's cabinet authorized the deployment of ships to the middle east as part of the un force in lebanon .

" on tuesday , the six nations failed to agree on a joint statement on iran at the iaea meeting due to the us call for sanctions and hesitance by russia and china to use that word , a western diplomat told news agencies . ' poisoned ' negotiations ? on thursday , an iranian official accused the us of " poisoning " the course of nuclear negotiations , the news agency isna reported . " the us intends to poison the course of the negotiations through constant antagonism , although iran has constantly stressed negotiations for realizing its nuclear rights , " foreign ministry spokesman mohammad-ali hosseini told dpa news service . comments in dakar iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad said thursday during a visit to dakar that iran would support unconditional talks on the nuclear dispute and that the issue could be settled as long as internationally-acknowledged laws were taken into consideration - a reference to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , which iran has signed . ahmadinejad will later this month travel to new york for the 61st session of the un general assembly , where he will once again challenge his american counterpart george w. bush to a television debate on both the nuclear dispute and the middle east conflict . dw staff -lrb- rar / jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sanctions against iran could cost 10,000 german jobs as world powers gear up for a new round of diplomacy to respond to iran 's refusal to halt uranium enrichment , germany 's main trade group said the country could lose 10,000 jobs if tehran is slapped with sanctions .

it was his last event on his personal six-day trip to his native bavaria homeland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many pilgrims spent the night at a field outside of regensburg for an outdoor mass on tuesday martina baumgarnter , a 22-year-old student from erding near munich , told ap news agency that the trip had shown her the warmer side of the 79-year-old former theologian who succeeded the charismatic john paul ii last year . " i had an image of him as being more distant than his predecessor , that has changed a lot , " baumgartner said . personal visit the visit is likely to be remembered as a sentimental stroll down memory lane in what the 79-year-old pope himself admitted may be his final major visit to his homeland . the emotional high point of the trip came on wednesday when the pontiff knelt in prayer at the graves of his mother , father and sister . the private prayers at the tiny ziegetsdorf cemetery outside the city of regensburg came on a day which the vatican said had been reserved for " private time " for the pope and his elder brother georg . following the 20-minute visit , the two brothers went the short distance to the house in the neighboring suburb of pentling , which the head of the roman catholic church has owned since he was a theology professor at regensburg university . pope focused on family in an earlier address , the pope had appealed for unity within the roman catholic church , where pressure groups have challenged his traditional views of marriage and the family . " just as in an organ an expert hand must constantly bring disharmony back to consonance , so we in the church ... always need to find anew , through our communion in faith , harmony in the praise of god and in fraternal love . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope , at a mass at the islinger field in regensburg on tuesday on tuesday benedict had hit the only political note of his visit , during which his addresses have been almost entirely spiritual , when he fleetingly criticised the islamic concept of " jihad . " " violence is incompatible with the nature of god and the nature of the soul , " the pope had said in a complex treatise on reason and faith . his comments drew criticism on wednesday from a leading muslim figure in italy .
ejaz ahmad , a member of an italian governmental consultative committee on islam , called on him to retract them . " the muslim world is currently undergoing a deep crisis and any attack from the west can aggravate this crisis , " ahmad was quoted as saying by italy 's ansa news agency . " in his speech the pope overlooks the fact that islam was the cradle of science and that muslims were the first to translate greek philosophers before they became part of european history , " he said . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope enjoys private time near end of german trip pope benedict xvi knelt in prayer at the graves of his mother , father and sister on wednesday in the emotional highpoint of his six-day visit to his native bavaria .

he says both need to come down from the sky and take a look at the reality on the ground . dw-world.de : what did you think of pope benedict 's visit ? hans küng : i think many people here in germany have an ambivalent impression .
benedict has a very nice personality ; he 's shown himself as a very friendly person .
he 's also not a media pope like his predecessor .
he 's not an actor who is looking for applause . he concentrates on the central truths of christianity and faith in god .
on the other hand , he did n't accomplish any of the reforms to the catholic church that some people were looking for . which reforms ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : küng compared the pope to another leader , george w. bush there are a great many things .
if you take the situation around munich , a lot of parishes are without priests .
and just having a lot of people in the seats does n't mean that they are all believers . of course everybody finds it a very stimulating event to see the pope up close and lots of people are looking for a spiritual father and a more credible representative of moral integrity , justice and peace than many politicians today . but there were fewer people at the liturgy than had been expected .
we should not think that all those who were coming to see a star are now convinced and faithful catholic believers . why do n't you think that the great wave of enthusiasm that greeted the pope could have a vitalizing effect on the church ? it would be great if it had consistent consequences .
it is not enough to preach and have a big event .
the most recent public opinion poll by mckinsey asked whether the catholic church should be reformed and 43 percent said yes .
this is 40 percent more than before . in the same poll , 45 percent - nearly half of all germans - said they have no confidence in the catholic church as an institution . the people in munich were very happy - they have a german pope , a bavarian pope .
it the event had been held in magdeburg , in a new german state , where only 8 percent are registered as christians , we would have had a different image of germany . what do you think about the pope 's comments on the unity of the church ?
do you think he could influence more cooperation between the catholics and the protestants ? of course he could .
i was very pleased that the german president , horst köhler , who is a member of the global ethic foundation , said when the pope arrived : " in the name of many christians in this country , more ecumenical progress . "
and the pope answered in a very convincing way .
he said he would do everything to bring catholic and protestants together . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope blessed the organ but overlooked deeper issues , said küng afterwards , when he met with other christians all the controversial issues between catholics and protestants were just ignored .
most people here in germany would have to have a common eucharist , the acknowledgement of the ministers of the protestant churches .
they would have a solution for marriages from different churches , and of course the problem of papal jurisdiction and infallibility .
all this was practically ignored .
even the representatives of the protestant churches did n't have the courage to mention it . do you feel that the changes you 've mentioned , including unity among christians , will be possible during the tenure of the current pope ? i had a long conversation with him , which i 'm very grateful for .
i still hope that he will finally see that he can not only talk - he must finally take some action .
and i still hope that , after a certain time of reflection , he will do something . sometimes i have the impression he 's like president bush , who takes his air force one jet and flies over new orleans just to see how the situation is .
but finally he had to come down to the ground to see what the reality is . the diocese in regensburg , where the pope was , is probably the most divided diocese in germany .
the bishop of regensburg replaced practically all the elected members of the diocesan council in an authoritarian way with like-minded people .
and people could not understand why the pope just made comments about the organ in the regensburg church in the presence of this bishop . hans küng was professor of ecumenical theology and director of the institute for ecumenical research at the university of tübingen from 1960 until his retirement in 1996 .
he also served as official theological consultant to the second vatican council appointed by pope john xxiii .

it the event had been held in magdeburg , in a new german state , where only 8 percent are registered as christians , we would have had a different image of germany . what do you think about the pope 's comments on the unity of the church ?
do you think he could influence more cooperation between the catholics and the protestants ? of course he could .
i was very pleased that the german president , horst köhler , who is a member of the global ethic foundation , said when the pope arrived : " in the name of many christians in this country , more ecumenical progress . "
and the pope answered in a very convincing way .
he said he would do everything to bring catholic and protestants together . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope blessed the organ but overlooked deeper issues , said küng afterwards , when he met with other christians all the controversial issues between catholics and protestants were just ignored .
most people here in germany would have to have a common eucharist , the acknowledgement of the ministers of the protestant churches .
they would have a solution for marriages from different churches , and of course the problem of papal jurisdiction and infallibility .
all this was practically ignored .
even the representatives of the protestant churches did n't have the courage to mention it . do you feel that the changes you 've mentioned , including unity among christians , will be possible during the tenure of the current pope ? i had a long conversation with him , which i 'm very grateful for .
i still hope that he will finally see that he can not only talk - he must finally take some action .
and i still hope that , after a certain time of reflection , he will do something . sometimes i have the impression he 's like president bush , who takes his air force one jet and flies over new orleans just to see how the situation is .
but finally he had to come down to the ground to see what the reality is . the diocese in regensburg , where the pope was , is probably the most divided diocese in germany .
the bishop of regensburg replaced practically all the elected members of the diocesan council in an authoritarian way with like-minded people .
and people could not understand why the pope just made comments about the organ in the regensburg church in the presence of this bishop . hans küng was professor of ecumenical theology and director of the institute for ecumenical research at the university of tübingen from 1960 until his retirement in 1996 .
he also served as official theological consultant to the second vatican council appointed by pope john xxiii .
küng has published numerous books on christianity , the catholic church and ethics . rob turner interviewed hans küng -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope urges faithful to stand up for beliefs against " fanaticism " pope benedict xvi urged pilgrims at a giant open-air mass in regensburg to stand up for their beliefs in the face of the " hatred and fanaticism " tarnishing religion .

while braunau will honor two nazi victims on thursday , the austrian town still lacks a place that deals with its most infamous son .
sixty years after the end of world war ii , some say it 's still too early . braunau is almost a town like many others on the austrian-bavarian border .
a church spire towers over the city and youngsters meet up at a fountain in the town square , which is lined with shops and cafés that are famous for their strudels .
bookstores have decorated their windows with the works of pope benedict xvi . , who was born just around the corner , in marktl .
the village lies almost exactly between germany 's most important place of pilgrimage , altötting , and braunau , where adolf hitler was born - between heaven and hell , as some said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : braunau sits across the river inn from the bavarian town of simbach it 's definitely not a label that pleases most of the 17,300 braunauers , who have struggled with this burden of coincidence since 1945 .
they have lived with the stigma of coming from the same place as the man responsible for the murder of millions .
they know that it 's sometimes easier to tell people that they come from " near salzburg . "
while marktl likes to forget that the pope only lived there for two years and has no personal memories of his time there , braunauers take pains to point out that hitler left at around the same age .
a stone as tourist attraction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : braunau 's picturesque town square " believe me , i 'd much rather have the pope in braunau , " said klaus prexl , head of the local tourism office , who looks like one of the many tanned visitors who stop by on their bicycle tours through the region .
but prexl does n't have the catholic leader on offer and instead struggles to deal with continuing interest in hitler .
" every second or third guest asks about the house , " he said after one woman visiting from poland came in to find out how she could get to the building where the dictator was born .
like all the others , prexl sends her down the street , through the city tower , then it 'll come up on your left-hand side , watch out for the stone of admonition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stone 's still the only marker that hitler was born here " for peace , freedom and democracy , " reads the inscription on the stone , which comes from the nearby nazi concentration camp in mauthausen .
" never again fascism .
the millions of dead are a reminder . "
it 's the only reference to the fact that hitler was born here and , according to prexl , it 's not enough .
" i think it 's time for a documentation center , " said the 57-year-old .
" it exists in all the places where he committed crimes and we conceal it .
it 's been talked about forever , but there are local political influences that do n't want it . "
taking on responsibility far from it , countered gerhard skiba , braunau 's mayor since 1989 .
shortly after taking office , the self-declared socialist and member of austria 's social democratic party decided to place the stone in front of the house just in time for the 100th anniversary of hitler 's birthday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : braunau 's mayor gerhard skiba in his office " there were pretty serious protests , " skiba said , adding that he even received some death threats .
" people said : ' we do n't need that , the stone could be a target for attacks . " '
he also cleansed the town of hitler souvenirs such as beer mugs , ashtrays and wine bottles with the nazi leader 's image that were still sold at the time .
he hired streetworkers to deal with signs of right-wing extremism among teenagers and enthusiastically backed the placement of so-called stumbling stones that remember people killed by the nazis in front of the houses where they once lived .
two more of these will be placed on thursday .
skiba said he also wants to install a sign that identifies hitler 's birth house in front of the building in the very near future .
while the austrian government rents the landmarked structure , the owner has so far refused to agree to a plaque that 's directly attached to its walls .
ideal use of building the owners 's unwillingness to sell the house has also been one of the main reasons why a so-called house of responsibility has not been set up inside it , skiba said .
another reason is that the building is currently not open to the public as it is used by an organization called lebenshilfe , which offers people with mental and other disabilities a place to work .
" that 's an ideal use for the building , " skiba said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franciscan nuns recently named a park in braunau in jägerstetter 's honor while he said that he regrets that he failed to name a fountain , bridge or street after franz jägerstetter , who was murdered by the nazis for refusing to join the army , he will wholeheartedly back plans to transform hitler 's birthplace into a documentation center once it is no longer needed by its current tenants .
" among the things that i still want to do as mayor , this has top priority , " the 59-year-old said .
some , such as braunau 's catholic pastor , think that it might still take some time .
" i think it 's too fresh , " said 65-year-old stefan hofer , who has preached at st. stephan 's church , where hitler was baptized , for the past 34 years .
he added that braunau was currently taking responsibility via its days of contemporary history , which began in 1992 with a symposium called " undesired heritage " that looked at how cities such as braunau , auschwitz , vichy or stalin 's birthplace gori deal with their heritage .
waiting for the green light but the scientific adviser of that event said that mayor skiba just needs to give the political green light for the house of responsibility .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gifts made by mentally disabled people are currently sold inside the house " if he says yes , i 'll raise the money , " said andreas maislinger , a historian and political scientist , adding that the house should look at the past , present and future by giving visitors information about hitler and his crimes , offering space for organizations such as lebenshilfe and serving as a place that promotes intercultural understanding by inviting young chinese and japanese , indians and pakistanis , israelis and palestinians and others to get to know each other during a stay in braunau .
" we 're already doing that throughout the world , " said maislinger , who also founded an organization that offers young austrians an opportunity to complete their compulsory community service abroad .

while braunau will honor two nazi victims on thursday , the austrian town still lacks a place that deals with its most infamous son .
sixty years after the end of world war ii , some say it 's still too early . braunau is almost a town like many others on the austrian-bavarian border .
a church spire towers over the city and youngsters meet up at a fountain in the town square , which is lined with shops and cafés that are famous for their strudels .
bookstores have decorated their windows with the works of pope benedict xvi . , who was born just around the corner , in marktl .
the village lies almost exactly between germany 's most important place of pilgrimage , altötting , and braunau , where adolf hitler was born - between heaven and hell , as some said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : braunau sits across the river inn from the bavarian town of simbach it 's definitely not a label that pleases most of the 17,300 braunauers , who have struggled with this burden of coincidence since 1945 .
they have lived with the stigma of coming from the same place as the man responsible for the murder of millions .
they know that it 's sometimes easier to tell people that they come from " near salzburg . "
while marktl likes to forget that the pope only lived there for two years and has no personal memories of his time there , braunauers take pains to point out that hitler left at around the same age .
a stone as tourist attraction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : braunau 's picturesque town square " believe me , i 'd much rather have the pope in braunau , " said klaus prexl , head of the local tourism office , who looks like one of the many tanned visitors who stop by on their bicycle tours through the region .
but prexl does n't have the catholic leader on offer and instead struggles to deal with continuing interest in hitler .
" every second or third guest asks about the house , " he said after one woman visiting from poland came in to find out how she could get to the building where the dictator was born .
like all the others , prexl sends her down the street , through the city tower , then it 'll come up on your left-hand side , watch out for the stone of admonition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stone 's still the only marker that hitler was born here " for peace , freedom and democracy , " reads the inscription on the stone , which comes from the nearby nazi concentration camp in mauthausen .
" never again fascism .
the millions of dead are a reminder . "
it 's the only reference to the fact that hitler was born here and , according to prexl , it 's not enough .
" i think it 's time for a documentation center , " said the 57-year-old .
" it exists in all the places where he committed crimes and we conceal it .
it 's been talked about forever , but there are local political influences that do n't want it . "
taking on responsibility far from it , countered gerhard skiba , braunau 's mayor since 1989 .
shortly after taking office , the self-declared socialist and member of austria 's social democratic party decided to place the stone in front of the house just in time for the 100th anniversary of hitler 's birthday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : braunau 's mayor gerhard skiba in his office " there were pretty serious protests , " skiba said , adding that he even received some death threats .
" people said : ' we do n't need that , the stone could be a target for attacks . " '
he also cleansed the town of hitler souvenirs such as beer mugs , ashtrays and wine bottles with the nazi leader 's image that were still sold at the time .
he hired streetworkers to deal with signs of right-wing extremism among teenagers and enthusiastically backed the placement of so-called stumbling stones that remember people killed by the nazis in front of the houses where they once lived .
two more of these will be placed on thursday .
skiba said he also wants to install a sign that identifies hitler 's birth house in front of the building in the very near future .
while the austrian government rents the landmarked structure , the owner has so far refused to agree to a plaque that 's directly attached to its walls .
ideal use of building the owners 's unwillingness to sell the house has also been one of the main reasons why a so-called house of responsibility has not been set up inside it , skiba said .
another reason is that the building is currently not open to the public as it is used by an organization called lebenshilfe , which offers people with mental and other disabilities a place to work .
" that 's an ideal use for the building , " skiba said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franciscan nuns recently named a park in braunau in jägerstetter 's honor while he said that he regrets that he failed to name a fountain , bridge or street after franz jägerstetter , who was murdered by the nazis for refusing to join the army , he will wholeheartedly back plans to transform hitler 's birthplace into a documentation center once it is no longer needed by its current tenants .
" among the things that i still want to do as mayor , this has top priority , " the 59-year-old said .
some , such as braunau 's catholic pastor , think that it might still take some time .
" i think it 's too fresh , " said 65-year-old stefan hofer , who has preached at st. stephan 's church , where hitler was baptized , for the past 34 years .
he added that braunau was currently taking responsibility via its days of contemporary history , which began in 1992 with a symposium called " undesired heritage " that looked at how cities such as braunau , auschwitz , vichy or stalin 's birthplace gori deal with their heritage .
waiting for the green light but the scientific adviser of that event said that mayor skiba just needs to give the political green light for the house of responsibility .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gifts made by mentally disabled people are currently sold inside the house " if he says yes , i 'll raise the money , " said andreas maislinger , a historian and political scientist , adding that the house should look at the past , present and future by giving visitors information about hitler and his crimes , offering space for organizations such as lebenshilfe and serving as a place that promotes intercultural understanding by inviting young chinese and japanese , indians and pakistanis , israelis and palestinians and others to get to know each other during a stay in braunau .
" we 're already doing that throughout the world , " said maislinger , who also founded an organization that offers young austrians an opportunity to complete their compulsory community service abroad .

considering that germany imports about one quarter of its rice from the us , brendel thought it was inevitable that a number of products and supermarket chains would be affected . " this modified strain of rice was planted in the us in 2001 , but only as a test crop , " brendel said .

of these , four came from rice produced in the us .
the origin of the other three positive samples is unknown . biotech rice is not allowed to be grown , sold or marketed in the eu . earlier eu reports of contaminated rice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace made initial claims in the aldi gm rice case the findings in baden-wurttemberg come just on the heels of reports concerning the discovery of ll601 in rice packages sold at the aldi nord supermarket chain in the northern regions of germany . the european federation of rice millers had tested 162 shipments of rice imported from the united states .
33 of them tested positive for genetically modified rice , the european commission said in a statement on monday . " any consignments which tested positive have already been recalled or withheld from the market and the federation 's members have committed to continuing such withdrawals for any positive findings , " the commission said monday . greenpeace genetics expert ulrike brendel said that the aldi products , sold under the bon-ri brand , had been contaminated with a strain of rice developed by german industrial giant bayer and tested in the united states . " we tested the samples at a respected and independent laboratory , " brendel said .
" the results show some of the rice has been modified using a method developed and published by bayer - there 's no doubt about it . " a tainted biotech product rice found in eight of aldi nord 's 35 sales areas contained traces of ll601 - a rice strain engineered by bayer to resist certain bayer herbicides . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both aldi and edeka have removed the rice products in question from shelves aldi nord said documentation for the rice imports showed no signs of shipments containing genetically modified rice , but it removed the affected products from its shelves and was testing the countries of origins of other similar products . the european commission 's findings suggested gm material had been finding its way into the european market for some time .
considering that germany imports about one quarter of its rice from the us , brendel thought it was inevitable that a number of products and supermarket chains would be affected . " this modified strain of rice was planted in the us in 2001 , but only as a test crop , " brendel said .
" the fact we 're finding it here in imports shows that industry is n't capable of controlling genetically modified crops .
we do n't know what human health or environmental risks involved .
if we want to keep food sources free of genetically modified material , then we ca n't afford to plant gm crops . " declaring war on biotech rice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany imported 46,500 tons of rice from the us in 2005 alone last month the european commission slapped stringent testing requirements on rice imports from the us to try and stop genetically modified varieties from entering the 25 country-bloc . at the end of august , germany 's federal ministry of consumer protection ordered state-level authorities to step up their detection efforts . france and sweden have also discovered traces of a banned genetically modified substance in imported us rice , in tests which must be confirmed by eu laboratories , a european commission source said tuesday . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu caution puts brakes on gm food legislation eu leaders thursday stressed the need for more information and experience before further legislation can be passed on genetically-modified organisms , at the end of a two-day conference on gmos in vienna .

europe 's largest economy has been resilient in spite of high oil prices , but the imf says hazards still lurk . germany 's stock market has been booming for more than three years .
the country 's companies have been enjoying better than average profits during that time .
now , it is starting to pay dividends and the international monetary fund , in its twice-yearly assessment of the global economy , has raised its 2006 economic growth forecasts for germany to 2 percent from its prediction of 1.3 percent in the spring . at its meeting in singapore , the imf 's chief economist raghuram rajan praised europe 's largest economy , saying " it was on a roll . " but berlin 's measures to lower spending , such as merging unemployment and welfare benefits were not having as much as an effect that had been expected , rajan said .
he suggested lowering income taxes to help spur private consumption , recommending more flexibility in the labor market and increased competition in the banking and utilities sectors . adding more kick to the economy , rajan said , alluding to reforms , would not necessarily mean lower incomes or the end of germany 's welfare state . europe should take advantage of growth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eurozone is expected to grow 2.4 percent the imf is not alone in its optimism regards germany .
the eu commission projects growth of 2.2 percent .
only berlin , possibly stung by overly rosy forecasts that went unmet in the recent past , sees more modest growth at 1.6 percent for the current year . a scheduled increase of germany 's value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- as of january will boost private spending until the end of this year .
after that , the imf expects growth to stagnate to 1.3 percent . the economy in the euro zone is experiencing growth not seen since the dot.com days , expected to hit 2.4 percent .
rajan views the stronger developments as an opportunity to pare down public deficits , in line with the eu 's stability and growth pact target to hold such shortfalls to 3.0 percent or less of total output .
as for germany , he echoed his calls for reforms to europe . " europe 's leaders need to find the will to take on vested interests in both labor and in the corporate sector , " said rajan .
" this necessary but difficult domestic battle is constantly postponed until after the next election , " he added . balancing inflation and interest rates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high oil prices will continue to threaten world economies rising oil prices have yet had a great effect on consumer prices but with a barrel of crude expected to hover around or above the $ 70 per barrel mark , inflation is a concern central banks around the world must face . the imf found that with euro zone inflation running " below but close to " the european central bank 's -lrb- ecb -rrb- 2.0 percent objective , " further interest rate increases will likely be needed to maintain price stability over the medium term if the expansion develops as expected . " the ecb since december has raised its benchmark rate four times , taking it from 2.0 to 3.0 percent , and has made clear it intends to carry on with monetary tightening .
but the imf cautioned : " with underlying inflationary pressures still well contained ... policymakers can afford to be cautious in tightening the monetary policy stance , all the more so given the risk of euro appreciation and weaker growth in the united states .

europe 's largest economy has been resilient in spite of high oil prices , but the imf says hazards still lurk . germany 's stock market has been booming for more than three years .
the country 's companies have been enjoying better than average profits during that time .
now , it is starting to pay dividends and the international monetary fund , in its twice-yearly assessment of the global economy , has raised its 2006 economic growth forecasts for germany to 2 percent from its prediction of 1.3 percent in the spring . at its meeting in singapore , the imf 's chief economist raghuram rajan praised europe 's largest economy , saying " it was on a roll . " but berlin 's measures to lower spending , such as merging unemployment and welfare benefits were not having as much as an effect that had been expected , rajan said .
he suggested lowering income taxes to help spur private consumption , recommending more flexibility in the labor market and increased competition in the banking and utilities sectors . adding more kick to the economy , rajan said , alluding to reforms , would not necessarily mean lower incomes or the end of germany 's welfare state . europe should take advantage of growth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eurozone is expected to grow 2.4 percent the imf is not alone in its optimism regards germany .
the eu commission projects growth of 2.2 percent .
only berlin , possibly stung by overly rosy forecasts that went unmet in the recent past , sees more modest growth at 1.6 percent for the current year . a scheduled increase of germany 's value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- as of january will boost private spending until the end of this year .
after that , the imf expects growth to stagnate to 1.3 percent . the economy in the euro zone is experiencing growth not seen since the dot.com days , expected to hit 2.4 percent .
rajan views the stronger developments as an opportunity to pare down public deficits , in line with the eu 's stability and growth pact target to hold such shortfalls to 3.0 percent or less of total output .
as for germany , he echoed his calls for reforms to europe . " europe 's leaders need to find the will to take on vested interests in both labor and in the corporate sector , " said rajan .
" this necessary but difficult domestic battle is constantly postponed until after the next election , " he added . balancing inflation and interest rates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high oil prices will continue to threaten world economies rising oil prices have yet had a great effect on consumer prices but with a barrel of crude expected to hover around or above the $ 70 per barrel mark , inflation is a concern central banks around the world must face . the imf found that with euro zone inflation running " below but close to " the european central bank 's -lrb- ecb -rrb- 2.0 percent objective , " further interest rate increases will likely be needed to maintain price stability over the medium term if the expansion develops as expected . " the ecb since december has raised its benchmark rate four times , taking it from 2.0 to 3.0 percent , and has made clear it intends to carry on with monetary tightening .

he says both need to come down from the sky and take a look at the reality on the ground . dw-world.de : what did you think of pope benedict 's visit ? hans küng : i think many people here in germany have an ambivalent impression .
benedict has a very nice personality ; he 's shown himself as a very friendly person .
he 's also not a media pope like his predecessor .
he 's not an actor who is looking for applause . he concentrates on the central truths of christianity and faith in god .
on the other hand , he did n't accomplish any of the reforms to the catholic church that some people were looking for . which reforms ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : küng compared the pope to another leader , george w. bush there are a great many things .
if you take the situation around munich , a lot of parishes are without priests .
and just having a lot of people in the seats does n't mean that they are all believers . of course everybody finds it a very stimulating event to see the pope up close and lots of people are looking for a spiritual father and a more credible representative of moral integrity , justice and peace than many politicians today . but there were fewer people at the liturgy than had been expected .
we should not think that all those who were coming to see a star are now convinced and faithful catholic believers . why do n't you think that the great wave of enthusiasm that greeted the pope could have a vitalizing effect on the church ? it would be great if it had consistent consequences .
it is not enough to preach and have a big event .
the most recent public opinion poll by mckinsey asked whether the catholic church should be reformed and 43 percent said yes .
this is 40 percent more than before . in the same poll , 45 percent - nearly half of all germans - said they have no confidence in the catholic church as an institution . the people in munich were very happy - they have a german pope , a bavarian pope .
it the event had been held in magdeburg , in a new german state , where only 8 percent are registered as christians , we would have had a different image of germany . what do you think about the pope 's comments on the unity of the church ?
do you think he could influence more cooperation between the catholics and the protestants ? of course he could .
i was very pleased that the german president , horst köhler , who is a member of the global ethic foundation , said when the pope arrived : " in the name of many christians in this country , more ecumenical progress . "
and the pope answered in a very convincing way .
he said he would do everything to bring catholic and protestants together . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope blessed the organ but overlooked deeper issues , said küng afterwards , when he met with other christians all the controversial issues between catholics and protestants were just ignored .
most people here in germany would have to have a common eucharist , the acknowledgement of the ministers of the protestant churches .
they would have a solution for marriages from different churches , and of course the problem of papal jurisdiction and infallibility .
all this was practically ignored .
even the representatives of the protestant churches did n't have the courage to mention it . do you feel that the changes you 've mentioned , including unity among christians , will be possible during the tenure of the current pope ? i had a long conversation with him , which i 'm very grateful for .
i still hope that he will finally see that he can not only talk - he must finally take some action .
and i still hope that , after a certain time of reflection , he will do something . sometimes i have the impression he 's like president bush , who takes his air force one jet and flies over new orleans just to see how the situation is .
but finally he had to come down to the ground to see what the reality is . the diocese in regensburg , where the pope was , is probably the most divided diocese in germany .
the bishop of regensburg replaced practically all the elected members of the diocesan council in an authoritarian way with like-minded people .
and people could not understand why the pope just made comments about the organ in the regensburg church in the presence of this bishop . hans küng was professor of ecumenical theology and director of the institute for ecumenical research at the university of tübingen from 1960 until his retirement in 1996 .
he also served as official theological consultant to the second vatican council appointed by pope john xxiii .
küng has published numerous books on christianity , the catholic church and ethics . rob turner interviewed hans küng -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope urges faithful to stand up for beliefs against " fanaticism " pope benedict xvi urged pilgrims at a giant open-air mass in regensburg to stand up for their beliefs in the face of the " hatred and fanaticism " tarnishing religion .

the german leader said she again raised human rights issues with the chinese leader and urged beijing to respect the freedom of the press . " in our discussions , we touched on human rights issues and i made it clear that these rights are inalienable and should be respected everywhere , " merkel told reporters at a press conference with wen . she said she had singled out the freedom of the press and stressed that journalists should be allowed to carry out their work during the 2008 olympic games in beijing .
merkel alluded to new media rules announced on sunday that require foreign media to seek approval to distribute news , pictures and graphics within china . " i said clearly that on this occasion too , the freedom of the press will play an important role and that we should continue to discuss the matter , " merkel said . her remarks follow the recent jailing of two journalists in what observers describe as a clampdown on the media ahead of the games and the 17th communist party congress next year .
the chinese government recently sentenced new york times researcher zhao yan to three years in prison for fraud and singapore straits times correspondent ching cheong to five years for allegedly spying for taiwan . intellectual property rights another area that has rankled many western politicians and business leaders is intellectual property rights -lrb- ipr -rrb- and the piracy of films and cds .

merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder , had together with france led calls in 2004 to lift the embargo but this was strongly opposed by both the us and japan , which say a resumption of european weapons sales to beijing will worsen tensions between china and taiwan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the violent crackdown on protests at tiananmen square led to the embargo merkel has said she will not go down schröder 's path .
with germany holding the eu presidency during the first half of 2007 , she said " the arms embargo theme is currently not on the agenda .

the extent of " perennial " ice - thick ice which remains all year round - declined by 14 % , losing an area the size of pakistan or turkey .
the last few decades have seen summer ice shrink by about 0.7 % per year .
the drastic shrinkage may relate partly to unusual wind patterns found in 2005 , though rising temperatures in the arctic could also be a factor .
the research is reported in the journal geophysical research letters . "
the change we see between 2004 and 2005 is enormous " son nghiem the arctic is warming about twice as fast as the global average ; and recent studies have shown that the area of the arctic covered by ice each summer , and the ice thickness , have been shrinking .
september 2005 saw the lowest recorded area of ice cover since 1978 , when satellite records became available .
perennial decay this latest study , from scientists led by son nghiem of nasa 's jet propulsion laboratory in california , measures something slightly different from the extent of summer ice cover - the extent of " perennial " ice cover .
perennial or " multi-year " ice is up to 3m thick and survives through at least one summer .
it is different from " seasonal " ice , which is thinner and melts more easily , surviving for just one winter before succumbing to the summer sun .
" perennial ice contains less salinity , " explained dr nghiem .
" it 's freshwater ice - there are more bubbles in it and typically its surface is much rougher - and a scatterometer -lsb- a radar-based instrument -rsb- can distinguish between the two types . "
using the scatterometer on nasa 's quikscat satellite , researchers scanned the arctic for perennial and seasonal ice .
from october 2004 to march 2006 they plotted a steady decline .
when they compared figures for the 2004 and 2005 northern hemisphere winter solstices - 21 december - a huge change showed up .
" in previous years there is some variability , but it is much smaller and regional , " dr nghiem told the bbc news website .
" however the change we see between 2004 and 2005 is enormous . "
the area of perennial sea ice lost was about 730,000 sq km , with a huge loss in the east arctic -lrb- defined as north of russia and europe -rrb- and a small gain in the west arctic , north of the americas and the atlantic ocean .
stray winds continuous scatterometer data has been available only since 1999 , so for comparison researchers must use the records of summer ice extent - which is almost , but not exactly , the same thing as perennial ice extent .
" if we average that over the long term we find a reduction of between 6.4 % and 7.8 % per decade , " said dr nghiem .
" what we have here is 14 % in one year - 18 times the previous rate . "
the key questions are what caused it , and whether it is an anomaly or the first sign of a major change of pace for arctic melting .
quikscat also monitors winds , and noted unusual patterns of wind in the east arctic in 2005 which could be related , perhaps propelling old ice from east to west , though how that could explain such a drastic loss of perennial ice is not clear .
if the pace of arctic melting is quickening , the implications for the future are not reassuring .
ice reflects the sun 's energy back into space ; open water absorbs it .
so a planet with less ice warms faster , potentially turning the projected impacts of global warming into reality sooner than anticipated .

see the quikscat images from december 2004 and 2005 enlarge image " perennial ice contains less salinity , " explained dr nghiem .
" it 's freshwater ice - there are more bubbles in it and typically its surface is much rougher - and a scatterometer -lsb- a radar-based instrument -rsb- can distinguish between the two types . "
using the scatterometer on nasa 's quikscat satellite , researchers scanned the arctic for perennial and seasonal ice .
from october 2004 to march 2006 they plotted a steady decline .
when they compared figures for the 2004 and 2005 northern hemisphere winter solstices - 21 december - a huge change showed up .
" in previous years there is some variability , but it is much smaller and regional , " dr nghiem told the bbc news website .
" however the change we see between 2004 and 2005 is enormous . "
the area of perennial sea ice lost was about 730,000 sq km , with a huge loss in the east arctic -lrb- defined as north of russia and europe -rrb- and a small gain in the west arctic , north of the americas and the atlantic ocean .
stray winds continuous scatterometer data has been available only since 1999 , so for comparison researchers must use the records of summer ice extent - which is almost , but not exactly , the same thing as perennial ice extent .
annual arctic air temperatures relative to the 1961-1990 average " if we average that over the long term we find a reduction of between 6.4 % and 7.8 % per decade , " said dr nghiem .
" what we have here is 14 % in one year - 18 times the previous rate . "
the key questions are what caused it , and whether it is an anomaly or the first sign of a major change of pace for arctic melting .
quikscat also monitors winds , and noted unusual patterns of wind in the east arctic in 2005 which could be related , perhaps propelling old ice from east to west , though how that could explain such a drastic loss of perennial ice is not clear .
if the pace of arctic melting is quickening , the implications for the future are not reassuring .
ice reflects the sun 's energy back into space ; open water absorbs it .
so a planet with less ice warms faster , potentially turning the projected impacts of global warming into reality sooner than anticipated .

this week some of singapore 's newspapers have been teeming with new recruitment ads put in by the city 's many escort agencies .
they 're all busily hunting for what they describe as " young , outgoing girls ... in their twenties " .
the apparent hiring frenzy has been triggered by the arrival of some 24,000 visitors - all coming to town this week with just one thing on their minds ... the annual meeting of the international monetary fund and world bank .
the front page headline in this morning 's straits times boasts that this is the biggest turnout ever .
the delegates do have some serious business to discuss here - in particular , plans to restructure the imf 's voting system to give countries like china and mexico more clout .
but for singapore - a tiny , humid and tightly-controlled city state - the real issue is how well it looks after its guests .
citizens are being urged to smile .
to make sure the delegates respond in kind , they 're being offered discounts on botox injections and other beauty treatments .
an article in the new paper urges visitors to venture out of their convention centre and discover the city 's secrets , declaring that there is much more to this place than " rules , laws and squeaky clean streets " .
campaigners barred but it is singapore 's laws which are in danger of overshadowing this week 's meeting .
it is illegal here for more than four people to demonstrate together outside .
so what to do with the many thousands of international activists who usually congregate at such events ?
we work with these representatives of civil societies , and we value their role - even when we disagree with what they say world bank singapore has made it very clear that its rules will not be bent - 10,000 police will make sure of that .
a number of campaigners have already been barred from entering the country .
those who have been allowed in are being carefully chaperoned .
they will be allowed to protest , but only in designated indoor areas .
they are also being provided with special , soft placards to wave .
thursday 's straits times carries a small article - tucked deep inside the newspaper - which some might argue belongs nearer the front page .
the world bank has come to its critics ' defence , accusing singapore of breaching a formal agreement by barring 28 activists from the country .
in a statement , it says : " we work with these representatives of civil societies , and we value their role - even when we disagree with what they say . "

this week some of singapore 's newspapers have been teeming with new recruitment ads put in by the city 's many escort agencies .

the delegates do have some serious business to discuss here - in particular , plans to restructure the imf 's voting system to give countries like china and mexico more clout .

citizens are being urged to smile .
to make sure the delegates respond in kind , they 're being offered discounts on botox injections and other beauty treatments .
an article in the new paper urges visitors to venture out of their convention centre and discover the city 's secrets , declaring that there is much more to this place than " rules , laws and squeaky clean streets " .
campaigners barred but it is singapore 's laws which are in danger of overshadowing this week 's meeting .
it is illegal here for more than four people to demonstrate together outside .

we work with these representatives of civil societies , and we value their role - even when we disagree with what they say world bank singapore has made it very clear that its rules will not be bent - 10,000 police will make sure of that .

the youtube website said the footage violated its terms of use , but hundreds of similar so-called " bitch fight " videos remain .
one of the girls in the cardiff film , from llanishen high school , ends up with blood on her face .
anti-bullying charity kidscape had called for the video to be taken off . "
one wonders how the parents are supposed to see what is happening if the content is banned .
hiding the problem does not make it go away " cardiffarian read your views the charity said parents of the girls fighting and watching should be shown the film to drive home the reality of what is happening .
california-based youtube allows users to post content directly .
the video , recorded on a mobile phone , had apparently been posted by a 15-year-old girl .
among videos still online is one claiming to be a fight at another school in south east wales , involving two boys .
iwan guy , a national executive member of the national association of head teachers said he had found the footage " very disturbing " .
" both boys and girls have been scrapping as long as there 've been boys and girls .
but it 's the mentality now and the way they think it 's ok to stage a fight - because this is a staged fight , it 's not one that just happened , " he said .
" what is disturbing for me is the misuse of the technology - of both the phones and the internet .
" i have to ask parents do you know what your children are doing with their mobile phones ?
do they know what they 're doing on the internet ? "
john carr , new technology adviser to children 's charity nch , said the fact it was so easy for children to reach a " large audience " , encouraged more staged fights than would otherwise happen .
mr carr said : " there was a case in london not long ago where a young lad was killed and the whole thing was videoed over a mobile phone .
" the judge was quite clear that it was partly because they wanted to film what they were doing that caused the attack in the first place . "
a teenager at coed mawr community centre in bangor said youngsters often wanted fights recorded to impress their friends .
she told bbc wales : " everyone records it so you think you 're cool , but then it happens more .
if it 's been on the internet once they know that they 're gullible , so they just do it again and again .
it 's the same people usually .
" if you put it on a site you can tell all your mates , so it soon gets round . "
the cardiff fight begins with the taller of the two talking to the other girl , as they are surrounded by other children .
the grainy footage , which is less than a minute long , shows them wrestling with each other for some moments before the smaller girl kicks upwards twice and repeatedly hits the taller girl in the face .
the bigger girl is pushed to the floor and a number of other youngsters join in and start kicking and hitting her .
she ends with blood on her face and is led away by other girls .
a spokeswoman for cardiff council 's education department said two pupils from llanishen high were involved in a " distressing altercation " out of hours and not on school property a few months ago .
police dealt with the incident and it was referred to the school .

the youtube website said the footage violated its terms of use , but hundreds of similar so-called " bitch fight " videos remain .
one of the girls in the cardiff film , from llanishen high school , ends up with blood on her face .
anti-bullying charity kidscape had called for the video to be taken off .
one wonders how the parents are supposed to see what is happening if the content is banned .
hiding the problem does not make it go away cardiffarian read your views the charity said parents of the girls fighting and watching should be shown the film to drive home the reality of what is happening .
california-based youtube allows users to post content directly .
the video , recorded on a mobile phone , had apparently been posted by a 15-year-old girl .
among videos still online is one claiming to be a fight at another school in south east wales , involving two boys .
neither pupil has been excluded from llanishen high school iwan guy , a national executive member of the national association of head teachers said he had found the footage " very disturbing " .
" both boys and girls have been scrapping as long as there 've been boys and girls .
but it 's the mentality now and the way they think it 's ok to stage a fight - because this is a staged fight , it 's not one that just happened , " he said .
" what is disturbing for me is the misuse of the technology - of both the phones and the internet .
" i have to ask parents do you know what your children are doing with their mobile phones ?
do they know what they 're doing on the internet ? "
john carr , new technology adviser to children 's charity nch , said the fact it was so easy for children to reach a " large audience " , encouraged more staged fights than would otherwise happen .
mr carr said : " there was a case in london not long ago where a young lad was killed and the whole thing was videoed over a mobile phone .
" the judge was quite clear that it was partly because they wanted to film what they were doing that caused the attack in the first place . "
harsh blows are given , with one girl ending bleeding from the face a teenager at coed mawr community centre in bangor said youngsters often wanted fights recorded to impress their friends .
she told bbc wales : " everyone records it so you think you 're cool , but then it happens more .
if it 's been on the internet once they know that they 're gullible , so they just do it again and again .
it 's the same people usually .
" if you put it on a site you can tell all your mates , so it soon gets round . "
the cardiff fight begins with the taller of the two talking to the other girl , as they are surrounded by other children .
the grainy footage , which is less than a minute long , shows them wrestling with each other for some moments before the smaller girl kicks upwards twice and repeatedly hits the taller girl in the face .
the bigger girl is pushed to the floor and a number of other youngsters join in and start kicking and hitting her .
she ends with blood on her face and is led away by other girls .
a spokeswoman for cardiff council 's education department said two pupils from llanishen high were involved in a " distressing altercation " out of hours and not on school property a few months ago .
police dealt with the incident and it was referred to the school .

the centre will investigate ways of generating electricity that minimise the emissions of carbon gases which scientists say are warming the planet .
to be known as the energy technologies institute , it will be funded by energy companies and the government .
the firms committed to the project so far include bp , shell , edf energy and eo.n uk .
the department of trade and industry has already promised to provide half of the overall funding for the institute - up to £ 500m over the next decade .
bp , edf , e.on uk and shell have each offered £ 5m per year .
with the launch of the prospectus , trade and industry secretary alistair darling has called on other private sector companies to come forward .
" if you take wind farm technology , for example , there 's a lot of small companies who individually do lots of things , " he told bbc news .
" we need to bring that together .
" if we bring together what government does , what companies like shell , bp do , if we bring that together , we 've got a better chance of pooling expertise , speeding up the development of these things , " mr darling said .
the initial aim for the new centre will be to improve the efficiency of burning fossil fuels .
it will also fund the development of new energy saving techniques , and look for ways to produce more efficient renewable generation technologies .
iain conn , bp group managing director , said : " the institute will help us share experience and knowledge between public and private sectors to enable development of new technologies . "
experts predict that in 25 years global energy use will have shot up by 50 % , largely because of the growth of the indian and chinese economies .
unless new and better ways are found to generate electricity , heat buildings and power vehicles , this rise in demand will be met by an even greater use of fossil fuels .
worldwide , public funding of energy research has been cut by a half since 1980 and in the uk it is now a 10th of what it used to be .
the proposed new investment by government and industry is an attempt to reverse that trend .
critics , though , say that research alone will not be enough .
they argue that only a carbon levy to increase the cost of fossil fuels will bring about the cuts in emissions that will be needed .
the intention to create the energy technologies institute was announced in the budget on 22 march 2006 .
the dti is inviting companies to express interest in participating in the institute by the end of november .
a director will be selected to provide day-to-day leadership .
it is expected that the institute will be fully operational by 2008 .

the centre will investigate ways of generating electricity that minimise the emissions of carbon gases which scientists say are warming the planet .
to be known as the energy technologies institute , it will be funded by energy companies and the government .
the firms committed to the project so far include bp , shell , edf energy and eo.n uk .
the department of trade and industry has already promised to provide half of the overall funding for the institute - up to £ 500m over the next decade .
bp , edf , e.on uk and shell have each offered £ 5m per year .
with the launch of the prospectus , trade and industry secretary alistair darling has called on other private sector companies to come forward .
" if you take wind farm technology , for example , there 's a lot of small companies who individually do lots of things , " he told bbc news .
" we need to bring that together .
" if we bring together what government does , what companies like shell , bp do , if we bring that together , we 've got a better chance of pooling expertise , speeding up the development of these things , " mr darling said .
the initial aim for the new centre will be to improve the efficiency of burning fossil fuels .
it will also fund the development of new energy saving techniques , and look for ways to produce more efficient renewable generation technologies .
iain conn , bp group managing director , said : " the institute will help us share experience and knowledge between public and private sectors to enable development of new technologies . "
experts predict that in 25 years global energy use will have shot up by 50 % , largely because of the growth of the indian and chinese economies .
unless new and better ways are found to generate electricity , heat buildings and power vehicles , this rise in demand will be met by an even greater use of fossil fuels .
worldwide , public funding of energy research has been cut by a half since 1980 and in the uk it is now a 10th of what it used to be .
the proposed new investment by government and industry is an attempt to reverse that trend .
critics , though , say that research alone will not be enough .
they argue that only a carbon levy to increase the cost of fossil fuels will bring about the cuts in emissions that will be needed .
the intention to create the energy technologies institute was announced in the budget on 22 march 2006 .
the dti is inviting companies to express interest in participating in the institute by the end of november .
a director will be selected to provide day-to-day leadership .
it is expected that the institute will be fully operational by 2008 .
it is not known yet where the institute will be hosted .

masuma is an environmental refugee , fleeing from the floods which have always beset her homeland but which are predicted to strike more severely with climate change .
she has found her way to the city from the rural district of bogra - a low-lying area originally formed from himalayan silt where the landscape is still being shaped by the mighty brahmaputra river as it snakes and carves through the soft sandy soil .
" in bogra we had a straw-made house that was nice .
when the flood came there was a big sucking of water and everything went down , " masuma says .
" water was rising in the house and my sister left her baby upon the bed .
when she came back in , the baby was gone .
the baby had been washed away and later on we found the body , " she recalls .
' climate refugees ' masuma 's story is already commonplace in dhaka , the fastest-growing city in the world .
its infrastructure is creaking under the weight of the new arrivals .
climate change is likely to increase the risks to people like her .
climate modellers forecast that as the world warms , the monsoon rains in the region will concentrate into a shorter period , causing a cruel combination of more extreme floods and longer periods of drought .
they also forecast that as sea level rises by up to a metre this century -lrb- the very top of the forecast range -rrb- , as many as 30 million bangladeshis could become climate refugees .
harsh conditions await those who are forced to move to the slums " climate refugees is a term we are going to hear much more of in the future , " observes saleem-ul huq , a fellow at the london-based international institute of environment and development -lrb- iied -rrb- .
he says many bangladeshi families escaping floods and droughts have already slipped over the indian border to swell the shanty towns of delhi , bombay and calcutta .
" the problem is hidden at the moment but it will inevitably come to the fore as climate change forces more and more people out of their homes .
" there will be a high economic cost - and countries that have to bear that cost are likely to be demanding compensation from rich nations for a problem they have not themselves caused , " mr huq predicts .
it is a problem that incenses informed politicians in countries like bangladesh , which are at the sharp end of climate change .
environment minister jafrul islam chowdhury demands that rich nations should take responsibility for a problem they have caused .
" i feel angry , because we are suffering for their activities .
they are responsible for our losses , for the damage to our economy , the displacement of our people . "
the uk government is taking something of a lead in helping bangladesh try to cope , by conducting a review aimed at ensuring that its international aid programme takes account of a changing climate .
the department for international development -lrb- dfid -rrb- believes that up to half its aid projects in the country could be compromised by climate change .
tom tanner , climate and development fellow at the institute of development studies , sussex , uk , is in dhaka reviewing uk aid .
" we estimate that up to 50 % of the -lrb- british -rrb- donor investment in a country like bangladesh is at risk from the impacts of climate change , " he says .
shifting sands dfid is already starting to modify some aid programmes for the poorest of the poor who make their homes on shifting silt islands in the great rivers of bangladesh .
the islands - known as choars - last on average about 20 years .
then the inhabitants are flooded out , and need to seek new land created elsewhere by the highly-dynamic rivers .
locals say siltation levels appear to have diminished , so less new land is being created .
we have nothing left , but we have to survive , so we 've had to build our house from reeds pulmala begum for pulmala begum , who lives on an embankment on the brahmaputra , rebuilding has become commonplace ; but each time she loses more .
she has been displaced by flood waters six times .
" we used to have a house and cattle and now we 've got no land where we can move to .
this time we do n't have any money to make another start , or to educate our children , " she laments .
" we have nothing left , but we have to survive , so we 've had to build our house from reeds . "
the uk government is the biggest donor to bangladesh , but its current annual aid package of £ 125m can not hope to tackle the scale of the challenge now , let alone the problems that will come .
i understand that a review by sir nicholas stern , commissioned by the uk 's prime minister and chancellor to look at the economics of climate change , will conclude that rich nations need to do far more to adapt to the inevitable consequences of climate change .
it will also say developed countries must cut emissions immediately to minimise the effects .
engineering solutions sir nicholas ' approach is criticised by some economists who argue that as climate change is beyond human control we should continue to maximise economic growth so we will be able to afford to pay for adaptation in the future .
in a recent article for the spectator magazine , former chancellor lord lawson argued : " far and away the most cost-effective policy for the world to adopt is to identify the most harmful consequences that may flow from global warming and , if they start to occur , to take action to counter them . "
locals are angry they are paying the cost of the west 's emissions lord lawson suggests that a dutch dyke-building engineer might solve the problems of bangladesh .
the stern review is likely to insist that both mitigation and adaptation are necessary , and will argue that economists have under-estimated the costs that climate change will impose and over-estimated the costs of cutting emissions .
the dutch government itself rejects the optimistic view taken by lord lawson .
a spokesman for the dutch embassy in bangladesh told bbc news that it would be impossible to protect bangladesh in the way holland had been protected .
he said there were 230 rivers , which were much more dynamic than holland 's rivers , consistently undermining attempts to channel them through the sandy soil .
mr huq goes further : " it is ridiculous for people who know nothing about bangladesh to make pronouncements on how much of it can or can not be saved .
" bangladesh is extremely vulnerable , and there is a major moral issue because this is not a problem that people here have caused , " he said .

" in bogra we had a straw-made house that was nice .
when the flood came there was a big sucking of water and everything went down , " masuma says .
" water was rising in the house and my sister left her baby upon the bed .
when she came back in , the baby was gone .
the baby had been washed away and later on we found the body , " she recalls .
' climate refugees ' masuma 's story is already commonplace in dhaka , the fastest-growing city in the world .
its infrastructure is creaking under the weight of the new arrivals .
climate change is likely to increase the risks to people like her .
climate modellers forecast that as the world warms , the monsoon rains in the region will concentrate into a shorter period , causing a cruel combination of more extreme floods and longer periods of drought .
they also forecast that as sea level rises by up to a metre this century -lrb- the very top of the forecast range -rrb- , as many as 30 million bangladeshis could become climate refugees .
harsh conditions await those who are forced to move to the slums " climate refugees is a term we are going to hear much more of in the future , " observes saleem-ul huq , a fellow at the london-based international institute of environment and development -lrb- iied -rrb- .
he says many bangladeshi families escaping floods and droughts have already slipped over the indian border to swell the shanty towns of delhi , bombay and calcutta .
" the problem is hidden at the moment but it will inevitably come to the fore as climate change forces more and more people out of their homes .
" there will be a high economic cost - and countries that have to bear that cost are likely to be demanding compensation from rich nations for a problem they have not themselves caused , " mr huq predicts .
it is a problem that incenses informed politicians in countries like bangladesh , which are at the sharp end of climate change .
environment minister jafrul islam chowdhury demands that rich nations should take responsibility for a problem they have caused .
" i feel angry , because we are suffering for their activities .
they are responsible for our losses , for the damage to our economy , the displacement of our people . "
the uk government is taking something of a lead in helping bangladesh try to cope , by conducting a review aimed at ensuring that its international aid programme takes account of a changing climate .
the department for international development -lrb- dfid -rrb- believes that up to half its aid projects in the country could be compromised by climate change .
tom tanner , climate and development fellow at the institute of development studies , sussex , uk , is in dhaka reviewing uk aid .
" we estimate that up to 50 % of the -lrb- british -rrb- donor investment in a country like bangladesh is at risk from the impacts of climate change , " he says .
shifting sands dfid is already starting to modify some aid programmes for the poorest of the poor who make their homes on shifting silt islands in the great rivers of bangladesh .
the islands - known as choars - last on average about 20 years .
then the inhabitants are flooded out , and need to seek new land created elsewhere by the highly-dynamic rivers .
locals say siltation levels appear to have diminished , so less new land is being created .
we have nothing left , but we have to survive , so we 've had to build our house from reeds pulmala begum for pulmala begum , who lives on an embankment on the brahmaputra , rebuilding has become commonplace ; but each time she loses more .
she has been displaced by flood waters six times .
" we used to have a house and cattle and now we 've got no land where we can move to .
this time we do n't have any money to make another start , or to educate our children , " she laments .
" we have nothing left , but we have to survive , so we 've had to build our house from reeds . "
the uk government is the biggest donor to bangladesh , but its current annual aid package of £ 125m can not hope to tackle the scale of the challenge now , let alone the problems that will come .
i understand that a review by sir nicholas stern , commissioned by the uk 's prime minister and chancellor to look at the economics of climate change , will conclude that rich nations need to do far more to adapt to the inevitable consequences of climate change .
it will also say developed countries must cut emissions immediately to minimise the effects .
engineering solutions sir nicholas ' approach is criticised by some economists who argue that as climate change is beyond human control we should continue to maximise economic growth so we will be able to afford to pay for adaptation in the future .
in a recent article for the spectator magazine , former chancellor lord lawson argued : " far and away the most cost-effective policy for the world to adopt is to identify the most harmful consequences that may flow from global warming and , if they start to occur , to take action to counter them . "
locals are angry they are paying the cost of the west 's emissions lord lawson suggests that a dutch dyke-building engineer might solve the problems of bangladesh .
the stern review is likely to insist that both mitigation and adaptation are necessary , and will argue that economists have under-estimated the costs that climate change will impose and over-estimated the costs of cutting emissions .
the dutch government itself rejects the optimistic view taken by lord lawson .
a spokesman for the dutch embassy in bangladesh told bbc news that it would be impossible to protect bangladesh in the way holland had been protected .
he said there were 230 rivers , which were much more dynamic than holland 's rivers , consistently undermining attempts to channel them through the sandy soil .
mr huq goes further : " it is ridiculous for people who know nothing about bangladesh to make pronouncements on how much of it can or can not be saved .
" bangladesh is extremely vulnerable , and there is a major moral issue because this is not a problem that people here have caused , " he said .

bbc news -pipe- science / nature -pipe- climate fears for bangladesh 's future bbc news / science / nature graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- thursday , 14 september 2006 , 08:39 gmt 09:39 uk climate fears for bangladesh 's future by roger harrabin environment analyst , bbc news , bangladesh masuma 's home is a bamboo and polythene shack in one of the hundreds of slums colonising every square metre of unbuilt land in dhaka , the capital of bangladesh .
masuma is an environmental refugee , fleeing from the floods which have always beset her homeland but which are predicted to strike more severely with climate change .
she has found her way to the city from the rural district of bogra - a low-lying area originally formed from himalayan silt where the landscape is still being shaped by the mighty brahmaputra river as it snakes and carves through the soft sandy soil .
" in bogra we had a straw-made house that was nice .
when the flood came there was a big sucking of water and everything went down , " masuma says .
" water was rising in the house and my sister left her baby upon the bed .
when she came back in , the baby was gone .
the baby had been washed away and later on we found the body , " she recalls .
' climate refugees ' masuma 's story is already commonplace in dhaka , the fastest-growing city in the world .
its infrastructure is creaking under the weight of the new arrivals .
climate change is likely to increase the risks to people like her .
climate modellers forecast that as the world warms , the monsoon rains in the region will concentrate into a shorter period , causing a cruel combination of more extreme floods and longer periods of drought .
they also forecast that as sea level rises by up to a metre this century -lrb- the very top of the forecast range -rrb- , as many as 30 million bangladeshis could become climate refugees .
" climate refugees is a term we are going to hear much more of in the future , " observes saleem-ul huq , a fellow at the london-based international institute of environment and development -lrb- iied -rrb- .
he says many bangladeshi families escaping floods and droughts have already slipped over the indian border to swell the shanty towns of delhi , bombay and calcutta .
" the problem is hidden at the moment but it will inevitably come to the fore as climate change forces more and more people out of their homes .
" there will be a high economic cost - and countries that have to bear that cost are likely to be demanding compensation from rich nations for a problem they have not themselves caused , " mr huq predicts .
it is a problem that incenses informed politicians in countries like bangladesh , which are at the sharp end of climate change .
environment minister jafrul islam chowdhury demands that rich nations should take responsibility for a problem they have caused .
" i feel angry , because we are suffering for their activities .
they are responsible for our losses , for the damage to our economy , the displacement of our people . "
the uk government is taking something of a lead in helping bangladesh try to cope , by conducting a review aimed at ensuring that its international aid programme takes account of a changing climate .
the department for international development -lrb- dfid -rrb- believes that up to half its aid projects in the country could be compromised by climate change .
tom tanner , climate and development fellow at the institute of development studies , sussex , uk , is in dhaka reviewing uk aid .
" we estimate that up to 50 % of the -lrb- british -rrb- donor investment in a country like bangladesh is at risk from the impacts of climate change , " he says .
shifting sands dfid is already starting to modify some aid programmes for the poorest of the poor who make their homes on shifting silt islands in the great rivers of bangladesh .
the islands - known as choars - last on average about 20 years .
then the inhabitants are flooded out , and need to seek new land created elsewhere by the highly-dynamic rivers .
locals say siltation levels appear to have diminished , so less new land is being created . "
we have nothing left , but we have to survive , so we 've had to build our house from reeds " pulmala begum for pulmala begum , who lives on an embankment on the brahmaputra , rebuilding has become commonplace ; but each time she loses more .
she has been displaced by flood waters six times .
" we used to have a house and cattle and now we 've got no land where we can move to .
this time we do n't have any money to make another start , or to educate our children , " she laments .
" we have nothing left , but we have to survive , so we 've had to build our house from reeds . "
the uk government is the biggest donor to bangladesh , but its current annual aid package of £ 125m can not hope to tackle the scale of the challenge now , let alone the problems that will come .
i understand that a review by sir nicholas stern , commissioned by the uk 's prime minister and chancellor to look at the economics of climate change , will conclude that rich nations need to do far more to adapt to the inevitable consequences of climate change .
it will also say developed countries must cut emissions immediately to minimise the effects .
engineering solutions sir nicholas ' approach is criticised by some economists who argue that as climate change is beyond human control we should continue to maximise economic growth so we will be able to afford to pay for adaptation in the future .
in a recent article for the spectator magazine , former chancellor lord lawson argued : " far and away the most cost-effective policy for the world to adopt is to identify the most harmful consequences that may flow from global warming and , if they start to occur , to take action to counter them . "
lord lawson suggests that a dutch dyke-building engineer might solve the problems of bangladesh .
the stern review is likely to insist that both mitigation and adaptation are necessary , and will argue that economists have under-estimated the costs that climate change will impose and over-estimated the costs of cutting emissions .
the dutch government itself rejects the optimistic view taken by lord lawson .
a spokesman for the dutch embassy in bangladesh told bbc news that it would be impossible to protect bangladesh in the way holland had been protected .
he said there were 230 rivers , which were much more dynamic than holland 's rivers , consistently undermining attempts to channel them through the sandy soil .
mr huq goes further : " it is ridiculous for people who know nothing about bangladesh to make pronouncements on how much of it can or can not be saved .
" bangladesh is extremely vulnerable , and there is a major moral issue because this is not a problem that people here have caused , " he said .

in typical banksy fashion , it was not until two hours before the media preview , that i was given the address of the venue for his exhibition .
it turned out to be a dingy , swelteringly hot warehouse in an industrial part of downtown los angeles .
the three-day free show titled barely legal - and billed as a " vandalised warehouse extravaganza " - has an overall theme of global poverty and injustice .
after much hype and secretive planning , the event opens to the public on friday following an invitation-only , celebrity launch party .
the organisers have said cameron diaz , colin farrell and orlando bloom are all expected to attend .
they will be treated to a familiar , but in some respects , head-scratching display of graffiti-inspired artwork . "
i 'm not sure what the point of having an elephant in a warehouse in downtown los angeles is " jason bentley us radio commentator in pictures : banksy in la a 37-year old indian elephant has been painted , from head to tail , in a floral pattern reminiscent of an old fashioned living room or a british pub .
the animal is made to stand in a makeshift living room , complete with sofa , chandelier and decorated with wallpaper in the same pattern .
banksy , as ever , was not on hand to discuss his creation , but it is understood that the elephant , blending into the background , is meant to represent the big issues in life , such as poverty , that some people choose to ignore .
" i do n't feel particularly incensed at the fact that he painted a live animal , " said journalist sorina diaconescu .
" but i think he 's treading a pretty thin line and it 's part of his charm . "
the meaning of the stunt appeared to be lost on some observers .
" i 've still got to get my head around that one , " said jason bentley , a commentator on us public radio .
" i 'm not sure what the point of having an elephant in a warehouse in downtown los angeles is . "
" i 'm not sure that banksy 's work carries a particular message , " added ms diaconescu .
" the medium is the message and in this case just the very fact that there is an elephant in the room , the proverbial elephant in the room , is what he 's trying to say , period . "
there is nothing cryptic about the exhibit that features giant cockroaches clambering over photos of a scantily clad paris hilton along with copies of her cd .
the display features a graffiti style message , " thou shalt not worship false icons . "
earlier this month banksy smuggled 500 " alternative " versions of the heiress 's album into record shops in the uk .
further stunts " i just love his approach and his style and his wit , " said mr bentley .
" it 's really very simple and profound at the same time , that 's what is clever about it .
in a very public arena you can take away something really significant . "
the exhibition also features film footage of banksy 's latest stunt , when he placed a life-size replica of a guantanamo bay detainee in a theme park ride at disneyland .
the operation was caught on camera , covertly , and has been edited into a short film .
as for more stunts in los angeles , during the exhibition weekend , banksy 's people are coy .
" keep your eyes peeled . "

" the medium is the message and in this case just the very fact that there is an elephant in the room , the proverbial elephant in the room , is what he 's trying to say , period . "
there is nothing cryptic about the exhibit that features giant cockroaches clambering over photos of a scantily clad paris hilton along with copies of her cd .
the display features a graffiti style message , " thou shalt not worship false icons . "
earlier this month banksy smuggled 500 " alternative " versions of the heiress 's album into record shops in the uk .
further stunts " i just love his approach and his style and his wit , " said mr bentley .
" it 's really very simple and profound at the same time , that 's what is clever about it .
in a very public arena you can take away something really significant . "
the exhibition also features film footage of banksy 's latest stunt , when he placed a life-size replica of a guantanamo bay detainee in a theme park ride at disneyland .
the operation was caught on camera , covertly , and has been edited into a short film .
as for more stunts in los angeles , during the exhibition weekend , banksy 's people are coy .

in typical banksy fashion , it was not until two hours before the media preview , that i was given the address of the venue for his exhibition .
it turned out to be a dingy , swelteringly hot warehouse in an industrial part of downtown los angeles .
the three-day free show titled barely legal - and billed as a " vandalised warehouse extravaganza " - has an overall theme of global poverty and injustice .
after much hype and secretive planning , the event opens to the public on friday following an invitation-only , celebrity launch party .

the animal is made to stand in a makeshift living room , complete with sofa , chandelier and decorated with wallpaper in the same pattern .
banksy , as ever , was not on hand to discuss his creation , but it is understood that the elephant , blending into the background , is meant to represent the big issues in life , such as poverty , that some people choose to ignore .
" i do n't feel particularly incensed at the fact that he painted a live animal , " said journalist sorina diaconescu .

a study of the sites by the consumer watchdog unearthed pornographic images , evidence of bullying and inappropriate adverts .
it also proved easy to pose as a child as the sites did no age or id checks .
" teenage users need to be aware that there is no way of knowing who is behind the face of a ' friend ' , " said jessica ross , computing which ? editor .
site seeing during its investigation computing which ? took a detailed look at bebo and myspace which are among the most popular social networking sites for teenagers .
in recent years sites such as myspace and bebo have built up a huge following .
myspace claims to have more than 80m users .
the sites let users chat to each other and give each one a personal webspace that can be used as a blog , illustrated with images or to host video clips . "
networking sites need to do more to protect their millions of trusting members " jessica ross , computing which ?
quick guide : blogs the study found a " sinister " side to the social sites and revealed that the ease with which accounts can be created left open many avenues for abuse .
one researcher was able to pose as a 14-year-old on myspace as the site did not require identification or carry out an age check .
in one incident of cyber-bullying one teenage boy organised a vote on his page on whether a girl had aids .
also only minutes after signing up for the sites the researchers uncovered links to pornographic images .
myspace took a couple of hours to remove one image once it was reported but on the bebo site a pornographic image remained two days after it was first spotted and reported .
the sites only monitor images after they have been posted and , said which ? , rely heavily on users to report abuse .
ms ross said : " networking sites , such as myspace.com and bebo.com , need to do more to protect their millions of trusting members . "
myspace and bebo employ security and safety officers who trawl the site for inappropriate content .
computing which ? said the teenager users of the sites it talked to knew how to block unwanted communication and to avoid distasteful sections of the sites .
in response to the report bebo boss michael birch said : " sadly , children face risks in everyday life , whether playing in their school grounds or on the internet .
we are very conscious of this and are working hard to ensure our site is not abused . "

land is a cause of conflict now in bolivia .
a recent survey by the catholic church here found that just 50,000 families own almost 90 % of bolivia 's productive land .
evo morales , the country 's first indigenous president , was elected earlier this year on a platform promising to redistribute land .
few of his constituents are large landowners - most are members of bolivia 's poor , indigenous majority .
they want the state to take the land .
otherwise , some say , they will do so themselves .
but the task is proving harder than imagined , with a key law facilitating government appropriation of unused private land stuck in the senate .
waiting in the eastern province of santa cruz , large landowners say they are hiring armed groups to protect their property from the landless and from alleged illegal activity by the state .
in the same province , indigenous organisations claim to have registered 22,000 families who are landless or land poor . "
our decision is to stay here until death and fight for our children " anto lopez settler while the reform is stalled , tensions in the region are increasing .
bolivia 's permanent assembly for human rights reported eight deaths this year .
a six-hour drive from the city of santa cruz is nucleo 29 , a tiny hamlet of about 30 houses which sits on the edge of an inaccessible field , surrounded by swamp .
most of the villagers here came from bolivia 's barren altiplano -lrb- high plateau in the andes -rrb- in search of land .
they moved onto the field five years ago , claiming it was unused .
last year they were violently removed by the police and one of them died .
his gravestone sits at the entrance to the village .
but the settlers are still here , waiting to get the land back .
building houses we arrived past midnight and found them huddled in a group inside a makeshift school .
they will not talk to the local press here , who call them terrorists , so at the meeting we were introduced as " the bbc from london , usa " .
" we lived here five years , " says anto lopez .
" then , a year ago the owner came .
this hurt because she was taking our work , our houses .
" our decision is to stay here until death and fight for our children .
we hope the president will resolve this problem for us as quickly as possible . "
back in the village , we could see that the field was now being used by its owner .
but the settlers have not given up .
instead they are building new houses and working what land they can .
village leader santo garcia explained : " we 're living here illegally .
we have no social function , we do n't pay any taxes .
nothing .
therefore we want the government to give back the land to families who have nothing . "
" we have nothing to eat , " adds leona cruz .
" we want to take this land , so we can work it and give our children food . "
' no protection ' but to give back land to these people the government must first take it away from others . "
there have been cases where the landless movement has gone in and set fire to camps and houses " branco marinkovic we contacted one of the largest regional landowners , branco marinkovic , and were told to meet him at 6.30am outside hanger 19 in santa cruz 's central airport .
in unseasonal wind and rain we flew low over his 12,000 hectares -lrb- 30,000 acres -rrb- of land .
he pointed out the clearings in the forest making way for new rice and soya fields in this , the most productive part of bolivia .
back on the ground , he described the problems he and his fellow landowners were experiencing .
" these people have been going into farms and into land that is being used .
there have been cases where the landless movement has gone in and set fire to camps and houses . "
and , are the police protecting land such as his ?
" no , " is the reply .
so how does he defend his land ?
" you ca n't go out and start shooting each other , " he says .
" i mean that would not be civilised and we do n't want this country to go to civil war . "
as we tour the sunflower plantation , in full bloom during the supposed dry season , i ask mr marinkovic if he thinks the government might send in the police or army to take his land .
" it might happen , i mean its happened in venezuela ...
it would be a shame if we could compare ourselves in a few years time to rhodesia -lrb- zimbabwe -rrb- or some other african country , " he says .
with the two sides so polarised it seems clear the president will have to negotiate in order to achieve an orderly land reform .
but it is not yet clear he is willing to do so .
as the situation stands , tension and conflict here in bolivia 's " wild east " will only increase .
