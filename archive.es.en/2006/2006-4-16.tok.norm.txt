benedict said he was praying that leaders and international organizations " be strengthened in their will to achieve peaceful coexistence among different races , cultures and religions , in order to remove the threat of terrorism . " similarly , " patient and persevering dialogue " was needed in the middle east , " to remove both ancient and new obstacles . "

the square had been brightly decorated with a huge floral display of yellow and white flowers , the colors of the vatican , to mark the most joyous day of the christian calendar , the resurrection of jesus christ .
german greeting caused cheers " dear brothers and sisters , christ is risen ! " a smiling benedict told cheering pilgrims from the central balcony of st peter 's cathedral , from where he pronounced his " urbi et orbi " message after the mass . as a brisk spring breeze ruffled the pontiff 's cream and gold vestments , he addressed catholics around the world in 62 languages , from malay to maltese , swedish to swahili .
the pilgrims and tourists reserved their biggest cheer for the moment he spoke in his native german . the greeting at the end of the mass was made famous by his predecessor john paul ii .

" silvio berlusconi has shown he is ready to start a series of discussions .
yet all we 've seen from prodi are muscular responses , " said paolo bonaiuti . the supreme court is not expected to issue a final confirmation of prodi 's victory until after the easter weekend break , probably tuesday or wednesday , when a recount of contested votes - demanded by berlusconi - is expected to be finalized . " italy is split right in two after last sunday 's vote , " said bonaiuti , accusing prodi of attempting " a trial of strength . "

it also has a wafer-thin two-seat majority in the senate . the closest election in living memory prompted berlusconi 's last-ditch appeal saturday for a short-term power-sharing government .
in an open letter to the corriere della sera daily , berlusconi proposed that the rival coalitions forge a short-term agreement " to meet the country 's immediate institutional , economic and international timetable . " prodi immediately dismissed the overture , instead demanding an apology from the conservative leader .
" after what he said about vote-rigging , he should ask for forgiveness , " he said .
on sunday , prodi said he had " closed a chapter " and was now looking to the future . " the country needs a breather , it needs to fly high , it needs joy , it needs to recuperate .
now we want to leave these -lrb- divisions -rrb- aside and begin to work for the country , " he told journalists outside his home in bologna .

" silvio berlusconi has shown he is ready to start a series of discussions .
yet all we 've seen from prodi are muscular responses , " said paolo bonaiuti . the supreme court is not expected to issue a final confirmation of prodi 's victory until after the easter weekend break , probably tuesday or wednesday , when a recount of contested votes - demanded by berlusconi - is expected to be finalized . " italy is split right in two after last sunday 's vote , " said bonaiuti , accusing prodi of attempting " a trial of strength . "
" in this situation of deep division , what is prodi doing ?
instead of healing wounds , he 's throwing salt on them , " he added . " time to work " prodi , the 66-year-old former european commission president , told reporters nothing had changed sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi 's ready to get to work " enough .
it 's time to work .
i am working calmly for a future government , and that 's what we must do , " said prodi , whose tiny 25,000 vote majority was just enough to win his disparate union coalition a working majority in the 630-seat lower house of parliament .
it also has a wafer-thin two-seat majority in the senate . the closest election in living memory prompted berlusconi 's last-ditch appeal saturday for a short-term power-sharing government .
in an open letter to the corriere della sera daily , berlusconi proposed that the rival coalitions forge a short-term agreement " to meet the country 's immediate institutional , economic and international timetable . " prodi immediately dismissed the overture , instead demanding an apology from the conservative leader .
" after what he said about vote-rigging , he should ask for forgiveness , " he said .
on sunday , prodi said he had " closed a chapter " and was now looking to the future . " the country needs a breather , it needs to fly high , it needs joy , it needs to recuperate .
now we want to leave these -lrb- divisions -rrb- aside and begin to work for the country , " he told journalists outside his home in bologna .
counting chickens ?
berlusconi has kept up a steady barrage of invectives since prodi was declared winner on tuesday , according to provisional results .
citing irregularities , he demanded a re-check of what the interior ministry said were some 43,000 contested votes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi had hoped a recount would change the results however , his battle to stay in power suffered a severe blow on friday when it emerged that there were too few disputed votes to reverse the outcome of the election . in a new twist to the election saga on saturday , former reforms minister roberto calderoli said that more than 45,000 votes cast for a center-left party in lombardy , northern italy , should be ruled illegal .
calderoli said that the small lega alleanza lombarda had registered its candidates in only one constituency , contravening italy 's new electoral law . " do n't count your chickens before they 're hatched .
prodi 's victory is far from being guaranteed .
in fact , it 's melting like snow under the sun , " said calderoli . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope urges talks with iran in easter message pope benedict xvi called for peace across the world in a traditional easter message sunday , his 79th birthday , highlighting particular concern over iran 's nuclear drive and conflicts and poverty across the globe .

benedict said he was praying that leaders and international organizations " be strengthened in their will to achieve peaceful coexistence among different races , cultures and religions , in order to remove the threat of terrorism . " similarly , " patient and persevering dialogue " was needed in the middle east , " to remove both ancient and new obstacles . "
" may the international community , which reaffirms israel 's just right to exist in peace , assist the palestinian people to overcome the precarious conditions in which they live and to build their future , moving towards the constitution of a state that is truly their own . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : darfur remains a crisis region much of his appeal focused on africa , particularly sudan 's troubled darfur region , where he said the humanitarian situation was " no longer sustainable . "
the pontiff lamented that " many wounds have yet to be healed " across the continent , particularly in the great lakes region , the horn of africa , the ivory coast , uganda , zimbabwe and other nations " which aspire to reconciliation , justice and progress . "
prayer for italian harmony the huge crowd of pilgrims and tourists applauded when the pope prayed for " harmony " in italy .
prime minister silvio berlusconi is refusing to concede defeat to the leftist opposition leader romano prodi after a disputed general election .
the country 's supreme court is to give its verdict on the winner next week after a partial recount of disputed votes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi -lrb- r -rrb- refuses to concede defeat to prodi the pope looked tired after just a few hours sleep following an easter vigil which ended early sunday . an italian carabinieri band and the band of the swiss guards played as benedict , celebrating his 79th birthday , led dozens of cardinals onto the square at the start of the mass , waving to the cheering crowd as he walked .
the square had been brightly decorated with a huge floral display of yellow and white flowers , the colors of the vatican , to mark the most joyous day of the christian calendar , the resurrection of jesus christ .
german greeting caused cheers " dear brothers and sisters , christ is risen ! " a smiling benedict told cheering pilgrims from the central balcony of st peter 's cathedral , from where he pronounced his " urbi et orbi " message after the mass . as a brisk spring breeze ruffled the pontiff 's cream and gold vestments , he addressed catholics around the world in 62 languages , from malay to maltese , swedish to swahili .
the pilgrims and tourists reserved their biggest cheer for the moment he spoke in his native german . the greeting at the end of the mass was made famous by his predecessor john paul ii .

" silvio berlusconi has shown he is ready to start a series of discussions .
yet all we 've seen from prodi are muscular responses , " said paolo bonaiuti . the supreme court is not expected to issue a final confirmation of prodi 's victory until after the easter weekend break , probably tuesday or wednesday , when a recount of contested votes - demanded by berlusconi - is expected to be finalized . " italy is split right in two after last sunday 's vote , " said bonaiuti , accusing prodi of attempting " a trial of strength . "

i am working calmly for a future government , and that 's what we must do , " said prodi , whose tiny 25,000 vote majority was just enough to win his disparate union coalition a working majority in the 630-seat lower house of parliament .
it also has a wafer-thin two-seat majority in the senate . the closest election in living memory prompted berlusconi 's last-ditch appeal saturday for a short-term power-sharing government .
in an open letter to the corriere della sera daily , berlusconi proposed that the rival coalitions forge a short-term agreement " to meet the country 's immediate institutional , economic and international timetable . " prodi immediately dismissed the overture , instead demanding an apology from the conservative leader .
" after what he said about vote-rigging , he should ask for forgiveness , " he said .
on sunday , prodi said he had " closed a chapter " and was now looking to the future . " the country needs a breather , it needs to fly high , it needs joy , it needs to recuperate .
now we want to leave these -lrb- divisions -rrb- aside and begin to work for the country , " he told journalists outside his home in bologna .
counting chickens ?
berlusconi has kept up a steady barrage of invectives since prodi was declared winner on tuesday , according to provisional results .
citing irregularities , he demanded a re-check of what the interior ministry said were some 43,000 contested votes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi had hoped a recount would change the results however , his battle to stay in power suffered a severe blow on friday when it emerged that there were too few disputed votes to reverse the outcome of the election . in a new twist to the election saga on saturday , former reforms minister roberto calderoli said that more than 45,000 votes cast for a center-left party in lombardy , northern italy , should be ruled illegal .
calderoli said that the small lega alleanza lombarda had registered its candidates in only one constituency , contravening italy 's new electoral law . " do n't count your chickens before they 're hatched .

berlusconi has kept up a steady barrage of invectives since prodi was declared winner on tuesday , according to provisional results .
citing irregularities , he demanded a re-check of what the interior ministry said were some 43,000 contested votes .

calderoli said that the small lega alleanza lombarda had registered its candidates in only one constituency , contravening italy 's new electoral law . " do n't count your chickens before they 're hatched .

" silvio berlusconi has shown he is ready to start a series of discussions .
yet all we 've seen from prodi are muscular responses , " said paolo bonaiuti . the supreme court is not expected to issue a final confirmation of prodi 's victory until after the easter weekend break , probably tuesday or wednesday , when a recount of contested votes - demanded by berlusconi - is expected to be finalized . " italy is split right in two after last sunday 's vote , " said bonaiuti , accusing prodi of attempting " a trial of strength . "
" in this situation of deep division , what is prodi doing ?
instead of healing wounds , he 's throwing salt on them , " he added . " time to work " prodi , the 66-year-old former european commission president , told reporters nothing had changed sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi 's ready to get to work " enough .
it 's time to work .
i am working calmly for a future government , and that 's what we must do , " said prodi , whose tiny 25,000 vote majority was just enough to win his disparate union coalition a working majority in the 630-seat lower house of parliament .
it also has a wafer-thin two-seat majority in the senate . the closest election in living memory prompted berlusconi 's last-ditch appeal saturday for a short-term power-sharing government .
in an open letter to the corriere della sera daily , berlusconi proposed that the rival coalitions forge a short-term agreement " to meet the country 's immediate institutional , economic and international timetable . " prodi immediately dismissed the overture , instead demanding an apology from the conservative leader .
" after what he said about vote-rigging , he should ask for forgiveness , " he said .
on sunday , prodi said he had " closed a chapter " and was now looking to the future . " the country needs a breather , it needs to fly high , it needs joy , it needs to recuperate .

" silvio berlusconi has shown he is ready to start a series of discussions .
yet all we 've seen from prodi are muscular responses , " said paolo bonaiuti . the supreme court is not expected to issue a final confirmation of prodi 's victory until after the easter weekend break , probably tuesday or wednesday , when a recount of contested votes - demanded by berlusconi - is expected to be finalized . " italy is split right in two after last sunday 's vote , " said bonaiuti , accusing prodi of attempting " a trial of strength . "
" in this situation of deep division , what is prodi doing ?

it 's time to work .
i am working calmly for a future government , and that 's what we must do , " said prodi , whose tiny 25,000 vote majority was just enough to win his disparate union coalition a working majority in the 630-seat lower house of parliament .
it also has a wafer-thin two-seat majority in the senate . the closest election in living memory prompted berlusconi 's last-ditch appeal saturday for a short-term power-sharing government .
in an open letter to the corriere della sera daily , berlusconi proposed that the rival coalitions forge a short-term agreement " to meet the country 's immediate institutional , economic and international timetable . " prodi immediately dismissed the overture , instead demanding an apology from the conservative leader .
" after what he said about vote-rigging , he should ask for forgiveness , " he said .
on sunday , prodi said he had " closed a chapter " and was now looking to the future . " the country needs a breather , it needs to fly high , it needs joy , it needs to recuperate .
now we want to leave these -lrb- divisions -rrb- aside and begin to work for the country , " he told journalists outside his home in bologna .
counting chickens ?
berlusconi has kept up a steady barrage of invectives since prodi was declared winner on tuesday , according to provisional results .
citing irregularities , he demanded a re-check of what the interior ministry said were some 43,000 contested votes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi had hoped a recount would change the results however , his battle to stay in power suffered a severe blow on friday when it emerged that there were too few disputed votes to reverse the outcome of the election . in a new twist to the election saga on saturday , former reforms minister roberto calderoli said that more than 45,000 votes cast for a center-left party in lombardy , northern italy , should be ruled illegal .
calderoli said that the small lega alleanza lombarda had registered its candidates in only one constituency , contravening italy 's new electoral law . " do n't count your chickens before they 're hatched .

" silvio berlusconi has shown he is ready to start a series of discussions .
yet all we 've seen from prodi are muscular responses , " said paolo bonaiuti . the supreme court is not expected to issue a final confirmation of prodi 's victory until after the easter weekend break , probably tuesday or wednesday , when a recount of contested votes - demanded by berlusconi - is expected to be finalized . " italy is split right in two after last sunday 's vote , " said bonaiuti , accusing prodi of attempting " a trial of strength . "
" in this situation of deep division , what is prodi doing ?
instead of healing wounds , he 's throwing salt on them , " he added . " time to work " prodi , the 66-year-old former european commission president , told reporters nothing had changed sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi 's ready to get to work " enough .
it 's time to work .
i am working calmly for a future government , and that 's what we must do , " said prodi , whose tiny 25,000 vote majority was just enough to win his disparate union coalition a working majority in the 630-seat lower house of parliament .
it also has a wafer-thin two-seat majority in the senate . the closest election in living memory prompted berlusconi 's last-ditch appeal saturday for a short-term power-sharing government .
in an open letter to the corriere della sera daily , berlusconi proposed that the rival coalitions forge a short-term agreement " to meet the country 's immediate institutional , economic and international timetable . " prodi immediately dismissed the overture , instead demanding an apology from the conservative leader .
" after what he said about vote-rigging , he should ask for forgiveness , " he said .
on sunday , prodi said he had " closed a chapter " and was now looking to the future . " the country needs a breather , it needs to fly high , it needs joy , it needs to recuperate .
now we want to leave these -lrb- divisions -rrb- aside and begin to work for the country , " he told journalists outside his home in bologna .
counting chickens ?
berlusconi has kept up a steady barrage of invectives since prodi was declared winner on tuesday , according to provisional results .
citing irregularities , he demanded a re-check of what the interior ministry said were some 43,000 contested votes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi had hoped a recount would change the results however , his battle to stay in power suffered a severe blow on friday when it emerged that there were too few disputed votes to reverse the outcome of the election . in a new twist to the election saga on saturday , former reforms minister roberto calderoli said that more than 45,000 votes cast for a center-left party in lombardy , northern italy , should be ruled illegal .
calderoli said that the small lega alleanza lombarda had registered its candidates in only one constituency , contravening italy 's new electoral law . " do n't count your chickens before they 're hatched .

" similarly , " patient and persevering dialogue " was needed in the middle east , " to remove both ancient and new obstacles . "

the square had been brightly decorated with a huge floral display of yellow and white flowers , the colors of the vatican , to mark the most joyous day of the christian calendar , the resurrection of jesus christ .

" silvio berlusconi has shown he is ready to start a series of discussions .
yet all we 've seen from prodi are muscular responses , " said paolo bonaiuti . the supreme court is not expected to issue a final confirmation of prodi 's victory until after the easter weekend break , probably tuesday or wednesday , when a recount of contested votes - demanded by berlusconi - is expected to be finalized . " italy is split right in two after last sunday 's vote , " said bonaiuti , accusing prodi of attempting " a trial of strength . "
" in this situation of deep division , what is prodi doing ?
instead of healing wounds , he 's throwing salt on them , " he added . " time to work " prodi , the 66-year-old former european commission president , told reporters nothing had changed sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi 's ready to get to work " enough .
it 's time to work .
i am working calmly for a future government , and that 's what we must do , " said prodi , whose tiny 25,000 vote majority was just enough to win his disparate union coalition a working majority in the 630-seat lower house of parliament .
it also has a wafer-thin two-seat majority in the senate . the closest election in living memory prompted berlusconi 's last-ditch appeal saturday for a short-term power-sharing government .
in an open letter to the corriere della sera daily , berlusconi proposed that the rival coalitions forge a short-term agreement " to meet the country 's immediate institutional , economic and international timetable . " prodi immediately dismissed the overture , instead demanding an apology from the conservative leader .
" after what he said about vote-rigging , he should ask for forgiveness , " he said .
on sunday , prodi said he had " closed a chapter " and was now looking to the future . " the country needs a breather , it needs to fly high , it needs joy , it needs to recuperate .
now we want to leave these -lrb- divisions -rrb- aside and begin to work for the country , " he told journalists outside his home in bologna .
counting chickens ?
berlusconi has kept up a steady barrage of invectives since prodi was declared winner on tuesday , according to provisional results .
citing irregularities , he demanded a re-check of what the interior ministry said were some 43,000 contested votes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi had hoped a recount would change the results however , his battle to stay in power suffered a severe blow on friday when it emerged that there were too few disputed votes to reverse the outcome of the election . in a new twist to the election saga on saturday , former reforms minister roberto calderoli said that more than 45,000 votes cast for a center-left party in lombardy , northern italy , should be ruled illegal .
calderoli said that the small lega alleanza lombarda had registered its candidates in only one constituency , contravening italy 's new electoral law . " do n't count your chickens before they 're hatched .
prodi 's victory is far from being guaranteed .
in fact , it 's melting like snow under the sun , " said calderoli . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope urges talks with iran in easter message pope benedict xvi called for peace across the world in a traditional easter message sunday , his 79th birthday , highlighting particular concern over iran 's nuclear drive and conflicts and poverty across the globe .

" silvio berlusconi has shown he is ready to start a series of discussions .
yet all we 've seen from prodi are muscular responses , " said paolo bonaiuti . the supreme court is not expected to issue a final confirmation of prodi 's victory until after the easter weekend break , probably tuesday or wednesday , when a recount of contested votes - demanded by berlusconi - is expected to be finalized . " italy is split right in two after last sunday 's vote , " said bonaiuti , accusing prodi of attempting " a trial of strength . "
" in this situation of deep division , what is prodi doing ?
instead of healing wounds , he 's throwing salt on them , " he added . " time to work " prodi , the 66-year-old former european commission president , told reporters nothing had changed sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi 's ready to get to work " enough .
it 's time to work .
i am working calmly for a future government , and that 's what we must do , " said prodi , whose tiny 25,000 vote majority was just enough to win his disparate union coalition a working majority in the 630-seat lower house of parliament .
it also has a wafer-thin two-seat majority in the senate . the closest election in living memory prompted berlusconi 's last-ditch appeal saturday for a short-term power-sharing government .
in an open letter to the corriere della sera daily , berlusconi proposed that the rival coalitions forge a short-term agreement " to meet the country 's immediate institutional , economic and international timetable . " prodi immediately dismissed the overture , instead demanding an apology from the conservative leader .
" after what he said about vote-rigging , he should ask for forgiveness , " he said .
on sunday , prodi said he had " closed a chapter " and was now looking to the future . " the country needs a breather , it needs to fly high , it needs joy , it needs to recuperate .
now we want to leave these -lrb- divisions -rrb- aside and begin to work for the country , " he told journalists outside his home in bologna .
counting chickens ?
berlusconi has kept up a steady barrage of invectives since prodi was declared winner on tuesday , according to provisional results .
citing irregularities , he demanded a re-check of what the interior ministry said were some 43,000 contested votes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi had hoped a recount would change the results however , his battle to stay in power suffered a severe blow on friday when it emerged that there were too few disputed votes to reverse the outcome of the election . in a new twist to the election saga on saturday , former reforms minister roberto calderoli said that more than 45,000 votes cast for a center-left party in lombardy , northern italy , should be ruled illegal .
calderoli said that the small lega alleanza lombarda had registered its candidates in only one constituency , contravening italy 's new electoral law . " do n't count your chickens before they 're hatched .
prodi 's victory is far from being guaranteed .

" silvio berlusconi has shown he is ready to start a series of discussions .
yet all we 've seen from prodi are muscular responses , " said paolo bonaiuti . the supreme court is not expected to issue a final confirmation of prodi 's victory until after the easter weekend break , probably tuesday or wednesday , when a recount of contested votes - demanded by berlusconi - is expected to be finalized . " italy is split right in two after last sunday 's vote , " said bonaiuti , accusing prodi of attempting " a trial of strength . "
" in this situation of deep division , what is prodi doing ?
instead of healing wounds , he 's throwing salt on them , " he added . " time to work " prodi , the 66-year-old former european commission president , told reporters nothing had changed sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi 's ready to get to work " enough .
it 's time to work .
i am working calmly for a future government , and that 's what we must do , " said prodi , whose tiny 25,000 vote majority was just enough to win his disparate union coalition a working majority in the 630-seat lower house of parliament .
it also has a wafer-thin two-seat majority in the senate . the closest election in living memory prompted berlusconi 's last-ditch appeal saturday for a short-term power-sharing government .
in an open letter to the corriere della sera daily , berlusconi proposed that the rival coalitions forge a short-term agreement " to meet the country 's immediate institutional , economic and international timetable . " prodi immediately dismissed the overture , instead demanding an apology from the conservative leader .
" after what he said about vote-rigging , he should ask for forgiveness , " he said .
on sunday , prodi said he had " closed a chapter " and was now looking to the future . " the country needs a breather , it needs to fly high , it needs joy , it needs to recuperate .
now we want to leave these -lrb- divisions -rrb- aside and begin to work for the country , " he told journalists outside his home in bologna .
counting chickens ?
berlusconi has kept up a steady barrage of invectives since prodi was declared winner on tuesday , according to provisional results .
citing irregularities , he demanded a re-check of what the interior ministry said were some 43,000 contested votes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi had hoped a recount would change the results however , his battle to stay in power suffered a severe blow on friday when it emerged that there were too few disputed votes to reverse the outcome of the election . in a new twist to the election saga on saturday , former reforms minister roberto calderoli said that more than 45,000 votes cast for a center-left party in lombardy , northern italy , should be ruled illegal .
calderoli said that the small lega alleanza lombarda had registered its candidates in only one constituency , contravening italy 's new electoral law . " do n't count your chickens before they 're hatched .

" similarly , " patient and persevering dialogue " was needed in the middle east , " to remove both ancient and new obstacles . "

benedict said he was praying that leaders and international organizations " be strengthened in their will to achieve peaceful coexistence among different races , cultures and religions , in order to remove the threat of terrorism . " similarly , " patient and persevering dialogue " was needed in the middle east , " to remove both ancient and new obstacles . "
" may the international community , which reaffirms israel 's just right to exist in peace , assist the palestinian people to overcome the precarious conditions in which they live and to build their future , moving towards the constitution of a state that is truly their own . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : darfur remains a crisis region much of his appeal focused on africa , particularly sudan 's troubled darfur region , where he said the humanitarian situation was " no longer sustainable . "
the pontiff lamented that " many wounds have yet to be healed " across the continent , particularly in the great lakes region , the horn of africa , the ivory coast , uganda , zimbabwe and other nations " which aspire to reconciliation , justice and progress . "
prayer for italian harmony the huge crowd of pilgrims and tourists applauded when the pope prayed for " harmony " in italy .
prime minister silvio berlusconi is refusing to concede defeat to the leftist opposition leader romano prodi after a disputed general election .
the country 's supreme court is to give its verdict on the winner next week after a partial recount of disputed votes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi -lrb- r -rrb- refuses to concede defeat to prodi the pope looked tired after just a few hours sleep following an easter vigil which ended early sunday . an italian carabinieri band and the band of the swiss guards played as benedict , celebrating his 79th birthday , led dozens of cardinals onto the square at the start of the mass , waving to the cheering crowd as he walked .
the square had been brightly decorated with a huge floral display of yellow and white flowers , the colors of the vatican , to mark the most joyous day of the christian calendar , the resurrection of jesus christ .
german greeting caused cheers " dear brothers and sisters , christ is risen !

" silvio berlusconi has shown he is ready to start a series of discussions .
yet all we 've seen from prodi are muscular responses , " said paolo bonaiuti . the supreme court is not expected to issue a final confirmation of prodi 's victory until after the easter weekend break , probably tuesday or wednesday , when a recount of contested votes - demanded by berlusconi - is expected to be finalized . " italy is split right in two after last sunday 's vote , " said bonaiuti , accusing prodi of attempting " a trial of strength . "
" in this situation of deep division , what is prodi doing ?
instead of healing wounds , he 's throwing salt on them , " he added . " time to work " prodi , the 66-year-old former european commission president , told reporters nothing had changed sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi 's ready to get to work " enough .
it 's time to work .
i am working calmly for a future government , and that 's what we must do , " said prodi , whose tiny 25,000 vote majority was just enough to win his disparate union coalition a working majority in the 630-seat lower house of parliament .
it also has a wafer-thin two-seat majority in the senate . the closest election in living memory prompted berlusconi 's last-ditch appeal saturday for a short-term power-sharing government .
in an open letter to the corriere della sera daily , berlusconi proposed that the rival coalitions forge a short-term agreement " to meet the country 's immediate institutional , economic and international timetable . " prodi immediately dismissed the overture , instead demanding an apology from the conservative leader .
" after what he said about vote-rigging , he should ask for forgiveness , " he said .
on sunday , prodi said he had " closed a chapter " and was now looking to the future . " the country needs a breather , it needs to fly high , it needs joy , it needs to recuperate .
now we want to leave these -lrb- divisions -rrb- aside and begin to work for the country , " he told journalists outside his home in bologna .
counting chickens ?
berlusconi has kept up a steady barrage of invectives since prodi was declared winner on tuesday , according to provisional results .
citing irregularities , he demanded a re-check of what the interior ministry said were some 43,000 contested votes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi had hoped a recount would change the results however , his battle to stay in power suffered a severe blow on friday when it emerged that there were too few disputed votes to reverse the outcome of the election . in a new twist to the election saga on saturday , former reforms minister roberto calderoli said that more than 45,000 votes cast for a center-left party in lombardy , northern italy , should be ruled illegal .
calderoli said that the small lega alleanza lombarda had registered its candidates in only one constituency , contravening italy 's new electoral law . " do n't count your chickens before they 're hatched .
prodi 's victory is far from being guaranteed .
in fact , it 's melting like snow under the sun , " said calderoli . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope urges talks with iran in easter message pope benedict xvi called for peace across the world in a traditional easter message sunday , his 79th birthday , highlighting particular concern over iran 's nuclear drive and conflicts and poverty across the globe .

" silvio berlusconi has shown he is ready to start a series of discussions .
yet all we 've seen from prodi are muscular responses , " said paolo bonaiuti . the supreme court is not expected to issue a final confirmation of prodi 's victory until after the easter weekend break , probably tuesday or wednesday , when a recount of contested votes - demanded by berlusconi - is expected to be finalized . " italy is split right in two after last sunday 's vote , " said bonaiuti , accusing prodi of attempting " a trial of strength . "
" in this situation of deep division , what is prodi doing ?
instead of healing wounds , he 's throwing salt on them , " he added . " time to work " prodi , the 66-year-old former european commission president , told reporters nothing had changed sunday .

i am working calmly for a future government , and that 's what we must do , " said prodi , whose tiny 25,000 vote majority was just enough to win his disparate union coalition a working majority in the 630-seat lower house of parliament .
it also has a wafer-thin two-seat majority in the senate . the closest election in living memory prompted berlusconi 's last-ditch appeal saturday for a short-term power-sharing government .
in an open letter to the corriere della sera daily , berlusconi proposed that the rival coalitions forge a short-term agreement " to meet the country 's immediate institutional , economic and international timetable . " prodi immediately dismissed the overture , instead demanding an apology from the conservative leader .
" after what he said about vote-rigging , he should ask for forgiveness , " he said .
on sunday , prodi said he had " closed a chapter " and was now looking to the future . " the country needs a breather , it needs to fly high , it needs joy , it needs to recuperate .
now we want to leave these -lrb- divisions -rrb- aside and begin to work for the country , " he told journalists outside his home in bologna .
counting chickens ?
berlusconi has kept up a steady barrage of invectives since prodi was declared winner on tuesday , according to provisional results .
citing irregularities , he demanded a re-check of what the interior ministry said were some 43,000 contested votes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi had hoped a recount would change the results however , his battle to stay in power suffered a severe blow on friday when it emerged that there were too few disputed votes to reverse the outcome of the election . in a new twist to the election saga on saturday , former reforms minister roberto calderoli said that more than 45,000 votes cast for a center-left party in lombardy , northern italy , should be ruled illegal .
calderoli said that the small lega alleanza lombarda had registered its candidates in only one constituency , contravening italy 's new electoral law . " do n't count your chickens before they 're hatched .

" silvio berlusconi has shown he is ready to start a series of discussions .
yet all we 've seen from prodi are muscular responses , " said paolo bonaiuti . the supreme court is not expected to issue a final confirmation of prodi 's victory until after the easter weekend break , probably tuesday or wednesday , when a recount of contested votes - demanded by berlusconi - is expected to be finalized . " italy is split right in two after last sunday 's vote , " said bonaiuti , accusing prodi of attempting " a trial of strength . "
" in this situation of deep division , what is prodi doing ?
instead of healing wounds , he 's throwing salt on them , " he added . " time to work " prodi , the 66-year-old former european commission president , told reporters nothing had changed sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi 's ready to get to work " enough .
it 's time to work .
i am working calmly for a future government , and that 's what we must do , " said prodi , whose tiny 25,000 vote majority was just enough to win his disparate union coalition a working majority in the 630-seat lower house of parliament .
it also has a wafer-thin two-seat majority in the senate . the closest election in living memory prompted berlusconi 's last-ditch appeal saturday for a short-term power-sharing government .
in an open letter to the corriere della sera daily , berlusconi proposed that the rival coalitions forge a short-term agreement " to meet the country 's immediate institutional , economic and international timetable . " prodi immediately dismissed the overture , instead demanding an apology from the conservative leader .
" after what he said about vote-rigging , he should ask for forgiveness , " he said .
on sunday , prodi said he had " closed a chapter " and was now looking to the future . " the country needs a breather , it needs to fly high , it needs joy , it needs to recuperate .
now we want to leave these -lrb- divisions -rrb- aside and begin to work for the country , " he told journalists outside his home in bologna .
counting chickens ?
berlusconi has kept up a steady barrage of invectives since prodi was declared winner on tuesday , according to provisional results .
citing irregularities , he demanded a re-check of what the interior ministry said were some 43,000 contested votes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi had hoped a recount would change the results however , his battle to stay in power suffered a severe blow on friday when it emerged that there were too few disputed votes to reverse the outcome of the election . in a new twist to the election saga on saturday , former reforms minister roberto calderoli said that more than 45,000 votes cast for a center-left party in lombardy , northern italy , should be ruled illegal .
calderoli said that the small lega alleanza lombarda had registered its candidates in only one constituency , contravening italy 's new electoral law . " do n't count your chickens before they 're hatched .

china sees taiwan as part of its territory and has threatened to use force if the island ever moved to declare formal independence .
however throughout his speech on sunday , president hu stressed the importance of peace .
he said the two sides should " resume talks on an equal footing as soon as possible " .
overtures top level talks have been suspended since 1999 when former taiwanese president lee teng-hui said relations should be " special state to state " .
