" i 'm not criticizing what jens lehmann did , but with me germany would have been world champions , " kahn , 37 , told the weekly newsmagazine stern . " i 'm convinced of it because the way my career has evolved points in that direction , " said kahn , who retired from the national side after sealing the bronze medal with a 3-1 win over portugal . " in 1994 with karlsruhe i reached the semi-finals of the uefa cup - two years later i won this trophy with bayern munich , " he explained . " in 1999 , i lost the champions league final in the harshest circumstances -lrb- losing 2-1 to manchester united in stoppage time -rrb- before winning this competition two years later .

" this logic , and i really believe in the law of series , should have continued at the 2006 world cup , " said kahn . klinsi did n't believe in kahn 's theory kahn , who is under contract with bayern munich until 2008 , said that he had tried to explain his theory to world cup coach jürgen klinsmann before the competition but " he did n't understand or did n't want to understand " . " i told him ' i do n't understand why you wo n't admit that i 'm right ' , " he added . germany previously won the world cup in 1954 , 1974 and 1990 . dw staff / afp -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de women wrestlers caught stealing duty-free perfume the fragrances on display at a frankfurt airport duty-free shop proved simply irresistible for two members of the ukrainian women 's national wrestling team .

but anti-terrorism laws in the us make it harder for americans to get their fruitcake fix . in its 550-year existence , the dresdner stollen has become a regular part of german christmases as well as those of other people around the world .
but none of its bakers is willing to cough up the cake 's recipe . " it has to be partially handmade and have a certain percentage of butter and particular amounts of raisins , lemon and orange peel , " said elisabeth kreuzkamm-aumüller , a dresden bakery owner .
" it is also very important that it does not have any margarine or artificial flavors . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many say dresdner stollen leave other fruit cakes in the -lrb- powered sugar -rrb- dust the cake also needs to have almonds and be shaped in traditional form , sprinkled with powdered sugar and can only be made in dresden to be called a true dresdner stollen , kreuzkamm-aumüller added . she should know what she 's talking about - her great-great-grandfather first started making the cakes in 1825 and was a cake maker for the royal family .
world war ii , however , saw the bakery destroyed and the family continued their work in munich until the berlin wall fell and they could re-open in dresden , where the family now has a bakery and cafe . kreuzkamm-aumüller made the move to dresden in 1993 , intending to stay only for a few months .

in the united states , however , people are facing difficulties when it comes to their christmas treat of choice . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that fruitcake better have valid papers " after sept.11 , we have had the problem that our bags of sugar are confused with anthrax , " kreuzkamm-aumüller said .
" we 've had to answer a lot of questions about why we are sending little bags of white powder around the world . " now the packages all bear an english tip that the bags are just sugar , are not a threat to national security and do not need to be destroyed . stollen , like all other food imported to the us for the last three years , fall under a biological weapon law , which requires all packages to be registered on the internet . where do you think that stollen 's going ? " it does n't matter if you send one stollen or an entire container full , you have to fill out 13 pages on the internet and register the stollen - where it comes from , whom it is going to , what 's inside it , how it 's packed , " kreuzkamm-aumüller said , continuing to list other details . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slicing into a stollen has become a christmas tradition around the world the procedure has become so time-intensive that kreuzkamm-aumüller said she 's calculated the best times to start the 10-minute process .

stoiber denies he knew of the snooping . stoiber has condemned the aide 's efforts to snoop on gabriele pauli , a district administrator in his own christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- party , but dismissed her allegations he knew in advance that chief of staff michael höhenberger was trying to gather incriminating information on pauli 's private life . stoiber said höhenberger is leaving his post with immediate effect after pauli , 49 , charged he had asked a mutual acquaintance whether she had alcohol problems or was dating anyone . while stoiber at first insisted that his chief of staff had not spied on pauli and tried to ignore her demands that he step down .
but then on saturday , in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper , he went on the attack , describing the snooping as the unsanctioned act of a lone staff member and calling allegations he knew of the incident " nonsense . " " it was the singular act of a staff member , " stoiber said .

" it also mandated that " all states shall freeze the funds , other financial assets and economic resources " owned by people or entities linked to " iran 's proliferation sensitive nuclear activities or the development of nuclear weapon delivery systems . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un security council russia 's un ambassador vitaly churkin , who worked hard to soften the resolution , expressed hope that iran would " correctly and very seriously take measures to correct the situation . " he made it clear that the sanctions would be lifted if iran complies with demands of the council and the international atomic energy agency . us acting ambassador alejandro wolff said the council expected iran 's full , unconditional and immediate compliance " with the resolution , warning that " we will not hesitate to return to this body for further action " if iran does not comply . " without further delay " the text , drawn up by britain , france and germany , requires the islamic republic to " without further delay suspend all enrichment-related and reprocessing activities , including research and development " as well as " all heavy water-related projects .

" the bullying powers today , in confronting iran 's peaceful nuclear technology , are faced with a sea of courageous people , " ahmadinejad said in a speech . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de steinmeier calls for iran to prove it wants to end crisis iran must send " trustworthy signals " that it seriously wants to bring to an end the current crisis surrounding its nuclear programme , the german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said friday .

" i 'm not criticizing what jens lehmann did , but with me germany would have been world champions , " kahn , 37 , told the weekly newsmagazine stern . " i 'm convinced of it because the way my career has evolved points in that direction , " said kahn , who retired from the national side after sealing the bronze medal with a 3-1 win over portugal .

" i told him ' i do n't understand why you wo n't admit that i 'm right ' , " he added . germany previously won the world cup in 1954 , 1974 and 1990 . dw staff / afp -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de women wrestlers caught stealing duty-free perfume the fragrances on display at a frankfurt airport duty-free shop proved simply irresistible for two members of the ukrainian women 's national wrestling team .

stoiber denies he knew of the snooping . stoiber has condemned the aide 's efforts to snoop on gabriele pauli , a district administrator in his own christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- party , but dismissed her allegations he knew in advance that chief of staff michael höhenberger was trying to gather incriminating information on pauli 's private life . stoiber said höhenberger is leaving his post with immediate effect after pauli , 49 , charged he had asked a mutual acquaintance whether she had alcohol problems or was dating anyone . while stoiber at first insisted that his chief of staff had not spied on pauli and tried to ignore her demands that he step down .
but then on saturday , in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper , he went on the attack , describing the snooping as the unsanctioned act of a lone staff member and calling allegations he knew of the incident " nonsense . " " it was the singular act of a staff member , " stoiber said .
" i never would have permitted anything like that .
he took the appropriate consequence -lrb- and resigned -rrb- .

" i 'm not criticizing what jens lehmann did , but with me germany would have been world champions , " kahn , 37 , told the weekly newsmagazine stern . " i 'm convinced of it because the way my career has evolved points in that direction , " said kahn , who retired from the national side after sealing the bronze medal with a 3-1 win over portugal . " in 1994 with karlsruhe i reached the semi-finals of the uefa cup - two years later i won this trophy with bayern munich , " he explained . " in 1999 , i lost the champions league final in the harshest circumstances -lrb- losing 2-1 to manchester united in stoppage time -rrb- before winning this competition two years later .

" i 'm convinced of it because the way my career has evolved points in that direction , " said kahn , who retired from the national side after sealing the bronze medal with a 3-1 win over portugal .

" it also mandated that " all states shall freeze the funds , other financial assets and economic resources " owned by people or entities linked to " iran 's proliferation sensitive nuclear activities or the development of nuclear weapon delivery systems . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un security council russia 's un ambassador vitaly churkin , who worked hard to soften the resolution , expressed hope that iran would " correctly and very seriously take measures to correct the situation . " he made it clear that the sanctions would be lifted if iran complies with demands of the council and the international atomic energy agency . us acting ambassador alejandro wolff said the council expected iran 's full , unconditional and immediate compliance " with the resolution , warning that " we will not hesitate to return to this body for further action " if iran does not comply . " without further delay " the text , drawn up by britain , france and germany , requires the islamic republic to " without further delay suspend all enrichment-related and reprocessing activities , including research and development " as well as " all heavy water-related projects .

" the bullying powers today , in confronting iran 's peaceful nuclear technology , are faced with a sea of courageous people , " ahmadinejad said in a speech . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de steinmeier calls for iran to prove it wants to end crisis iran must send " trustworthy signals " that it seriously wants to bring to an end the current crisis surrounding its nuclear programme , the german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said friday .

but anti-terrorism laws in the us make it harder for americans to get their fruitcake fix . in its 550-year existence , the dresdner stollen has become a regular part of german christmases as well as those of other people around the world .
but none of its bakers is willing to cough up the cake 's recipe . " it has to be partially handmade and have a certain percentage of butter and particular amounts of raisins , lemon and orange peel , " said elisabeth kreuzkamm-aumüller , a dresden bakery owner .
" it is also very important that it does not have any margarine or artificial flavors .

human rights groups want the seven - including two former military rulers - to face trial in spain .
guatemala has rejected extradition requests made this year .
spain 's highest court has ruled that cases of genocide committed abroad could be judged in spain , even if no spanish citizens have been involved .
the seven men sought by madrid include former military rulers efrain rios montt and oscar humberto mejia victores .
they are wanted in connection with a series of kidnappings , mass murders and torture of mayan indians committed during guatemalan 's 36-year-long civil war , which ended 10 years ago .
they have faced charges in spain since 1999 , when the guatemalan indigenous leader and nobel peace prize winner rigoberta menchu presented a complaint against them .
bbc regional analyst emilio san pedro says she filed the complaint in spain because prosecutions of crimes committed during the civil war are practically impossible in guatemala .
more than 200,000 people , the majority of them indigenous peasants , are estimated to have died during the conflict .
similar requests made by spain earlier this year have so far failed to produce any results - although two of the seven men are in custody in guatemala .

now aged 61 , stewart has been busy in 2006 .
appearances on tv talent shows in the uk and us accompanied the release of a covers album , while in his personal life , he was adapting to life with baby son alastair and finalising his divorce with rachel hunter .
looking relaxed in a hotel suite in central london - slouching with his right leg dangling over the arm of his chair - stewart is happy to reminisce about the successful start to his career he enjoyed with the faces .
" we did n't think it was very good when we were doing it .
that was why the faces were such a drinking band , because we did n't really believe in ourselves .
" the music of the faces has influenced a lot of bands , a lot of people . "
it was certainly a high point because we were always high " rod stewart on the faces " it was a good combination of fellowship between the five guys in the band and a unique songwriting team - myself , ronnie lane and ronnie wood .
" i think we wrote some tremendous songs - narrative songs which always had a beginning and an end , with good acoustic melodies and harmonies . "
the faces were " a good band " and yet their music sounded " thrown together " , he concedes , adding that this was because they were " always drunk " .
" it was certainly a high point because we were always high , " he says .
" but it was when i first started to seriously write songs , so i learned a great deal , as i did with long john baldry and the jeff beck group .
you learn with all these bands , hopefully - and you should learn . "

appearances on tv talent shows in the uk and us accompanied the release of a covers album , while in his personal life , he was adapting to life with baby son alastair and finalising his divorce with rachel hunter .
looking relaxed in a hotel suite in central london - slouching with his right leg dangling over the arm of his chair - stewart is happy to reminisce about the successful start to his career he enjoyed with the faces .
" we did n't think it was very good when we were doing it .
that was why the faces were such a drinking band , because we did n't really believe in ourselves .
" the music of the faces has influenced a lot of bands , a lot of people .
it was certainly a high point because we were always high rod stewart on the faces " it was a good combination of fellowship between the five guys in the band and a unique songwriting team - myself , ronnie lane and ronnie wood .
" i think we wrote some tremendous songs - narrative songs which always had a beginning and an end , with good acoustic melodies and harmonies . "
the faces were " a good band " and yet their music sounded " thrown together " , he concedes , adding that this was because they were " always drunk " .
" it was certainly a high point because we were always high , " he says .
" but it was when i first started to seriously write songs , so i learned a great deal , as i did with long john baldry and the jeff beck group .
you learn with all these bands , hopefully - and you should learn . "
songwriting in october , the singer released still the same : great rock classics of our time , a covers album which followed the reinterpretations heard on the four volumes of his great american songbook .
he says he is unlikely to rework other artists ' music forever , but is refreshingly honest about why he generates little of his own material .
" i do n't enjoy songwriting .
i 'm not a natural songwriter .
i have six kids at home - not all at the same time , thank goodness , as that would drive me up the wall rod stewart , pictured with fiancee penny lancaster " when i get a spare 10 minutes , i do n't go , ' oh , let me go upstairs in the bedroom and write a song . '
and i 've always been that way .
he has not been composing " at all " in recent times , he says .
" i was writing songs up until the early 90s and not getting a great deal of response , to be honest with you , from record sales or radio .
maybe the craft has left me , i do n't know . "
but in terms of hearing new music , stewart manages to stay in touch , thanks to his children .
" i loved the killers ' song when we were young .
" i have enough music coming out of my kids ' bedrooms when i 'm at home .
i have six kids at home - not all at the same time , thank goodness , as that would drive me up the wall , " he jokes .
" i have n't a clue how to download but my 19-year-old daughter does it for me .
" she 's the one that turns me on to new stuff , and says , ' dad , listen to this . '
so i say to her to download it , ask how much it 's going to cost , and she does it for me . "
' wonderful ' shows stewart appeared as a mentor on tv reality shows the x factor and american idol in 2006 , but admits that this was mostly a promotional vehicle for him : " i had a new album coming out and i wanted to promote it . "
stewart enjoyed his first solo number one , maggie may , in 1971 but still he was " very , very nervous " about appearing on the x factor , he admits .
" i never used to watch american idol or the x factor until i was on them .
" now i 've got to watch them to see who 's going to win .
it just gets you wrapped up in there and carries you away .
it 's just wonderful .
" i sometimes think the judges are more entertaining than the talent - simon -lsb- cowell -rsb- especially .
he speaks volumes for what people really think . "
stewart rounds off by discussing whether , after almost four decades in the public eye , he will reinvent his musical style in the near future .
it appears not .
" i became famous , i think , really because of the interpretation of other people 's songs , way back when , and that 's what i enjoy the most .
and i 'm a lazy bugger . "

he was one of four labour members who supported the snp 's motion opposing the replacement of the nuclear submarines with up-to-date models .
mr chisholm said his decision had been a " matter of principle " .
the scottish parliament failed to agree a position on the future of the clyde-based fleet .
mr chisholm , whose successor will be announced in the new year , has already spoken out against the uk government 's plans to replace the nuclear submarines , based at faslane .
the one-time health minister has also been critical of the iraq war and the removal of failed asylum seekers using dawn raids . "

in his resignation letter , he told first minister jack mcconnell : " in those circumstances , notwithstanding the fact that it is a reserved issue , i realise that it is not tenable for me to continue as one of your ministers . "
mr mcconnell said mr chisholm had made a substantial contribution to government , but added : " i understand malcolm 's position and have accepted his resignation . "
a second resignation mr chisholm told bbc scotland that signalling his opposition to trident was important " it was not easy for me , in fact it proved impossible for me to have said one thing a couple of weeks ago and vote the opposite of it today , " he said .

" this whole issue demonstrates just how out of touch he is with the scottish public and even members of his own party , " she said .
the snp 's motion was defeated by 72 to 45 , while three amendments - lodged by labour , the liberal democrats and the conservatives - were also defeated .

in his resignation letter , he told first minister jack mcconnell : " in those circumstances , notwithstanding the fact that it is a reserved issue , i realise that it is not tenable for me to continue as one of your ministers . "
mr mcconnell said mr chisholm had made a substantial contribution to government , but added : " i understand malcolm 's position and have accepted his resignation . "

some 46 morning flights are cancelled , but ba plans to operate all afternoon domestic flights to and from heathrow .
the airline said it hoped to operate 95 % of its heathrow services , including 87 % of short-haul flights , on saturday , with a full service on sunday .
more than 1,000 flights were cancelled in recent days because of the fog .
forecasters at the bbc 's weather centre said they were " reasonably confident " visibility would improve around heathrow on saturday , as the fog moved north .
although heathrow was the worst affected , other airports including norwich , bristol , cardiff and southampton have also been disrupted by fog in the past few days , with yet others suffering knock-on effects from heathrow .
transport switch heathrow managing director mark bullock said he was hopeful the situation at the airport would return to " some semblance of normality " on saturday .
nobody wants to see passengers delayed on their journey , especially at this time of year mark bullock heathrow managing director " the picture is a lot better than it has been .
on thursday we had 370 cancelled flights , yesterday that improved to 284 , and so far today we have confirmation of 74 cancelled flights , so that 's significantly better than it 's been , " he said .
" we 're very hopeful that we can clear the backlog in time for christmas .
british airways , for example , have been putting on larger aircraft to some of their short-haul destinations , and as of yesterday they 've taken over 4,000 people by coach to their destinations and that coaching operation continues today .
" also the railways are laying on additional train services . "
bbc news correspondent ben ando , at heathrow , said people arriving at the airport on saturday were confident they would be able to catch their flights , particularly if they were booked on medium or long-haul trips .
he said visibility at heathrow was far better on saturday morning than it was at the same time the previous day - up to 4,000 metres when it had been down to 600 metres .

travel advice at-a-glance bbc travel bbc weather bmi has made no cancellations at heathrow and is looking to operate as full a service as possible .
ba flights from heathrow to paris and brussels resume on sunday .
in all , 411 flights were cancelled on friday , including more than 300 flights at heathrow , with all british airways domestic services scrapped and about 40,000 people affected .
the flight cancellations came about after air traffic control placed restrictions on flights landing and taking off at heathrow , because of the low visibility .
ba says passengers whose flights have been cancelled are entitled to a full refund .
mr bullock defended the handling of the situation at heathrow where temporary waiting areas in marquees were set up for passengers .
he said : " nobody wants to see passengers delayed on their journey , especially at this time of year , and our hearts can only go out to those people who have been affected .
" but what we did do on wednesday when the weather closed in on us was put into place our contingency plans .
" we have heated marquees , we 've been providing passengers with catering facilities , we 've had video games , televisions and even children 's entertainers . "
at gatwick airport , where many tourist and ski holiday travellers are expected , there are no reported cancellations and most flights are leaving on time , although there may be some delays .
engineering works ken gibbs from virgin trains said there were no problems with its services , although journeys may take longer than normal .
" we 're not running any extra services .
we have some engineering works - network rail are doing some works - so we have some diversions in place , so passengers should expect some extended journey time , i 'm afraid , " he said .
brian bannister from coach operator national express said the weather had actually helped its services to run on time .
" it 's probably been a help to us , strangely .
i think it 's created nice slow and steady traffic streams across the motorways , " he said .
the highways agency has suspended more than half of its 83 roadworks , and many rail engineering works are also being delayed until christmas .

" we 're very hopeful that we can clear the backlog in time for christmas .
british airways , for example , have been putting on larger aircraft to some of their short-haul destinations , and as of yesterday they 've taken over 4,000 people by coach to their destinations and that coaching operation continues today .
" also the railways are laying on additional train services . "
bbc news correspondent ben ando , at heathrow , said people arriving at the airport on saturday were confident they would be able to catch their flights , particularly if they were booked on medium or long-haul trips .
he said visibility at heathrow was far better on saturday morning than it was at the same time the previous day - up to 4,000 metres when it had been down to 600 metres .
travel advice british airways customers should contact 0800 727 800 or check the www.britishairways.com website to see if their flight is still operating there is regular travel information on bbc news 24 , bbc radio five live and the bbc 's local radio and regional tv news .
this website will have updated advice and there are links to the bbc 's travel and weather web sites below .
travel advice at-a-glance bbc travel bbc weather bmi has made no cancellations at heathrow and is looking to operate as full a service as possible .
ba flights from heathrow to paris and brussels resume on sunday .
in all , 411 flights were cancelled on friday , including more than 300 flights at heathrow , with all british airways domestic services scrapped and about 40,000 people affected .
the flight cancellations came about after air traffic control placed restrictions on flights landing and taking off at heathrow , because of the low visibility .
ba says passengers whose flights have been cancelled are entitled to a full refund .
mr bullock defended the handling of the situation at heathrow where temporary waiting areas in marquees were set up for passengers .
he said : " nobody wants to see passengers delayed on their journey , especially at this time of year , and our hearts can only go out to those people who have been affected .
" but what we did do on wednesday when the weather closed in on us was put into place our contingency plans .
" we have heated marquees , we 've been providing passengers with catering facilities , we 've had video games , televisions and even children 's entertainers . "
at gatwick airport , where many tourist and ski holiday travellers are expected , there are no reported cancellations and most flights are leaving on time , although there may be some delays .
engineering works ken gibbs from virgin trains said there were no problems with its services , although journeys may take longer than normal .
" we 're not running any extra services .
we have some engineering works - network rail are doing some works - so we have some diversions in place , so passengers should expect some extended journey time , i 'm afraid , " he said .
brian bannister from coach operator national express said the weather had actually helped its services to run on time .
" it 's probably been a help to us , strangely .
i think it 's created nice slow and steady traffic streams across the motorways , " he said .
the highways agency has suspended more than half of its 83 roadworks , and many rail engineering works are also being delayed until christmas .

dr rowan williams , head of the anglican church , said there had been a growing number of attacks on christians .
he is on a pilgrimage to the region with the leader of the roman catholic church in england and wales , cardinal cormac murphy-o 'connor .
the government said its policy in iraq was not the cause of such attacks .
" it is the intolerant extremists that are inflicting the pain and suffering in iraq and other parts in the middle east , " a foreign office spokesman said .
" we are doing all we can to support the iraqi people . "
the situation has got worse since saddam fell dr rowan williams , archbishop of canterbury dr williams told bbc radio 4 's today programme there was " no doubt " that life for christians in iraq had become more difficult since the invasion .
" what we have seen in the last year or so in iraq has been attacks on christian priests , the murder of some christian priests , and the massive departure of large numbers of christians from iraq , " he said .
" the situation has got worse since saddam fell . "
his comments come after he told the times newspaper ministers had ignored warnings christians in the region " would be seen as supporters of the crusading west " .
among the results was the shrinking christian population in iraq , he said .
he wrote from bethlehem that despite frequent warnings before the iraq war , the government had adopted no strategy to protect christian minorities in the region .
' pray for town ' dr williams called for readers of his article to " pray for the little town of bethlehem " .
he told the today programme that despite a " traditional co-existence " in bethlehem there were now " signs there of anti-christian feeling by local muslims " .
his comments echoed similar remarks in the times where he said the migration of christian populations from countries where they had formerly existed amicably with the muslim majority " fuels the myth in east and west - that islam ca n't live with other faiths " .
dr williams wrote that the christians were not being persecuted by muslim governments .
meanwhile , cardinal murphy-o 'connor said they were both in bethlehem as an " act of solidarity " .
" we are here to express our desire for peace in this land of conflict , " he said .
" our presence here is not just symbolic . "
both archbishops said they wanted to highlight how israel 's security measures were strangling the town .
they travelled with bishop nathan hovhannisian , of the armenian church of great britain , and the rev david coffey , of the free churches on the four-day visit to the holy land .

dr rowan williams , head of the anglican church , said there had been a growing number of attacks on christians .
he is on a pilgrimage to the region with the leader of the roman catholic church in england and wales , cardinal cormac murphy-o 'connor .
the government said its policy in iraq was not the cause of such attacks .
" it is the intolerant extremists that are inflicting the pain and suffering in iraq and other parts in the middle east , " a foreign office spokesman said .
" we are doing all we can to support the iraqi people . "
the situation has got worse since saddam fell dr rowan williams , archbishop of canterbury dr williams told bbc radio 4 's today programme there was " no doubt " that life for christians in iraq had become more difficult since the invasion .

" the situation has got worse since saddam fell . "
his comments come after he told the times newspaper ministers had ignored warnings christians in the region " would be seen as supporters of the crusading west " .

army padres there will be trying to give the troops some spiritual cheer over the festive period .
there is not much to be said for war .
but one thing it does is to allow the military chaplains to hold their christmas services at the right time , with the men and women of the armed forces all around them .
at home the services would be held days or even weeks before the event , in garrison churches , before the regiments dispersed for christmas .
by contrast the 12 chaplains - 11 from the army and one from the air force - serving more than 7,000 troops in southern iraq will be in the thick of things .
they will hold midnight masses and carol services in every unit for those who wish to attend provided they are off duty .
for the rest , christmas is like any other day .
patron of lost causes those attacking them do not take the day off and the defenders will , if anything , be extra vigilant . "
we might want to give them encouragement and help rather than pull them down " reverend andrew martlew british chaplain rocket and mortar attacks on british bases occur every day - three rockets fell on the shaiba logistics base while we were with a padre visiting a sentry on a watchtower .
an artillery battery which went home on the last rotation lost four men killed out of 110 : in modern soldiering , those are not light casualties .
some of the young men , aged 18 or 19 , are on their first operational duty , and even in their first foreign country .
others have had one , two or even three previous tours of duty in iraq .
all of them are facing six months of concentrated reality amid conditions of hardship , danger and boredom , which most of us who live in peace and comfort can hardly imagine .
their homes are tents and their churches are portakabins .
in such conditions one of the few advantages of being an army padre rather than a village vicar is that you can rename your church if you want to .
the reverend andrew martlew , chaplain to 40 field regiment of the royal artillery , holds services in a metal hut behind blast walls 10ft high which , when he arrived , was the church of st paul in the desert .
it is now the church of st jude .
st jude is known , among his other functions , as the patron saint of lost causes .
fag-break visits the chaplains are frank about it : their task is harder because the soldiers feel more isolated , and have more questions to ask , because they are serving in a cause that is either unpopular or misunderstood at home .
the padres also wonder , " what are we doing here and why ? "
the reverend andrew martlew adds : " this is quite a difficult thing to say and an even more difficult thing to think , but almost by taking the queen 's shilling we 're putting elements of our consciences into cold storage .
" in order to help the guys we might be not necessarily economical with the truth , but we might want to give them encouragement and help rather than pull them down . "
another sign of christmas is the seasonal migration of chiefs of staff and politicians .
like birds of passage , they fly into basra and then out again .
as a disaffected soldier put it , they stay for the length of a fag break .
tony blair , on his fourth and last pre-christmas visit , actually spent three hours with the troops .
the theatre of war - an aircraft hanger at basra air station - was decorated with two challenger tanks outside and two warrior armoured personnel carriers , a lynx helicopter and 300 serving men and women of all three armed forces inside .
these things are not left to chance .
the prime minister 's travelling party of 13 , excluding bodyguards , included seven whose job was in one way or another to deal with the press .
twenty reporters were also on the plane .
that is a ratio of more than one to three of sheepdogs to sheep .
on what is still a controversial conflict , presentation matters .
getting on with it the prime minister insisted there was no change of policy : " british troops will stay until the job is done . "

army padres there will be trying to give the troops some spiritual cheer over the festive period .
there is not much to be said for war .
but one thing it does is to allow the military chaplains to hold their christmas services at the right time , with the men and women of the armed forces all around them .
at home the services would be held days or even weeks before the event , in garrison churches , before the regiments dispersed for christmas .
by contrast the 12 chaplains - 11 from the army and one from the air force - serving more than 7,000 troops in southern iraq will be in the thick of things .
they will hold midnight masses and carol services in every unit for those who wish to attend provided they are off duty .
for the rest , christmas is like any other day .
patron of lost causes those attacking them do not take the day off and the defenders will , if anything , be extra vigilant .
we might want to give them encouragement and help rather than pull them down reverend andrew martlew british chaplain rocket and mortar attacks on british bases occur every day - three rockets fell on the shaiba logistics base while we were with a padre visiting a sentry on a watchtower .
an artillery battery which went home on the last rotation lost four men killed out of 110 : in modern soldiering , those are not light casualties .
some of the young men , aged 18 or 19 , are on their first operational duty , and even in their first foreign country .
others have had one , two or even three previous tours of duty in iraq .
all of them are facing six months of concentrated reality amid conditions of hardship , danger and boredom , which most of us who live in peace and comfort can hardly imagine .
their homes are tents and their churches are portakabins .
in such conditions one of the few advantages of being an army padre rather than a village vicar is that you can rename your church if you want to .
the reverend andrew martlew , chaplain to 40 field regiment of the royal artillery , holds services in a metal hut behind blast walls 10ft high which , when he arrived , was the church of st paul in the desert .
it is now the church of st jude .
st jude is known , among his other functions , as the patron saint of lost causes .
fag-break visits the chaplains are frank about it : their task is harder because the soldiers feel more isolated , and have more questions to ask , because they are serving in a cause that is either unpopular or misunderstood at home .
tony blair spent three hours meeting troops before christmas the padres also wonder , " what are we doing here and why ? "
the reverend andrew martlew adds : " this is quite a difficult thing to say and an even more difficult thing to think , but almost by taking the queen 's shilling we 're putting elements of our consciences into cold storage .
" in order to help the guys we might be not necessarily economical with the truth , but we might want to give them encouragement and help rather than pull them down . "
another sign of christmas is the seasonal migration of chiefs of staff and politicians .
like birds of passage , they fly into basra and then out again .
as a disaffected soldier put it , they stay for the length of a fag break .
tony blair , on his fourth and last pre-christmas visit , actually spent three hours with the troops .
the theatre of war - an aircraft hanger at basra air station - was decorated with two challenger tanks outside and two warrior armoured personnel carriers , a lynx helicopter and 300 serving men and women of all three armed forces inside .
these things are not left to chance .
the prime minister 's travelling party of 13 , excluding bodyguards , included seven whose job was in one way or another to deal with the press .
twenty reporters were also on the plane .
that is a ratio of more than one to three of sheepdogs to sheep .
on what is still a controversial conflict , presentation matters .
getting on with it the prime minister insisted there was no change of policy : " british troops will stay until the job is done . "
yet the soldiers themselves know that the shaibah logistical base will be handed back to the iraqis in the spring or early summer .
the three british bases in basra will close .
