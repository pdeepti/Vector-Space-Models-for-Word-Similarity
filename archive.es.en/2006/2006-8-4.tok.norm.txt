after a successful six-hour operation , the astronauts returned to the station ahead of schedule . thomas reiter on thursday became the first european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- astronaut to conduct a space walk from the international space station .
he and his american colleague jeff williams spent six hours making repairs on the space station . " it 's an indescribable feeling to be working between earth and the heavens , " said reiter , who spent 179 days in the now defunct mir space station a decade ago and has performed two other space walks . there were some initial concerns thursday at nasa when the door to the space station jammed .
but after some pushing and pulling , the hatch released and reiter and williams floated out , as if in slow motion . reiter was wearing a white space suite with a german flag .
williams ' suit had red stripes so that the two could be easily identified by observers inside the space station . a hard day 's work bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reiter was hooked with karabiners to the space station " it 's really exhausting because they have to fight against the resistance in their suits and move heavy objects back and forth , " said volker damann , an esa doctor .
" that 's why we see their heart rates peak , like with cyclists or people doing sports . " " you have to imagine that there 's a vacuum outside , " said reiter , who had spent countless hours underwater to simulate the experience .
" you 're in a pressurized suit and every tiny movement you make with each finger … is very physically demanding . " like mountain climbers , reiter and williams used karabiners , metal rings with clips , to hook themselves to the space station as they moved along its outer shell .
not only were the astronauts themselves secured , but each one of their tools as well . " we do n't want to lose them , for one thing , but the next crew to go out does n't want to run into the tools again , " damann said .
" it 's very important for us not to lose anything . " a n ew day every 90 mi n utes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 48-year-old astronaut used to be a pilot in the german air force the international space station races around the earth at 28,000 kilometers per hour -lrb- 17,400 miles per hour -rrb- and circles it once every 90 minutes .
damann said the human body can only recognize acceleration and deceleration , not speed itself .
the astronauts do n't notice the space station 's quick pace , just the shortened days and nights . " it 's gravity that affects the astronauts , " said reinhold ewald , an esa astronaut who observed the space walk operation from the german control center in oberpfaffenhofen .
the astronaut 's orbit compensates for gravity , he explained , and " the end result is that you float weightlessly but are pulled here and there by these forces .
you just do n't notice it . " after repairing two gps antennas , installing a gauge to measure the space station 's electric field , screwing on replacement parts and installing various devices , reiter and williams returned ahead of schedule . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german astronaut to join nasa 's discovery shuttle mission thomas reiter , a former german air force pilot and veteran astronaut , joins six americans on the discovery shuttle mission to the international space station .

but when one under-sexed aachen housewife had enough of not getting the good lovin ' from her husband - she called the cops . police officers are often called upon to read people their civil rights but it 's unusual for them to be asked to explain the conjugal versions .
yet that 's exactly what was required of officers attending to a domestic complaint in the german city of aachen this week . a desperate woman at her wits end with her disinterested husband called the local cops to demand that they enforce the laws of love after a tiff on wednesday night . after several barren months without the merest hint of getting any , the 44-year-old woman turned to law enforcement in a bid to get her lazy lover off the couch and into her bed for some healthy husband-wife horizontal action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : got the horn : not everyone has as much fun in the bedroom the call to the police came after the woman could bear it no longer and woke her non-performing 45-year old spouse in the middle of the night to demand that he fulfilled his sexual obligations .
when her advances were refused , a row broke out and she called the police and asked them to intervene . make my husba n d have sex with me ! the perplexed cops turned up to hear the wife demanding that they make her hubbie have sex with her . " the police officials did not feel able to resolve the dispute , let alone issue any kind of official order , " police spokesperson paul kemen said on thursday .
" and because no crime or infringement could be identified , all they could do was file a report in case intervention might be required at a later date , " he added . chances are that if the wife has n't got hers by then , they may be attending a far more serious incident . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans ca n't get no ...

but when one under-sexed aachen housewife had enough of not getting the good lovin ' from her husband - she called the cops . police officers are often called upon to read people their civil rights but it 's unusual for them to be asked to explain the conjugal versions .
yet that 's exactly what was required of officers attending to a domestic complaint in the german city of aachen this week . a desperate woman at her wits end with her disinterested husband called the local cops to demand that they enforce the laws of love after a tiff on wednesday night . after several barren months without the merest hint of getting any , the 44-year-old woman turned to law enforcement in a bid to get her lazy lover off the couch and into her bed for some healthy husband-wife horizontal action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : got the horn : not everyone has as much fun in the bedroom the call to the police came after the woman could bear it no longer and woke her non-performing 45-year old spouse in the middle of the night to demand that he fulfilled his sexual obligations .
when her advances were refused , a row broke out and she called the police and asked them to intervene . make my husba n d have sex with me ! the perplexed cops turned up to hear the wife demanding that they make her hubbie have sex with her . " the police officials did not feel able to resolve the dispute , let alone issue any kind of official order , " police spokesperson paul kemen said on thursday .
" and because no crime or infringement could be identified , all they could do was file a report in case intervention might be required at a later date , " he added . chances are that if the wife has n't got hers by then , they may be attending a far more serious incident . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans ca n't get no ...

after a successful six-hour operation , the astronauts returned to the station ahead of schedule . thomas reiter on thursday became the first european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- astronaut to conduct a space walk from the international space station .
he and his american colleague jeff williams spent six hours making repairs on the space station . " it 's an indescribable feeling to be working between earth and the heavens , " said reiter , who spent 179 days in the now defunct mir space station a decade ago and has performed two other space walks . there were some initial concerns thursday at nasa when the door to the space station jammed .
but after some pushing and pulling , the hatch released and reiter and williams floated out , as if in slow motion . reiter was wearing a white space suite with a german flag .
williams ' suit had red stripes so that the two could be easily identified by observers inside the space station . a hard day 's work bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reiter was hooked with karabiners to the space station " it 's really exhausting because they have to fight against the resistance in their suits and move heavy objects back and forth , " said volker damann , an esa doctor .
" that 's why we see their heart rates peak , like with cyclists or people doing sports . " " you have to imagine that there 's a vacuum outside , " said reiter , who had spent countless hours underwater to simulate the experience .
" you 're in a pressurized suit and every tiny movement you make with each finger … is very physically demanding . " like mountain climbers , reiter and williams used karabiners , metal rings with clips , to hook themselves to the space station as they moved along its outer shell .
not only were the astronauts themselves secured , but each one of their tools as well . " we do n't want to lose them , for one thing , but the next crew to go out does n't want to run into the tools again , " damann said .
" it 's very important for us not to lose anything .

damann said the human body can only recognize acceleration and deceleration , not speed itself .
the astronauts do n't notice the space station 's quick pace , just the shortened days and nights . " it 's gravity that affects the astronauts , " said reinhold ewald , an esa astronaut who observed the space walk operation from the german control center in oberpfaffenhofen .
the astronaut 's orbit compensates for gravity , he explained , and " the end result is that you float weightlessly but are pulled here and there by these forces .
you just do n't notice it . " after repairing two gps antennas , installing a gauge to measure the space station 's electric field , screwing on replacement parts and installing various devices , reiter and williams returned ahead of schedule . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german astronaut to join nasa 's discovery shuttle mission thomas reiter , a former german air force pilot and veteran astronaut , joins six americans on the discovery shuttle mission to the international space station .

after a successful six-hour operation , the astronauts returned to the station ahead of schedule . thomas reiter on thursday became the first european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- astronaut to conduct a space walk from the international space station .
he and his american colleague jeff williams spent six hours making repairs on the space station . " it 's an indescribable feeling to be working between earth and the heavens , " said reiter , who spent 179 days in the now defunct mir space station a decade ago and has performed two other space walks . there were some initial concerns thursday at nasa when the door to the space station jammed .
but after some pushing and pulling , the hatch released and reiter and williams floated out , as if in slow motion . reiter was wearing a white space suite with a german flag .
williams ' suit had red stripes so that the two could be easily identified by observers inside the space station . a hard day 's work bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reiter was hooked with karabiners to the space station " it 's really exhausting because they have to fight against the resistance in their suits and move heavy objects back and forth , " said volker damann , an esa doctor .
" that 's why we see their heart rates peak , like with cyclists or people doing sports . " " you have to imagine that there 's a vacuum outside , " said reiter , who had spent countless hours underwater to simulate the experience .
" you 're in a pressurized suit and every tiny movement you make with each finger … is very physically demanding . " like mountain climbers , reiter and williams used karabiners , metal rings with clips , to hook themselves to the space station as they moved along its outer shell .
not only were the astronauts themselves secured , but each one of their tools as well . " we do n't want to lose them , for one thing , but the next crew to go out does n't want to run into the tools again , " damann said .
" it 's very important for us not to lose anything . " a n ew day every 90 mi n utes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 48-year-old astronaut used to be a pilot in the german air force the international space station races around the earth at 28,000 kilometers per hour -lrb- 17,400 miles per hour -rrb- and circles it once every 90 minutes .
damann said the human body can only recognize acceleration and deceleration , not speed itself .
the astronauts do n't notice the space station 's quick pace , just the shortened days and nights . " it 's gravity that affects the astronauts , " said reinhold ewald , an esa astronaut who observed the space walk operation from the german control center in oberpfaffenhofen .
the astronaut 's orbit compensates for gravity , he explained , and " the end result is that you float weightlessly but are pulled here and there by these forces .
you just do n't notice it . " after repairing two gps antennas , installing a gauge to measure the space station 's electric field , screwing on replacement parts and installing various devices , reiter and williams returned ahead of schedule . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german astronaut to join nasa 's discovery shuttle mission thomas reiter , a former german air force pilot and veteran astronaut , joins six americans on the discovery shuttle mission to the international space station .

plant operators in germany said the country 's 17 nuclear reactors remain safe . a subsidiary of germany 's largest energy company , eon , shut down two of three reactors it runs in the swedish city of oskarshamn thursday after backup generators failed to start properly at a similar plant last week . a reactor in forsmark was taken off the swedish power grid when two of the four diesel generators intended to provide the plant with emergency power needed to be manually started , reawakening the debate over the safety of nuclear power . " it was as close as you can get to a nuclear meltdown , " former construction manager at the forsmark plant , lars-olov höglund told the swedish daily newspaper sve n ska dagbladet .
" it was sheer luck that this did n't lead to a catastrophe worse than chernobyl . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sweden said there was no danger of a meltdown in forsmark vattenfall , the swedish power company that operates the forsmark plant about 46 miles -lrb- 75 kilometers -rrb- from stockholm , disputed the danger of a meltdown , saying the two diesel generators provided enough power to run the plant 's cooling system , according to a company spokesperson . the swedish environmental ministry agreed that the situation was not as dangerous as höglund said . " this could n't be compared with something as serious as a meltdown , " ministry spokesperson lena berglund said .
" it was never close to it . " swedish nuclear power inspectorate -lrb- ski -rrb- spokesman anders bredfell told the bbc news web site the forsmark incident ranked as a number two on the international atomic energy agency 's scale , which ranks nuclear incidents from zero to seven and rates incidents as four or more as being dangerous to humans and the environment .
the chernobyl nuclear disaster was rated a seven . preve n tive closures at other swedish pla n ts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two swedish plants were close as precautionary measures the oskarshamn reactors , about 150 miles south of stockholm , were shut down thursday after eon subsidiary okg said " safety there could not be guaranteed , " according to a company spokesperson .
swedish atomic energy officials announced they would be examining the safety of all their nuclear power plants . some of germany 's 17 nuclear power plants use a similar cooling system to that of the swedish plant and their safety should be checked , according to the environmental organization greenpeace . " we assume that there was retrofitting here in germany after the 2004 incident that were not performed in sweden , " greenpeace 's heinz smital said in a statement , referring to a short emergency power outage in germany 's isar 2 nuclear power plant two years ago .
" nevertheless , the german atomic regulatory agency quickly needs to clarify if a similar danger threatens local atomic power plants . " germa n y committed to phasi n g out n uclear power the german environment ministry said thursday the malfunctions in the swedish plants a " serious safety incident " and friday called on the german states ' atomic regulatory agencies to check the operation of their plants ' emergency power and cooling systems for the aeg components that are suspected to have led to the break down in sweden . german nuclear power critics used the incident in a country with western safety standards to point out the dangers of atomic power and to call for an end to germany 's dependency on atomic energy , which accounts for about 12 percent of german energy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts are checking to see if a similar accident could happen in germany " the incident has made it clear that atomic power technology is not actually controllable , " marco bülow , germany 's social democratic party environmental issues spokesperson told reporters on friday .
" we can not discuss extending the operating times for atomic power plants . " in the past , members of germany 's conservative christian parties have argued for prolonging the country 's reliance on nuclear power .
at the end of july , the grand coalition government , however , said in a statement that it remains committed to phasing out nuclear power . similar malfu n ctio n u n likely i n germa n y a repeat of the swedish incident is unlikely in germany , according to preliminary reports from the country 's 17 atomic power plants gathered by the german dpa news agency . " the initial analysis of our six atomic power plants has shown that an incident similar to forsmark can be ruled out , " an eon spokesperson said friday , adding that the company 's german reactors have a different emergency power supply than the swedish plant . operators of germany 's other nuclear reactors , including vattenfall , also reported that their reactors are running normally and that there are no plans to shut them down . like germany , sweden has committed to eliminating its reliance on nuclear power .

after a successful six-hour operation , the astronauts returned to the station ahead of schedule . thomas reiter on thursday became the first european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- astronaut to conduct a space walk from the international space station .
he and his american colleague jeff williams spent six hours making repairs on the space station . " it 's an indescribable feeling to be working between earth and the heavens , " said reiter , who spent 179 days in the now defunct mir space station a decade ago and has performed two other space walks . there were some initial concerns thursday at nasa when the door to the space station jammed .
but after some pushing and pulling , the hatch released and reiter and williams floated out , as if in slow motion . reiter was wearing a white space suite with a german flag .
williams ' suit had red stripes so that the two could be easily identified by observers inside the space station . a hard day 's work bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reiter was hooked with karabiners to the space station " it 's really exhausting because they have to fight against the resistance in their suits and move heavy objects back and forth , " said volker damann , an esa doctor .
" that 's why we see their heart rates peak , like with cyclists or people doing sports . " " you have to imagine that there 's a vacuum outside , " said reiter , who had spent countless hours underwater to simulate the experience .
" you 're in a pressurized suit and every tiny movement you make with each finger … is very physically demanding . " like mountain climbers , reiter and williams used karabiners , metal rings with clips , to hook themselves to the space station as they moved along its outer shell .
not only were the astronauts themselves secured , but each one of their tools as well . " we do n't want to lose them , for one thing , but the next crew to go out does n't want to run into the tools again , " damann said .
" it 's very important for us not to lose anything . " a n ew day every 90 mi n utes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 48-year-old astronaut used to be a pilot in the german air force the international space station races around the earth at 28,000 kilometers per hour -lrb- 17,400 miles per hour -rrb- and circles it once every 90 minutes .
damann said the human body can only recognize acceleration and deceleration , not speed itself .
the astronauts do n't notice the space station 's quick pace , just the shortened days and nights . " it 's gravity that affects the astronauts , " said reinhold ewald , an esa astronaut who observed the space walk operation from the german control center in oberpfaffenhofen .
the astronaut 's orbit compensates for gravity , he explained , and " the end result is that you float weightlessly but are pulled here and there by these forces .
you just do n't notice it . " after repairing two gps antennas , installing a gauge to measure the space station 's electric field , screwing on replacement parts and installing various devices , reiter and williams returned ahead of schedule . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german astronaut to join nasa 's discovery shuttle mission thomas reiter , a former german air force pilot and veteran astronaut , joins six americans on the discovery shuttle mission to the international space station .

plant operators in germany said the country 's 17 nuclear reactors remain safe . a subsidiary of germany 's largest energy company , eon , shut down two of three reactors it runs in the swedish city of oskarshamn thursday after backup generators failed to start properly at a similar plant last week . a reactor in forsmark was taken off the swedish power grid when two of the four diesel generators intended to provide the plant with emergency power needed to be manually started , reawakening the debate over the safety of nuclear power . " it was as close as you can get to a nuclear meltdown , " former construction manager at the forsmark plant , lars-olov höglund told the swedish daily newspaper sve n ska dagbladet .

" this could n't be compared with something as serious as a meltdown , " ministry spokesperson lena berglund said .
" it was never close to it . " swedish nuclear power inspectorate -lrb- ski -rrb- spokesman anders bredfell told the bbc news web site the forsmark incident ranked as a number two on the international atomic energy agency 's scale , which ranks nuclear incidents from zero to seven and rates incidents as four or more as being dangerous to humans and the environment .

swedish atomic energy officials announced they would be examining the safety of all their nuclear power plants . some of germany 's 17 nuclear power plants use a similar cooling system to that of the swedish plant and their safety should be checked , according to the environmental organization greenpeace . " we assume that there was retrofitting here in germany after the 2004 incident that were not performed in sweden , " greenpeace 's heinz smital said in a statement , referring to a short emergency power outage in germany 's isar 2 nuclear power plant two years ago .

" we can not discuss extending the operating times for atomic power plants . " in the past , members of germany 's conservative christian parties have argued for prolonging the country 's reliance on nuclear power .

" the initial analysis of our six atomic power plants has shown that an incident similar to forsmark can be ruled out , " an eon spokesperson said friday , adding that the company 's german reactors have a different emergency power supply than the swedish plant . operators of germany 's other nuclear reactors , including vattenfall , also reported that their reactors are running normally and that there are no plans to shut them down . like germany , sweden has committed to eliminating its reliance on nuclear power .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 04.08.2006 european press review : will there be a victor ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel bombed bridges into beirut on friday european newspapers weighed in this week on various aspects of the conflict in the middle east .
hope for a quick resolution seemed to be waning . " israel is stirring up hate in lebanon and the arab-muslim world by destroying the civil infrastructure , killing more children than armed men , unleashing a flood of refugees and announcing that all the lebanese in the south will be considered supporters of hezbollah and could therefore die , " wrote france 's le monde on thursday .
" after the shock of sept .
11 , the us fiasco in iraq and the intensification of the struggle against jihad fighters , the war in lebanon is stoking resentment against the jewish state , its american allies and the west in general .
the future will show who the military victor will be .
but the first three weeks of the conflict have indicated that there might not be one . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair has postponed his summer vacation to help secure a un security resolution tony blair " has made mistakes since the outbreak of the israel-lebanon conflict , though they have largely been errors of rhetoric , " according to britain 's the times .
demonstrating greater public concern for the civilian casualties at an earlier stage would have " better served his overall ends , " while his delayed expression of regret " appears , however misleadingly , to be secondary . "
a un security council resolution and the establishment of an international peace-keeping force " would do much to vindicate the prime minister and his position , " said the commentary . austria 's kurier wrote on thursday that " without a doubt , israel is being ruthless in defending its sovereignty .
israel does n't care about the international opinion and is going up against aggressors with every bit of harshness .
it has faired well so far , has survived and forced a formerly hostile neighbor into peace . "
lebanon is a country " whose population has suffered more than any other in the middle east in the past decades .
that is not israel 's fault . "
iran and its " henchmen " have brought about a " war against israel 's very existence , " said the paper , quoting german foreign minister joschka fischer . " people believed for a long time that the verbal radicalism of iranian president mahmud ahmadinejad was some kind of personal idiosyncrasy , " wrote germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on wednesday .
" it has now even been said that the man has - to put it politely - a somewhat bizarre , unpredictable character , such that his dreams of destruction concerning israel ca n't be taken quite as seriously as they sound . "
the paper quoted the iranian revolutionary leader ayatollah khomeini , who had committed his country years ago to supporting lebanon in its quest to eliminate israel .
" after the country had thawed a bit under president khatami , the islamic republic of iran has returned to its roots , at least ideologically , " said the paper . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de violence in the middle east click on the links to read dw-world.de 's compilation of articles on the conflict and the search for peace .
" germany should take part in lebanon peace-keeping mission " former israeli ambassador to germany avi primor backed the idea of german troops participating in a possible international peacekeeping mission in lebanon as long as they were not stationed on the border with israel .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.08.2006 swedish nuclear scare reignites german atomic questions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has committed to phasing out nuclear power germans questioned the safety of atomic power after three swedish nuclear reactors were shut down due to safety concerns .
plant operators in germany said the country 's 17 nuclear reactors remain safe . a subsidiary of germany 's largest energy company , eon , shut down two of three reactors it runs in the swedish city of oskarshamn thursday after backup generators failed to start properly at a similar plant last week . a reactor in forsmark was taken off the swedish power grid when two of the four diesel generators intended to provide the plant with emergency power needed to be manually started , reawakening the debate over the safety of nuclear power . " it was as close as you can get to a nuclear meltdown , " former construction manager at the forsmark plant , lars-olov höglund told the swedish daily newspaper sve n ska dagbladet .
" it was sheer luck that this did n't lead to a catastrophe worse than chernobyl . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sweden said there was no danger of a meltdown in forsmark vattenfall , the swedish power company that operates the forsmark plant about 46 miles -lrb- 75 kilometers -rrb- from stockholm , disputed the danger of a meltdown , saying the two diesel generators provided enough power to run the plant 's cooling system , according to a company spokesperson . the swedish environmental ministry agreed that the situation was not as dangerous as höglund said . " this could n't be compared with something as serious as a meltdown , " ministry spokesperson lena berglund said .
" it was never close to it . " swedish nuclear power inspectorate -lrb- ski -rrb- spokesman anders bredfell told the bbc news web site the forsmark incident ranked as a number two on the international atomic energy agency 's scale , which ranks nuclear incidents from zero to seven and rates incidents as four or more as being dangerous to humans and the environment .
the chernobyl nuclear disaster was rated a seven . preve n tive closures at other swedish pla n ts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two swedish plants were close as precautionary measures the oskarshamn reactors , about 150 miles south of stockholm , were shut down thursday after eon subsidiary okg said " safety there could not be guaranteed , " according to a company spokesperson .
swedish atomic energy officials announced they would be examining the safety of all their nuclear power plants . some of germany 's 17 nuclear power plants use a similar cooling system to that of the swedish plant and their safety should be checked , according to the environmental organization greenpeace . " we assume that there was retrofitting here in germany after the 2004 incident that were not performed in sweden , " greenpeace 's heinz smital said in a statement , referring to a short emergency power outage in germany 's isar 2 nuclear power plant two years ago .
" nevertheless , the german atomic regulatory agency quickly needs to clarify if a similar danger threatens local atomic power plants .

plant operators in germany said the country 's 17 nuclear reactors remain safe . a subsidiary of germany 's largest energy company , eon , shut down two of three reactors it runs in the swedish city of oskarshamn thursday after backup generators failed to start properly at a similar plant last week . a reactor in forsmark was taken off the swedish power grid when two of the four diesel generators intended to provide the plant with emergency power needed to be manually started , reawakening the debate over the safety of nuclear power .

" it was never close to it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 04.08.2006 european press review : will there be a victor ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel bombed bridges into beirut on friday european newspapers weighed in this week on various aspects of the conflict in the middle east .
hope for a quick resolution seemed to be waning . " israel is stirring up hate in lebanon and the arab-muslim world by destroying the civil infrastructure , killing more children than armed men , unleashing a flood of refugees and announcing that all the lebanese in the south will be considered supporters of hezbollah and could therefore die , " wrote france 's le monde on thursday .
" after the shock of sept .
11 , the us fiasco in iraq and the intensification of the struggle against jihad fighters , the war in lebanon is stoking resentment against the jewish state , its american allies and the west in general .
the future will show who the military victor will be .
but the first three weeks of the conflict have indicated that there might not be one . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair has postponed his summer vacation to help secure a un security resolution tony blair " has made mistakes since the outbreak of the israel-lebanon conflict , though they have largely been errors of rhetoric , " according to britain 's the times .
demonstrating greater public concern for the civilian casualties at an earlier stage would have " better served his overall ends , " while his delayed expression of regret " appears , however misleadingly , to be secondary . "
a un security council resolution and the establishment of an international peace-keeping force " would do much to vindicate the prime minister and his position , " said the commentary . austria 's kurier wrote on thursday that " without a doubt , israel is being ruthless in defending its sovereignty .
israel does n't care about the international opinion and is going up against aggressors with every bit of harshness .
it has faired well so far , has survived and forced a formerly hostile neighbor into peace . "
lebanon is a country " whose population has suffered more than any other in the middle east in the past decades .
that is not israel 's fault . "
iran and its " henchmen " have brought about a " war against israel 's very existence , " said the paper , quoting german foreign minister joschka fischer . " people believed for a long time that the verbal radicalism of iranian president mahmud ahmadinejad was some kind of personal idiosyncrasy , " wrote germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on wednesday .
" it has now even been said that the man has - to put it politely - a somewhat bizarre , unpredictable character , such that his dreams of destruction concerning israel ca n't be taken quite as seriously as they sound . "
the paper quoted the iranian revolutionary leader ayatollah khomeini , who had committed his country years ago to supporting lebanon in its quest to eliminate israel .
" after the country had thawed a bit under president khatami , the islamic republic of iran has returned to its roots , at least ideologically , " said the paper . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de violence in the middle east click on the links to read dw-world.de 's compilation of articles on the conflict and the search for peace .
" germany should take part in lebanon peace-keeping mission " former israeli ambassador to germany avi primor backed the idea of german troops participating in a possible international peacekeeping mission in lebanon as long as they were not stationed on the border with israel .

plant operators in germany said the country 's 17 nuclear reactors remain safe . a subsidiary of germany 's largest energy company , eon , shut down two of three reactors it runs in the swedish city of oskarshamn thursday after backup generators failed to start properly at a similar plant last week . a reactor in forsmark was taken off the swedish power grid when two of the four diesel generators intended to provide the plant with emergency power needed to be manually started , reawakening the debate over the safety of nuclear power .

swedish atomic energy officials announced they would be examining the safety of all their nuclear power plants . some of germany 's 17 nuclear power plants use a similar cooling system to that of the swedish plant and their safety should be checked , according to the environmental organization greenpeace . " we assume that there was retrofitting here in germany after the 2004 incident that were not performed in sweden , " greenpeace 's heinz smital said in a statement , referring to a short emergency power outage in germany 's isar 2 nuclear power plant two years ago .

" we can not discuss extending the operating times for atomic power plants . " in the past , members of germany 's conservative christian parties have argued for prolonging the country 's reliance on nuclear power .

after a successful six-hour operation , the astronauts returned to the station ahead of schedule . thomas reiter on thursday became the first european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- astronaut to conduct a space walk from the international space station .
he and his american colleague jeff williams spent six hours making repairs on the space station . " it 's an indescribable feeling to be working between earth and the heavens , " said reiter , who spent 179 days in the now defunct mir space station a decade ago and has performed two other space walks . there were some initial concerns thursday at nasa when the door to the space station jammed .
but after some pushing and pulling , the hatch released and reiter and williams floated out , as if in slow motion . reiter was wearing a white space suite with a german flag .
williams ' suit had red stripes so that the two could be easily identified by observers inside the space station . a hard day 's work bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reiter was hooked with karabiners to the space station " it 's really exhausting because they have to fight against the resistance in their suits and move heavy objects back and forth , " said volker damann , an esa doctor .
" that 's why we see their heart rates peak , like with cyclists or people doing sports . " " you have to imagine that there 's a vacuum outside , " said reiter , who had spent countless hours underwater to simulate the experience .
" you 're in a pressurized suit and every tiny movement you make with each finger … is very physically demanding . " like mountain climbers , reiter and williams used karabiners , metal rings with clips , to hook themselves to the space station as they moved along its outer shell .
not only were the astronauts themselves secured , but each one of their tools as well . " we do n't want to lose them , for one thing , but the next crew to go out does n't want to run into the tools again , " damann said .
" it 's very important for us not to lose anything . " a n ew day every 90 mi n utes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 48-year-old astronaut used to be a pilot in the german air force the international space station races around the earth at 28,000 kilometers per hour -lrb- 17,400 miles per hour -rrb- and circles it once every 90 minutes .
damann said the human body can only recognize acceleration and deceleration , not speed itself .
the astronauts do n't notice the space station 's quick pace , just the shortened days and nights . " it 's gravity that affects the astronauts , " said reinhold ewald , an esa astronaut who observed the space walk operation from the german control center in oberpfaffenhofen .
the astronaut 's orbit compensates for gravity , he explained , and " the end result is that you float weightlessly but are pulled here and there by these forces .
you just do n't notice it . " after repairing two gps antennas , installing a gauge to measure the space station 's electric field , screwing on replacement parts and installing various devices , reiter and williams returned ahead of schedule . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german astronaut to join nasa 's discovery shuttle mission thomas reiter , a former german air force pilot and veteran astronaut , joins six americans on the discovery shuttle mission to the international space station .

but when one under-sexed aachen housewife had enough of not getting the good lovin ' from her husband - she called the cops . police officers are often called upon to read people their civil rights but it 's unusual for them to be asked to explain the conjugal versions .
yet that 's exactly what was required of officers attending to a domestic complaint in the german city of aachen this week . a desperate woman at her wits end with her disinterested husband called the local cops to demand that they enforce the laws of love after a tiff on wednesday night . after several barren months without the merest hint of getting any , the 44-year-old woman turned to law enforcement in a bid to get her lazy lover off the couch and into her bed for some healthy husband-wife horizontal action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : got the horn : not everyone has as much fun in the bedroom the call to the police came after the woman could bear it no longer and woke her non-performing 45-year old spouse in the middle of the night to demand that he fulfilled his sexual obligations .
when her advances were refused , a row broke out and she called the police and asked them to intervene . make my husba n d have sex with me ! the perplexed cops turned up to hear the wife demanding that they make her hubbie have sex with her . " the police officials did not feel able to resolve the dispute , let alone issue any kind of official order , " police spokesperson paul kemen said on thursday .
" and because no crime or infringement could be identified , all they could do was file a report in case intervention might be required at a later date , " he added . chances are that if the wife has n't got hers by then , they may be attending a far more serious incident . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans ca n't get no ...

plant operators in germany said the country 's 17 nuclear reactors remain safe . a subsidiary of germany 's largest energy company , eon , shut down two of three reactors it runs in the swedish city of oskarshamn thursday after backup generators failed to start properly at a similar plant last week . a reactor in forsmark was taken off the swedish power grid when two of the four diesel generators intended to provide the plant with emergency power needed to be manually started , reawakening the debate over the safety of nuclear power . " it was as close as you can get to a nuclear meltdown , " former construction manager at the forsmark plant , lars-olov höglund told the swedish daily newspaper sve n ska dagbladet .
" it was sheer luck that this did n't lead to a catastrophe worse than chernobyl . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sweden said there was no danger of a meltdown in forsmark vattenfall , the swedish power company that operates the forsmark plant about 46 miles -lrb- 75 kilometers -rrb- from stockholm , disputed the danger of a meltdown , saying the two diesel generators provided enough power to run the plant 's cooling system , according to a company spokesperson . the swedish environmental ministry agreed that the situation was not as dangerous as höglund said . " this could n't be compared with something as serious as a meltdown , " ministry spokesperson lena berglund said .
" it was never close to it . " swedish nuclear power inspectorate -lrb- ski -rrb- spokesman anders bredfell told the bbc news web site the forsmark incident ranked as a number two on the international atomic energy agency 's scale , which ranks nuclear incidents from zero to seven and rates incidents as four or more as being dangerous to humans and the environment .
the chernobyl nuclear disaster was rated a seven . preve n tive closures at other swedish pla n ts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two swedish plants were close as precautionary measures the oskarshamn reactors , about 150 miles south of stockholm , were shut down thursday after eon subsidiary okg said " safety there could not be guaranteed , " according to a company spokesperson .
swedish atomic energy officials announced they would be examining the safety of all their nuclear power plants . some of germany 's 17 nuclear power plants use a similar cooling system to that of the swedish plant and their safety should be checked , according to the environmental organization greenpeace . " we assume that there was retrofitting here in germany after the 2004 incident that were not performed in sweden , " greenpeace 's heinz smital said in a statement , referring to a short emergency power outage in germany 's isar 2 nuclear power plant two years ago .
" nevertheless , the german atomic regulatory agency quickly needs to clarify if a similar danger threatens local atomic power plants . " germa n y committed to phasi n g out n uclear power the german environment ministry said thursday the malfunctions in the swedish plants a " serious safety incident " and friday called on the german states ' atomic regulatory agencies to check the operation of their plants ' emergency power and cooling systems for the aeg components that are suspected to have led to the break down in sweden . german nuclear power critics used the incident in a country with western safety standards to point out the dangers of atomic power and to call for an end to germany 's dependency on atomic energy , which accounts for about 12 percent of german energy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts are checking to see if a similar accident could happen in germany " the incident has made it clear that atomic power technology is not actually controllable , " marco bülow , germany 's social democratic party environmental issues spokesperson told reporters on friday .
" we can not discuss extending the operating times for atomic power plants . " in the past , members of germany 's conservative christian parties have argued for prolonging the country 's reliance on nuclear power .
at the end of july , the grand coalition government , however , said in a statement that it remains committed to phasing out nuclear power . similar malfu n ctio n u n likely i n germa n y a repeat of the swedish incident is unlikely in germany , according to preliminary reports from the country 's 17 atomic power plants gathered by the german dpa news agency . " the initial analysis of our six atomic power plants has shown that an incident similar to forsmark can be ruled out , " an eon spokesperson said friday , adding that the company 's german reactors have a different emergency power supply than the swedish plant . operators of germany 's other nuclear reactors , including vattenfall , also reported that their reactors are running normally and that there are no plans to shut them down . like germany , sweden has committed to eliminating its reliance on nuclear power .

hope for a quick resolution seemed to be waning . " israel is stirring up hate in lebanon and the arab-muslim world by destroying the civil infrastructure , killing more children than armed men , unleashing a flood of refugees and announcing that all the lebanese in the south will be considered supporters of hezbollah and could therefore die , " wrote france 's le monde on thursday .
" after the shock of sept .
11 , the us fiasco in iraq and the intensification of the struggle against jihad fighters , the war in lebanon is stoking resentment against the jewish state , its american allies and the west in general .
the future will show who the military victor will be .
but the first three weeks of the conflict have indicated that there might not be one . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair has postponed his summer vacation to help secure a un security resolution tony blair " has made mistakes since the outbreak of the israel-lebanon conflict , though they have largely been errors of rhetoric , " according to britain 's the times .
demonstrating greater public concern for the civilian casualties at an earlier stage would have " better served his overall ends , " while his delayed expression of regret " appears , however misleadingly , to be secondary . "
a un security council resolution and the establishment of an international peace-keeping force " would do much to vindicate the prime minister and his position , " said the commentary . austria 's kurier wrote on thursday that " without a doubt , israel is being ruthless in defending its sovereignty .
israel does n't care about the international opinion and is going up against aggressors with every bit of harshness .
it has faired well so far , has survived and forced a formerly hostile neighbor into peace . "
lebanon is a country " whose population has suffered more than any other in the middle east in the past decades .
that is not israel 's fault . "
iran and its " henchmen " have brought about a " war against israel 's very existence , " said the paper , quoting german foreign minister joschka fischer . " people believed for a long time that the verbal radicalism of iranian president mahmud ahmadinejad was some kind of personal idiosyncrasy , " wrote germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on wednesday .
" it has now even been said that the man has - to put it politely - a somewhat bizarre , unpredictable character , such that his dreams of destruction concerning israel ca n't be taken quite as seriously as they sound . "
the paper quoted the iranian revolutionary leader ayatollah khomeini , who had committed his country years ago to supporting lebanon in its quest to eliminate israel .
" after the country had thawed a bit under president khatami , the islamic republic of iran has returned to its roots , at least ideologically , " said the paper . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de violence in the middle east click on the links to read dw-world.de 's compilation of articles on the conflict and the search for peace .

plant operators in germany said the country 's 17 nuclear reactors remain safe . a subsidiary of germany 's largest energy company , eon , shut down two of three reactors it runs in the swedish city of oskarshamn thursday after backup generators failed to start properly at a similar plant last week . a reactor in forsmark was taken off the swedish power grid when two of the four diesel generators intended to provide the plant with emergency power needed to be manually started , reawakening the debate over the safety of nuclear power . " it was as close as you can get to a nuclear meltdown , " former construction manager at the forsmark plant , lars-olov höglund told the swedish daily newspaper sve n ska dagbladet .
" it was sheer luck that this did n't lead to a catastrophe worse than chernobyl .

" this could n't be compared with something as serious as a meltdown , " ministry spokesperson lena berglund said .
" it was never close to it . " swedish nuclear power inspectorate -lrb- ski -rrb- spokesman anders bredfell told the bbc news web site the forsmark incident ranked as a number two on the international atomic energy agency 's scale , which ranks nuclear incidents from zero to seven and rates incidents as four or more as being dangerous to humans and the environment .

swedish atomic energy officials announced they would be examining the safety of all their nuclear power plants . some of germany 's 17 nuclear power plants use a similar cooling system to that of the swedish plant and their safety should be checked , according to the environmental organization greenpeace . " we assume that there was retrofitting here in germany after the 2004 incident that were not performed in sweden , " greenpeace 's heinz smital said in a statement , referring to a short emergency power outage in germany 's isar 2 nuclear power plant two years ago .
" nevertheless , the german atomic regulatory agency quickly needs to clarify if a similar danger threatens local atomic power plants . " germa n y committed to phasi n g out n uclear power the german environment ministry said thursday the malfunctions in the swedish plants a " serious safety incident " and friday called on the german states ' atomic regulatory agencies to check the operation of their plants ' emergency power and cooling systems for the aeg components that are suspected to have led to the break down in sweden . german nuclear power critics used the incident in a country with western safety standards to point out the dangers of atomic power and to call for an end to germany 's dependency on atomic energy , which accounts for about 12 percent of german energy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts are checking to see if a similar accident could happen in germany " the incident has made it clear that atomic power technology is not actually controllable , " marco bülow , germany 's social democratic party environmental issues spokesperson told reporters on friday .
" we can not discuss extending the operating times for atomic power plants . " in the past , members of germany 's conservative christian parties have argued for prolonging the country 's reliance on nuclear power .
at the end of july , the grand coalition government , however , said in a statement that it remains committed to phasing out nuclear power . similar malfu n ctio n u n likely i n germa n y a repeat of the swedish incident is unlikely in germany , according to preliminary reports from the country 's 17 atomic power plants gathered by the german dpa news agency . " the initial analysis of our six atomic power plants has shown that an incident similar to forsmark can be ruled out , " an eon spokesperson said friday , adding that the company 's german reactors have a different emergency power supply than the swedish plant . operators of germany 's other nuclear reactors , including vattenfall , also reported that their reactors are running normally and that there are no plans to shut them down . like germany , sweden has committed to eliminating its reliance on nuclear power .

hope for a quick resolution seemed to be waning . " israel is stirring up hate in lebanon and the arab-muslim world by destroying the civil infrastructure , killing more children than armed men , unleashing a flood of refugees and announcing that all the lebanese in the south will be considered supporters of hezbollah and could therefore die , " wrote france 's le monde on thursday .
" after the shock of sept .
11 , the us fiasco in iraq and the intensification of the struggle against jihad fighters , the war in lebanon is stoking resentment against the jewish state , its american allies and the west in general .
the future will show who the military victor will be .
but the first three weeks of the conflict have indicated that there might not be one . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair has postponed his summer vacation to help secure a un security resolution tony blair " has made mistakes since the outbreak of the israel-lebanon conflict , though they have largely been errors of rhetoric , " according to britain 's the times .
demonstrating greater public concern for the civilian casualties at an earlier stage would have " better served his overall ends , " while his delayed expression of regret " appears , however misleadingly , to be secondary . "
a un security council resolution and the establishment of an international peace-keeping force " would do much to vindicate the prime minister and his position , " said the commentary . austria 's kurier wrote on thursday that " without a doubt , israel is being ruthless in defending its sovereignty .
israel does n't care about the international opinion and is going up against aggressors with every bit of harshness .
it has faired well so far , has survived and forced a formerly hostile neighbor into peace . "
lebanon is a country " whose population has suffered more than any other in the middle east in the past decades .
that is not israel 's fault . "
iran and its " henchmen " have brought about a " war against israel 's very existence , " said the paper , quoting german foreign minister joschka fischer . " people believed for a long time that the verbal radicalism of iranian president mahmud ahmadinejad was some kind of personal idiosyncrasy , " wrote germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on wednesday .
" it has now even been said that the man has - to put it politely - a somewhat bizarre , unpredictable character , such that his dreams of destruction concerning israel ca n't be taken quite as seriously as they sound . "
the paper quoted the iranian revolutionary leader ayatollah khomeini , who had committed his country years ago to supporting lebanon in its quest to eliminate israel .
" after the country had thawed a bit under president khatami , the islamic republic of iran has returned to its roots , at least ideologically , " said the paper . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de violence in the middle east click on the links to read dw-world.de 's compilation of articles on the conflict and the search for peace .
" germany should take part in lebanon peace-keeping mission " former israeli ambassador to germany avi primor backed the idea of german troops participating in a possible international peacekeeping mission in lebanon as long as they were not stationed on the border with israel .

" when the interior minister in the face of this catastrophe refuses to take in refugees , that is an expression of spiritual coldness and a lack of christian charity and humanitarian responsibility " she said . there are around 40,000 lebanese living in germany along with numerous german citizens of lebanese origin .

an estimated 45 percent of the internally displaced are children . the french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said thursday that current figures underestimated the humanitarian situation in lebanon and called it " disastrous . " " on the humanitarian front , the situation is more and more worrying , " douste-blazy told a news conference in paris . " i would even say disastrous .
we have passed the figure of one million displaced people and of these , half are children . " we have passed the figure of 800 dead and sadly of these more than a third are children , " he added .

" food is increasingly expensive in beirut .
medicine for children is beginning to run out . " elsewhere , greece announced that it would provide shipping for free to transport european union aid from cyprus to beirut . " the shipments will go in on a greek navy ship and the republic of cyprus will offer for free the services of the port of larnaka , " the foreign ministry in athens said in a statement . eu countries should first arrange the transport of the aid to cyprus , the ministry said . aid maki n g its way i n to leba n o n turkey said thursday it would ship food worth $ 1.2 million -lrb- 938,000 euros -rrb- to lebanon and syria for lebanese people displaced by israeli offensives . the bulk of the 900-ton supplies would be shipped to lebanon on trucks , starting from next week , while one sixth would go to lebanese refugees who fled to syria , the emergency situations agency said . meanwhile , 20 trucks carrying un aid have arrived in lebanon from neighboring syria , a spokesman for the un refugee body said .

after a successful six-hour operation , the astronauts returned to the station ahead of schedule . thomas reiter on thursday became the first european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- astronaut to conduct a space walk from the international space station .
he and his american colleague jeff williams spent six hours making repairs on the space station . " it 's an indescribable feeling to be working between earth and the heavens , " said reiter , who spent 179 days in the now defunct mir space station a decade ago and has performed two other space walks . there were some initial concerns thursday at nasa when the door to the space station jammed .
but after some pushing and pulling , the hatch released and reiter and williams floated out , as if in slow motion . reiter was wearing a white space suite with a german flag .
williams ' suit had red stripes so that the two could be easily identified by observers inside the space station . a hard day 's work bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reiter was hooked with karabiners to the space station " it 's really exhausting because they have to fight against the resistance in their suits and move heavy objects back and forth , " said volker damann , an esa doctor .
" that 's why we see their heart rates peak , like with cyclists or people doing sports . " " you have to imagine that there 's a vacuum outside , " said reiter , who had spent countless hours underwater to simulate the experience .
" you 're in a pressurized suit and every tiny movement you make with each finger … is very physically demanding . " like mountain climbers , reiter and williams used karabiners , metal rings with clips , to hook themselves to the space station as they moved along its outer shell .
not only were the astronauts themselves secured , but each one of their tools as well . " we do n't want to lose them , for one thing , but the next crew to go out does n't want to run into the tools again , " damann said .

plant operators in germany said the country 's 17 nuclear reactors remain safe . a subsidiary of germany 's largest energy company , eon , shut down two of three reactors it runs in the swedish city of oskarshamn thursday after backup generators failed to start properly at a similar plant last week . a reactor in forsmark was taken off the swedish power grid when two of the four diesel generators intended to provide the plant with emergency power needed to be manually started , reawakening the debate over the safety of nuclear power . " it was as close as you can get to a nuclear meltdown , " former construction manager at the forsmark plant , lars-olov höglund told the swedish daily newspaper sve n ska dagbladet .
" it was sheer luck that this did n't lead to a catastrophe worse than chernobyl . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sweden said there was no danger of a meltdown in forsmark vattenfall , the swedish power company that operates the forsmark plant about 46 miles -lrb- 75 kilometers -rrb- from stockholm , disputed the danger of a meltdown , saying the two diesel generators provided enough power to run the plant 's cooling system , according to a company spokesperson . the swedish environmental ministry agreed that the situation was not as dangerous as höglund said . " this could n't be compared with something as serious as a meltdown , " ministry spokesperson lena berglund said .
" it was never close to it . " swedish nuclear power inspectorate -lrb- ski -rrb- spokesman anders bredfell told the bbc news web site the forsmark incident ranked as a number two on the international atomic energy agency 's scale , which ranks nuclear incidents from zero to seven and rates incidents as four or more as being dangerous to humans and the environment .

swedish atomic energy officials announced they would be examining the safety of all their nuclear power plants . some of germany 's 17 nuclear power plants use a similar cooling system to that of the swedish plant and their safety should be checked , according to the environmental organization greenpeace . " we assume that there was retrofitting here in germany after the 2004 incident that were not performed in sweden , " greenpeace 's heinz smital said in a statement , referring to a short emergency power outage in germany 's isar 2 nuclear power plant two years ago .
" nevertheless , the german atomic regulatory agency quickly needs to clarify if a similar danger threatens local atomic power plants . " germa n y committed to phasi n g out n uclear power the german environment ministry said thursday the malfunctions in the swedish plants a " serious safety incident " and friday called on the german states ' atomic regulatory agencies to check the operation of their plants ' emergency power and cooling systems for the aeg components that are suspected to have led to the break down in sweden . german nuclear power critics used the incident in a country with western safety standards to point out the dangers of atomic power and to call for an end to germany 's dependency on atomic energy , which accounts for about 12 percent of german energy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts are checking to see if a similar accident could happen in germany " the incident has made it clear that atomic power technology is not actually controllable , " marco bülow , germany 's social democratic party environmental issues spokesperson told reporters on friday .
" we can not discuss extending the operating times for atomic power plants . " in the past , members of germany 's conservative christian parties have argued for prolonging the country 's reliance on nuclear power .
at the end of july , the grand coalition government , however , said in a statement that it remains committed to phasing out nuclear power . similar malfu n ctio n u n likely i n germa n y a repeat of the swedish incident is unlikely in germany , according to preliminary reports from the country 's 17 atomic power plants gathered by the german dpa news agency . " the initial analysis of our six atomic power plants has shown that an incident similar to forsmark can be ruled out , " an eon spokesperson said friday , adding that the company 's german reactors have a different emergency power supply than the swedish plant . operators of germany 's other nuclear reactors , including vattenfall , also reported that their reactors are running normally and that there are no plans to shut them down . like germany , sweden has committed to eliminating its reliance on nuclear power .

after a successful six-hour operation , the astronauts returned to the station ahead of schedule . thomas reiter on thursday became the first european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- astronaut to conduct a space walk from the international space station .
he and his american colleague jeff williams spent six hours making repairs on the space station . " it 's an indescribable feeling to be working between earth and the heavens , " said reiter , who spent 179 days in the now defunct mir space station a decade ago and has performed two other space walks . there were some initial concerns thursday at nasa when the door to the space station jammed .
but after some pushing and pulling , the hatch released and reiter and williams floated out , as if in slow motion . reiter was wearing a white space suite with a german flag .
williams ' suit had red stripes so that the two could be easily identified by observers inside the space station . a hard day 's work bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reiter was hooked with karabiners to the space station " it 's really exhausting because they have to fight against the resistance in their suits and move heavy objects back and forth , " said volker damann , an esa doctor .
" that 's why we see their heart rates peak , like with cyclists or people doing sports . " " you have to imagine that there 's a vacuum outside , " said reiter , who had spent countless hours underwater to simulate the experience .
" you 're in a pressurized suit and every tiny movement you make with each finger … is very physically demanding . " like mountain climbers , reiter and williams used karabiners , metal rings with clips , to hook themselves to the space station as they moved along its outer shell .
not only were the astronauts themselves secured , but each one of their tools as well . " we do n't want to lose them , for one thing , but the next crew to go out does n't want to run into the tools again , " damann said .
" it 's very important for us not to lose anything . " a n ew day every 90 mi n utes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 48-year-old astronaut used to be a pilot in the german air force the international space station races around the earth at 28,000 kilometers per hour -lrb- 17,400 miles per hour -rrb- and circles it once every 90 minutes .
damann said the human body can only recognize acceleration and deceleration , not speed itself .
the astronauts do n't notice the space station 's quick pace , just the shortened days and nights . " it 's gravity that affects the astronauts , " said reinhold ewald , an esa astronaut who observed the space walk operation from the german control center in oberpfaffenhofen .
the astronaut 's orbit compensates for gravity , he explained , and " the end result is that you float weightlessly but are pulled here and there by these forces .
you just do n't notice it . " after repairing two gps antennas , installing a gauge to measure the space station 's electric field , screwing on replacement parts and installing various devices , reiter and williams returned ahead of schedule . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german astronaut to join nasa 's discovery shuttle mission thomas reiter , a former german air force pilot and veteran astronaut , joins six americans on the discovery shuttle mission to the international space station .

after a successful six-hour operation , the astronauts returned to the station ahead of schedule . thomas reiter on thursday became the first european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- astronaut to conduct a space walk from the international space station .
he and his american colleague jeff williams spent six hours making repairs on the space station . " it 's an indescribable feeling to be working between earth and the heavens , " said reiter , who spent 179 days in the now defunct mir space station a decade ago and has performed two other space walks . there were some initial concerns thursday at nasa when the door to the space station jammed .
but after some pushing and pulling , the hatch released and reiter and williams floated out , as if in slow motion . reiter was wearing a white space suite with a german flag .
williams ' suit had red stripes so that the two could be easily identified by observers inside the space station . a hard day 's work bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reiter was hooked with karabiners to the space station " it 's really exhausting because they have to fight against the resistance in their suits and move heavy objects back and forth , " said volker damann , an esa doctor .
" that 's why we see their heart rates peak , like with cyclists or people doing sports . " " you have to imagine that there 's a vacuum outside , " said reiter , who had spent countless hours underwater to simulate the experience .
" you 're in a pressurized suit and every tiny movement you make with each finger … is very physically demanding . " like mountain climbers , reiter and williams used karabiners , metal rings with clips , to hook themselves to the space station as they moved along its outer shell .
not only were the astronauts themselves secured , but each one of their tools as well . " we do n't want to lose them , for one thing , but the next crew to go out does n't want to run into the tools again , " damann said .

damann said the human body can only recognize acceleration and deceleration , not speed itself .

after a successful six-hour operation , the astronauts returned to the station ahead of schedule . thomas reiter on thursday became the first european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- astronaut to conduct a space walk from the international space station .
he and his american colleague jeff williams spent six hours making repairs on the space station . " it 's an indescribable feeling to be working between earth and the heavens , " said reiter , who spent 179 days in the now defunct mir space station a decade ago and has performed two other space walks . there were some initial concerns thursday at nasa when the door to the space station jammed .
but after some pushing and pulling , the hatch released and reiter and williams floated out , as if in slow motion . reiter was wearing a white space suite with a german flag .
williams ' suit had red stripes so that the two could be easily identified by observers inside the space station . a hard day 's work bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reiter was hooked with karabiners to the space station " it 's really exhausting because they have to fight against the resistance in their suits and move heavy objects back and forth , " said volker damann , an esa doctor .

hope for a quick resolution seemed to be waning . " israel is stirring up hate in lebanon and the arab-muslim world by destroying the civil infrastructure , killing more children than armed men , unleashing a flood of refugees and announcing that all the lebanese in the south will be considered supporters of hezbollah and could therefore die , " wrote france 's le monde on thursday .

the future will show who the military victor will be .
but the first three weeks of the conflict have indicated that there might not be one . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair has postponed his summer vacation to help secure a un security resolution tony blair " has made mistakes since the outbreak of the israel-lebanon conflict , though they have largely been errors of rhetoric , " according to britain 's the times .
demonstrating greater public concern for the civilian casualties at an earlier stage would have " better served his overall ends , " while his delayed expression of regret " appears , however misleadingly , to be secondary . "
a un security council resolution and the establishment of an international peace-keeping force " would do much to vindicate the prime minister and his position , " said the commentary . austria 's kurier wrote on thursday that " without a doubt , israel is being ruthless in defending its sovereignty .
israel does n't care about the international opinion and is going up against aggressors with every bit of harshness .
it has faired well so far , has survived and forced a formerly hostile neighbor into peace . "
lebanon is a country " whose population has suffered more than any other in the middle east in the past decades .
that is not israel 's fault . "
iran and its " henchmen " have brought about a " war against israel 's very existence , " said the paper , quoting german foreign minister joschka fischer . " people believed for a long time that the verbal radicalism of iranian president mahmud ahmadinejad was some kind of personal idiosyncrasy , " wrote germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on wednesday .
" it has now even been said that the man has - to put it politely - a somewhat bizarre , unpredictable character , such that his dreams of destruction concerning israel ca n't be taken quite as seriously as they sound . "
the paper quoted the iranian revolutionary leader ayatollah khomeini , who had committed his country years ago to supporting lebanon in its quest to eliminate israel .
" after the country had thawed a bit under president khatami , the islamic republic of iran has returned to its roots , at least ideologically , " said the paper . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de violence in the middle east click on the links to read dw-world.de 's compilation of articles on the conflict and the search for peace .

but when one under-sexed aachen housewife had enough of not getting the good lovin ' from her husband - she called the cops . police officers are often called upon to read people their civil rights but it 's unusual for them to be asked to explain the conjugal versions .
yet that 's exactly what was required of officers attending to a domestic complaint in the german city of aachen this week . a desperate woman at her wits end with her disinterested husband called the local cops to demand that they enforce the laws of love after a tiff on wednesday night . after several barren months without the merest hint of getting any , the 44-year-old woman turned to law enforcement in a bid to get her lazy lover off the couch and into her bed for some healthy husband-wife horizontal action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : got the horn : not everyone has as much fun in the bedroom the call to the police came after the woman could bear it no longer and woke her non-performing 45-year old spouse in the middle of the night to demand that he fulfilled his sexual obligations .
when her advances were refused , a row broke out and she called the police and asked them to intervene . make my husba n d have sex with me ! the perplexed cops turned up to hear the wife demanding that they make her hubbie have sex with her . " the police officials did not feel able to resolve the dispute , let alone issue any kind of official order , " police spokesperson paul kemen said on thursday .
" and because no crime or infringement could be identified , all they could do was file a report in case intervention might be required at a later date , " he added . chances are that if the wife has n't got hers by then , they may be attending a far more serious incident . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans ca n't get no ...

swedish atomic energy officials announced they would be examining the safety of all their nuclear power plants . some of germany 's 17 nuclear power plants use a similar cooling system to that of the swedish plant and their safety should be checked , according to the environmental organization greenpeace . " we assume that there was retrofitting here in germany after the 2004 incident that were not performed in sweden , " greenpeace 's heinz smital said in a statement , referring to a short emergency power outage in germany 's isar 2 nuclear power plant two years ago .

" when the interior minister in the face of this catastrophe refuses to take in refugees , that is an expression of spiritual coldness and a lack of christian charity and humanitarian responsibility " she said . there are around 40,000 lebanese living in germany along with numerous german citizens of lebanese origin .

an estimated 45 percent of the internally displaced are children . the french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said thursday that current figures underestimated the humanitarian situation in lebanon and called it " disastrous . " " on the humanitarian front , the situation is more and more worrying , " douste-blazy told a news conference in paris . " i would even say disastrous .
we have passed the figure of one million displaced people and of these , half are children . " we have passed the figure of 800 dead and sadly of these more than a third are children , " he added .

" the shipments will go in on a greek navy ship and the republic of cyprus will offer for free the services of the port of larnaka , " the foreign ministry in athens said in a statement . eu countries should first arrange the transport of the aid to cyprus , the ministry said . aid maki n g its way i n to leba n o n turkey said thursday it would ship food worth $ 1.2 million -lrb- 938,000 euros -rrb- to lebanon and syria for lebanese people displaced by israeli offensives . the bulk of the 900-ton supplies would be shipped to lebanon on trucks , starting from next week , while one sixth would go to lebanese refugees who fled to syria , the emergency situations agency said . meanwhile , 20 trucks carrying un aid have arrived in lebanon from neighboring syria , a spokesman for the un refugee body said .

a towering hall is a feature of the new museum in lerwick , which is due to open to the public in spring 2007 .
the boats have been winched into position in their new home , up to 14m high .
elevated viewing platforms on each of the floors of the main building will give visitors a series of views of the suspended boats .
specialist contractors travelled with their equipment by road and sea from cornwall to shetland , one tip of the uk to the other , to oversee the delicate boat hanging operation .
the hanging boats include one suspended with full rigging , as if under sail .
the boat hall will trace the history of shetland boats from viking roots to the present day .

with a walkout due to start at the escondida mine in chile on monday , staff said they wanted to avoid the strike but would not back down .
union representatives said managers had pledged to respond by midday friday .
staff at the mine , which is 57.5 % owned by bhp billiton want a 13 % pay rise , but have so far only been offered 3 % .
the 2,000 workers are also demanding a 16m peso -lrb- $ 29,400 ; £ 15,500 -rrb- bonus , but the mine 's operators are currently only prepared to go as far as 8.1m peso , double their previous offer .
record copper prices staff say they are sticking to their guns because global copper prices have hit record highs this year after a surge in demand led by china 's booming economy .
analysts said any disruption to output at escondida , which is expected to produce 1.4 million tonnes of copper this year , may lead to copper prices rising still further on the international market .
while bhp billiton owns almost two-thirds of the escondida mine , fellow anglo-australian mining giant rio tinto owns 30 % .

at the same time , the number of people going bankrupt is rising sharply .
bbc news examines why it is so many people are defaulting on their debt .
what is the scale of bad debt ?
lloyds tsb has become the latest uk bank to warn on escalating bad debts .
the bank 's latest results revealed that lloyds ' uk retail banking arm set aside £ 632m against bad debts during the first half of 2006 , a rise of 16 % .
the number of personal insolvencies - when people are declared bankrupt or enter an individual voluntary arrangement -lrb- ivas -rrb- - paints an even gloomier picture .
more than 23,000 people became insolvent in england and wales during the first three months of 2006 - 73 % more than in the same period last year .
new personal insolvency figures are out on 4 august and are expected to show another rise .
why are more people going bankrupt ?
there seem to be many reasons for the rising tide of insolvency .
firstly , in recent years there has been a massive expansion of uk personal debt .
for a good few years , the uk consumer has enjoyed benign economic conditions .
high levels of employment coupled with low interest rates have boosted consumer confidence .
with such a golden backdrop , banks have been falling over themselves to lend money .
a number of debt advisers suggest that some lenders have behaved irresponsibly by fuelling the uk debt culture .
logically , the more people there are in debt , the greater the chances of people falling into arrears .
however , some bodies such as the credit services agency , which represents debt collectors , have suggested that recent changes to the bankruptcy law make going insolvent easier and less punishing , which has led to the rise in insolvencies .
is it easier to go bankrupt ?
the department for trade and industry -lrb- dti -rrb- , which is responsible for the insolvency service , is adamant that bankruptcy is " no easy option " .
bankruptcy law changes automatic discharge after one year creditors have three years to deal with bankrupt 's home some bankrupts may continue to pay off debts even after discharge dishonest , reckless or blameworthy bankrupts could face restrictions for up to 15 years however , the government 's enterprise act fundamentally reformed uk bankruptcy .
bankrupts can now find themselves discharged after just one year , down from three .
in addition , under the reforms , the homes of bankrupts were given better protection from being seized by creditors .
some suggest that these measures have tipped the scales and that debtors who face a choice between struggling on or going bankrupt are now more likely to go down the latter route .
are there any other reasons for rising tide of personal insolvency ?
in recent times , a whole industry has sprung up around insolvency .
this has centred on management of ivas .
i did not want to go bankrupt as it could end in me losing my house , so i responded to a television advert for a firm which promised to free me from my debt one reader 's experience of entering an iva ivas are an alternative to bankruptcy that allows debtors to come to an agreement with their creditors .
firms offer to set up and manage customers ivas for a fee , charged to the creditors .
iva management services have been widely advertised , and this , some experts suggest , has prompted many to take the insolvency path .
could bad debt get out of hand ?
it largely depends on the what happens to the economy .

on monday , the bank of england said that new credit card borrowing was at its lowest for 12 years .
last week , the association of payment clearing services said that spending on credit cards was actually lower in the first half of 2006 than during the same period last year .
the main worry for economists is what will happen if interest rates have to go up .
the higher rates go , the more people are likely to opt to become insolvent .
the doomsday scenario is that so many people go insolvent as to cause what is called a credit crunch - where the banks , to protect their own finances , cut back on lending severely , sending the economy into a downward spiral .

one of them , bloggers : real internet diaries , is based entirely on british blogs .
" i 'd never heard of blogs until a year ago , " says the play 's director , oliver mann , who worked until recently as a television producer in london .
last year , he and a friend heard from an old classmate , who told them to check out his blog .
" he just wrote the most intensely personal stuff about his private life , " mr mann says .
" we became so addicted to it that we were checking it out at work . "
that need to confess is still very much with us .
who we confess to is a very different matter sam raven , blogger " we started sort of performing it for each other , and that is when i realised that a blog like this would work well as a kind of dramatic monologue , in an intimate stage venue . "
mr mann hatched the idea of creating a play from british blogs , and staging it at the fringe .
the director scoured hundreds of blogs .
there was , he admits , plenty of dross .
but he did manage to find some dramatic , even racy , stories .
" i was really taken aback by the quality of the writing , " he says .
" i came across stories that were titillating and interesting , but that also had real substance to them .
people expressed themselves really beautifully .
when mr mann contacted the bloggers he liked , he promised not to change a single word they had written .
he also promised to protect their identities by changing names and locations .

in the play , the director weaves together a number of strange narratives , including a mother of three discussing her nymphomania , and a young man in the midst of a horrible , endless break-up with his girlfriend .
then there 's a character named eva , who is agoraphobic and works for a sex chat-line .
with blogging , you are your own editor , you can write whatever you like , and you can get immediate feedback - that is the beauty of it sam raven , blogger " my callers are the only human contact i have during the day .
i do n't feel how lonely i am sometimes , because i have work to do .
but when i stop to look around , that 's when it bites , " writes eva .
given the sensitive and personal nature of the material , it is not surprising that most of the online writers featured in bloggers : real internet diaries chose to remain anonymous .
but one blogger , sam raven , is not afraid to have his real name used .
mr raven blogs about what he calls his " neurotic " family , and how much they get on his nerves .
he says it 's a story he needs to get off his chest .
" previously , one would confess one 's apparent sins to the local wise man , or the priest .
these days , one confesses to the community at large , the blogosphere , " says mr raven .
" that need to confess is still very much with us .
who we confess to is a very different matter .

but with all the ensuing publicity , mr raven 's family now knows he 's called them " lunatic " and " insane " .
still , he says they plan to attend the performance in edinburgh .
" in reality , i hope they take it with a pinch of salt , and say , ' at least he 's done something with his life ' , " says mr raven , with a smile .
bloggers : real internet diaries is n't the only fringe offering tapping into blogs this year .
there will also be a dramatisation of baghdad burning , which features one young iraqi girl 's blog about the current conflict in her country .
it may seem a far cry from mr mann 's production , but the director disagrees .
in both cases , he says , it is the drama born of ordinary people writing about their everyday lives .

one of them , bloggers : real internet diaries , is based entirely on british blogs .
" i 'd never heard of blogs until a year ago , " says the play 's director , oliver mann , who worked until recently as a television producer in london .
last year , he and a friend heard from an old classmate , who told them to check out his blog .
" he just wrote the most intensely personal stuff about his private life , " mr mann says .
" we became so addicted to it that we were checking it out at work . "
that need to confess is still very much with us .
who we confess to is a very different matter sam raven , blogger " we started sort of performing it for each other , and that is when i realised that a blog like this would work well as a kind of dramatic monologue , in an intimate stage venue . "
mr mann hatched the idea of creating a play from british blogs , and staging it at the fringe .
the director scoured hundreds of blogs .
there was , he admits , plenty of dross .
but he did manage to find some dramatic , even racy , stories .
" i was really taken aback by the quality of the writing , " he says .
" i came across stories that were titillating and interesting , but that also had real substance to them .
people expressed themselves really beautifully .
when mr mann contacted the bloggers he liked , he promised not to change a single word they had written .
he also promised to protect their identities by changing names and locations .
have your say the whole atmosphere is electric and must be experienced at least once .

in the play , the director weaves together a number of strange narratives , including a mother of three discussing her nymphomania , and a young man in the midst of a horrible , endless break-up with his girlfriend .
then there 's a character named eva , who is agoraphobic and works for a sex chat-line .

but when i stop to look around , that 's when it bites , " writes eva .
given the sensitive and personal nature of the material , it is not surprising that most of the online writers featured in bloggers : real internet diaries chose to remain anonymous .
but one blogger , sam raven , is not afraid to have his real name used .
mr raven blogs about what he calls his " neurotic " family , and how much they get on his nerves .
he says it 's a story he needs to get off his chest .
" previously , one would confess one 's apparent sins to the local wise man , or the priest .
these days , one confesses to the community at large , the blogosphere , " says mr raven .
" that need to confess is still very much with us .

but with all the ensuing publicity , mr raven 's family now knows he 's called them " lunatic " and " insane " .
still , he says they plan to attend the performance in edinburgh .
" in reality , i hope they take it with a pinch of salt , and say , ' at least he 's done something with his life ' , " says mr raven , with a smile .
bloggers : real internet diaries is n't the only fringe offering tapping into blogs this year .
there will also be a dramatisation of baghdad burning , which features one young iraqi girl 's blog about the current conflict in her country .
it may seem a far cry from mr mann 's production , but the director disagrees .
in both cases , he says , it is the drama born of ordinary people writing about their everyday lives .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- bank profits : curse or blessing ?
bbc news / business graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- business contents : your money -pipe- economy companies friday , 4 august 2006 , 07:54 gmt 08:54 uk bank profits : curse or blessing ?
analysis by robert peston business editor , bbc news the reaction of many of us when we hear about banks ' record profits is to bristle .
memories of queuing an age for the counter or cheques taking days to clear become even more irksome .
and then there 's the thought that if they are making so much money , it must be because we 're being overcharged .
well , this is a fallacy .
rate of return the absolute size of banks ' profits - or that of any company - is irrelevant .
whether a bank makes £ 10bn or £ 10m in a year says nothing about whether it is making too little money or too much money - or about whether we are being overcharged .
what matters is the rate of return that the banks earn and whether there is effective competition in the industry .
the rate of return is the profits generated as a percentage of their capital .
it may sound like a difficult concept , but it is n't .
think about it as the equivalent of what we earn when we put our money in a savings account or into shares .
unreasonable reluctance the rate of return earned by the big british banks does look pretty good compared , for example , with many of the continental european banks .
so does that prove that we 're being ripped off ?
well , not necessarily .
the uk banking market is more competitive than those of france , germany , spain or italy .
if uk banks earn a better rate of return than their peers in those countries , it probably means uk banks are more efficient - which is a good thing .
now i am not arguing that competition in the uk is intense enough .
it is now easier than ever for us to switch banks with a minimum of hassle , but surprisingly few of us do this .
the banks take advantage of our inertia - of our reluctance to seek out the keenest deals for banking services .
the same is true in telecoms and gas .
bt and british gas derive huge benefits from the millions of individuals who ca n't be bothered to seek out cheaper providers of their services , or are simply fearful of change .
but if they are making profits from our inertia , who is to blame ?
is it bt , british gas and the banks ?
or is it us and our unreasonable reluctance to switch banks or telecoms provider or gas supplier ?
cheers to profits all that said , there is a very good reason why fat profits from the big banks may actually be a reason to celebrate .
here 's why .
the six biggest uk banks are worth about £ 300bn - equivalent to a fifth of the value of all uk companies listed on the london stock exchange .
what that means is that they represent about a fifth of all british shares held by our pension funds and they pay about a quarter of all dividends injected by british companies into these pension funds .
so when the banks do well , millions of people benefit - in the sense that the pensions that we receive or expect to receive are better underpinned .
to put it more starkly , if the banks made zero profits and paid no dividends , there would be even bigger holes in pension funds than those that yawn today .
now to be clear - i am not an apologist for the banks .
they can be arrogant .
their service can stink .
and they can be negligent in lending too much to the wrong people or to inappropriate businesses .
but it is nonsensical to kick them just because their profits run into billions .
it 's how they earn those billions that matters .

she was perhaps even more admired as a lieder-singer .
schwarzkopf started her career with the vienna state opera dame elisabeth , the daughter of a prussian schoolmaster , was born in 1915 near posen , germany - now in poland .
she received her early musical training in berlin but started her professional career with the vienna state opera .
she toured with the company and , as the countess in mozart 's le nozze di figaro , found what was to become one of her signature roles .
at the end of world war ii , walter legge , then an assistant director at covent garden , went to vienna on a talent-spotting trip .
he met dame elisabeth and in due course married her in 1953 in epsom , england .
afterwards she made her home in london and took british citizenship , though she remained essentially an international singer .
good-looking , full of vivacity and charming , dame elisabeth was also a woman of fine intellect and a fanatically hard worker .
she used her beautiful soprano voice with impeccable artistry and was a splendid actress .
rare award of her operatic roles , perhaps the one that suited her best was that of the marschallin in richard strauss 's rosenkavalier .
she had a big repertory of songs , including works by benjamin britten , schubert , brahms and hugo wolf .
one of her signature roles was the marschallin in der rosenkavalier -lrb- r -rrb- her interpretation of the latter was distinctive in the way she coloured each syllable of each word .
she would divide her time between lieder recitals and opera performances for the rest of her career .
her last operatic performance was in brussels in 1971 as the marschallin .
in 1976 , cambridge university gave her a rarely-awarded honorary doctorate of music .
when her husband died in 1979 , she announced that she would not sing in public again .
she did , however , continue to lecture and give her masterclasses - some of which were shown on the bbc .
she was well-known for being a strict taskmistress , with some describing her manner as harsh .
diva dismissal when britain , her adopted country , made her a dame in 1992 , it provoked controversy about her early links with the nazi party that would disturb the tranquillity of her later years .
she had been boycotted for several years in the united states for the same reason .
famously , seven of her desert island discs were her own records but there was never any doubt about her determination to exploit every opportunity to establish herself as a force in her profession .
throughout her career she sought constantly the adulation of the audience , though she scornfully dismissed any suggestion that she was a diva .
she will be remembered by many radio listeners , however , as the castaway who chose seven of her own records when she appeared on desert island discs .
she moved to switzerland in later life before settling in vorarlberg , austria .
the bbc 's creative director , alan yentob , said : " despite her fiery temperament , elisabeth schwarzkopf was one of the great sopranos of the 20th century .
" her very early recording of richard strauss 's four last songs is still for me a heart-stopper . "

analysis by robert peston business editor , bbc news are customers being ripped off by profitable banks ?
the reaction of many of us when we hear about banks ' record profits is to bristle .
memories of queuing an age for the counter or cheques taking days to clear become even more irksome .
and then there 's the thought that if they are making so much money , it must be because we 're being overcharged .
well , this is a fallacy .
rate of return the absolute size of banks ' profits - or that of any company - is irrelevant .
whether a bank makes £ 10bn or £ 10m in a year says nothing about whether it is making too little money or too much money - or about whether we are being overcharged .
what matters is the rate of return that the banks earn and whether there is effective competition in the industry .
the rate of return is the profits generated as a percentage of their capital .
it may sound like a difficult concept , but it is n't .
think about it as the equivalent of what we earn when we put our money in a savings account or into shares .
unreasonable reluctance the rate of return earned by the big british banks does look pretty good compared , for example , with many of the continental european banks .
so does that prove that we 're being ripped off ?
a rainy day for the banks could bring bad news to pension savers well , not necessarily .
the uk banking market is more competitive than those of france , germany , spain or italy .
if uk banks earn a better rate of return than their peers in those countries , it probably means uk banks are more efficient - which is a good thing .
now i am not arguing that competition in the uk is intense enough .
it is now easier than ever for us to switch banks with a minimum of hassle , but surprisingly few of us do this .
the banks take advantage of our inertia - of our reluctance to seek out the keenest deals for banking services .
the same is true in telecoms and gas .
bt and british gas derive huge benefits from the millions of individuals who ca n't be bothered to seek out cheaper providers of their services , or are simply fearful of change .
but if they are making profits from our inertia , who is to blame ?
is it bt , british gas and the banks ?
or is it us and our unreasonable reluctance to switch banks or telecoms provider or gas supplier ?
cheers to profits all that said , there is a very good reason why fat profits from the big banks may actually be a reason to celebrate .
here 's why .
the six biggest uk banks are worth about £ 300bn - equivalent to a fifth of the value of all uk companies listed on the london stock exchange .
what that means is that they represent about a fifth of all british shares held by our pension funds and they pay about a quarter of all dividends injected by british companies into these pension funds .
so when the banks do well , millions of people benefit - in the sense that the pensions that we receive or expect to receive are better underpinned .
to put it more starkly , if the banks made zero profits and paid no dividends , there would be even bigger holes in pension funds than those that yawn today .
now to be clear - i am not an apologist for the banks .
they can be arrogant .
their service can stink .
and they can be negligent in lending too much to the wrong people or to inappropriate businesses .
but it is nonsensical to kick them just because their profits run into billions .
it 's how they earn those billions that matters .

or is it us and our unreasonable reluctance to switch banks or telecoms provider or gas supplier ?
cheers to profits all that said , there is a very good reason why fat profits from the big banks may actually be a reason to celebrate .
here 's why .
the six biggest uk banks are worth about £ 300bn - equivalent to a fifth of the value of all uk companies listed on the london stock exchange .
what that means is that they represent about a fifth of all british shares held by our pension funds and they pay about a quarter of all dividends injected by british companies into these pension funds .
so when the banks do well , millions of people benefit - in the sense that the pensions that we receive or expect to receive are better underpinned .
to put it more starkly , if the banks made zero profits and paid no dividends , there would be even bigger holes in pension funds than those that yawn today .
now to be clear - i am not an apologist for the banks .
they can be arrogant .
their service can stink .
and they can be negligent in lending too much to the wrong people or to inappropriate businesses .
but it is nonsensical to kick them just because their profits run into billions .
it 's how they earn those billions that matters .

analysis by robert peston business editor , bbc news are customers being ripped off by profitable banks ?
the reaction of many of us when we hear about banks ' record profits is to bristle .
memories of queuing an age for the counter or cheques taking days to clear become even more irksome .
and then there 's the thought that if they are making so much money , it must be because we 're being overcharged .
well , this is a fallacy .
rate of return the absolute size of banks ' profits - or that of any company - is irrelevant .
whether a bank makes £ 10bn or £ 10m in a year says nothing about whether it is making too little money or too much money - or about whether we are being overcharged .
what matters is the rate of return that the banks earn and whether there is effective competition in the industry .
the rate of return is the profits generated as a percentage of their capital .
it may sound like a difficult concept , but it is n't .
think about it as the equivalent of what we earn when we put our money in a savings account or into shares .
unreasonable reluctance the rate of return earned by the big british banks does look pretty good compared , for example , with many of the continental european banks .
so does that prove that we 're being ripped off ?
a rainy day for the banks could bring bad news to pension savers well , not necessarily .
the uk banking market is more competitive than those of france , germany , spain or italy .
if uk banks earn a better rate of return than their peers in those countries , it probably means uk banks are more efficient - which is a good thing .
now i am not arguing that competition in the uk is intense enough .
it is now easier than ever for us to switch banks with a minimum of hassle , but surprisingly few of us do this .
the banks take advantage of our inertia - of our reluctance to seek out the keenest deals for banking services .
the same is true in telecoms and gas .
bt and british gas derive huge benefits from the millions of individuals who ca n't be bothered to seek out cheaper providers of their services , or are simply fearful of change .

some 18 % of adults in england binge drink double the daily recommended level in one or more sessions a week .
newcastle had the highest rates of binge drinking , and people in blackpool died earliest from overindulging .
the centre for public health analysed statistics from the past two years for all 354 local authority regions .
the centre , part of liverpool john moores university , broke the figures down after analysing health , crime , mortality and binge drinking statistics from 2004 to 2006 .
copeland , in cumbria , and liverpool had the most alcohol hospital admissions .
experts warned that england had gone from a country " enjoying a harmless tipple " to one developing " a dangerous alcohol addiction " .
in 2004-5 , 217,900 men and 147,000 women were admitted to hospital for alcohol-related conditions .
council areas in the north west and north east dominated the top 10 for both sexes .
liverpool had the worst rate for men - 1,548 per 100,000 - followed by manchester on 1,465 and middlesbrough on 1,435 .
for women , copeland registered 794 , liverpool 785 and halton 772 . "

some 29.2 % of adults in newcastle binge drink , followed by 27.6 % in liverpool and durham .
this compared with just 8.8 % in east dorset , consuming double the recommended daily limit - the equivalent of a large glass of wine for women and a pint-and-a-half of lager for men - in at least one session a week .
read the report most computers will open this document automatically , but you may need adobe reader the city of westminster in london was the worst place for alcohol-related violence in 2005-6 , with 15 violent offences per 1,000 residents due to alcohol .
professor mark bellis , director for the centre for public health , said : " these profiles graphically illustrate the growing costs of cheap alcohol , a night-time economy almost exclusively packed with bars and clubs and a failure to deliver a credible drinking message to both youths and adults .
" we hope that making these statistics widely available will highlight that we are no longer a nation enjoying a harmless tipple but increasingly one developing a dangerous alcohol addiction . "
a department of health spokeswoman said the government was working hard to combat alcohol problems : " we are working hard to raise awareness about alcohol misuse and ensure that treatment is available to those who need it . "
she pointed out that £ 217m a year was spent on alcohol treatment with over 60,000 people being treated by specialist alcohol services .
but steve webb , the liberal democrats ' health spokesman , said : " it is simply unacceptable that such stark health inequalities still exist .
" the government needs to think about more than just containment of the problem , it must deal with the causes . "
and shadow home secretary david davis added : " this alarming research shows why it was wrong of the government to unleash 24-hour drinking on all our towns and cities without a proper assessment of the consequences . "

fans will be encouraged to revive traditional songs instead of " discriminatory chanting " which caused trouble with governing body uefa .
in may , rangers were fined more than £ 13,000 and severely criticised after video evidence was presented at a hearing of fans singing the billy boys .
the club will now play its " long- forgotten " songs over its pa system .
it will also issue lyrics for the traditional songs on match days , beginning with the first home game of the new season on saturday .

" i know if that comes out in the wrong context it wo n't sound too good but like many other rangers supporters you sing that song without actually meaning the words you 're singing , " mr templeton said .
he said fans of dundee or kilmarnock , who sing a version of the billy boys , did not mean it when they sang up to their knees " in arab blood " or " ayr blood " when playing their local rivals .
" at the time you do n't feel guilty because basically you do n't mean it , " he said .
" under the current circumstances with the uefa directive it 's got to work because there 's a serious chance of damaging the name of rangers football club . "

reader of geo-biology dr liane benning is the only scientist from the uk to be involved in the arctic mars analogue svalbard expedition -lrb- amase -rrb- .
the team will be testing equipment on the arctic island of spitsbergen for use on a nasa mission to mars in 2011 .
the remote location is said to have a similar geology to the red planet .
" it is the closest we know from its geology , from its atmosphere and from what we know about its history , which is potentially very similar to what we see on earth today , " said dr benning .
" we do n't know if there 's life on mars , but we are developing technologies to try and go and actually look for it . "
previous expeditions have found signs of a microbial community within the ice on spitsbergen , in svalbard , supporting the theory that life could be sustained on mars , she said .
now the team are hoping to develop techniques to find any signs of carbon or bacteria .
dr benning will be joined by scientists from norway and the us on the expedition .
a nasa astronaut in training will also be on hand to test his space suit and the testing procedures .
one of the main aims is to develop methods that will ensure no contamination from earth when the rovers are sent to mars , said br benning .
further in the future , scientists also hope it will be possible to collect samples from the planet .

ernst ludwig kirchner 's strassenszene , berlin , shows a city street scene , and was one of 11 paintings of his portraying everyday life .
it is " the most significant german expressionist picture ever to come to auction " , christie 's germany said .
nearly 600 of kirchner 's works were destroyed by nazis in the 1930s .
it is not clear exactly how strassenszene , berlin , was taken from its owners , jewish collectors alfred and thekla hess .
" it is believed this was a forced sale which was not planned with the knowledge of the widow thekla hess , " andreas rumbler of christie 's told the reuters news agency .
" money was paid by the collector in 1937 , but we have to assume the widow never saw the money .
we have to assume it was taken by the nazis , " he said .
kirchner was considered a " degenerate " artist by the nazis , he added , but they may have seen the commercial value in selling on his work .
nervous breakdown the artist was a leading member of the bridge , a group of young germans who had been inspired by the art of vincent van gogh and edvard munch , and the philosophy of friedrich nietzsche .
he served briefly as a soldier in world war i but suffered a nervous breakdown in 1915 from which he did not fully recover .
he committed suicide in 1938 at the age of 58 .
his work is the latest valuable piece of nazi-acquired art to be sold on quickly after being returned to owners .
a gustav klimt portrait fetched a reported $ 135m -lrb- £ 71m -rrb- - the most ever paid for a painting - in june , while a picture by austrian expressionist egon schiele was sold for nearly $ 22m -lrb- £ 12m -rrb- the same month .
kirchner 's painting will be sold in new york on 8 november .
