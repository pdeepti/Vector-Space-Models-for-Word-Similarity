" we have been forced to start the operation to lower the pressure in ukraine 's gas pipeline system , " state-controlled gazprom 's spokesman sergei kupriyanov told afp after a deadline expired for kiev to agree to a steep gas price increase as from april . russia and ukraine have been locked in a bitter gas price dispute for months , sparking concerns in european union states that depend heavily on russian energy supplies . " export gas will be delivered in its totality , " kupriyanov continued , referring to deliveries to the rest of europe . " we were ready to come to an agreement with the ukrainian people ...
our offer was rejected , " kupriyanov said . europe dependent around a fifth of europe 's gas supply comes from russia via ukraine and is carried into ukraine by a single main trunk pipeline from russia that then branches off into the country 's pipeline network and european routes further west . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's president yushchenko , left , and officials at a gas sector review ukrainian prime minister yury yekhanurov said last week that if moscow stopped supplying kiev then his country of 48 million people would have the right to take 15 percent of the gas transiting through its territory to western europe . there was no immediate official comment from the ukrainian government after gazprom 's announcement of the pressure reduction . price hike kiev has so far been paying 50 dollars per 1,000 cubic meters -lrb- 35,316 cubic feet -rrb- of natural gas from russia . gazprom , which controls a third of the world 's natural gas reserves , wants $ 230 -lrb- 195 euros -rrb- , arguing that soviet-era tariffs no longer apply and the price needs to be aligned with market rates . kiev has said it can pay more over a transitional period but gazprom said it would shut down ukraine 's gas supply from january 1 unless kiev agreed to the higher price immediately . last-minute diplomatic moves by russian president vladimir putin and ukrainian president viktor yushchenko failed to prevent the stoppage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom headquarters in moscow putin offered to maintain gas supplies at the current price until april but only on condition that a deal be struck by a midnight deadline on new year and that ukraine agree to a more than four-fold price increase thereafter . gazprom said ukraine rejected the deal , though ukrainian officials said late saturday that they were " surprised " by the announcement and that russia had agreed ukraine could pay 50 dollars for the first quarter of 2006 . enough for the winter ? ukraine depends on russia for around a third of its natural gas supplies , importing some 25 billion cubic metres per year , and many ordinary ukrainians have expressed alarm despite official assurances that the country has enough reserves to last the winter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protest over the gas conflict in front of the russian embassy in kiev in a new year 's address , yushchenko called on ukrainians to ensure the country 's " economic independence , " invoking a popular revolt that brought him to power in a presidential election last year against a russian-backed candidate . " a year ago we beat the dictatorship and won a real victory , " yushchenko said .
" today we have to go a step further to ensure together ukraine 's economic independence . " russia maintains the dispute is purely commercial but ukraine , which was once part of the soviet union but has been increasingly at odds with russian authorities over its firmly pro-west orientation , says that it is under political pressure from moscow . eu meets over issue the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , has called a special meeting of its gas coordination group for wednesday to discuss the russia-ukraine row . austria , which took over the eu presidency sunday , as well as france , germany and italy have asked russian and ukrainian energy officials that gas supplies " be maintained to their full extent . " as the row with russia deepened , kiev signed an agreement last week with the central asian state of turkmenistan , which has some of the largest gas reserves in the world , to supply 40 billion cubic meters of gas to ukraine at 50 dollars per 1,000 cubic meters . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putin offers compromise to break russia-ukraine gas deadlock russian president vladimir putin offered saturday to delay a steep price rise in natural gas for ukraine in an 11th-hour bid to resolve a bitter row before moscow cuts gas supplies to the ex-soviet republic .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.01.2006 debate reopens on merging germany 's states großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a merger could save berlin major administrative costs , advocates say a regional social democratic leader has reignited debate about reducing the number of the country ’ s 16 federal states .
the idea is backed by economists , but opposed by policy makers in both east and west . jan bullerjahn , who wants to be elected premier of the eastern state of saxony-anhalt in march , said in an interview on german public radio this week that mergers of several federal states would become inevitable if administrative costs were to be saved and country ’ s eastern regions made more competitive . the timing of saxony anhalt 's social democratic leader announcement is no coincidence . germany ’ s grand coalition government of christian and social democrats has already decided on far-reaching reforms that will reshuffle the powers of the state and the regions .
in a later phase , financial interactions between the two will also be redefined . the purpose of this reform is more transparent power sharing and cost reduction in the face of spiraling public deficits at all levels . way for the east to play catch-up ? jan bullerjahn ’ s proposal to reduce germany ’ s 16 federal states to nine - starting from 2020 at the latest - pursues the same objective . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bullerjahn thinks easterns states such as thuringia stand to profit the regional spd leader is particularly interested in merging the three eastern federal states of saxony-anhalt , saxony and thuringia . apart from saving administrative costs and reducing bureaucracy , he argues , such a fusion would be vital , if the east is to achieve its goal of catching up economically with the more advanced western half of the country . bullerjahn maintains that the eastern german federal states in their present shape can never become economic forces , largely due to their shrinking populations . according to him , his home state of saxony-anhalt will have shed as many as half a million people by 2020 , leaving its overall population at a little over two million . “ by 2020 it will become more than obvious that the eastern federal states will only ever be - at the very best - top of the second league if structural changes are not enacted , " he said . " each federal state will have no more than between two and three and a half million inhabitants each , " he added .
" consequently , they ’ ll never be able to be on a par economically with such populous western federal states as north rhine-westphalia , baden-württemberg and bavaria . ” developing the east 's potential strengths bullerjahn says a depressed east kept alive only by vast annual financial transfers from the west is something nobody should be wishing for . merging some federal states , he believes , would be in the interest of the whole country . “ of course we ’ ll have to do our homework first in the east and create modern administrative structures which reflect the demographic changes in our population , bullerjahn said . reservations about redrawing the map bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen is opposed to mergers state mergers being debated by policymakers right now would not only affect the east .
a merger between the city state of bremen and lower saxony would also be part of the equation . while economic analysts are in favor of such marriages , bremen ’ s mayor is categorically opposed to it .
he fears a loss of regional identity and is convinced that mergers would not reduce debts . in general , people in germany harbor strong reservations about any attempts to redraw the federal map . in 1996 , a planned merger between the city state of berlin and brandenburg was blocked by a referendum .
and most politicians know that another similar referendum would be just as disastrous for the pro-merger lobby in 2006 as it was in the mid-1990s . it appears that people are not ready to significantly downsize germany 's federal system . hardy graupner -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel stresses urgent need for federalism reform german chancellor angela merkel has reiterated hopes that the country ’ s federal system will be speedily tackled without any further delays .

" austria especially wants to use its presidency to bring europe closer to its citizens and increase confidence in the european project , " schüssel said saturday evening in a message to his mostly euroskeptic countrymen published on the internet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria hopes to firm up the eu 's foundations emphasizing " the idea of a shared and diverse continent , " he said : " together , we want to bring new momentum to europe .

in favor of a european tax , schüssel has called for " radical changes " in the way the eu is funded , suggesting member states contribute 3.0 percent of gross domestic product to research funds and has proposed " measures promoting growth and employment .

austria assumed the eu presidency in the second half of 1998 , but suffered six months of humiliating sanctions by the other 14 member states in 2000 , after it welcomed the far-right party of jörg haider into the government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula plassnik enlargement will be another priority for austria which , at a crossroads between east and west , will seek to stabilize the balkans for the sake of the " european peace project , " foreign minister ursula plassnik said . plassnik had to agree to the opening of eu accession talks with turkey - which a majority of austrians oppose - but obtained that talks be also opened with croatia .

" austria especially wants to use its presidency to bring europe closer to its citizens and increase confidence in the european project , " schüssel said saturday evening in a message to his mostly euroskeptic countrymen published on the internet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria hopes to firm up the eu 's foundations emphasizing " the idea of a shared and diverse continent , " he said : " together , we want to bring new momentum to europe . " identity crisis vienna takes over from london an eu in the middle of an identity crisis , even if tony blair reached a last-minute deal on the 2007-2013 budget by giving up part of the british rebate . but the austrian presidency must find an institutional understanding with the european commission and parliament .
in favor of a european tax , schüssel has called for " radical changes " in the way the eu is funded , suggesting member states contribute 3.0 percent of gross domestic product to research funds and has proposed " measures promoting growth and employment . " a sticky subject for the group of 25 this year is what to do with the ratification process for the european constitution , after the french and dutch rejected it in the spring of 2005 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian flag supportive of the constitution , schüssel said saturday evening without adding further details that there was " another way of proceeding .

our offer was rejected , " kupriyanov said . europe dependent around a fifth of europe 's gas supply comes from russia via ukraine and is carried into ukraine by a single main trunk pipeline from russia that then branches off into the country 's pipeline network and european routes further west . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's president yushchenko , left , and officials at a gas sector review ukrainian prime minister yury yekhanurov said last week that if moscow stopped supplying kiev then his country of 48 million people would have the right to take 15 percent of the gas transiting through its territory to western europe . there was no immediate official comment from the ukrainian government after gazprom 's announcement of the pressure reduction . price hike kiev has so far been paying 50 dollars per 1,000 cubic meters -lrb- 35,316 cubic feet -rrb- of natural gas from russia . gazprom , which controls a third of the world 's natural gas reserves , wants $ 230 -lrb- 195 euros -rrb- , arguing that soviet-era tariffs no longer apply and the price needs to be aligned with market rates . kiev has said it can pay more over a transitional period but gazprom said it would shut down ukraine 's gas supply from january 1 unless kiev agreed to the higher price immediately . last-minute diplomatic moves by russian president vladimir putin and ukrainian president viktor yushchenko failed to prevent the stoppage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom headquarters in moscow putin offered to maintain gas supplies at the current price until april but only on condition that a deal be struck by a midnight deadline on new year and that ukraine agree to a more than four-fold price increase thereafter . gazprom said ukraine rejected the deal , though ukrainian officials said late saturday that they were " surprised " by the announcement and that russia had agreed ukraine could pay 50 dollars for the first quarter of 2006 . enough for the winter ? ukraine depends on russia for around a third of its natural gas supplies , importing some 25 billion cubic metres per year , and many ordinary ukrainians have expressed alarm despite official assurances that the country has enough reserves to last the winter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protest over the gas conflict in front of the russian embassy in kiev in a new year 's address , yushchenko called on ukrainians to ensure the country 's " economic independence , " invoking a popular revolt that brought him to power in a presidential election last year against a russian-backed candidate . " a year ago we beat the dictatorship and won a real victory , " yushchenko said .
" today we have to go a step further to ensure together ukraine 's economic independence . " russia maintains the dispute is purely commercial but ukraine , which was once part of the soviet union but has been increasingly at odds with russian authorities over its firmly pro-west orientation , says that it is under political pressure from moscow . eu meets over issue the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , has called a special meeting of its gas coordination group for wednesday to discuss the russia-ukraine row . austria , which took over the eu presidency sunday , as well as france , germany and italy have asked russian and ukrainian energy officials that gas supplies " be maintained to their full extent . " as the row with russia deepened , kiev signed an agreement last week with the central asian state of turkmenistan , which has some of the largest gas reserves in the world , to supply 40 billion cubic meters of gas to ukraine at 50 dollars per 1,000 cubic meters . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putin offers compromise to break russia-ukraine gas deadlock russian president vladimir putin offered saturday to delay a steep price rise in natural gas for ukraine in an 11th-hour bid to resolve a bitter row before moscow cuts gas supplies to the ex-soviet republic .

the idea is backed by economists , but opposed by policy makers in both east and west . jan bullerjahn , who wants to be elected premier of the eastern state of saxony-anhalt in march , said in an interview on german public radio this week that mergers of several federal states would become inevitable if administrative costs were to be saved and country ’ s eastern regions made more competitive . the timing of saxony anhalt 's social democratic leader announcement is no coincidence . germany ’ s grand coalition government of christian and social democrats has already decided on far-reaching reforms that will reshuffle the powers of the state and the regions .

" each federal state will have no more than between two and three and a half million inhabitants each , " he added .
" consequently , they ’ ll never be able to be on a par economically with such populous western federal states as north rhine-westphalia , baden-württemberg and bavaria . ” developing the east 's potential strengths bullerjahn says a depressed east kept alive only by vast annual financial transfers from the west is something nobody should be wishing for . merging some federal states , he believes , would be in the interest of the whole country . “ of course we ’ ll have to do our homework first in the east and create modern administrative structures which reflect the demographic changes in our population , bullerjahn said . reservations about redrawing the map bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen is opposed to mergers state mergers being debated by policymakers right now would not only affect the east .

the idea is backed by economists , but opposed by policy makers in both east and west . jan bullerjahn , who wants to be elected premier of the eastern state of saxony-anhalt in march , said in an interview on german public radio this week that mergers of several federal states would become inevitable if administrative costs were to be saved and country ’ s eastern regions made more competitive . the timing of saxony anhalt 's social democratic leader announcement is no coincidence . germany ’ s grand coalition government of christian and social democrats has already decided on far-reaching reforms that will reshuffle the powers of the state and the regions .
in a later phase , financial interactions between the two will also be redefined . the purpose of this reform is more transparent power sharing and cost reduction in the face of spiraling public deficits at all levels . way for the east to play catch-up ? jan bullerjahn ’ s proposal to reduce germany ’ s 16 federal states to nine - starting from 2020 at the latest - pursues the same objective . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bullerjahn thinks easterns states such as thuringia stand to profit the regional spd leader is particularly interested in merging the three eastern federal states of saxony-anhalt , saxony and thuringia . apart from saving administrative costs and reducing bureaucracy , he argues , such a fusion would be vital , if the east is to achieve its goal of catching up economically with the more advanced western half of the country . bullerjahn maintains that the eastern german federal states in their present shape can never become economic forces , largely due to their shrinking populations . according to him , his home state of saxony-anhalt will have shed as many as half a million people by 2020 , leaving its overall population at a little over two million . “ by 2020 it will become more than obvious that the eastern federal states will only ever be - at the very best - top of the second league if structural changes are not enacted , " he said . " each federal state will have no more than between two and three and a half million inhabitants each , " he added .

" a year ago we beat the dictatorship and won a real victory , " yushchenko said .
" today we have to go a step further to ensure together ukraine 's economic independence . " russia maintains the dispute is purely commercial but ukraine , which was once part of the soviet union but has been increasingly at odds with russian authorities over its firmly pro-west orientation , says that it is under political pressure from moscow . eu meets over issue the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , has called a special meeting of its gas coordination group for wednesday to discuss the russia-ukraine row . austria , which took over the eu presidency sunday , as well as france , germany and italy have asked russian and ukrainian energy officials that gas supplies " be maintained to their full extent . " as the row with russia deepened , kiev signed an agreement last week with the central asian state of turkmenistan , which has some of the largest gas reserves in the world , to supply 40 billion cubic meters of gas to ukraine at 50 dollars per 1,000 cubic meters . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putin offers compromise to break russia-ukraine gas deadlock russian president vladimir putin offered saturday to delay a steep price rise in natural gas for ukraine in an 11th-hour bid to resolve a bitter row before moscow cuts gas supplies to the ex-soviet republic .

" austria especially wants to use its presidency to bring europe closer to its citizens and increase confidence in the european project , " schüssel said saturday evening in a message to his mostly euroskeptic countrymen published on the internet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria hopes to firm up the eu 's foundations emphasizing " the idea of a shared and diverse continent , " he said : " together , we want to bring new momentum to europe . " identity crisis vienna takes over from london an eu in the middle of an identity crisis , even if tony blair reached a last-minute deal on the 2007-2013 budget by giving up part of the british rebate . but the austrian presidency must find an institutional understanding with the european commission and parliament .
in favor of a european tax , schüssel has called for " radical changes " in the way the eu is funded , suggesting member states contribute 3.0 percent of gross domestic product to research funds and has proposed " measures promoting growth and employment . " a sticky subject for the group of 25 this year is what to do with the ratification process for the european constitution , after the french and dutch rejected it in the spring of 2005 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian flag supportive of the constitution , schüssel said saturday evening without adding further details that there was " another way of proceeding . "
french president jacques chirac has also said he will propose institutional initiatives . in an interview with the daily die presse this weekend , the chancellor said he hoped to see " a middle way " on the liberalization of services in europe , while avoiding " social dumping . " he insisted on fighting the brussels bureaucracy and demanded less interventionism by the european court of justice , which should not " quietly erode " the sovereignty of each state . tricky relationship with europe austria is one of the eu states with the most euroskeptic population but its economy benefits the most from enlargement which saw 10 mostly central european countries join the bloc in 2004 . its relationship with the eu , since joining in 1995 , has seen ups and downs .
austria assumed the eu presidency in the second half of 1998 , but suffered six months of humiliating sanctions by the other 14 member states in 2000 , after it welcomed the far-right party of jörg haider into the government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula plassnik enlargement will be another priority for austria which , at a crossroads between east and west , will seek to stabilize the balkans for the sake of the " european peace project , " foreign minister ursula plassnik said . plassnik had to agree to the opening of eu accession talks with turkey - which a majority of austrians oppose - but obtained that talks be also opened with croatia .
vienna will also guide the entrance into the union of bulgaria and romania , set for 2007 . austria will host a major summit between europe and latin america in may and may host a us-eu summit with president george w. bush . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de british eu presidency tenure fails to impress as britain 's six-month rotation as european union president draws to a close , observers look back on the past half year , which was marked by a series of attempts to reform the eu .

the idea is backed by economists , but opposed by policy makers in both east and west . jan bullerjahn , who wants to be elected premier of the eastern state of saxony-anhalt in march , said in an interview on german public radio this week that mergers of several federal states would become inevitable if administrative costs were to be saved and country ’ s eastern regions made more competitive . the timing of saxony anhalt 's social democratic leader announcement is no coincidence . germany ’ s grand coalition government of christian and social democrats has already decided on far-reaching reforms that will reshuffle the powers of the state and the regions .
in a later phase , financial interactions between the two will also be redefined . the purpose of this reform is more transparent power sharing and cost reduction in the face of spiraling public deficits at all levels . way for the east to play catch-up ? jan bullerjahn ’ s proposal to reduce germany ’ s 16 federal states to nine - starting from 2020 at the latest - pursues the same objective . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bullerjahn thinks easterns states such as thuringia stand to profit the regional spd leader is particularly interested in merging the three eastern federal states of saxony-anhalt , saxony and thuringia . apart from saving administrative costs and reducing bureaucracy , he argues , such a fusion would be vital , if the east is to achieve its goal of catching up economically with the more advanced western half of the country . bullerjahn maintains that the eastern german federal states in their present shape can never become economic forces , largely due to their shrinking populations . according to him , his home state of saxony-anhalt will have shed as many as half a million people by 2020 , leaving its overall population at a little over two million . “ by 2020 it will become more than obvious that the eastern federal states will only ever be - at the very best - top of the second league if structural changes are not enacted , " he said . " each federal state will have no more than between two and three and a half million inhabitants each , " he added .
" consequently , they ’ ll never be able to be on a par economically with such populous western federal states as north rhine-westphalia , baden-württemberg and bavaria . ” developing the east 's potential strengths bullerjahn says a depressed east kept alive only by vast annual financial transfers from the west is something nobody should be wishing for . merging some federal states , he believes , would be in the interest of the whole country . “ of course we ’ ll have to do our homework first in the east and create modern administrative structures which reflect the demographic changes in our population , bullerjahn said . reservations about redrawing the map bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen is opposed to mergers state mergers being debated by policymakers right now would not only affect the east .
a merger between the city state of bremen and lower saxony would also be part of the equation . while economic analysts are in favor of such marriages , bremen ’ s mayor is categorically opposed to it .
he fears a loss of regional identity and is convinced that mergers would not reduce debts . in general , people in germany harbor strong reservations about any attempts to redraw the federal map . in 1996 , a planned merger between the city state of berlin and brandenburg was blocked by a referendum .

the idea is backed by economists , but opposed by policy makers in both east and west . jan bullerjahn , who wants to be elected premier of the eastern state of saxony-anhalt in march , said in an interview on german public radio this week that mergers of several federal states would become inevitable if administrative costs were to be saved and country ’ s eastern regions made more competitive . the timing of saxony anhalt 's social democratic leader announcement is no coincidence . germany ’ s grand coalition government of christian and social democrats has already decided on far-reaching reforms that will reshuffle the powers of the state and the regions .
in a later phase , financial interactions between the two will also be redefined . the purpose of this reform is more transparent power sharing and cost reduction in the face of spiraling public deficits at all levels . way for the east to play catch-up ? jan bullerjahn ’ s proposal to reduce germany ’ s 16 federal states to nine - starting from 2020 at the latest - pursues the same objective . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bullerjahn thinks easterns states such as thuringia stand to profit the regional spd leader is particularly interested in merging the three eastern federal states of saxony-anhalt , saxony and thuringia . apart from saving administrative costs and reducing bureaucracy , he argues , such a fusion would be vital , if the east is to achieve its goal of catching up economically with the more advanced western half of the country . bullerjahn maintains that the eastern german federal states in their present shape can never become economic forces , largely due to their shrinking populations . according to him , his home state of saxony-anhalt will have shed as many as half a million people by 2020 , leaving its overall population at a little over two million . “ by 2020 it will become more than obvious that the eastern federal states will only ever be - at the very best - top of the second league if structural changes are not enacted , " he said . " each federal state will have no more than between two and three and a half million inhabitants each , " he added .
" consequently , they ’ ll never be able to be on a par economically with such populous western federal states as north rhine-westphalia , baden-württemberg and bavaria . ” developing the east 's potential strengths bullerjahn says a depressed east kept alive only by vast annual financial transfers from the west is something nobody should be wishing for . merging some federal states , he believes , would be in the interest of the whole country . “ of course we ’ ll have to do our homework first in the east and create modern administrative structures which reflect the demographic changes in our population , bullerjahn said . reservations about redrawing the map bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen is opposed to mergers state mergers being debated by policymakers right now would not only affect the east .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 01.01.2006 new eu president austria wants " momentum " for europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian chancellor schüssel and angela merkel toast the new year austria sunday began on a musical note its six-month presidency of the european union , to which it wants to provide a " vitamin boost " by trying to reopen the debate on the constitution and growth . after a terrible year for europe in 2005 , austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel , whose country takes over from britain , started the year in harmony , attending the famous new year 's concert in vienna in the company of his german counterpart angela merkel , a fellow christian democrat . aside from the traditional strauss waltzes , the program featured pieces by wolfgang amadeus mozart , whose 250th birthday this year will be another cause for celebrations in austria . " austria especially wants to use its presidency to bring europe closer to its citizens and increase confidence in the european project , " schüssel said saturday evening in a message to his mostly euroskeptic countrymen published on the internet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria hopes to firm up the eu 's foundations emphasizing " the idea of a shared and diverse continent , " he said : " together , we want to bring new momentum to europe . " identity crisis vienna takes over from london an eu in the middle of an identity crisis , even if tony blair reached a last-minute deal on the 2007-2013 budget by giving up part of the british rebate . but the austrian presidency must find an institutional understanding with the european commission and parliament .
in favor of a european tax , schüssel has called for " radical changes " in the way the eu is funded , suggesting member states contribute 3.0 percent of gross domestic product to research funds and has proposed " measures promoting growth and employment . " a sticky subject for the group of 25 this year is what to do with the ratification process for the european constitution , after the french and dutch rejected it in the spring of 2005 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian flag supportive of the constitution , schüssel said saturday evening without adding further details that there was " another way of proceeding . "

austria assumed the eu presidency in the second half of 1998 , but suffered six months of humiliating sanctions by the other 14 member states in 2000 , after it welcomed the far-right party of jörg haider into the government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula plassnik enlargement will be another priority for austria which , at a crossroads between east and west , will seek to stabilize the balkans for the sake of the " european peace project , " foreign minister ursula plassnik said . plassnik had to agree to the opening of eu accession talks with turkey - which a majority of austrians oppose - but obtained that talks be also opened with croatia .
vienna will also guide the entrance into the union of bulgaria and romania , set for 2007 . austria will host a major summit between europe and latin america in may and may host a us-eu summit with president george w. bush . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de british eu presidency tenure fails to impress as britain 's six-month rotation as european union president draws to a close , observers look back on the past half year , which was marked by a series of attempts to reform the eu .

" austria especially wants to use its presidency to bring europe closer to its citizens and increase confidence in the european project , " schüssel said saturday evening in a message to his mostly euroskeptic countrymen published on the internet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria hopes to firm up the eu 's foundations emphasizing " the idea of a shared and diverse continent , " he said : " together , we want to bring new momentum to europe . " identity crisis vienna takes over from london an eu in the middle of an identity crisis , even if tony blair reached a last-minute deal on the 2007-2013 budget by giving up part of the british rebate . but the austrian presidency must find an institutional understanding with the european commission and parliament .
in favor of a european tax , schüssel has called for " radical changes " in the way the eu is funded , suggesting member states contribute 3.0 percent of gross domestic product to research funds and has proposed " measures promoting growth and employment . " a sticky subject for the group of 25 this year is what to do with the ratification process for the european constitution , after the french and dutch rejected it in the spring of 2005 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian flag supportive of the constitution , schüssel said saturday evening without adding further details that there was " another way of proceeding . "
french president jacques chirac has also said he will propose institutional initiatives . in an interview with the daily die presse this weekend , the chancellor said he hoped to see " a middle way " on the liberalization of services in europe , while avoiding " social dumping . " he insisted on fighting the brussels bureaucracy and demanded less interventionism by the european court of justice , which should not " quietly erode " the sovereignty of each state . tricky relationship with europe austria is one of the eu states with the most euroskeptic population but its economy benefits the most from enlargement which saw 10 mostly central european countries join the bloc in 2004 . its relationship with the eu , since joining in 1995 , has seen ups and downs .
austria assumed the eu presidency in the second half of 1998 , but suffered six months of humiliating sanctions by the other 14 member states in 2000 , after it welcomed the far-right party of jörg haider into the government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula plassnik enlargement will be another priority for austria which , at a crossroads between east and west , will seek to stabilize the balkans for the sake of the " european peace project , " foreign minister ursula plassnik said . plassnik had to agree to the opening of eu accession talks with turkey - which a majority of austrians oppose - but obtained that talks be also opened with croatia .
vienna will also guide the entrance into the union of bulgaria and romania , set for 2007 . austria will host a major summit between europe and latin america in may and may host a us-eu summit with president george w. bush . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de british eu presidency tenure fails to impress as britain 's six-month rotation as european union president draws to a close , observers look back on the past half year , which was marked by a series of attempts to reform the eu .

the idea is backed by economists , but opposed by policy makers in both east and west . jan bullerjahn , who wants to be elected premier of the eastern state of saxony-anhalt in march , said in an interview on german public radio this week that mergers of several federal states would become inevitable if administrative costs were to be saved and country ’ s eastern regions made more competitive . the timing of saxony anhalt 's social democratic leader announcement is no coincidence . germany ’ s grand coalition government of christian and social democrats has already decided on far-reaching reforms that will reshuffle the powers of the state and the regions .
in a later phase , financial interactions between the two will also be redefined . the purpose of this reform is more transparent power sharing and cost reduction in the face of spiraling public deficits at all levels . way for the east to play catch-up ? jan bullerjahn ’ s proposal to reduce germany ’ s 16 federal states to nine - starting from 2020 at the latest - pursues the same objective . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bullerjahn thinks easterns states such as thuringia stand to profit the regional spd leader is particularly interested in merging the three eastern federal states of saxony-anhalt , saxony and thuringia . apart from saving administrative costs and reducing bureaucracy , he argues , such a fusion would be vital , if the east is to achieve its goal of catching up economically with the more advanced western half of the country . bullerjahn maintains that the eastern german federal states in their present shape can never become economic forces , largely due to their shrinking populations . according to him , his home state of saxony-anhalt will have shed as many as half a million people by 2020 , leaving its overall population at a little over two million . “ by 2020 it will become more than obvious that the eastern federal states will only ever be - at the very best - top of the second league if structural changes are not enacted , " he said . " each federal state will have no more than between two and three and a half million inhabitants each , " he added .
" consequently , they ’ ll never be able to be on a par economically with such populous western federal states as north rhine-westphalia , baden-württemberg and bavaria . ” developing the east 's potential strengths bullerjahn says a depressed east kept alive only by vast annual financial transfers from the west is something nobody should be wishing for . merging some federal states , he believes , would be in the interest of the whole country . “ of course we ’ ll have to do our homework first in the east and create modern administrative structures which reflect the demographic changes in our population , bullerjahn said . reservations about redrawing the map bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen is opposed to mergers state mergers being debated by policymakers right now would not only affect the east .

he fears a loss of regional identity and is convinced that mergers would not reduce debts . in general , people in germany harbor strong reservations about any attempts to redraw the federal map . in 1996 , a planned merger between the city state of berlin and brandenburg was blocked by a referendum .

the idea is backed by economists , but opposed by policy makers in both east and west . jan bullerjahn , who wants to be elected premier of the eastern state of saxony-anhalt in march , said in an interview on german public radio this week that mergers of several federal states would become inevitable if administrative costs were to be saved and country ’ s eastern regions made more competitive . the timing of saxony anhalt 's social democratic leader announcement is no coincidence . germany ’ s grand coalition government of christian and social democrats has already decided on far-reaching reforms that will reshuffle the powers of the state and the regions .
in a later phase , financial interactions between the two will also be redefined . the purpose of this reform is more transparent power sharing and cost reduction in the face of spiraling public deficits at all levels . way for the east to play catch-up ? jan bullerjahn ’ s proposal to reduce germany ’ s 16 federal states to nine - starting from 2020 at the latest - pursues the same objective . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bullerjahn thinks easterns states such as thuringia stand to profit the regional spd leader is particularly interested in merging the three eastern federal states of saxony-anhalt , saxony and thuringia . apart from saving administrative costs and reducing bureaucracy , he argues , such a fusion would be vital , if the east is to achieve its goal of catching up economically with the more advanced western half of the country . bullerjahn maintains that the eastern german federal states in their present shape can never become economic forces , largely due to their shrinking populations . according to him , his home state of saxony-anhalt will have shed as many as half a million people by 2020 , leaving its overall population at a little over two million . “ by 2020 it will become more than obvious that the eastern federal states will only ever be - at the very best - top of the second league if structural changes are not enacted , " he said . " each federal state will have no more than between two and three and a half million inhabitants each , " he added .
" consequently , they ’ ll never be able to be on a par economically with such populous western federal states as north rhine-westphalia , baden-württemberg and bavaria . ” developing the east 's potential strengths bullerjahn says a depressed east kept alive only by vast annual financial transfers from the west is something nobody should be wishing for . merging some federal states , he believes , would be in the interest of the whole country . “ of course we ’ ll have to do our homework first in the east and create modern administrative structures which reflect the demographic changes in our population , bullerjahn said . reservations about redrawing the map bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen is opposed to mergers state mergers being debated by policymakers right now would not only affect the east .
a merger between the city state of bremen and lower saxony would also be part of the equation . while economic analysts are in favor of such marriages , bremen ’ s mayor is categorically opposed to it .
he fears a loss of regional identity and is convinced that mergers would not reduce debts . in general , people in germany harbor strong reservations about any attempts to redraw the federal map . in 1996 , a planned merger between the city state of berlin and brandenburg was blocked by a referendum .
and most politicians know that another similar referendum would be just as disastrous for the pro-merger lobby in 2006 as it was in the mid-1990s . it appears that people are not ready to significantly downsize germany 's federal system . hardy graupner -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel stresses urgent need for federalism reform german chancellor angela merkel has reiterated hopes that the country ’ s federal system will be speedily tackled without any further delays .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schrempp 's replacement , dieter zetsche speculation raged in the press after schrempp made the announcement he would step down , especially since he is leaving three years before his contract expires .

at the beginnig of his tenure , schrempp announced shareholder value was a key prinicpal , but failed to significantly raise share prices , which have plodding along between 30 and 35 euros since the daimlerchrysler merger .
the low-key schrempp is being replaced by charismatic manager dieter zetsche .

analysts say he is well equipped to bring new life to the company and its key mercedes unit .
he managed to cut 26,000 jobs and close down six factories while remaining highly respected by unions and workers . zetsche has said he plans to increase cooperation between the german and american parts of the company in order to cut costs . sabrina fritz -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mercedes announces massive job cuts daimlerchrysler announced that one out of nine jobs would be cut from the workforce at its german mercedes unit in an effort to reduce costs .

" austria especially wants to use its presidency to bring europe closer to its citizens and increase confidence in the european project , " schüssel said saturday evening in a message to his mostly euroskeptic countrymen published on the internet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria hopes to firm up the eu 's foundations emphasizing " the idea of a shared and diverse continent , " he said : " together , we want to bring new momentum to europe . " identity crisis vienna takes over from london an eu in the middle of an identity crisis , even if tony blair reached a last-minute deal on the 2007-2013 budget by giving up part of the british rebate . but the austrian presidency must find an institutional understanding with the european commission and parliament .
in favor of a european tax , schüssel has called for " radical changes " in the way the eu is funded , suggesting member states contribute 3.0 percent of gross domestic product to research funds and has proposed " measures promoting growth and employment . " a sticky subject for the group of 25 this year is what to do with the ratification process for the european constitution , after the french and dutch rejected it in the spring of 2005 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian flag supportive of the constitution , schüssel said saturday evening without adding further details that there was " another way of proceeding .

" we have been forced to start the operation to lower the pressure in ukraine 's gas pipeline system , " state-controlled gazprom 's spokesman sergei kupriyanov told afp after a deadline expired for kiev to agree to a steep gas price increase as from april . russia and ukraine have been locked in a bitter gas price dispute for months , sparking concerns in european union states that depend heavily on russian energy supplies .

" a year ago we beat the dictatorship and won a real victory , " yushchenko said .
" today we have to go a step further to ensure together ukraine 's economic independence .

" as the row with russia deepened , kiev signed an agreement last week with the central asian state of turkmenistan , which has some of the largest gas reserves in the world , to supply 40 billion cubic meters of gas to ukraine at 50 dollars per 1,000 cubic meters . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putin offers compromise to break russia-ukraine gas deadlock russian president vladimir putin offered saturday to delay a steep price rise in natural gas for ukraine in an 11th-hour bid to resolve a bitter row before moscow cuts gas supplies to the ex-soviet republic .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.01.2006 debate reopens on merging germany 's states großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a merger could save berlin major administrative costs , advocates say a regional social democratic leader has reignited debate about reducing the number of the country ’ s 16 federal states .
the idea is backed by economists , but opposed by policy makers in both east and west . jan bullerjahn , who wants to be elected premier of the eastern state of saxony-anhalt in march , said in an interview on german public radio this week that mergers of several federal states would become inevitable if administrative costs were to be saved and country ’ s eastern regions made more competitive . the timing of saxony anhalt 's social democratic leader announcement is no coincidence . germany ’ s grand coalition government of christian and social democrats has already decided on far-reaching reforms that will reshuffle the powers of the state and the regions .
in a later phase , financial interactions between the two will also be redefined . the purpose of this reform is more transparent power sharing and cost reduction in the face of spiraling public deficits at all levels . way for the east to play catch-up ? jan bullerjahn ’ s proposal to reduce germany ’ s 16 federal states to nine - starting from 2020 at the latest - pursues the same objective . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bullerjahn thinks easterns states such as thuringia stand to profit the regional spd leader is particularly interested in merging the three eastern federal states of saxony-anhalt , saxony and thuringia . apart from saving administrative costs and reducing bureaucracy , he argues , such a fusion would be vital , if the east is to achieve its goal of catching up economically with the more advanced western half of the country . bullerjahn maintains that the eastern german federal states in their present shape can never become economic forces , largely due to their shrinking populations . according to him , his home state of saxony-anhalt will have shed as many as half a million people by 2020 , leaving its overall population at a little over two million . “ by 2020 it will become more than obvious that the eastern federal states will only ever be - at the very best - top of the second league if structural changes are not enacted , " he said . " each federal state will have no more than between two and three and a half million inhabitants each , " he added .
" consequently , they ’ ll never be able to be on a par economically with such populous western federal states as north rhine-westphalia , baden-württemberg and bavaria . ” developing the east 's potential strengths bullerjahn says a depressed east kept alive only by vast annual financial transfers from the west is something nobody should be wishing for . merging some federal states , he believes , would be in the interest of the whole country . “ of course we ’ ll have to do our homework first in the east and create modern administrative structures which reflect the demographic changes in our population , bullerjahn said . reservations about redrawing the map bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen is opposed to mergers state mergers being debated by policymakers right now would not only affect the east .
a merger between the city state of bremen and lower saxony would also be part of the equation . while economic analysts are in favor of such marriages , bremen ’ s mayor is categorically opposed to it .
he fears a loss of regional identity and is convinced that mergers would not reduce debts . in general , people in germany harbor strong reservations about any attempts to redraw the federal map . in 1996 , a planned merger between the city state of berlin and brandenburg was blocked by a referendum .
and most politicians know that another similar referendum would be just as disastrous for the pro-merger lobby in 2006 as it was in the mid-1990s . it appears that people are not ready to significantly downsize germany 's federal system . hardy graupner -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel stresses urgent need for federalism reform german chancellor angela merkel has reiterated hopes that the country ’ s federal system will be speedily tackled without any further delays .

the idea is backed by economists , but opposed by policy makers in both east and west . jan bullerjahn , who wants to be elected premier of the eastern state of saxony-anhalt in march , said in an interview on german public radio this week that mergers of several federal states would become inevitable if administrative costs were to be saved and country ’ s eastern regions made more competitive . the timing of saxony anhalt 's social democratic leader announcement is no coincidence . germany ’ s grand coalition government of christian and social democrats has already decided on far-reaching reforms that will reshuffle the powers of the state and the regions .
in a later phase , financial interactions between the two will also be redefined . the purpose of this reform is more transparent power sharing and cost reduction in the face of spiraling public deficits at all levels . way for the east to play catch-up ? jan bullerjahn ’ s proposal to reduce germany ’ s 16 federal states to nine - starting from 2020 at the latest - pursues the same objective . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bullerjahn thinks easterns states such as thuringia stand to profit the regional spd leader is particularly interested in merging the three eastern federal states of saxony-anhalt , saxony and thuringia . apart from saving administrative costs and reducing bureaucracy , he argues , such a fusion would be vital , if the east is to achieve its goal of catching up economically with the more advanced western half of the country . bullerjahn maintains that the eastern german federal states in their present shape can never become economic forces , largely due to their shrinking populations . according to him , his home state of saxony-anhalt will have shed as many as half a million people by 2020 , leaving its overall population at a little over two million . “ by 2020 it will become more than obvious that the eastern federal states will only ever be - at the very best - top of the second league if structural changes are not enacted , " he said . " each federal state will have no more than between two and three and a half million inhabitants each , " he added .
" consequently , they ’ ll never be able to be on a par economically with such populous western federal states as north rhine-westphalia , baden-württemberg and bavaria . ” developing the east 's potential strengths bullerjahn says a depressed east kept alive only by vast annual financial transfers from the west is something nobody should be wishing for . merging some federal states , he believes , would be in the interest of the whole country . “ of course we ’ ll have to do our homework first in the east and create modern administrative structures which reflect the demographic changes in our population , bullerjahn said . reservations about redrawing the map bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen is opposed to mergers state mergers being debated by policymakers right now would not only affect the east .
a merger between the city state of bremen and lower saxony would also be part of the equation . while economic analysts are in favor of such marriages , bremen ’ s mayor is categorically opposed to it .
he fears a loss of regional identity and is convinced that mergers would not reduce debts . in general , people in germany harbor strong reservations about any attempts to redraw the federal map . in 1996 , a planned merger between the city state of berlin and brandenburg was blocked by a referendum .

" austria especially wants to use its presidency to bring europe closer to its citizens and increase confidence in the european project , " schüssel said saturday evening in a message to his mostly euroskeptic countrymen published on the internet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria hopes to firm up the eu 's foundations emphasizing " the idea of a shared and diverse continent , " he said : " together , we want to bring new momentum to europe . " identity crisis vienna takes over from london an eu in the middle of an identity crisis , even if tony blair reached a last-minute deal on the 2007-2013 budget by giving up part of the british rebate . but the austrian presidency must find an institutional understanding with the european commission and parliament .
in favor of a european tax , schüssel has called for " radical changes " in the way the eu is funded , suggesting member states contribute 3.0 percent of gross domestic product to research funds and has proposed " measures promoting growth and employment . " a sticky subject for the group of 25 this year is what to do with the ratification process for the european constitution , after the french and dutch rejected it in the spring of 2005 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian flag supportive of the constitution , schüssel said saturday evening without adding further details that there was " another way of proceeding . "
french president jacques chirac has also said he will propose institutional initiatives . in an interview with the daily die presse this weekend , the chancellor said he hoped to see " a middle way " on the liberalization of services in europe , while avoiding " social dumping . " he insisted on fighting the brussels bureaucracy and demanded less interventionism by the european court of justice , which should not " quietly erode " the sovereignty of each state . tricky relationship with europe austria is one of the eu states with the most euroskeptic population but its economy benefits the most from enlargement which saw 10 mostly central european countries join the bloc in 2004 . its relationship with the eu , since joining in 1995 , has seen ups and downs .
austria assumed the eu presidency in the second half of 1998 , but suffered six months of humiliating sanctions by the other 14 member states in 2000 , after it welcomed the far-right party of jörg haider into the government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula plassnik enlargement will be another priority for austria which , at a crossroads between east and west , will seek to stabilize the balkans for the sake of the " european peace project , " foreign minister ursula plassnik said . plassnik had to agree to the opening of eu accession talks with turkey - which a majority of austrians oppose - but obtained that talks be also opened with croatia .
vienna will also guide the entrance into the union of bulgaria and romania , set for 2007 . austria will host a major summit between europe and latin america in may and may host a us-eu summit with president george w. bush . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de british eu presidency tenure fails to impress as britain 's six-month rotation as european union president draws to a close , observers look back on the past half year , which was marked by a series of attempts to reform the eu .

" we have been forced to start the operation to lower the pressure in ukraine 's gas pipeline system , " state-controlled gazprom 's spokesman sergei kupriyanov told afp after a deadline expired for kiev to agree to a steep gas price increase as from april . russia and ukraine have been locked in a bitter gas price dispute for months , sparking concerns in european union states that depend heavily on russian energy supplies . " export gas will be delivered in its totality , " kupriyanov continued , referring to deliveries to the rest of europe . " we were ready to come to an agreement with the ukrainian people ...
our offer was rejected , " kupriyanov said . europe dependent around a fifth of europe 's gas supply comes from russia via ukraine and is carried into ukraine by a single main trunk pipeline from russia that then branches off into the country 's pipeline network and european routes further west . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's president yushchenko , left , and officials at a gas sector review ukrainian prime minister yury yekhanurov said last week that if moscow stopped supplying kiev then his country of 48 million people would have the right to take 15 percent of the gas transiting through its territory to western europe . there was no immediate official comment from the ukrainian government after gazprom 's announcement of the pressure reduction . price hike kiev has so far been paying 50 dollars per 1,000 cubic meters -lrb- 35,316 cubic feet -rrb- of natural gas from russia . gazprom , which controls a third of the world 's natural gas reserves , wants $ 230 -lrb- 195 euros -rrb- , arguing that soviet-era tariffs no longer apply and the price needs to be aligned with market rates . kiev has said it can pay more over a transitional period but gazprom said it would shut down ukraine 's gas supply from january 1 unless kiev agreed to the higher price immediately . last-minute diplomatic moves by russian president vladimir putin and ukrainian president viktor yushchenko failed to prevent the stoppage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom headquarters in moscow putin offered to maintain gas supplies at the current price until april but only on condition that a deal be struck by a midnight deadline on new year and that ukraine agree to a more than four-fold price increase thereafter . gazprom said ukraine rejected the deal , though ukrainian officials said late saturday that they were " surprised " by the announcement and that russia had agreed ukraine could pay 50 dollars for the first quarter of 2006 . enough for the winter ? ukraine depends on russia for around a third of its natural gas supplies , importing some 25 billion cubic metres per year , and many ordinary ukrainians have expressed alarm despite official assurances that the country has enough reserves to last the winter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protest over the gas conflict in front of the russian embassy in kiev in a new year 's address , yushchenko called on ukrainians to ensure the country 's " economic independence , " invoking a popular revolt that brought him to power in a presidential election last year against a russian-backed candidate . " a year ago we beat the dictatorship and won a real victory , " yushchenko said .
" today we have to go a step further to ensure together ukraine 's economic independence . " russia maintains the dispute is purely commercial but ukraine , which was once part of the soviet union but has been increasingly at odds with russian authorities over its firmly pro-west orientation , says that it is under political pressure from moscow . eu meets over issue the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , has called a special meeting of its gas coordination group for wednesday to discuss the russia-ukraine row . austria , which took over the eu presidency sunday , as well as france , germany and italy have asked russian and ukrainian energy officials that gas supplies " be maintained to their full extent . " as the row with russia deepened , kiev signed an agreement last week with the central asian state of turkmenistan , which has some of the largest gas reserves in the world , to supply 40 billion cubic meters of gas to ukraine at 50 dollars per 1,000 cubic meters . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putin offers compromise to break russia-ukraine gas deadlock russian president vladimir putin offered saturday to delay a steep price rise in natural gas for ukraine in an 11th-hour bid to resolve a bitter row before moscow cuts gas supplies to the ex-soviet republic .

of the 275 stations , up to 37 stations closed due to a lack of staff and northern line services were delayed , transport for london -lrb- tfl -rrb- said .
rail maritime and transport -lrb- rmt -rrb- union members were protesting at new rotas .
up to 200,000 people saw in the new year in central london , police said .
the strike continues until noon .
british transport police said the evening had passed " very well indeed " with no reports of overcrowding .
the dispute involves station staff , not train drivers , so most lines were running without delays , but some trains were unable to make their usual stops because of closed stations .
we are calling upon london to really get off its backside and come and make this event a really superb success dan kirkby , new year parade organiser most of the stations that closed were outside the central area , and other stations further out and above ground were left unstaffed with their ticket barriers open .
zone one stations affected by the strike included covent garden , which was closed , and king 's cross where victoria , piccadilly and northern lines were not stopping .
extra buses helped ferry people home after the festivities in central london , which included a 10-minute firework display on the thames and celebrations in trafalgar and parliament squares .
safety fears the strike , scheduled to end at noon on new year 's day , is also expected to affect london 's new year parade , due to start at noon .
one of the organisers , dan kirkby , urged people to come in despite the strike : " we are calling upon london to really get off its backside and come and make this event a really superb success , which it deserves to be . "
the dispute centres around a rota linked to the introduction of a new 35-hour week for tube workers .
the rmt said that when it agreed to make the change it had not been shown new work patterns , which it believes will compromise safety for staff and travellers .
more strikes planned rmt leader bob crow told the bbc he had offered to suspend the strike , in return for lu suspending the new rotas , but lu had refused .
he added : " we 've had to try and put maximum pressure on london underground to concentrate their minds .
" and if new year 's eve wo n't concentrate their minds we 're going to have to look in the new year to stepping up the action . "
the rmt plans more strikes later this month .

and in an advert in the sunday telegraph , he said : " the world is changing ... so are we . "
he called the chancellor " extreme " , " awful " and a " creature of the past " , in an interview with the sunday times .
labour party officials have dismissed the comments , saying what counts in the long run is policy substance , not presentation .
' transformation ' the flurry of articles follows mr cameron 's new year 's message on saturday , in which he said it was an exciting time to be a tory .
in the sunday telegraph advert , he seemed to signal an intention to dump the tories ' " patients ' passport " health policy , saying of the nhs : " we want to improve it for everyone , not help a few to opt out . "
" i find -lsb- him -rsb- awful because it 's just like listening to a speak-your-weight machine on propaganda " david cameron there was no commitment to tax cuts , but instead a pledge to develop policies that " help the least well-off in society , not the rich " .
in an article for the mail on sunday , mr cameron promised " a year of transformation " for the tories in 2006 , taking them towards his vision of " a modern , compassionate conservative party " .
he said the next election would see a new generation of voters born after margaret thatcher 's departure from power , and insisted he would not be " the prisoner of an ideological past " .
in the sunday times interview , mr cameron refused to rule out tax rises if times were tough .
he has previously promised to " share the proceeds of growth " under a future tory government between tax cuts and increased investment in public services .
however , he has now made it clear that this did not amount to a promise to make tax cuts every year .
bbc political reporter mike sergeant said it was " not the kind of language you 'd have heard from previous tory leaders " .
" for the first time mr cameron talks of the need to stand up to big business - his party 's traditional ally , " he added .
' personal abuse ' mr cameron 's personal attack on the chancellor came despite his promise to move away from " punch and judy-style " confrontational politics .
in the newspaper interview he said : " gordon brown is the old-style thump-thump-thump and i think that 's exactly what turns people off .
" i find -lsb- him -rsb- awful because it 's just like listening to a speak-your-weight machine on propaganda . "
" david cameron 's new style of politics seems to have lasted less than a month " harriet harman labour mp mr cameron , 39 , who entered parliament in 2001 and has never held office , went on to describe the 54-year-old chancellor as " very much a 1980s politician " and " a creature of the past " .
he also expressed a wish to face mr brown , who is widely considered to be the prime minister 's likely successor , calling on the pm to " get on " and quit .
" this is going to be the choice people are going to make between a rather old-style 1980s approach to politics ... and a new approach i have , " said the conservative leader .
" it would be good for the country , now blair has said he 's going , that he got on and left . "
labour mp harriet harman , an ally of the chancellor , told the sunday times : " david cameron 's new style of politics seems to have lasted less than a month .
" he has woken the tories from their slumber only to walk them up a blind alley of shallow personal abuse . "

he called the chancellor " extreme " , " awful " and a " creature of the past " , in an interview with the sunday times .
labour party officials have dismissed the comments , saying what counts in the long run is policy substance , not presentation .
' transformation ' the flurry of articles follows mr cameron 's new year 's message on saturday , in which he said it was an exciting time to be a tory .
in the sunday telegraph advert , he seemed to signal an intention to dump the tories ' " patients ' passport " health policy , saying of the nhs : " we want to improve it for everyone , not help a few to opt out . "
i find -lsb- him -rsb- awful because it 's just like listening to a speak-your-weight machine on propaganda david cameron there was no commitment to tax cuts , but instead a pledge to develop policies that " help the least well-off in society , not the rich " .
in an article for the mail on sunday , mr cameron promised " a year of transformation " for the tories in 2006 , taking them towards his vision of " a modern , compassionate conservative party " .
he said the next election would see a new generation of voters born after margaret thatcher 's departure from power , and insisted he would not be " the prisoner of an ideological past " .
in the sunday times interview , mr cameron refused to rule out tax rises if times were tough .
he has previously promised to " share the proceeds of growth " under a future tory government between tax cuts and increased investment in public services .
however , he has now made it clear that this did not amount to a promise to make tax cuts every year .
bbc political reporter mike sergeant said it was " not the kind of language you 'd have heard from previous tory leaders " .
" for the first time mr cameron talks of the need to stand up to big business - his party 's traditional ally , " he added .
' personal abuse ' mr cameron 's personal attack on the chancellor came despite his promise to move away from " punch and judy-style " confrontational politics .
in the newspaper interview he said : " gordon brown is the old-style thump-thump-thump and i think that 's exactly what turns people off .
" i find -lsb- him -rsb- awful because it 's just like listening to a speak-your-weight machine on propaganda . "
david cameron 's new style of politics seems to have lasted less than a month harriet harman labour mp mr cameron , 39 , who entered parliament in 2001 and has never held office , went on to describe the 54-year-old chancellor as " very much a 1980s politician " and " a creature of the past " .
he also expressed a wish to face mr brown , who is widely considered to be the prime minister 's likely successor , calling on the pm to " get on " and quit .
" this is going to be the choice people are going to make between a rather old-style 1980s approach to politics ... and a new approach i have , " said the conservative leader .
" it would be good for the country , now blair has said he 's going , that he got on and left . "
labour mp harriet harman , an ally of the chancellor , told the sunday times : " david cameron 's new style of politics seems to have lasted less than a month .
" he has woken the tories from their slumber only to walk them up a blind alley of shallow personal abuse . "

in his new year address the president vowed to strengthen taiwan 's security .
in comments bound to anger china , he also suggested that the taiwan could hold a referendum in 2007 to establish a new constitution .
this is a move that beijing has strongly warned against , fearing that it could lead to taiwan declaring formal independence .
china regards taiwan as a renegade province that should be reunited with the mainland .
with his personal popularity at an all-time low and his party still reeling from a crushing defeat in last month 's local elections , many had expected president chen shui-bian to adopt a conciliatory approach in his speech .
instead he signalled that the government would take a tougher stand towards china and pursue domestic policies to strengthen the island 's national identity .
repeating a pledge to push for constitutional reform , he said a national referendum on a new constitution could be held by 2007 if conditions were ripe .
the president warned of the growing military threat from china , noting that it had targeted 784 missiles at taiwan .
political frictions he also urged the opposition-controlled parliament to approve a special budget which has been blocked for more than a year to allow taiwan to purchase arms from the us to be able to better defend itself .
he warned of the risk to companies investing in china , suggesting the government would remain firm against growing pressure by the business lobby to remove remaining barriers on trade and investment with the mainland .
the government would adopt a policy of " pro-active management and effective liberalisation " to guard taiwan 's economic security , he said , warning that the island should not " lock in " its economic lifeline in china .
despite the political frictions across the taiwan strait , local businesses have invested as much as $ 100bn in china and have been calling on the government to approve direct transport links .
