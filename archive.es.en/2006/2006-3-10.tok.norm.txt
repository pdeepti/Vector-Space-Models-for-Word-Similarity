stating the need for an inquiry had been one thing , but agreeing on joint terms of reference quite another , especially since one of the opposition parties - the greens - was in government at the time and is worried about what the inquiry will reveal . now that this stumbling block is out of the way , the opposition has to collect the required 154 signatures in favor of the inquiry next week .

the opposition wants the probe to deal first and foremost with the role of bnd agents stationed in baghdad before and during the war on iraq .
of particular interest are all issues related to the question as to whether these agents or their bosses at home passed on any information to the us military or intelligence which might have helped the americans pick bombing targets . this would have meant direct involvement in the war effort and would have stood in stark contrast to the official line of the german government , which openly and vociferously opposed the war . but the inquiry will deal with a number of other aspects as well , such as the abduction of a lebanese-born german national to afghanistan by the cia and the interrogation of terror suspects by german intelligence agents in detention camps located in countries with a record of using torture . government rejects inquiry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's foreign minister frank-walter belonged to the former and current government it did n't come as a major surprise that the ruling grand coalition of social and christian democrats showed little understanding for the opposition 's intentions . " the free democrats should be ashamed of forging an alliance with the left party and the greens in such a sensitive matter , " said peter ramsauer , the parliamentary leader of bavaria 's christian social union .
" the really should n't ignore the damage they 're about to do .
the reputation of germany 's intelligence service is bound to suffer .
and i doubt whether in such a situation the bnd can do its job and provide maximum safety for our citizens in the months ahead . " for the opposition , the fdp 's jörg van essen said he was certain the inquiry would not serve to discredit the work of the german intelligence , but would rather look into what he believes was a double game being played by the schröder government . he also brushed aside allegations that his party wanted to use the probe mainly as an instrument to win over voters during elections in several german states later this month . swift process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hearings will take place in a room like this one the opposition parties have suggested that the inquiry could start as soon as the end of march .
they - especially the greens - do n't want it to drag on for months on end , turning into a general investigation of the previous government 's foreign policy . they are planning to appoint a special investigator to speed up things .
the cross-party panel will most likely be made up of only seven parliamentarians . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de politicians warn iraq inquiry could harm intelligence work with an inquiry into the role of german bnd agents in iraq looking likely , the parties in the ruling coalition have warned that such public scrutiny could damage the ability of intelligence officers to work effectively .
-lrb- march 7 , 2006 -rrb- germany 's opposition parties force iraq spy investigation the liberal free democrats have joined the greens and the left party in voting in favor of an inquiry into german involvement in iraq .
an investigation will almost certainly now go ahead .
-lrb- march 6 , 2006 -rrb- " we have to shed light on the issue " even as germany 's federal intelligence agency denies reports its spies in baghdad helped the us in selecting bombing targets there , jürgen trittin of the opposition green party told dw-world the fog has to be cleared .

it 's the biggest overhaul of germany 's governmental system and will require 40 constitutional amendments . the long-awaited federalism reform is expected to newly regulate the jurisdictions of the federal government and germany 's 16 states . the latter are generally responsible for making laws - a concept that forms the basis of the original idea of federalism , according to herbert von arnim , a professor at the university for administrative sciences in speyer .

it 's the biggest overhaul of germany 's governmental system and will require 40 constitutional amendments . the long-awaited federalism reform is expected to newly regulate the jurisdictions of the federal government and germany 's 16 states . the latter are generally responsible for making laws - a concept that forms the basis of the original idea of federalism , according to herbert von arnim , a professor at the university for administrative sciences in speyer . " states are closer to the citizens , " he said .
" they know what things are like on the ground and find it easier to adjust rules to the needs of the people .
they can also compete with each other , meaning that the best system will succeed in the end . " historic foundation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto von bismarck became germany 's first chancellor in 1871 after uniting the country under the prussian crown germany 's principle of federalism has its roots in history . for centuries , germany consisted of autonomous principalities and so-called " free cities . "
this patchwork quilt long resisted any attempts for unification .
when the german reich was eventually founded in 1871 , individual states still did n't hand over much sovereignty . some of this diversity has been preserved today , such as in the area of culture .
few countries have as many opera houses and theaters as germany . " federalism clearly brings about diversity , " said martin molok , a law professor at düsseldorf university .
" it encourages progress .
if we have different model , we can test which one works best and choose it . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : theodor heuss germany 's nazi dictatorship also influenced the postwar constitution , which was meant to prevent a concentration of power in berlin .
germany 's first federal president , theodor heuss , declared his support for federalism in september 1949 . " we are a federal republic , " he said .
" we do n't want centralism in german .
we have behind us the lesson of national socialism that showed us what happens when germans are meant to fit a norm .
we do n't want that . " federal rights increase but there are cases - by now a majority - where the federal government has the power to legislate . " there are a number of areas , such as foreign policy , where it would not make sense to leave it up to the states , " morlok said , adding that globalization has increased the number of areas where laws are made in the country 's administrative center . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr is a federal matter defense , trade and currency issues and transport are fields were federal legislation is warranted .
in other areas , states can only adopt laws if the federal government has not done so already .
this includes social , civil and criminal law .
the federal state also regulates almost everything that has to do with immigration . the states maintain jurisdiction over police and education matters .
but even in these areas , states are increasingly coordinating their decisions . " there are no less than 1,000 coordinating committees , " von arnim said . adding the eu layer adding to the confusion is the supranational level of the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu also has a say when it comes to agriculture " we have some areas , such as agriculture and environmental protection , where the basic guidelines come from brussels and national parliaments have to turn them into law , " morlok said .
" that means that federal and state governments have to deal with this one after the other .
and that leads to people being totally confused about who is in charge . " reacting to a waning right to legislate , states have been trying to influence federal legislation .
since they have to approve regulations that affect them directly , if they reject them in germany 's upper house , the bundesrat , proposed legislation can not become law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the bundesrat have to approve fewer federal laws in the future ?
the number of laws that require state approval has risen from 40 percent to 60 percent , allowing states to block laws in power struggles with the national government .
this happened frequently under the previous red-green coalition as the bundesrat was controlled by the christian democratic opposition . federalism reform is meant to untie these sometimes gnarled interconnections and make the state more effective again . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chancellor merkel riding high after first 100 days the dire predictions once made about germany 's current " grand coalition " government have proven untrue .

stating the need for an inquiry had been one thing , but agreeing on joint terms of reference quite another , especially since one of the opposition parties - the greens - was in government at the time and is worried about what the inquiry will reveal . now that this stumbling block is out of the way , the opposition has to collect the required 154 signatures in favor of the inquiry next week .
altogether , the three parties have 166 members in the bundestag , meaning that they can afford over 10 dissidents in their own ranks . bnd 's role in baghdad crucial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did bnd agents help the us in preparing the invasion of iraq ?
the opposition wants the probe to deal first and foremost with the role of bnd agents stationed in baghdad before and during the war on iraq .
of particular interest are all issues related to the question as to whether these agents or their bosses at home passed on any information to the us military or intelligence which might have helped the americans pick bombing targets . this would have meant direct involvement in the war effort and would have stood in stark contrast to the official line of the german government , which openly and vociferously opposed the war . but the inquiry will deal with a number of other aspects as well , such as the abduction of a lebanese-born german national to afghanistan by the cia and the interrogation of terror suspects by german intelligence agents in detention camps located in countries with a record of using torture . government rejects inquiry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's foreign minister frank-walter belonged to the former and current government it did n't come as a major surprise that the ruling grand coalition of social and christian democrats showed little understanding for the opposition 's intentions . " the free democrats should be ashamed of forging an alliance with the left party and the greens in such a sensitive matter , " said peter ramsauer , the parliamentary leader of bavaria 's christian social union .
" the really should n't ignore the damage they 're about to do .
the reputation of germany 's intelligence service is bound to suffer .
and i doubt whether in such a situation the bnd can do its job and provide maximum safety for our citizens in the months ahead . " for the opposition , the fdp 's jörg van essen said he was certain the inquiry would not serve to discredit the work of the german intelligence , but would rather look into what he believes was a double game being played by the schröder government . he also brushed aside allegations that his party wanted to use the probe mainly as an instrument to win over voters during elections in several german states later this month . swift process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hearings will take place in a room like this one the opposition parties have suggested that the inquiry could start as soon as the end of march .
they - especially the greens - do n't want it to drag on for months on end , turning into a general investigation of the previous government 's foreign policy . they are planning to appoint a special investigator to speed up things .

the city council agreed to the sale with a vote of 40 in favor and 29 against . the controversial decision , which went against the wishes of 45,000 residents who signed a petition protesting against the deal , makes dresden the first major german city to sell its entire residential real estate holdings and could have a knock on effect for other cash-strapped cities . poorly performing economies and high social costs have saddled larger german towns and cities with mountains of debt .
in recent years , the sale of apartments built to serve lower-income workers has become a quick way of reducing debt , to the chagrin of tenant associations . the sale of dresden 's real estate holdings may lead to other cities taking similar action .
berlin has already sold more than 260,000 apartments to private investors in the last three years .
hamburg and cologne are also considering such sales . " dresden sale is no blueprint for debt solution " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sale of dresden 's real estate worries residents however , gerd landsberg , the managing director of the german city and districts organization , said that dresden 's decision should not become a model for other cities wanting to clear their debts through such a scheme .
" this is an individual case , " he said , " and should not become a blueprint for the solution of financial problems . " landsberg said he would be pleased if dresden succeeds to free itself from debt but added that such sales are not the answer to financial crises .
only the government and individual states can solve the problems by reducing financial demands and increasing investment , he said . the german tenants association called the deal " wrong and short-sighted , " saying that the tenants would be expected to pay the bill in the long run .
" the high purchase price paid by fortress will have to recouped somewhere , " association director franz-georg rips said in a statement . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dresden sells gdr legacy , eliminates debt in a highly-controversial move , dresden on thursday will become the first major german city to sell its entire residential real estate holdings .

speakers for the opposition in parliament called it a monster .
they feel it can not take care of the task of untangling the web of interlocking powers between federal and state governments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast served as minister for agriculture and consumer protection in the previous government " the reform was meant to separate powers , but it now does n't , " said renate künast , the parliamentary leader of the greens party .
" it was meant to speed up decision-making and tackle the huge challenges facing germany .
on all of this the reform fails .
what was supposed to be the masterpiece of the grand coalition government has become a bungled piece of legislation that wo n't bring germany forward . " current system blocks legislation currently around 60 percent of german laws have to be approved by both chambers of parliament , the bundestag and the bundesrat , which represents the states .
this system has led to a blockade of important legislation in the past when the two houses have been controlled by different parties .
if ratified , the new bill would substantially reduce the number of laws which the bundesrat can veto . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesrat in session in exchange for the concessions by the states , the central government in berlin has been forced to relinquish powers in areas such as education , the environment , the penal system and the civil service .
opposition parties therefore accused chancellor angela merkel of fostering separatist tendencies among state leaders who are bent on destroying national solidarity . in times of limited finances , they warned , this would lead to a race for the lowest standards in environmental protection and public administration , and foster growing inequality in education . government mulls changes to reform this fear was even shared by peter struck , parliamentary leader of the social democrats . although the spd ministers in chancellor merkel 's cabinet are supporting the draft , he openly called for changes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter struck does n't want to rush things " simply because the bill has been brought into parliament , this does n't mean we adopt it all at once , " he said .
" there is no doubt that a reform is necessary .
but this draft can not be the last word on it and parliamentary deputies have every right to change it according to their convictions . " but klaus wowereit , the social democrat mayor of the city-state of berlin , warned against unraveling the hard-won compromise . " if all those who have not seen their wishes fulfilled start demanding changes , we 'll end up in a difficult situation , " he said .
" in this case i expect the reform to founder in the end . " but some voices in the bundesrat said they were worried that the poorer states could suffer from the reforms . both houses of parliament must pass the bill with a two-thirds majority before the constitutional amendments can go through .
the reform is the first key domestic hurdle for chancellor angela merkel and a major test of the ability of her grand coalition government to sell controversial measures not only to the public at large but also to its own members of parliament . uwe hessler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany starts constitutional overhaul germany 's parliament on friday is starting the process of reforming the country 's federal structure .
it 's the biggest overhaul of germany 's governmental system and will require more than 20 constitutional amendments .

the court revealed that it is believed that at least one of the offers of payment was accepted .
the court also refused to acknowledge or deny any connection with the match fixing operation involving hoyzer . the dfb also revealed that it was carrying out its own investigation into the possibility that matches in the amateur regional league might have been fixed this season after hearing claims to that effect .
the dfb said in a statement that it had no evidence yet and had handed all relevant information to the state prosecutors in frankfurt . no refereeing or top tier involvement , dfb says the ruling body was quick to add that the current probe had so far shown that the new cases of match fixing were nowhere near as large as those of last year and that there had been no evidence as yet to indicate the top tier of the game had been infiltrated or officials bribed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dfb 's theo zwanziger promised swift action " we have to state clearly that , according to the results of the ongoing investigation , no referee is involved and no first division club is concerned , " dfb chief executive theo zwanziger said in a statement .

for germans , the reporting of the world cup preparation process has become almost a daily soap opera but how do issues such as the struggles with hooliganism , security and stadium safety look to those outside germany ? inside germany 's borders , the country 's world cup preparations - with all their successes and failures - have been followed almost daily by the media .
as a result , even the most mundane twists and turns of the process have been reported and passed on to the public .
people in germany are now either very well informed or fed up with the whole thing . but the world cup , of course , is not just a german event .
from the beginning of june , the teams and supporters of 31 other countries will begin to descend on germany for the actual tournament . while the world cup soap opera has been playing almost constantly in the host country since it was awarded the championships in 2002 , the other participating countries have had other things on their minds , like qualification and their own chances of lifting the trophy . so have such widely debated topics as security , stadium safety and ticket allocation made any impact outside germany ?
do the other nations really care about the preparations as long as the world cup takes place ? patrice armand of the french football supporters union remembers the build up to france 's tournament in 1998 , the last world cup to be played on european soil .
" in france it felt like we were cut off from the rest of the world while preparing for the tournament in 1998 , " he said . the french faced a number of similar challenges to the germans in the build-up to their world cup but armand believes germany has had a tougher job this time round . a changing world with changing challenges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french celebrated after preparation stress subsided " the world has changed dramatically since 1998 .

as a result , even the most mundane twists and turns of the process have been reported and passed on to the public .
people in germany are now either very well informed or fed up with the whole thing . but the world cup , of course , is not just a german event .
from the beginning of june , the teams and supporters of 31 other countries will begin to descend on germany for the actual tournament . while the world cup soap opera has been playing almost constantly in the host country since it was awarded the championships in 2002 , the other participating countries have had other things on their minds , like qualification and their own chances of lifting the trophy . so have such widely debated topics as security , stadium safety and ticket allocation made any impact outside germany ?

from the beginning of june , the teams and supporters of 31 other countries will begin to descend on germany for the actual tournament . while the world cup soap opera has been playing almost constantly in the host country since it was awarded the championships in 2002 , the other participating countries have had other things on their minds , like qualification and their own chances of lifting the trophy . so have such widely debated topics as security , stadium safety and ticket allocation made any impact outside germany ?
do the other nations really care about the preparations as long as the world cup takes place ? patrice armand of the french football supporters union remembers the build up to france 's tournament in 1998 , the last world cup to be played on european soil .
" in france it felt like we were cut off from the rest of the world while preparing for the tournament in 1998 , " he said . the french faced a number of similar challenges to the germans in the build-up to their world cup but armand believes germany has had a tougher job this time round . a changing world with changing challenges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french celebrated after preparation stress subsided " the world has changed dramatically since 1998 .
germany has had to deal with the increased threat from international terrorism , something that was less of a worry for france eight years ago .
i think germany is doing the best it can to protect the world cup from attack but it could do more . " when asked if he thought the german army should be deployed as an added security force , armand said : " that is an issue for the germans to decide .
for the french , it would be no problem but we do not have such a weight of history on us as the germans do .
i think the germans should do whatever it takes to secure the world cup . " france suffered from the scourge of hooliganism in ' 98 and the germans are hoping they have learnt from the lessons of the past .
they have prepared a plan for dealing with the threat , specifically from renowned hooligans and bitter rivals from england and the netherlands . judge us on behavior , not reputation , say england fans with the german police under orders to watch these sets of fans in particular , what feeling does that create in these countries in the build-up to the tournament ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : england fans have worked hard to change perceptions " england fans want to be judged on their behavior and not their reputation , " said andrin cooper from the english football association -lrb- fa -rrb- .
" our fans have made huge strides in recent years to change perceptions .
we had just one arrest at euro 2004 in portugal and none at the 2002 world cup . " " the fa is expecting a great world cup in a real football country with a real football culture .
germany has great infrastructure and great stadiums and the organizing committee and host cities have really made an effort to welcome everyone with open arms .
we 're confident it will be a successful , safe world cup . " dutch expert fears open-space hooliganism ron elsker , an expert on dutch soccer hooliganism , agreed but had concerns about security away from the stadiums .
" i think the idea of having public viewing areas is unavoidable considering the demand for the world cup , but i also feel that the germans have dug themselves into a hole with this idea , " elsker said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the idea of " fanparks " has some security experts concerned " i do n't think they are prepared enough to deal with the potential for violence at these events .
a stadium is one thing , a wide open public place is a lot harder to police . " even if the stadiums are secure when it comes to potential violence , there have been concerns raised about the condition and safety precautions in place at the grounds . after a widely reported spat between the organizing committee and consumer watchdog magazine stiftung warentest over a report that four world cup stadiums had inadequate safety measures in place , a recent uefa cup clash between stuttgart and english team middlesbrough at the gottlieb daimler stadium once again raised these concerns . no safety fears for fans despite stuttgart incident a burst pipe in a kitchen caused an alert 30 minutes before kick-off and the announcements which followed were made in german , with no translation , meaning many boro fans remained in their seats during the evacuation . paddy cronesberry , the chairman of middlesbrough 's disabled supporters club was in stuttgart for the game .
" most of the disabled supporters were stopped from entering once the alarm went off , but those supporters in the ground had no idea what was happening . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traveling fans were impressed by stuttgart 's stadium " despite that , i was very impressed by the stadium and the safety measures although access could have been better .
we only had a couple of thousand fans and the two gates for the away end still made it tight .
a large contingent may have bigger problems . " " the germans are the best at organizing anything and have had a lot of experience of big sporting events .
i have no concerns about safety for fans in the german stadiums .
i think the attitudes of people are the most important thing .
if you go with a positive one , you will help the world cup be a huge success .

he added that there was a gap in the french market for a tabloid-style newspaper , since the print media in france was predominantly institutional , with the state playing a major role . before a final decision is made , however , extensive market research would have to be carried out , döpfner said , according to financial times deutschland . he also acknowledged that the publication would bear risks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fakt readers in poland " setting up a new newspaper would cost a substantial amount of money , " döpfner said . but he estimated the german group could generate hundreds of millions of euros in revenues from such a newspaper in france . springer 's bild has a circulation of 3.6 million , but the number of readers tops 11.8 million .

protestors were heading rallying calls against plans by some state and local authorities to increase the working week from 38.5 hours to 40 or more and to cut christmas and holiday bonuses . around 6,000 teachers represented by the gew union also held demonstrations outside kindergartens , schools and universities in berlin thursday , further boosting the numbers of protestors on the german streets . the strikes have been gaining momentum in their fifth week and the turnout on the day before the services union verdi was due to hold talks with employers was an obvious sign of the growing discontent around germany at the idea of extending working hours . the industrial action is also making a visible impact on german cities and towns , where piles of uncollected rubbish are growing and kindergartens , hospitals and public administration services are becoming increasingly disrupted . while union and employer negotiators are due to hold talks on friday , prospects of reaching a deal look slim , especially since verdi rejected an offer from municipal employers in the southern state of baden-württemberg on wednesday which the employers said went to " the absolute limit . " warring sides show no sign of securing a deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verdi 's frank bsirske rallies a crowd of protestors " i 'm skeptical , " hartmut möllring , chief negotiator for tarifgemeinschaft der länder -lrb- tdl -rrb- , the state employers ' umbrella organization , told reporters when asked about the prospects of a deal being reached by the end of this week . the employers ' organization has been accused by verdi of deliberately dragging the conflict out in a bid to make the strike unpopular and to overshadow the protestors ' objectives . according to the bdb banking association , whose 200 member banks include deutsche bank ag and hvb group , a prolonged disruption of services would also pose a risk to a domestic economy that 's recovering after five years of stagnation . " the policy of möllring and company threatens the interests of hundreds of thousands .
it 's a declaration of war against the people in this country , " verdi chief frank bsirske told a demonstration attended by around 20,000 people in hanover .
the union says the move would endanger the jobs of some 250,000 part time and trainee workers . strikes gaining support in engineering sector the services dispute is already beginning to spread to other areas of german industry , namely the engineering sector , the country 's biggest , with 3.4 million employees . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the strikes could massively grow if the powerful ig metall union joins engineering union ig metall has been calling brief walkouts during shifts ever since pay contracts ran out on feb .
28 .
last week , 10,000 workers from daimlerchrysler and bosch in baden-württemberg left their posts to join the protest . the engineering and metal workers may extend their action by staging one-day strikes after march 28 , the day a so-called peace period barring unlimited protests expires , unless a new wage agreement is reached in the next three weeks . as well as disrupting industry and services , the strikes could have a political impact , with state elections in baden-württemberg and rhineland-palatinate in the southwest and in saxony-anhalt in the east to be held on march 26 , the first since the grand coalition of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union and the social democrats took power in november . in an interview in berlin on thursday , guido westerwelle , the leader of the free market liberal free democratic party , the largest opposition group in the national parliament , said the government has " encouraged " the strikes by " unilaterally " raising taxes and ending tax breaks . westerwelle said decisions by merkel 's government to increase value-added tax , end homebuyers ' subsidies and reduce tax breaks for holiday work and commuters are adding to workers ' " grief .

speakers for the opposition in parliament called it a monster .
they feel it can not take care of the task of untangling the web of interlocking powers between federal and state governments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast served as minister for agriculture and consumer protection in the previous government " the reform was meant to separate powers , but it now does n't , " said renate künast , the parliamentary leader of the greens party .
" it was meant to speed up decision-making and tackle the huge challenges facing germany .
on all of this the reform fails .
what was supposed to be the masterpiece of the grand coalition government has become a bungled piece of legislation that wo n't bring germany forward . " current system blocks legislation currently around 60 percent of german laws have to be approved by both chambers of parliament , the bundestag and the bundesrat , which represents the states .
this system has led to a blockade of important legislation in the past when the two houses have been controlled by different parties .
if ratified , the new bill would substantially reduce the number of laws which the bundesrat can veto . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesrat in session in exchange for the concessions by the states , the central government in berlin has been forced to relinquish powers in areas such as education , the environment , the penal system and the civil service .
opposition parties therefore accused chancellor angela merkel of fostering separatist tendencies among state leaders who are bent on destroying national solidarity . in times of limited finances , they warned , this would lead to a race for the lowest standards in environmental protection and public administration , and foster growing inequality in education . government mulls changes to reform this fear was even shared by peter struck , parliamentary leader of the social democrats . although the spd ministers in chancellor merkel 's cabinet are supporting the draft , he openly called for changes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter struck does n't want to rush things " simply because the bill has been brought into parliament , this does n't mean we adopt it all at once , " he said .
" there is no doubt that a reform is necessary .
but this draft can not be the last word on it and parliamentary deputies have every right to change it according to their convictions . " but klaus wowereit , the social democrat mayor of the city-state of berlin , warned against unraveling the hard-won compromise . " if all those who have not seen their wishes fulfilled start demanding changes , we 'll end up in a difficult situation , " he said .
" in this case i expect the reform to founder in the end . " but some voices in the bundesrat said they were worried that the poorer states could suffer from the reforms . both houses of parliament must pass the bill with a two-thirds majority before the constitutional amendments can go through .
the reform is the first key domestic hurdle for chancellor angela merkel and a major test of the ability of her grand coalition government to sell controversial measures not only to the public at large but also to its own members of parliament . uwe hessler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany starts constitutional overhaul germany 's parliament on friday is starting the process of reforming the country 's federal structure .
it 's the biggest overhaul of germany 's governmental system and will require more than 20 constitutional amendments .
-lrb- march 10 , 2006 -rrb- chancellor merkel riding high after first 100 days the dire predictions once made about germany 's current " grand coalition " government have proven untrue .
on the contrary , harmony is the watchword so far .
political scientist klaus detterbeck looks back and ahead .
-lrb- march 1 , 2006 -rrb- path cleared for german federalism reform after years of debate , germany 's federal and state governments have agreed on plans to reform their individual responsibilities , thus paving the way for a more transparent and efficient means of government .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.03.2006 opposition criticizes federalism reform plan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : balancing federal and state interests : merkel with german states ' coat of arms on stars both houses of germany 's parliament on friday debated the draft of the country 's so-called federalism reform - a mammoth piece of legislation that includes more than 20 changes to the german constitution . german chancellor angela merkel and the premiers of the 16 federal states brought the reform before the german parliament in a joint effort to overhaul the country 's complex federal system . the amendments are deemed crucial in streamlining political decision-making in germany that has increasingly become a drawn-out affair with legislation being substantially watered down at the end of the process . but in spite of substantial agreement between federal and state governments , the " mother of all reforms , " as one of its authors called it , still has a rocky road ahead of it .
speakers for the opposition in parliament called it a monster .
they feel it can not take care of the task of untangling the web of interlocking powers between federal and state governments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast served as minister for agriculture and consumer protection in the previous government " the reform was meant to separate powers , but it now does n't , " said renate künast , the parliamentary leader of the greens party .
" it was meant to speed up decision-making and tackle the huge challenges facing germany .
on all of this the reform fails .
what was supposed to be the masterpiece of the grand coalition government has become a bungled piece of legislation that wo n't bring germany forward . " current system blocks legislation currently around 60 percent of german laws have to be approved by both chambers of parliament , the bundestag and the bundesrat , which represents the states .
this system has led to a blockade of important legislation in the past when the two houses have been controlled by different parties .
if ratified , the new bill would substantially reduce the number of laws which the bundesrat can veto . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesrat in session in exchange for the concessions by the states , the central government in berlin has been forced to relinquish powers in areas such as education , the environment , the penal system and the civil service .
opposition parties therefore accused chancellor angela merkel of fostering separatist tendencies among state leaders who are bent on destroying national solidarity . in times of limited finances , they warned , this would lead to a race for the lowest standards in environmental protection and public administration , and foster growing inequality in education . government mulls changes to reform this fear was even shared by peter struck , parliamentary leader of the social democrats . although the spd ministers in chancellor merkel 's cabinet are supporting the draft , he openly called for changes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter struck does n't want to rush things " simply because the bill has been brought into parliament , this does n't mean we adopt it all at once , " he said .
" there is no doubt that a reform is necessary .
but this draft can not be the last word on it and parliamentary deputies have every right to change it according to their convictions . " but klaus wowereit , the social democrat mayor of the city-state of berlin , warned against unraveling the hard-won compromise . " if all those who have not seen their wishes fulfilled start demanding changes , we 'll end up in a difficult situation , " he said .
" in this case i expect the reform to founder in the end . " but some voices in the bundesrat said they were worried that the poorer states could suffer from the reforms . both houses of parliament must pass the bill with a two-thirds majority before the constitutional amendments can go through .
the reform is the first key domestic hurdle for chancellor angela merkel and a major test of the ability of her grand coalition government to sell controversial measures not only to the public at large but also to its own members of parliament . uwe hessler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany starts constitutional overhaul germany 's parliament on friday is starting the process of reforming the country 's federal structure .
it 's the biggest overhaul of germany 's governmental system and will require more than 20 constitutional amendments .
-lrb- march 10 , 2006 -rrb- chancellor merkel riding high after first 100 days the dire predictions once made about germany 's current " grand coalition " government have proven untrue .
on the contrary , harmony is the watchword so far .

the court revealed that it is believed that at least one of the offers of payment was accepted .
the court also refused to acknowledge or deny any connection with the match fixing operation involving hoyzer . the dfb also revealed that it was carrying out its own investigation into the possibility that matches in the amateur regional league might have been fixed this season after hearing claims to that effect .
the dfb said in a statement that it had no evidence yet and had handed all relevant information to the state prosecutors in frankfurt . no refereeing or top tier involvement , dfb says the ruling body was quick to add that the current probe had so far shown that the new cases of match fixing were nowhere near as large as those of last year and that there had been no evidence as yet to indicate the top tier of the game had been infiltrated or officials bribed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dfb 's theo zwanziger promised swift action " we have to state clearly that , according to the results of the ongoing investigation , no referee is involved and no first division club is concerned , " dfb chief executive theo zwanziger said in a statement .
" as long as there is money circulating around games , sadly , you can not rule out manipulation and cheating , " zwanziger added . " the dfb has been investigating for several weeks .
there was a very small suspicion of a criminal act and we decided that in the interests of a clear explanation we would work together with the investigators , " zwanziger continued .
" if anything is confirmed , it will be investigated and action will be taken .
those involved will be removed , and that includes from football circles . " retrial possibility in hoyzer case meanwhile the hoyzer scandal threatens to surface once more to add further insult to injury after it was revealed that the disgraced referee was not the official at one of the matches that he was accused of fixing and that as this was included in the court case against him , the mistake may lead to a retrial . legal experts were investigating the claim and the prospect of the case returning to court .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.03.2006 german opposition agrees on terms of bnd affair inquiry großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opposition in parliament hopes to get to the bottom on the bnd 's role in iraq following a protracted tug-of-war , germany 's opposition parties friday agreed on the terms of reference for a parliamentary inquiry on the activities of german intelligence service bnd before and during the iraq war . germany 's three opposition parties , the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , the left party and the greens accuse the former government of social democratic chancellor gerhard schröder of having secretly supported the us-led war effort while publicly rejecting the 2003 invasion . the parties have overcome their differences on the issue and on friday agreed on a brief for the planned parliamentary inquiry .
stating the need for an inquiry had been one thing , but agreeing on joint terms of reference quite another , especially since one of the opposition parties - the greens - was in government at the time and is worried about what the inquiry will reveal . now that this stumbling block is out of the way , the opposition has to collect the required 154 signatures in favor of the inquiry next week .
altogether , the three parties have 166 members in the bundestag , meaning that they can afford over 10 dissidents in their own ranks . bnd 's role in baghdad crucial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did bnd agents help the us in preparing the invasion of iraq ?
the opposition wants the probe to deal first and foremost with the role of bnd agents stationed in baghdad before and during the war on iraq .
of particular interest are all issues related to the question as to whether these agents or their bosses at home passed on any information to the us military or intelligence which might have helped the americans pick bombing targets . this would have meant direct involvement in the war effort and would have stood in stark contrast to the official line of the german government , which openly and vociferously opposed the war . but the inquiry will deal with a number of other aspects as well , such as the abduction of a lebanese-born german national to afghanistan by the cia and the interrogation of terror suspects by german intelligence agents in detention camps located in countries with a record of using torture . government rejects inquiry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's foreign minister frank-walter belonged to the former and current government it did n't come as a major surprise that the ruling grand coalition of social and christian democrats showed little understanding for the opposition 's intentions . " the free democrats should be ashamed of forging an alliance with the left party and the greens in such a sensitive matter , " said peter ramsauer , the parliamentary leader of bavaria 's christian social union .
" the really should n't ignore the damage they 're about to do .
the reputation of germany 's intelligence service is bound to suffer .
and i doubt whether in such a situation the bnd can do its job and provide maximum safety for our citizens in the months ahead . " for the opposition , the fdp 's jörg van essen said he was certain the inquiry would not serve to discredit the work of the german intelligence , but would rather look into what he believes was a double game being played by the schröder government . he also brushed aside allegations that his party wanted to use the probe mainly as an instrument to win over voters during elections in several german states later this month . swift process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hearings will take place in a room like this one the opposition parties have suggested that the inquiry could start as soon as the end of march .
they - especially the greens - do n't want it to drag on for months on end , turning into a general investigation of the previous government 's foreign policy . they are planning to appoint a special investigator to speed up things .
the cross-party panel will most likely be made up of only seven parliamentarians . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de politicians warn iraq inquiry could harm intelligence work with an inquiry into the role of german bnd agents in iraq looking likely , the parties in the ruling coalition have warned that such public scrutiny could damage the ability of intelligence officers to work effectively .
-lrb- march 7 , 2006 -rrb- germany 's opposition parties force iraq spy investigation the liberal free democrats have joined the greens and the left party in voting in favor of an inquiry into german involvement in iraq .
an investigation will almost certainly now go ahead .
-lrb- march 6 , 2006 -rrb- " we have to shed light on the issue " even as germany 's federal intelligence agency denies reports its spies in baghdad helped the us in selecting bombing targets there , jürgen trittin of the opposition green party told dw-world the fog has to be cleared .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.03.2006 opposition criticizes federalism reform plan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : balancing federal and state interests : merkel with german states ' coat of arms on stars both houses of germany 's parliament on friday debated the draft of the country 's so-called federalism reform - a mammoth piece of legislation that includes more than 20 changes to the german constitution . german chancellor angela merkel and the premiers of the 16 federal states brought the reform before the german parliament in a joint effort to overhaul the country 's complex federal system . the amendments are deemed crucial in streamlining political decision-making in germany that has increasingly become a drawn-out affair with legislation being substantially watered down at the end of the process . but in spite of substantial agreement between federal and state governments , the " mother of all reforms , " as one of its authors called it , still has a rocky road ahead of it .
speakers for the opposition in parliament called it a monster .
they feel it can not take care of the task of untangling the web of interlocking powers between federal and state governments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast served as minister for agriculture and consumer protection in the previous government " the reform was meant to separate powers , but it now does n't , " said renate künast , the parliamentary leader of the greens party .
" it was meant to speed up decision-making and tackle the huge challenges facing germany .
on all of this the reform fails .
what was supposed to be the masterpiece of the grand coalition government has become a bungled piece of legislation that wo n't bring germany forward . " current system blocks legislation currently around 60 percent of german laws have to be approved by both chambers of parliament , the bundestag and the bundesrat , which represents the states .
this system has led to a blockade of important legislation in the past when the two houses have been controlled by different parties .
if ratified , the new bill would substantially reduce the number of laws which the bundesrat can veto . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesrat in session in exchange for the concessions by the states , the central government in berlin has been forced to relinquish powers in areas such as education , the environment , the penal system and the civil service .
opposition parties therefore accused chancellor angela merkel of fostering separatist tendencies among state leaders who are bent on destroying national solidarity . in times of limited finances , they warned , this would lead to a race for the lowest standards in environmental protection and public administration , and foster growing inequality in education . government mulls changes to reform this fear was even shared by peter struck , parliamentary leader of the social democrats . although the spd ministers in chancellor merkel 's cabinet are supporting the draft , he openly called for changes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter struck does n't want to rush things " simply because the bill has been brought into parliament , this does n't mean we adopt it all at once , " he said .
" there is no doubt that a reform is necessary .
but this draft can not be the last word on it and parliamentary deputies have every right to change it according to their convictions . " but klaus wowereit , the social democrat mayor of the city-state of berlin , warned against unraveling the hard-won compromise . " if all those who have not seen their wishes fulfilled start demanding changes , we 'll end up in a difficult situation , " he said .
" in this case i expect the reform to founder in the end . " but some voices in the bundesrat said they were worried that the poorer states could suffer from the reforms . both houses of parliament must pass the bill with a two-thirds majority before the constitutional amendments can go through .
the reform is the first key domestic hurdle for chancellor angela merkel and a major test of the ability of her grand coalition government to sell controversial measures not only to the public at large but also to its own members of parliament . uwe hessler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany starts constitutional overhaul germany 's parliament on friday is starting the process of reforming the country 's federal structure .
it 's the biggest overhaul of germany 's governmental system and will require more than 20 constitutional amendments .

the court revealed that it is believed that at least one of the offers of payment was accepted .
the court also refused to acknowledge or deny any connection with the match fixing operation involving hoyzer . the dfb also revealed that it was carrying out its own investigation into the possibility that matches in the amateur regional league might have been fixed this season after hearing claims to that effect .
the dfb said in a statement that it had no evidence yet and had handed all relevant information to the state prosecutors in frankfurt . no refereeing or top tier involvement , dfb says the ruling body was quick to add that the current probe had so far shown that the new cases of match fixing were nowhere near as large as those of last year and that there had been no evidence as yet to indicate the top tier of the game had been infiltrated or officials bribed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dfb 's theo zwanziger promised swift action " we have to state clearly that , according to the results of the ongoing investigation , no referee is involved and no first division club is concerned , " dfb chief executive theo zwanziger said in a statement .
" as long as there is money circulating around games , sadly , you can not rule out manipulation and cheating , " zwanziger added . " the dfb has been investigating for several weeks .
there was a very small suspicion of a criminal act and we decided that in the interests of a clear explanation we would work together with the investigators , " zwanziger continued .
" if anything is confirmed , it will be investigated and action will be taken .
those involved will be removed , and that includes from football circles . " retrial possibility in hoyzer case meanwhile the hoyzer scandal threatens to surface once more to add further insult to injury after it was revealed that the disgraced referee was not the official at one of the matches that he was accused of fixing and that as this was included in the court case against him , the mistake may lead to a retrial . legal experts were investigating the claim and the prospect of the case returning to court .
the dfb will be hoping that no mistake was made but if there was , the retrial is scheduled for sometime after july 9 this year - the day of the world cup final . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ex-bundesliga player jailed for fixing matches former fc chemitz player steffen karl received a nine-month suspended sentence and 50 hours of community service for his part in the match-fixing scandal that shook german soccer to its core .

stating the need for an inquiry had been one thing , but agreeing on joint terms of reference quite another , especially since one of the opposition parties - the greens - was in government at the time and is worried about what the inquiry will reveal . now that this stumbling block is out of the way , the opposition has to collect the required 154 signatures in favor of the inquiry next week .

the opposition wants the probe to deal first and foremost with the role of bnd agents stationed in baghdad before and during the war on iraq .
of particular interest are all issues related to the question as to whether these agents or their bosses at home passed on any information to the us military or intelligence which might have helped the americans pick bombing targets . this would have meant direct involvement in the war effort and would have stood in stark contrast to the official line of the german government , which openly and vociferously opposed the war . but the inquiry will deal with a number of other aspects as well , such as the abduction of a lebanese-born german national to afghanistan by the cia and the interrogation of terror suspects by german intelligence agents in detention camps located in countries with a record of using torture . government rejects inquiry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's foreign minister frank-walter belonged to the former and current government it did n't come as a major surprise that the ruling grand coalition of social and christian democrats showed little understanding for the opposition 's intentions . " the free democrats should be ashamed of forging an alliance with the left party and the greens in such a sensitive matter , " said peter ramsauer , the parliamentary leader of bavaria 's christian social union .
" the really should n't ignore the damage they 're about to do .

speakers for the opposition in parliament called it a monster .
they feel it can not take care of the task of untangling the web of interlocking powers between federal and state governments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast served as minister for agriculture and consumer protection in the previous government " the reform was meant to separate powers , but it now does n't , " said renate künast , the parliamentary leader of the greens party .
" it was meant to speed up decision-making and tackle the huge challenges facing germany .
on all of this the reform fails .
what was supposed to be the masterpiece of the grand coalition government has become a bungled piece of legislation that wo n't bring germany forward . " current system blocks legislation currently around 60 percent of german laws have to be approved by both chambers of parliament , the bundestag and the bundesrat , which represents the states .
this system has led to a blockade of important legislation in the past when the two houses have been controlled by different parties .
if ratified , the new bill would substantially reduce the number of laws which the bundesrat can veto . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesrat in session in exchange for the concessions by the states , the central government in berlin has been forced to relinquish powers in areas such as education , the environment , the penal system and the civil service .
opposition parties therefore accused chancellor angela merkel of fostering separatist tendencies among state leaders who are bent on destroying national solidarity . in times of limited finances , they warned , this would lead to a race for the lowest standards in environmental protection and public administration , and foster growing inequality in education . government mulls changes to reform this fear was even shared by peter struck , parliamentary leader of the social democrats . although the spd ministers in chancellor merkel 's cabinet are supporting the draft , he openly called for changes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter struck does n't want to rush things " simply because the bill has been brought into parliament , this does n't mean we adopt it all at once , " he said .
" there is no doubt that a reform is necessary .
but this draft can not be the last word on it and parliamentary deputies have every right to change it according to their convictions . " but klaus wowereit , the social democrat mayor of the city-state of berlin , warned against unraveling the hard-won compromise . " if all those who have not seen their wishes fulfilled start demanding changes , we 'll end up in a difficult situation , " he said .
" in this case i expect the reform to founder in the end . " but some voices in the bundesrat said they were worried that the poorer states could suffer from the reforms . both houses of parliament must pass the bill with a two-thirds majority before the constitutional amendments can go through .
the reform is the first key domestic hurdle for chancellor angela merkel and a major test of the ability of her grand coalition government to sell controversial measures not only to the public at large but also to its own members of parliament . uwe hessler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany starts constitutional overhaul germany 's parliament on friday is starting the process of reforming the country 's federal structure .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.03.2006 german opposition agrees on terms of bnd affair inquiry großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opposition in parliament hopes to get to the bottom on the bnd 's role in iraq following a protracted tug-of-war , germany 's opposition parties friday agreed on the terms of reference for a parliamentary inquiry on the activities of german intelligence service bnd before and during the iraq war . germany 's three opposition parties , the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , the left party and the greens accuse the former government of social democratic chancellor gerhard schröder of having secretly supported the us-led war effort while publicly rejecting the 2003 invasion . the parties have overcome their differences on the issue and on friday agreed on a brief for the planned parliamentary inquiry .
stating the need for an inquiry had been one thing , but agreeing on joint terms of reference quite another , especially since one of the opposition parties - the greens - was in government at the time and is worried about what the inquiry will reveal . now that this stumbling block is out of the way , the opposition has to collect the required 154 signatures in favor of the inquiry next week .
altogether , the three parties have 166 members in the bundestag , meaning that they can afford over 10 dissidents in their own ranks . bnd 's role in baghdad crucial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did bnd agents help the us in preparing the invasion of iraq ?
the opposition wants the probe to deal first and foremost with the role of bnd agents stationed in baghdad before and during the war on iraq .
of particular interest are all issues related to the question as to whether these agents or their bosses at home passed on any information to the us military or intelligence which might have helped the americans pick bombing targets . this would have meant direct involvement in the war effort and would have stood in stark contrast to the official line of the german government , which openly and vociferously opposed the war . but the inquiry will deal with a number of other aspects as well , such as the abduction of a lebanese-born german national to afghanistan by the cia and the interrogation of terror suspects by german intelligence agents in detention camps located in countries with a record of using torture . government rejects inquiry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's foreign minister frank-walter belonged to the former and current government it did n't come as a major surprise that the ruling grand coalition of social and christian democrats showed little understanding for the opposition 's intentions . " the free democrats should be ashamed of forging an alliance with the left party and the greens in such a sensitive matter , " said peter ramsauer , the parliamentary leader of bavaria 's christian social union .
" the really should n't ignore the damage they 're about to do .
the reputation of germany 's intelligence service is bound to suffer .
and i doubt whether in such a situation the bnd can do its job and provide maximum safety for our citizens in the months ahead . " for the opposition , the fdp 's jörg van essen said he was certain the inquiry would not serve to discredit the work of the german intelligence , but would rather look into what he believes was a double game being played by the schröder government . he also brushed aside allegations that his party wanted to use the probe mainly as an instrument to win over voters during elections in several german states later this month . swift process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hearings will take place in a room like this one the opposition parties have suggested that the inquiry could start as soon as the end of march .
they - especially the greens - do n't want it to drag on for months on end , turning into a general investigation of the previous government 's foreign policy . they are planning to appoint a special investigator to speed up things .
the cross-party panel will most likely be made up of only seven parliamentarians . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de politicians warn iraq inquiry could harm intelligence work with an inquiry into the role of german bnd agents in iraq looking likely , the parties in the ruling coalition have warned that such public scrutiny could damage the ability of intelligence officers to work effectively .
-lrb- march 7 , 2006 -rrb- germany 's opposition parties force iraq spy investigation the liberal free democrats have joined the greens and the left party in voting in favor of an inquiry into german involvement in iraq .
an investigation will almost certainly now go ahead .
-lrb- march 6 , 2006 -rrb- " we have to shed light on the issue " even as germany 's federal intelligence agency denies reports its spies in baghdad helped the us in selecting bombing targets there , jürgen trittin of the opposition green party told dw-world the fog has to be cleared .

stating the need for an inquiry had been one thing , but agreeing on joint terms of reference quite another , especially since one of the opposition parties - the greens - was in government at the time and is worried about what the inquiry will reveal . now that this stumbling block is out of the way , the opposition has to collect the required 154 signatures in favor of the inquiry next week .

the opposition wants the probe to deal first and foremost with the role of bnd agents stationed in baghdad before and during the war on iraq .
of particular interest are all issues related to the question as to whether these agents or their bosses at home passed on any information to the us military or intelligence which might have helped the americans pick bombing targets . this would have meant direct involvement in the war effort and would have stood in stark contrast to the official line of the german government , which openly and vociferously opposed the war . but the inquiry will deal with a number of other aspects as well , such as the abduction of a lebanese-born german national to afghanistan by the cia and the interrogation of terror suspects by german intelligence agents in detention camps located in countries with a record of using torture . government rejects inquiry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's foreign minister frank-walter belonged to the former and current government it did n't come as a major surprise that the ruling grand coalition of social and christian democrats showed little understanding for the opposition 's intentions .

" the really should n't ignore the damage they 're about to do .

and i doubt whether in such a situation the bnd can do its job and provide maximum safety for our citizens in the months ahead . " for the opposition , the fdp 's jörg van essen said he was certain the inquiry would not serve to discredit the work of the german intelligence , but would rather look into what he believes was a double game being played by the schröder government . he also brushed aside allegations that his party wanted to use the probe mainly as an instrument to win over voters during elections in several german states later this month . swift process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hearings will take place in a room like this one the opposition parties have suggested that the inquiry could start as soon as the end of march .

stating the need for an inquiry had been one thing , but agreeing on joint terms of reference quite another , especially since one of the opposition parties - the greens - was in government at the time and is worried about what the inquiry will reveal . now that this stumbling block is out of the way , the opposition has to collect the required 154 signatures in favor of the inquiry next week .

the opposition wants the probe to deal first and foremost with the role of bnd agents stationed in baghdad before and during the war on iraq .
of particular interest are all issues related to the question as to whether these agents or their bosses at home passed on any information to the us military or intelligence which might have helped the americans pick bombing targets . this would have meant direct involvement in the war effort and would have stood in stark contrast to the official line of the german government , which openly and vociferously opposed the war . but the inquiry will deal with a number of other aspects as well , such as the abduction of a lebanese-born german national to afghanistan by the cia and the interrogation of terror suspects by german intelligence agents in detention camps located in countries with a record of using torture . government rejects inquiry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's foreign minister frank-walter belonged to the former and current government it did n't come as a major surprise that the ruling grand coalition of social and christian democrats showed little understanding for the opposition 's intentions .

" the really should n't ignore the damage they 're about to do .
the reputation of germany 's intelligence service is bound to suffer .
and i doubt whether in such a situation the bnd can do its job and provide maximum safety for our citizens in the months ahead . " for the opposition , the fdp 's jörg van essen said he was certain the inquiry would not serve to discredit the work of the german intelligence , but would rather look into what he believes was a double game being played by the schröder government . he also brushed aside allegations that his party wanted to use the probe mainly as an instrument to win over voters during elections in several german states later this month . swift process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hearings will take place in a room like this one the opposition parties have suggested that the inquiry could start as soon as the end of march .
they - especially the greens - do n't want it to drag on for months on end , turning into a general investigation of the previous government 's foreign policy . they are planning to appoint a special investigator to speed up things .

protestors were heading rallying calls against plans by some state and local authorities to increase the working week from 38.5 hours to 40 or more and to cut christmas and holiday bonuses . around 6,000 teachers represented by the gew union also held demonstrations outside kindergartens , schools and universities in berlin thursday , further boosting the numbers of protestors on the german streets . the strikes have been gaining momentum in their fifth week and the turnout on the day before the services union verdi was due to hold talks with employers was an obvious sign of the growing discontent around germany at the idea of extending working hours . the industrial action is also making a visible impact on german cities and towns , where piles of uncollected rubbish are growing and kindergartens , hospitals and public administration services are becoming increasingly disrupted . while union and employer negotiators are due to hold talks on friday , prospects of reaching a deal look slim , especially since verdi rejected an offer from municipal employers in the southern state of baden-württemberg on wednesday which the employers said went to " the absolute limit . " warring sides show no sign of securing a deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verdi 's frank bsirske rallies a crowd of protestors " i 'm skeptical , " hartmut möllring , chief negotiator for tarifgemeinschaft der länder -lrb- tdl -rrb- , the state employers ' umbrella organization , told reporters when asked about the prospects of a deal being reached by the end of this week . the employers ' organization has been accused by verdi of deliberately dragging the conflict out in a bid to make the strike unpopular and to overshadow the protestors ' objectives . according to the bdb banking association , whose 200 member banks include deutsche bank ag and hvb group , a prolonged disruption of services would also pose a risk to a domestic economy that 's recovering after five years of stagnation . " the policy of möllring and company threatens the interests of hundreds of thousands .
it 's a declaration of war against the people in this country , " verdi chief frank bsirske told a demonstration attended by around 20,000 people in hanover .

last week , 10,000 workers from daimlerchrysler and bosch in baden-württemberg left their posts to join the protest . the engineering and metal workers may extend their action by staging one-day strikes after march 28 , the day a so-called peace period barring unlimited protests expires , unless a new wage agreement is reached in the next three weeks . as well as disrupting industry and services , the strikes could have a political impact , with state elections in baden-württemberg and rhineland-palatinate in the southwest and in saxony-anhalt in the east to be held on march 26 , the first since the grand coalition of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union and the social democrats took power in november . in an interview in berlin on thursday , guido westerwelle , the leader of the free market liberal free democratic party , the largest opposition group in the national parliament , said the government has " encouraged " the strikes by " unilaterally " raising taxes and ending tax breaks . westerwelle said decisions by merkel 's government to increase value-added tax , end homebuyers ' subsidies and reduce tax breaks for holiday work and commuters are adding to workers ' " grief .

he added that there was a gap in the french market for a tabloid-style newspaper , since the print media in france was predominantly institutional , with the state playing a major role . before a final decision is made , however , extensive market research would have to be carried out , döpfner said , according to financial times deutschland . he also acknowledged that the publication would bear risks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fakt readers in poland " setting up a new newspaper would cost a substantial amount of money , " döpfner said . but he estimated the german group could generate hundreds of millions of euros in revenues from such a newspaper in france . springer 's bild has a circulation of 3.6 million , but the number of readers tops 11.8 million .

the court revealed that it is believed that at least one of the offers of payment was accepted .
the court also refused to acknowledge or deny any connection with the match fixing operation involving hoyzer . the dfb also revealed that it was carrying out its own investigation into the possibility that matches in the amateur regional league might have been fixed this season after hearing claims to that effect .
the dfb said in a statement that it had no evidence yet and had handed all relevant information to the state prosecutors in frankfurt . no refereeing or top tier involvement , dfb says the ruling body was quick to add that the current probe had so far shown that the new cases of match fixing were nowhere near as large as those of last year and that there had been no evidence as yet to indicate the top tier of the game had been infiltrated or officials bribed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dfb 's theo zwanziger promised swift action " we have to state clearly that , according to the results of the ongoing investigation , no referee is involved and no first division club is concerned , " dfb chief executive theo zwanziger said in a statement .
" as long as there is money circulating around games , sadly , you can not rule out manipulation and cheating , " zwanziger added . " the dfb has been investigating for several weeks .
there was a very small suspicion of a criminal act and we decided that in the interests of a clear explanation we would work together with the investigators , " zwanziger continued .
" if anything is confirmed , it will be investigated and action will be taken .
those involved will be removed , and that includes from football circles . " retrial possibility in hoyzer case meanwhile the hoyzer scandal threatens to surface once more to add further insult to injury after it was revealed that the disgraced referee was not the official at one of the matches that he was accused of fixing and that as this was included in the court case against him , the mistake may lead to a retrial . legal experts were investigating the claim and the prospect of the case returning to court .
the dfb will be hoping that no mistake was made but if there was , the retrial is scheduled for sometime after july 9 this year - the day of the world cup final . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ex-bundesliga player jailed for fixing matches former fc chemitz player steffen karl received a nine-month suspended sentence and 50 hours of community service for his part in the match-fixing scandal that shook german soccer to its core .

for germans , the reporting of the world cup preparation process has become almost a daily soap opera but how do issues such as the struggles with hooliganism , security and stadium safety look to those outside germany ? inside germany 's borders , the country 's world cup preparations - with all their successes and failures - have been followed almost daily by the media .
as a result , even the most mundane twists and turns of the process have been reported and passed on to the public .
people in germany are now either very well informed or fed up with the whole thing . but the world cup , of course , is not just a german event .
from the beginning of june , the teams and supporters of 31 other countries will begin to descend on germany for the actual tournament . while the world cup soap opera has been playing almost constantly in the host country since it was awarded the championships in 2002 , the other participating countries have had other things on their minds , like qualification and their own chances of lifting the trophy . so have such widely debated topics as security , stadium safety and ticket allocation made any impact outside germany ?
do the other nations really care about the preparations as long as the world cup takes place ? patrice armand of the french football supporters union remembers the build up to france 's tournament in 1998 , the last world cup to be played on european soil .
" in france it felt like we were cut off from the rest of the world while preparing for the tournament in 1998 , " he said . the french faced a number of similar challenges to the germans in the build-up to their world cup but armand believes germany has had a tougher job this time round . a changing world with changing challenges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french celebrated after preparation stress subsided " the world has changed dramatically since 1998 .
germany has had to deal with the increased threat from international terrorism , something that was less of a worry for france eight years ago .
i think germany is doing the best it can to protect the world cup from attack but it could do more . " when asked if he thought the german army should be deployed as an added security force , armand said : " that is an issue for the germans to decide .
for the french , it would be no problem but we do not have such a weight of history on us as the germans do .
i think the germans should do whatever it takes to secure the world cup . " france suffered from the scourge of hooliganism in ' 98 and the germans are hoping they have learnt from the lessons of the past .
they have prepared a plan for dealing with the threat , specifically from renowned hooligans and bitter rivals from england and the netherlands . judge us on behavior , not reputation , say england fans with the german police under orders to watch these sets of fans in particular , what feeling does that create in these countries in the build-up to the tournament ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : england fans have worked hard to change perceptions " england fans want to be judged on their behavior and not their reputation , " said andrin cooper from the english football association -lrb- fa -rrb- .
" our fans have made huge strides in recent years to change perceptions .
we had just one arrest at euro 2004 in portugal and none at the 2002 world cup . " " the fa is expecting a great world cup in a real football country with a real football culture .
germany has great infrastructure and great stadiums and the organizing committee and host cities have really made an effort to welcome everyone with open arms .
we 're confident it will be a successful , safe world cup . " dutch expert fears open-space hooliganism ron elsker , an expert on dutch soccer hooliganism , agreed but had concerns about security away from the stadiums .
" i think the idea of having public viewing areas is unavoidable considering the demand for the world cup , but i also feel that the germans have dug themselves into a hole with this idea , " elsker said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the idea of " fanparks " has some security experts concerned " i do n't think they are prepared enough to deal with the potential for violence at these events .
a stadium is one thing , a wide open public place is a lot harder to police . " even if the stadiums are secure when it comes to potential violence , there have been concerns raised about the condition and safety precautions in place at the grounds . after a widely reported spat between the organizing committee and consumer watchdog magazine stiftung warentest over a report that four world cup stadiums had inadequate safety measures in place , a recent uefa cup clash between stuttgart and english team middlesbrough at the gottlieb daimler stadium once again raised these concerns . no safety fears for fans despite stuttgart incident a burst pipe in a kitchen caused an alert 30 minutes before kick-off and the announcements which followed were made in german , with no translation , meaning many boro fans remained in their seats during the evacuation . paddy cronesberry , the chairman of middlesbrough 's disabled supporters club was in stuttgart for the game .
" most of the disabled supporters were stopped from entering once the alarm went off , but those supporters in the ground had no idea what was happening . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traveling fans were impressed by stuttgart 's stadium " despite that , i was very impressed by the stadium and the safety measures although access could have been better .
we only had a couple of thousand fans and the two gates for the away end still made it tight .
a large contingent may have bigger problems . " " the germans are the best at organizing anything and have had a lot of experience of big sporting events .
i have no concerns about safety for fans in the german stadiums .
i think the attitudes of people are the most important thing .
if you go with a positive one , you will help the world cup be a huge success .

it 's the biggest overhaul of germany 's governmental system and will require 40 constitutional amendments . the long-awaited federalism reform is expected to newly regulate the jurisdictions of the federal government and germany 's 16 states . the latter are generally responsible for making laws - a concept that forms the basis of the original idea of federalism , according to herbert von arnim , a professor at the university for administrative sciences in speyer . " states are closer to the citizens , " he said .
" they know what things are like on the ground and find it easier to adjust rules to the needs of the people .
they can also compete with each other , meaning that the best system will succeed in the end . " historic foundation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto von bismarck became germany 's first chancellor in 1871 after uniting the country under the prussian crown germany 's principle of federalism has its roots in history . for centuries , germany consisted of autonomous principalities and so-called " free cities . "
this patchwork quilt long resisted any attempts for unification .
when the german reich was eventually founded in 1871 , individual states still did n't hand over much sovereignty . some of this diversity has been preserved today , such as in the area of culture .
few countries have as many opera houses and theaters as germany . " federalism clearly brings about diversity , " said martin molok , a law professor at düsseldorf university .
" it encourages progress .
if we have different model , we can test which one works best and choose it . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : theodor heuss germany 's nazi dictatorship also influenced the postwar constitution , which was meant to prevent a concentration of power in berlin .
germany 's first federal president , theodor heuss , declared his support for federalism in september 1949 . " we are a federal republic , " he said .
" we do n't want centralism in german .
we have behind us the lesson of national socialism that showed us what happens when germans are meant to fit a norm .
we do n't want that . " federal rights increase but there are cases - by now a majority - where the federal government has the power to legislate . " there are a number of areas , such as foreign policy , where it would not make sense to leave it up to the states , " morlok said , adding that globalization has increased the number of areas where laws are made in the country 's administrative center . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr is a federal matter defense , trade and currency issues and transport are fields were federal legislation is warranted .
in other areas , states can only adopt laws if the federal government has not done so already .
this includes social , civil and criminal law .
the federal state also regulates almost everything that has to do with immigration . the states maintain jurisdiction over police and education matters .
but even in these areas , states are increasingly coordinating their decisions . " there are no less than 1,000 coordinating committees , " von arnim said . adding the eu layer adding to the confusion is the supranational level of the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu also has a say when it comes to agriculture " we have some areas , such as agriculture and environmental protection , where the basic guidelines come from brussels and national parliaments have to turn them into law , " morlok said .
" that means that federal and state governments have to deal with this one after the other .
and that leads to people being totally confused about who is in charge . " reacting to a waning right to legislate , states have been trying to influence federal legislation .
since they have to approve regulations that affect them directly , if they reject them in germany 's upper house , the bundesrat , proposed legislation can not become law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the bundesrat have to approve fewer federal laws in the future ?
the number of laws that require state approval has risen from 40 percent to 60 percent , allowing states to block laws in power struggles with the national government .
this happened frequently under the previous red-green coalition as the bundesrat was controlled by the christian democratic opposition . federalism reform is meant to untie these sometimes gnarled interconnections and make the state more effective again . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chancellor merkel riding high after first 100 days the dire predictions once made about germany 's current " grand coalition " government have proven untrue .

protestors were heading rallying calls against plans by some state and local authorities to increase the working week from 38.5 hours to 40 or more and to cut christmas and holiday bonuses . around 6,000 teachers represented by the gew union also held demonstrations outside kindergartens , schools and universities in berlin thursday , further boosting the numbers of protestors on the german streets . the strikes have been gaining momentum in their fifth week and the turnout on the day before the services union verdi was due to hold talks with employers was an obvious sign of the growing discontent around germany at the idea of extending working hours . the industrial action is also making a visible impact on german cities and towns , where piles of uncollected rubbish are growing and kindergartens , hospitals and public administration services are becoming increasingly disrupted . while union and employer negotiators are due to hold talks on friday , prospects of reaching a deal look slim , especially since verdi rejected an offer from municipal employers in the southern state of baden-württemberg on wednesday which the employers said went to " the absolute limit . " warring sides show no sign of securing a deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verdi 's frank bsirske rallies a crowd of protestors " i 'm skeptical , " hartmut möllring , chief negotiator for tarifgemeinschaft der länder -lrb- tdl -rrb- , the state employers ' umbrella organization , told reporters when asked about the prospects of a deal being reached by the end of this week . the employers ' organization has been accused by verdi of deliberately dragging the conflict out in a bid to make the strike unpopular and to overshadow the protestors ' objectives . according to the bdb banking association , whose 200 member banks include deutsche bank ag and hvb group , a prolonged disruption of services would also pose a risk to a domestic economy that 's recovering after five years of stagnation . " the policy of möllring and company threatens the interests of hundreds of thousands .
it 's a declaration of war against the people in this country , " verdi chief frank bsirske told a demonstration attended by around 20,000 people in hanover .
the union says the move would endanger the jobs of some 250,000 part time and trainee workers . strikes gaining support in engineering sector the services dispute is already beginning to spread to other areas of german industry , namely the engineering sector , the country 's biggest , with 3.4 million employees . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the strikes could massively grow if the powerful ig metall union joins engineering union ig metall has been calling brief walkouts during shifts ever since pay contracts ran out on feb .

protestors were heading rallying calls against plans by some state and local authorities to increase the working week from 38.5 hours to 40 or more and to cut christmas and holiday bonuses . around 6,000 teachers represented by the gew union also held demonstrations outside kindergartens , schools and universities in berlin thursday , further boosting the numbers of protestors on the german streets . the strikes have been gaining momentum in their fifth week and the turnout on the day before the services union verdi was due to hold talks with employers was an obvious sign of the growing discontent around germany at the idea of extending working hours . the industrial action is also making a visible impact on german cities and towns , where piles of uncollected rubbish are growing and kindergartens , hospitals and public administration services are becoming increasingly disrupted . while union and employer negotiators are due to hold talks on friday , prospects of reaching a deal look slim , especially since verdi rejected an offer from municipal employers in the southern state of baden-württemberg on wednesday which the employers said went to " the absolute limit . " warring sides show no sign of securing a deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verdi 's frank bsirske rallies a crowd of protestors " i 'm skeptical , " hartmut möllring , chief negotiator for tarifgemeinschaft der länder -lrb- tdl -rrb- , the state employers ' umbrella organization , told reporters when asked about the prospects of a deal being reached by the end of this week . the employers ' organization has been accused by verdi of deliberately dragging the conflict out in a bid to make the strike unpopular and to overshadow the protestors ' objectives . according to the bdb banking association , whose 200 member banks include deutsche bank ag and hvb group , a prolonged disruption of services would also pose a risk to a domestic economy that 's recovering after five years of stagnation . " the policy of möllring and company threatens the interests of hundreds of thousands .
it 's a declaration of war against the people in this country , " verdi chief frank bsirske told a demonstration attended by around 20,000 people in hanover .
the union says the move would endanger the jobs of some 250,000 part time and trainee workers . strikes gaining support in engineering sector the services dispute is already beginning to spread to other areas of german industry , namely the engineering sector , the country 's biggest , with 3.4 million employees . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the strikes could massively grow if the powerful ig metall union joins engineering union ig metall has been calling brief walkouts during shifts ever since pay contracts ran out on feb .
28 .
last week , 10,000 workers from daimlerchrysler and bosch in baden-württemberg left their posts to join the protest . the engineering and metal workers may extend their action by staging one-day strikes after march 28 , the day a so-called peace period barring unlimited protests expires , unless a new wage agreement is reached in the next three weeks . as well as disrupting industry and services , the strikes could have a political impact , with state elections in baden-württemberg and rhineland-palatinate in the southwest and in saxony-anhalt in the east to be held on march 26 , the first since the grand coalition of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union and the social democrats took power in november . in an interview in berlin on thursday , guido westerwelle , the leader of the free market liberal free democratic party , the largest opposition group in the national parliament , said the government has " encouraged " the strikes by " unilaterally " raising taxes and ending tax breaks . westerwelle said decisions by merkel 's government to increase value-added tax , end homebuyers ' subsidies and reduce tax breaks for holiday work and commuters are adding to workers ' " grief .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.03.2006 opposition criticizes federalism reform plan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : balancing federal and state interests : merkel with german states ' coat of arms on stars both houses of germany 's parliament on friday debated the draft of the country 's so-called federalism reform - a mammoth piece of legislation that includes more than 20 changes to the german constitution . german chancellor angela merkel and the premiers of the 16 federal states brought the reform before the german parliament in a joint effort to overhaul the country 's complex federal system . the amendments are deemed crucial in streamlining political decision-making in germany that has increasingly become a drawn-out affair with legislation being substantially watered down at the end of the process . but in spite of substantial agreement between federal and state governments , the " mother of all reforms , " as one of its authors called it , still has a rocky road ahead of it .
speakers for the opposition in parliament called it a monster .
they feel it can not take care of the task of untangling the web of interlocking powers between federal and state governments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast served as minister for agriculture and consumer protection in the previous government " the reform was meant to separate powers , but it now does n't , " said renate künast , the parliamentary leader of the greens party .
" it was meant to speed up decision-making and tackle the huge challenges facing germany .
on all of this the reform fails .
what was supposed to be the masterpiece of the grand coalition government has become a bungled piece of legislation that wo n't bring germany forward . " current system blocks legislation currently around 60 percent of german laws have to be approved by both chambers of parliament , the bundestag and the bundesrat , which represents the states .
this system has led to a blockade of important legislation in the past when the two houses have been controlled by different parties .
if ratified , the new bill would substantially reduce the number of laws which the bundesrat can veto . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesrat in session in exchange for the concessions by the states , the central government in berlin has been forced to relinquish powers in areas such as education , the environment , the penal system and the civil service .
opposition parties therefore accused chancellor angela merkel of fostering separatist tendencies among state leaders who are bent on destroying national solidarity . in times of limited finances , they warned , this would lead to a race for the lowest standards in environmental protection and public administration , and foster growing inequality in education . government mulls changes to reform this fear was even shared by peter struck , parliamentary leader of the social democrats . although the spd ministers in chancellor merkel 's cabinet are supporting the draft , he openly called for changes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter struck does n't want to rush things " simply because the bill has been brought into parliament , this does n't mean we adopt it all at once , " he said .
" there is no doubt that a reform is necessary .
but this draft can not be the last word on it and parliamentary deputies have every right to change it according to their convictions . " but klaus wowereit , the social democrat mayor of the city-state of berlin , warned against unraveling the hard-won compromise . " if all those who have not seen their wishes fulfilled start demanding changes , we 'll end up in a difficult situation , " he said .
" in this case i expect the reform to founder in the end . " but some voices in the bundesrat said they were worried that the poorer states could suffer from the reforms . both houses of parliament must pass the bill with a two-thirds majority before the constitutional amendments can go through .
the reform is the first key domestic hurdle for chancellor angela merkel and a major test of the ability of her grand coalition government to sell controversial measures not only to the public at large but also to its own members of parliament . uwe hessler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany starts constitutional overhaul germany 's parliament on friday is starting the process of reforming the country 's federal structure .

for germans , the reporting of the world cup preparation process has become almost a daily soap opera but how do issues such as the struggles with hooliganism , security and stadium safety look to those outside germany ? inside germany 's borders , the country 's world cup preparations - with all their successes and failures - have been followed almost daily by the media .
as a result , even the most mundane twists and turns of the process have been reported and passed on to the public .
people in germany are now either very well informed or fed up with the whole thing . but the world cup , of course , is not just a german event .
from the beginning of june , the teams and supporters of 31 other countries will begin to descend on germany for the actual tournament . while the world cup soap opera has been playing almost constantly in the host country since it was awarded the championships in 2002 , the other participating countries have had other things on their minds , like qualification and their own chances of lifting the trophy . so have such widely debated topics as security , stadium safety and ticket allocation made any impact outside germany ?
do the other nations really care about the preparations as long as the world cup takes place ? patrice armand of the french football supporters union remembers the build up to france 's tournament in 1998 , the last world cup to be played on european soil .
" in france it felt like we were cut off from the rest of the world while preparing for the tournament in 1998 , " he said . the french faced a number of similar challenges to the germans in the build-up to their world cup but armand believes germany has had a tougher job this time round . a changing world with changing challenges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french celebrated after preparation stress subsided " the world has changed dramatically since 1998 .
germany has had to deal with the increased threat from international terrorism , something that was less of a worry for france eight years ago .
i think germany is doing the best it can to protect the world cup from attack but it could do more . " when asked if he thought the german army should be deployed as an added security force , armand said : " that is an issue for the germans to decide .
for the french , it would be no problem but we do not have such a weight of history on us as the germans do .
i think the germans should do whatever it takes to secure the world cup . " france suffered from the scourge of hooliganism in ' 98 and the germans are hoping they have learnt from the lessons of the past .
they have prepared a plan for dealing with the threat , specifically from renowned hooligans and bitter rivals from england and the netherlands . judge us on behavior , not reputation , say england fans with the german police under orders to watch these sets of fans in particular , what feeling does that create in these countries in the build-up to the tournament ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : england fans have worked hard to change perceptions " england fans want to be judged on their behavior and not their reputation , " said andrin cooper from the english football association -lrb- fa -rrb- .
" our fans have made huge strides in recent years to change perceptions .
we had just one arrest at euro 2004 in portugal and none at the 2002 world cup . " " the fa is expecting a great world cup in a real football country with a real football culture .
germany has great infrastructure and great stadiums and the organizing committee and host cities have really made an effort to welcome everyone with open arms .
we 're confident it will be a successful , safe world cup . " dutch expert fears open-space hooliganism ron elsker , an expert on dutch soccer hooliganism , agreed but had concerns about security away from the stadiums .
" i think the idea of having public viewing areas is unavoidable considering the demand for the world cup , but i also feel that the germans have dug themselves into a hole with this idea , " elsker said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the idea of " fanparks " has some security experts concerned " i do n't think they are prepared enough to deal with the potential for violence at these events .
a stadium is one thing , a wide open public place is a lot harder to police . " even if the stadiums are secure when it comes to potential violence , there have been concerns raised about the condition and safety precautions in place at the grounds . after a widely reported spat between the organizing committee and consumer watchdog magazine stiftung warentest over a report that four world cup stadiums had inadequate safety measures in place , a recent uefa cup clash between stuttgart and english team middlesbrough at the gottlieb daimler stadium once again raised these concerns . no safety fears for fans despite stuttgart incident a burst pipe in a kitchen caused an alert 30 minutes before kick-off and the announcements which followed were made in german , with no translation , meaning many boro fans remained in their seats during the evacuation . paddy cronesberry , the chairman of middlesbrough 's disabled supporters club was in stuttgart for the game .
" most of the disabled supporters were stopped from entering once the alarm went off , but those supporters in the ground had no idea what was happening . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traveling fans were impressed by stuttgart 's stadium " despite that , i was very impressed by the stadium and the safety measures although access could have been better .
we only had a couple of thousand fans and the two gates for the away end still made it tight .
a large contingent may have bigger problems . " " the germans are the best at organizing anything and have had a lot of experience of big sporting events .
i have no concerns about safety for fans in the german stadiums .
i think the attitudes of people are the most important thing .
if you go with a positive one , you will help the world cup be a huge success .

the court revealed that it is believed that at least one of the offers of payment was accepted .
the court also refused to acknowledge or deny any connection with the match fixing operation involving hoyzer . the dfb also revealed that it was carrying out its own investigation into the possibility that matches in the amateur regional league might have been fixed this season after hearing claims to that effect .
the dfb said in a statement that it had no evidence yet and had handed all relevant information to the state prosecutors in frankfurt . no refereeing or top tier involvement , dfb says the ruling body was quick to add that the current probe had so far shown that the new cases of match fixing were nowhere near as large as those of last year and that there had been no evidence as yet to indicate the top tier of the game had been infiltrated or officials bribed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dfb 's theo zwanziger promised swift action " we have to state clearly that , according to the results of the ongoing investigation , no referee is involved and no first division club is concerned , " dfb chief executive theo zwanziger said in a statement .
" as long as there is money circulating around games , sadly , you can not rule out manipulation and cheating , " zwanziger added . " the dfb has been investigating for several weeks .
there was a very small suspicion of a criminal act and we decided that in the interests of a clear explanation we would work together with the investigators , " zwanziger continued .
" if anything is confirmed , it will be investigated and action will be taken .
those involved will be removed , and that includes from football circles . " retrial possibility in hoyzer case meanwhile the hoyzer scandal threatens to surface once more to add further insult to injury after it was revealed that the disgraced referee was not the official at one of the matches that he was accused of fixing and that as this was included in the court case against him , the mistake may lead to a retrial . legal experts were investigating the claim and the prospect of the case returning to court .
the dfb will be hoping that no mistake was made but if there was , the retrial is scheduled for sometime after july 9 this year - the day of the world cup final . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ex-bundesliga player jailed for fixing matches former fc chemitz player steffen karl received a nine-month suspended sentence and 50 hours of community service for his part in the match-fixing scandal that shook german soccer to its core .

for germans , the reporting of the world cup preparation process has become almost a daily soap opera but how do issues such as the struggles with hooliganism , security and stadium safety look to those outside germany ? inside germany 's borders , the country 's world cup preparations - with all their successes and failures - have been followed almost daily by the media .
as a result , even the most mundane twists and turns of the process have been reported and passed on to the public .
people in germany are now either very well informed or fed up with the whole thing . but the world cup , of course , is not just a german event .
from the beginning of june , the teams and supporters of 31 other countries will begin to descend on germany for the actual tournament . while the world cup soap opera has been playing almost constantly in the host country since it was awarded the championships in 2002 , the other participating countries have had other things on their minds , like qualification and their own chances of lifting the trophy . so have such widely debated topics as security , stadium safety and ticket allocation made any impact outside germany ?
do the other nations really care about the preparations as long as the world cup takes place ? patrice armand of the french football supporters union remembers the build up to france 's tournament in 1998 , the last world cup to be played on european soil .
" in france it felt like we were cut off from the rest of the world while preparing for the tournament in 1998 , " he said . the french faced a number of similar challenges to the germans in the build-up to their world cup but armand believes germany has had a tougher job this time round . a changing world with changing challenges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french celebrated after preparation stress subsided " the world has changed dramatically since 1998 .
germany has had to deal with the increased threat from international terrorism , something that was less of a worry for france eight years ago .
i think germany is doing the best it can to protect the world cup from attack but it could do more . " when asked if he thought the german army should be deployed as an added security force , armand said : " that is an issue for the germans to decide .
for the french , it would be no problem but we do not have such a weight of history on us as the germans do .
i think the germans should do whatever it takes to secure the world cup . " france suffered from the scourge of hooliganism in ' 98 and the germans are hoping they have learnt from the lessons of the past .
they have prepared a plan for dealing with the threat , specifically from renowned hooligans and bitter rivals from england and the netherlands . judge us on behavior , not reputation , say england fans with the german police under orders to watch these sets of fans in particular , what feeling does that create in these countries in the build-up to the tournament ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : england fans have worked hard to change perceptions " england fans want to be judged on their behavior and not their reputation , " said andrin cooper from the english football association -lrb- fa -rrb- .
" our fans have made huge strides in recent years to change perceptions .
we had just one arrest at euro 2004 in portugal and none at the 2002 world cup . " " the fa is expecting a great world cup in a real football country with a real football culture .
germany has great infrastructure and great stadiums and the organizing committee and host cities have really made an effort to welcome everyone with open arms .
we 're confident it will be a successful , safe world cup . " dutch expert fears open-space hooliganism ron elsker , an expert on dutch soccer hooliganism , agreed but had concerns about security away from the stadiums .
" i think the idea of having public viewing areas is unavoidable considering the demand for the world cup , but i also feel that the germans have dug themselves into a hole with this idea , " elsker said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the idea of " fanparks " has some security experts concerned " i do n't think they are prepared enough to deal with the potential for violence at these events .
a stadium is one thing , a wide open public place is a lot harder to police . " even if the stadiums are secure when it comes to potential violence , there have been concerns raised about the condition and safety precautions in place at the grounds . after a widely reported spat between the organizing committee and consumer watchdog magazine stiftung warentest over a report that four world cup stadiums had inadequate safety measures in place , a recent uefa cup clash between stuttgart and english team middlesbrough at the gottlieb daimler stadium once again raised these concerns . no safety fears for fans despite stuttgart incident a burst pipe in a kitchen caused an alert 30 minutes before kick-off and the announcements which followed were made in german , with no translation , meaning many boro fans remained in their seats during the evacuation . paddy cronesberry , the chairman of middlesbrough 's disabled supporters club was in stuttgart for the game .
" most of the disabled supporters were stopped from entering once the alarm went off , but those supporters in the ground had no idea what was happening . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traveling fans were impressed by stuttgart 's stadium " despite that , i was very impressed by the stadium and the safety measures although access could have been better .
we only had a couple of thousand fans and the two gates for the away end still made it tight .
a large contingent may have bigger problems . " " the germans are the best at organizing anything and have had a lot of experience of big sporting events .
i have no concerns about safety for fans in the german stadiums .
i think the attitudes of people are the most important thing .
if you go with a positive one , you will help the world cup be a huge success .

it 's the biggest overhaul of germany 's governmental system and will require 40 constitutional amendments . the long-awaited federalism reform is expected to newly regulate the jurisdictions of the federal government and germany 's 16 states . the latter are generally responsible for making laws - a concept that forms the basis of the original idea of federalism , according to herbert von arnim , a professor at the university for administrative sciences in speyer . " states are closer to the citizens , " he said .
" they know what things are like on the ground and find it easier to adjust rules to the needs of the people .
they can also compete with each other , meaning that the best system will succeed in the end . " historic foundation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto von bismarck became germany 's first chancellor in 1871 after uniting the country under the prussian crown germany 's principle of federalism has its roots in history . for centuries , germany consisted of autonomous principalities and so-called " free cities . "
this patchwork quilt long resisted any attempts for unification .
when the german reich was eventually founded in 1871 , individual states still did n't hand over much sovereignty . some of this diversity has been preserved today , such as in the area of culture .
few countries have as many opera houses and theaters as germany . " federalism clearly brings about diversity , " said martin molok , a law professor at düsseldorf university .
" it encourages progress .
if we have different model , we can test which one works best and choose it . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : theodor heuss germany 's nazi dictatorship also influenced the postwar constitution , which was meant to prevent a concentration of power in berlin .
germany 's first federal president , theodor heuss , declared his support for federalism in september 1949 . " we are a federal republic , " he said .
" we do n't want centralism in german .
we have behind us the lesson of national socialism that showed us what happens when germans are meant to fit a norm .
we do n't want that . " federal rights increase but there are cases - by now a majority - where the federal government has the power to legislate . " there are a number of areas , such as foreign policy , where it would not make sense to leave it up to the states , " morlok said , adding that globalization has increased the number of areas where laws are made in the country 's administrative center . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr is a federal matter defense , trade and currency issues and transport are fields were federal legislation is warranted .
in other areas , states can only adopt laws if the federal government has not done so already .
this includes social , civil and criminal law .
the federal state also regulates almost everything that has to do with immigration . the states maintain jurisdiction over police and education matters .
but even in these areas , states are increasingly coordinating their decisions . " there are no less than 1,000 coordinating committees , " von arnim said . adding the eu layer adding to the confusion is the supranational level of the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu also has a say when it comes to agriculture " we have some areas , such as agriculture and environmental protection , where the basic guidelines come from brussels and national parliaments have to turn them into law , " morlok said .
" that means that federal and state governments have to deal with this one after the other .
and that leads to people being totally confused about who is in charge . " reacting to a waning right to legislate , states have been trying to influence federal legislation .
since they have to approve regulations that affect them directly , if they reject them in germany 's upper house , the bundesrat , proposed legislation can not become law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the bundesrat have to approve fewer federal laws in the future ?
the number of laws that require state approval has risen from 40 percent to 60 percent , allowing states to block laws in power struggles with the national government .
this happened frequently under the previous red-green coalition as the bundesrat was controlled by the christian democratic opposition . federalism reform is meant to untie these sometimes gnarled interconnections and make the state more effective again . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chancellor merkel riding high after first 100 days the dire predictions once made about germany 's current " grand coalition " government have proven untrue .

the court revealed that it is believed that at least one of the offers of payment was accepted .
the court also refused to acknowledge or deny any connection with the match fixing operation involving hoyzer . the dfb also revealed that it was carrying out its own investigation into the possibility that matches in the amateur regional league might have been fixed this season after hearing claims to that effect .
the dfb said in a statement that it had no evidence yet and had handed all relevant information to the state prosecutors in frankfurt . no refereeing or top tier involvement , dfb says the ruling body was quick to add that the current probe had so far shown that the new cases of match fixing were nowhere near as large as those of last year and that there had been no evidence as yet to indicate the top tier of the game had been infiltrated or officials bribed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dfb 's theo zwanziger promised swift action " we have to state clearly that , according to the results of the ongoing investigation , no referee is involved and no first division club is concerned , " dfb chief executive theo zwanziger said in a statement .
" as long as there is money circulating around games , sadly , you can not rule out manipulation and cheating , " zwanziger added . " the dfb has been investigating for several weeks .
there was a very small suspicion of a criminal act and we decided that in the interests of a clear explanation we would work together with the investigators , " zwanziger continued .
" if anything is confirmed , it will be investigated and action will be taken .
those involved will be removed , and that includes from football circles . " retrial possibility in hoyzer case meanwhile the hoyzer scandal threatens to surface once more to add further insult to injury after it was revealed that the disgraced referee was not the official at one of the matches that he was accused of fixing and that as this was included in the court case against him , the mistake may lead to a retrial . legal experts were investigating the claim and the prospect of the case returning to court .
the dfb will be hoping that no mistake was made but if there was , the retrial is scheduled for sometime after july 9 this year - the day of the world cup final . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ex-bundesliga player jailed for fixing matches former fc chemitz player steffen karl received a nine-month suspended sentence and 50 hours of community service for his part in the match-fixing scandal that shook german soccer to its core .

it 's the biggest overhaul of germany 's governmental system and will require 40 constitutional amendments . the long-awaited federalism reform is expected to newly regulate the jurisdictions of the federal government and germany 's 16 states . the latter are generally responsible for making laws - a concept that forms the basis of the original idea of federalism , according to herbert von arnim , a professor at the university for administrative sciences in speyer . " states are closer to the citizens , " he said .
" they know what things are like on the ground and find it easier to adjust rules to the needs of the people .
they can also compete with each other , meaning that the best system will succeed in the end . " historic foundation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto von bismarck became germany 's first chancellor in 1871 after uniting the country under the prussian crown germany 's principle of federalism has its roots in history . for centuries , germany consisted of autonomous principalities and so-called " free cities . "
this patchwork quilt long resisted any attempts for unification .
when the german reich was eventually founded in 1871 , individual states still did n't hand over much sovereignty . some of this diversity has been preserved today , such as in the area of culture .
few countries have as many opera houses and theaters as germany . " federalism clearly brings about diversity , " said martin molok , a law professor at düsseldorf university .
" it encourages progress .
if we have different model , we can test which one works best and choose it . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : theodor heuss germany 's nazi dictatorship also influenced the postwar constitution , which was meant to prevent a concentration of power in berlin .
germany 's first federal president , theodor heuss , declared his support for federalism in september 1949 . " we are a federal republic , " he said .
" we do n't want centralism in german .
we have behind us the lesson of national socialism that showed us what happens when germans are meant to fit a norm .

it 's the biggest overhaul of germany 's governmental system and will require 40 constitutional amendments . the long-awaited federalism reform is expected to newly regulate the jurisdictions of the federal government and germany 's 16 states . the latter are generally responsible for making laws - a concept that forms the basis of the original idea of federalism , according to herbert von arnim , a professor at the university for administrative sciences in speyer . " states are closer to the citizens , " he said .
" they know what things are like on the ground and find it easier to adjust rules to the needs of the people .
they can also compete with each other , meaning that the best system will succeed in the end . " historic foundation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto von bismarck became germany 's first chancellor in 1871 after uniting the country under the prussian crown germany 's principle of federalism has its roots in history . for centuries , germany consisted of autonomous principalities and so-called " free cities . "
this patchwork quilt long resisted any attempts for unification .
when the german reich was eventually founded in 1871 , individual states still did n't hand over much sovereignty . some of this diversity has been preserved today , such as in the area of culture .
few countries have as many opera houses and theaters as germany . " federalism clearly brings about diversity , " said martin molok , a law professor at düsseldorf university .
" it encourages progress .
if we have different model , we can test which one works best and choose it . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : theodor heuss germany 's nazi dictatorship also influenced the postwar constitution , which was meant to prevent a concentration of power in berlin .
germany 's first federal president , theodor heuss , declared his support for federalism in september 1949 . " we are a federal republic , " he said .
" we do n't want centralism in german .
we have behind us the lesson of national socialism that showed us what happens when germans are meant to fit a norm .
we do n't want that . " federal rights increase but there are cases - by now a majority - where the federal government has the power to legislate .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.03.2006 opposition criticizes federalism reform plan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : balancing federal and state interests : merkel with german states ' coat of arms on stars both houses of germany 's parliament on friday debated the draft of the country 's so-called federalism reform - a mammoth piece of legislation that includes more than 20 changes to the german constitution . german chancellor angela merkel and the premiers of the 16 federal states brought the reform before the german parliament in a joint effort to overhaul the country 's complex federal system . the amendments are deemed crucial in streamlining political decision-making in germany that has increasingly become a drawn-out affair with legislation being substantially watered down at the end of the process . but in spite of substantial agreement between federal and state governments , the " mother of all reforms , " as one of its authors called it , still has a rocky road ahead of it .
speakers for the opposition in parliament called it a monster .
they feel it can not take care of the task of untangling the web of interlocking powers between federal and state governments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast served as minister for agriculture and consumer protection in the previous government " the reform was meant to separate powers , but it now does n't , " said renate künast , the parliamentary leader of the greens party .
" it was meant to speed up decision-making and tackle the huge challenges facing germany .
on all of this the reform fails .
what was supposed to be the masterpiece of the grand coalition government has become a bungled piece of legislation that wo n't bring germany forward . " current system blocks legislation currently around 60 percent of german laws have to be approved by both chambers of parliament , the bundestag and the bundesrat , which represents the states .
this system has led to a blockade of important legislation in the past when the two houses have been controlled by different parties .
if ratified , the new bill would substantially reduce the number of laws which the bundesrat can veto . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesrat in session in exchange for the concessions by the states , the central government in berlin has been forced to relinquish powers in areas such as education , the environment , the penal system and the civil service .
opposition parties therefore accused chancellor angela merkel of fostering separatist tendencies among state leaders who are bent on destroying national solidarity . in times of limited finances , they warned , this would lead to a race for the lowest standards in environmental protection and public administration , and foster growing inequality in education . government mulls changes to reform this fear was even shared by peter struck , parliamentary leader of the social democrats . although the spd ministers in chancellor merkel 's cabinet are supporting the draft , he openly called for changes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter struck does n't want to rush things " simply because the bill has been brought into parliament , this does n't mean we adopt it all at once , " he said .
" there is no doubt that a reform is necessary .
but this draft can not be the last word on it and parliamentary deputies have every right to change it according to their convictions . " but klaus wowereit , the social democrat mayor of the city-state of berlin , warned against unraveling the hard-won compromise . " if all those who have not seen their wishes fulfilled start demanding changes , we 'll end up in a difficult situation , " he said .
" in this case i expect the reform to founder in the end . " but some voices in the bundesrat said they were worried that the poorer states could suffer from the reforms . both houses of parliament must pass the bill with a two-thirds majority before the constitutional amendments can go through .
the reform is the first key domestic hurdle for chancellor angela merkel and a major test of the ability of her grand coalition government to sell controversial measures not only to the public at large but also to its own members of parliament . uwe hessler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany starts constitutional overhaul germany 's parliament on friday is starting the process of reforming the country 's federal structure .

for germans , the reporting of the world cup preparation process has become almost a daily soap opera but how do issues such as the struggles with hooliganism , security and stadium safety look to those outside germany ? inside germany 's borders , the country 's world cup preparations - with all their successes and failures - have been followed almost daily by the media .
as a result , even the most mundane twists and turns of the process have been reported and passed on to the public .
people in germany are now either very well informed or fed up with the whole thing . but the world cup , of course , is not just a german event .
from the beginning of june , the teams and supporters of 31 other countries will begin to descend on germany for the actual tournament . while the world cup soap opera has been playing almost constantly in the host country since it was awarded the championships in 2002 , the other participating countries have had other things on their minds , like qualification and their own chances of lifting the trophy . so have such widely debated topics as security , stadium safety and ticket allocation made any impact outside germany ?
do the other nations really care about the preparations as long as the world cup takes place ? patrice armand of the french football supporters union remembers the build up to france 's tournament in 1998 , the last world cup to be played on european soil .
" in france it felt like we were cut off from the rest of the world while preparing for the tournament in 1998 , " he said . the french faced a number of similar challenges to the germans in the build-up to their world cup but armand believes germany has had a tougher job this time round . a changing world with changing challenges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french celebrated after preparation stress subsided " the world has changed dramatically since 1998 .
germany has had to deal with the increased threat from international terrorism , something that was less of a worry for france eight years ago .
i think germany is doing the best it can to protect the world cup from attack but it could do more . " when asked if he thought the german army should be deployed as an added security force , armand said : " that is an issue for the germans to decide .
for the french , it would be no problem but we do not have such a weight of history on us as the germans do .
i think the germans should do whatever it takes to secure the world cup . " france suffered from the scourge of hooliganism in ' 98 and the germans are hoping they have learnt from the lessons of the past .
they have prepared a plan for dealing with the threat , specifically from renowned hooligans and bitter rivals from england and the netherlands . judge us on behavior , not reputation , say england fans with the german police under orders to watch these sets of fans in particular , what feeling does that create in these countries in the build-up to the tournament ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : england fans have worked hard to change perceptions " england fans want to be judged on their behavior and not their reputation , " said andrin cooper from the english football association -lrb- fa -rrb- .
" our fans have made huge strides in recent years to change perceptions .
we had just one arrest at euro 2004 in portugal and none at the 2002 world cup . " " the fa is expecting a great world cup in a real football country with a real football culture .
germany has great infrastructure and great stadiums and the organizing committee and host cities have really made an effort to welcome everyone with open arms .
we 're confident it will be a successful , safe world cup . " dutch expert fears open-space hooliganism ron elsker , an expert on dutch soccer hooliganism , agreed but had concerns about security away from the stadiums .
" i think the idea of having public viewing areas is unavoidable considering the demand for the world cup , but i also feel that the germans have dug themselves into a hole with this idea , " elsker said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the idea of " fanparks " has some security experts concerned " i do n't think they are prepared enough to deal with the potential for violence at these events .
a stadium is one thing , a wide open public place is a lot harder to police . " even if the stadiums are secure when it comes to potential violence , there have been concerns raised about the condition and safety precautions in place at the grounds . after a widely reported spat between the organizing committee and consumer watchdog magazine stiftung warentest over a report that four world cup stadiums had inadequate safety measures in place , a recent uefa cup clash between stuttgart and english team middlesbrough at the gottlieb daimler stadium once again raised these concerns . no safety fears for fans despite stuttgart incident a burst pipe in a kitchen caused an alert 30 minutes before kick-off and the announcements which followed were made in german , with no translation , meaning many boro fans remained in their seats during the evacuation . paddy cronesberry , the chairman of middlesbrough 's disabled supporters club was in stuttgart for the game .
" most of the disabled supporters were stopped from entering once the alarm went off , but those supporters in the ground had no idea what was happening . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traveling fans were impressed by stuttgart 's stadium " despite that , i was very impressed by the stadium and the safety measures although access could have been better .
we only had a couple of thousand fans and the two gates for the away end still made it tight .
a large contingent may have bigger problems . " " the germans are the best at organizing anything and have had a lot of experience of big sporting events .
i have no concerns about safety for fans in the german stadiums .
i think the attitudes of people are the most important thing .
if you go with a positive one , you will help the world cup be a huge success .

for germans , the reporting of the world cup preparation process has become almost a daily soap opera but how do issues such as the struggles with hooliganism , security and stadium safety look to those outside germany ? inside germany 's borders , the country 's world cup preparations - with all their successes and failures - have been followed almost daily by the media .
as a result , even the most mundane twists and turns of the process have been reported and passed on to the public .
people in germany are now either very well informed or fed up with the whole thing . but the world cup , of course , is not just a german event .
from the beginning of june , the teams and supporters of 31 other countries will begin to descend on germany for the actual tournament . while the world cup soap opera has been playing almost constantly in the host country since it was awarded the championships in 2002 , the other participating countries have had other things on their minds , like qualification and their own chances of lifting the trophy . so have such widely debated topics as security , stadium safety and ticket allocation made any impact outside germany ?
do the other nations really care about the preparations as long as the world cup takes place ? patrice armand of the french football supporters union remembers the build up to france 's tournament in 1998 , the last world cup to be played on european soil .
" in france it felt like we were cut off from the rest of the world while preparing for the tournament in 1998 , " he said . the french faced a number of similar challenges to the germans in the build-up to their world cup but armand believes germany has had a tougher job this time round . a changing world with changing challenges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french celebrated after preparation stress subsided " the world has changed dramatically since 1998 .

i think the germans should do whatever it takes to secure the world cup . " france suffered from the scourge of hooliganism in ' 98 and the germans are hoping they have learnt from the lessons of the past .

germany has great infrastructure and great stadiums and the organizing committee and host cities have really made an effort to welcome everyone with open arms .
we 're confident it will be a successful , safe world cup . " dutch expert fears open-space hooliganism ron elsker , an expert on dutch soccer hooliganism , agreed but had concerns about security away from the stadiums .

a stadium is one thing , a wide open public place is a lot harder to police . " even if the stadiums are secure when it comes to potential violence , there have been concerns raised about the condition and safety precautions in place at the grounds . after a widely reported spat between the organizing committee and consumer watchdog magazine stiftung warentest over a report that four world cup stadiums had inadequate safety measures in place , a recent uefa cup clash between stuttgart and english team middlesbrough at the gottlieb daimler stadium once again raised these concerns . no safety fears for fans despite stuttgart incident a burst pipe in a kitchen caused an alert 30 minutes before kick-off and the announcements which followed were made in german , with no translation , meaning many boro fans remained in their seats during the evacuation . paddy cronesberry , the chairman of middlesbrough 's disabled supporters club was in stuttgart for the game .
" most of the disabled supporters were stopped from entering once the alarm went off , but those supporters in the ground had no idea what was happening . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traveling fans were impressed by stuttgart 's stadium " despite that , i was very impressed by the stadium and the safety measures although access could have been better .

a large contingent may have bigger problems . " " the germans are the best at organizing anything and have had a lot of experience of big sporting events .

for germans , the reporting of the world cup preparation process has become almost a daily soap opera but how do issues such as the struggles with hooliganism , security and stadium safety look to those outside germany ? inside germany 's borders , the country 's world cup preparations - with all their successes and failures - have been followed almost daily by the media .
as a result , even the most mundane twists and turns of the process have been reported and passed on to the public .
people in germany are now either very well informed or fed up with the whole thing . but the world cup , of course , is not just a german event .
from the beginning of june , the teams and supporters of 31 other countries will begin to descend on germany for the actual tournament . while the world cup soap opera has been playing almost constantly in the host country since it was awarded the championships in 2002 , the other participating countries have had other things on their minds , like qualification and their own chances of lifting the trophy . so have such widely debated topics as security , stadium safety and ticket allocation made any impact outside germany ?

" in france it felt like we were cut off from the rest of the world while preparing for the tournament in 1998 , " he said . the french faced a number of similar challenges to the germans in the build-up to their world cup but armand believes germany has had a tougher job this time round . a changing world with changing challenges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french celebrated after preparation stress subsided " the world has changed dramatically since 1998 .

i think the germans should do whatever it takes to secure the world cup . " france suffered from the scourge of hooliganism in ' 98 and the germans are hoping they have learnt from the lessons of the past .

it 's the biggest overhaul of germany 's governmental system and will require 40 constitutional amendments . the long-awaited federalism reform is expected to newly regulate the jurisdictions of the federal government and germany 's 16 states . the latter are generally responsible for making laws - a concept that forms the basis of the original idea of federalism , according to herbert von arnim , a professor at the university for administrative sciences in speyer . " states are closer to the citizens , " he said .
" they know what things are like on the ground and find it easier to adjust rules to the needs of the people .
they can also compete with each other , meaning that the best system will succeed in the end . " historic foundation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto von bismarck became germany 's first chancellor in 1871 after uniting the country under the prussian crown germany 's principle of federalism has its roots in history . for centuries , germany consisted of autonomous principalities and so-called " free cities . "
this patchwork quilt long resisted any attempts for unification .
when the german reich was eventually founded in 1871 , individual states still did n't hand over much sovereignty . some of this diversity has been preserved today , such as in the area of culture .
few countries have as many opera houses and theaters as germany . " federalism clearly brings about diversity , " said martin molok , a law professor at düsseldorf university .
" it encourages progress .
if we have different model , we can test which one works best and choose it . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : theodor heuss germany 's nazi dictatorship also influenced the postwar constitution , which was meant to prevent a concentration of power in berlin .
germany 's first federal president , theodor heuss , declared his support for federalism in september 1949 . " we are a federal republic , " he said .
" we do n't want centralism in german .
we have behind us the lesson of national socialism that showed us what happens when germans are meant to fit a norm .
we do n't want that . " federal rights increase but there are cases - by now a majority - where the federal government has the power to legislate . " there are a number of areas , such as foreign policy , where it would not make sense to leave it up to the states , " morlok said , adding that globalization has increased the number of areas where laws are made in the country 's administrative center . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr is a federal matter defense , trade and currency issues and transport are fields were federal legislation is warranted .
in other areas , states can only adopt laws if the federal government has not done so already .
this includes social , civil and criminal law .
the federal state also regulates almost everything that has to do with immigration . the states maintain jurisdiction over police and education matters .
but even in these areas , states are increasingly coordinating their decisions . " there are no less than 1,000 coordinating committees , " von arnim said . adding the eu layer adding to the confusion is the supranational level of the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu also has a say when it comes to agriculture " we have some areas , such as agriculture and environmental protection , where the basic guidelines come from brussels and national parliaments have to turn them into law , " morlok said .
" that means that federal and state governments have to deal with this one after the other .
and that leads to people being totally confused about who is in charge . " reacting to a waning right to legislate , states have been trying to influence federal legislation .
since they have to approve regulations that affect them directly , if they reject them in germany 's upper house , the bundesrat , proposed legislation can not become law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the bundesrat have to approve fewer federal laws in the future ?
the number of laws that require state approval has risen from 40 percent to 60 percent , allowing states to block laws in power struggles with the national government .
this happened frequently under the previous red-green coalition as the bundesrat was controlled by the christian democratic opposition . federalism reform is meant to untie these sometimes gnarled interconnections and make the state more effective again . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chancellor merkel riding high after first 100 days the dire predictions once made about germany 's current " grand coalition " government have proven untrue .

he added that there was a gap in the french market for a tabloid-style newspaper , since the print media in france was predominantly institutional , with the state playing a major role . before a final decision is made , however , extensive market research would have to be carried out , döpfner said , according to financial times deutschland . he also acknowledged that the publication would bear risks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fakt readers in poland " setting up a new newspaper would cost a substantial amount of money , " döpfner said . but he estimated the german group could generate hundreds of millions of euros in revenues from such a newspaper in france . springer 's bild has a circulation of 3.6 million , but the number of readers tops 11.8 million .

stating the need for an inquiry had been one thing , but agreeing on joint terms of reference quite another , especially since one of the opposition parties - the greens - was in government at the time and is worried about what the inquiry will reveal . now that this stumbling block is out of the way , the opposition has to collect the required 154 signatures in favor of the inquiry next week .

the opposition wants the probe to deal first and foremost with the role of bnd agents stationed in baghdad before and during the war on iraq .
of particular interest are all issues related to the question as to whether these agents or their bosses at home passed on any information to the us military or intelligence which might have helped the americans pick bombing targets . this would have meant direct involvement in the war effort and would have stood in stark contrast to the official line of the german government , which openly and vociferously opposed the war . but the inquiry will deal with a number of other aspects as well , such as the abduction of a lebanese-born german national to afghanistan by the cia and the interrogation of terror suspects by german intelligence agents in detention camps located in countries with a record of using torture . government rejects inquiry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's foreign minister frank-walter belonged to the former and current government it did n't come as a major surprise that the ruling grand coalition of social and christian democrats showed little understanding for the opposition 's intentions . " the free democrats should be ashamed of forging an alliance with the left party and the greens in such a sensitive matter , " said peter ramsauer , the parliamentary leader of bavaria 's christian social union .
" the really should n't ignore the damage they 're about to do .
the reputation of germany 's intelligence service is bound to suffer .
and i doubt whether in such a situation the bnd can do its job and provide maximum safety for our citizens in the months ahead . " for the opposition , the fdp 's jörg van essen said he was certain the inquiry would not serve to discredit the work of the german intelligence , but would rather look into what he believes was a double game being played by the schröder government . he also brushed aside allegations that his party wanted to use the probe mainly as an instrument to win over voters during elections in several german states later this month . swift process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hearings will take place in a room like this one the opposition parties have suggested that the inquiry could start as soon as the end of march .
they - especially the greens - do n't want it to drag on for months on end , turning into a general investigation of the previous government 's foreign policy . they are planning to appoint a special investigator to speed up things .

he added that there was a gap in the french market for a tabloid-style newspaper , since the print media in france was predominantly institutional , with the state playing a major role . before a final decision is made , however , extensive market research would have to be carried out , döpfner said , according to financial times deutschland . he also acknowledged that the publication would bear risks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fakt readers in poland " setting up a new newspaper would cost a substantial amount of money , " döpfner said . but he estimated the german group could generate hundreds of millions of euros in revenues from such a newspaper in france . springer 's bild has a circulation of 3.6 million , but the number of readers tops 11.8 million .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 10.03.2006 germany fears new match fixing scandal ahead of world cup großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prosecutors say players from the lower leagues were offered bribes to throw games four people are in custody as part of an investigation into a new match fixing affair that threatens to blacken germany 's name ahead of the world cup and resurrect the shame of the hoyzer scandal from last year . just when the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- thought it had swept the debris from last year 's refereeing scandal under the carpet in time to host a scandal-free world cup , frankfurt state prosecutors revealed on friday that four people were arrested this week as a result of an investigation into alleged match fixing . chief prosecutor thomas bechtel said the four were arrested on monday and were still in custody but he refused to name them or the teams involved in the suspected betting fraud in the german second division and regional league as not to endanger the ongoing investigation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert hoyzer was convicted in november last year according to the court statement , the alleged match fixing involves worrying similarities to that which engulfed the bundesliga in 2005 when referee robert hoyzer admitted fixing a number of games as part of a balkan mafia operation . hoyzer was sentenced to two years and five months in prison last november after admitting fixing several matches in return for payment from a croatian ringleader . prosecutors believe at least one bribe was accepted in this latest episode , it has been confirmed that players have been allegedly approached and offered several thousand euros if they could influence the result of at least five games .
the court revealed that it is believed that at least one of the offers of payment was accepted .
the court also refused to acknowledge or deny any connection with the match fixing operation involving hoyzer . the dfb also revealed that it was carrying out its own investigation into the possibility that matches in the amateur regional league might have been fixed this season after hearing claims to that effect .
the dfb said in a statement that it had no evidence yet and had handed all relevant information to the state prosecutors in frankfurt . no refereeing or top tier involvement , dfb says the ruling body was quick to add that the current probe had so far shown that the new cases of match fixing were nowhere near as large as those of last year and that there had been no evidence as yet to indicate the top tier of the game had been infiltrated or officials bribed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dfb 's theo zwanziger promised swift action " we have to state clearly that , according to the results of the ongoing investigation , no referee is involved and no first division club is concerned , " dfb chief executive theo zwanziger said in a statement .
" as long as there is money circulating around games , sadly , you can not rule out manipulation and cheating , " zwanziger added . " the dfb has been investigating for several weeks .
there was a very small suspicion of a criminal act and we decided that in the interests of a clear explanation we would work together with the investigators , " zwanziger continued .
" if anything is confirmed , it will be investigated and action will be taken .
those involved will be removed , and that includes from football circles . " retrial possibility in hoyzer case meanwhile the hoyzer scandal threatens to surface once more to add further insult to injury after it was revealed that the disgraced referee was not the official at one of the matches that he was accused of fixing and that as this was included in the court case against him , the mistake may lead to a retrial . legal experts were investigating the claim and the prospect of the case returning to court .
the dfb will be hoping that no mistake was made but if there was , the retrial is scheduled for sometime after july 9 this year - the day of the world cup final . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ex-bundesliga player jailed for fixing matches former fc chemitz player steffen karl received a nine-month suspended sentence and 50 hours of community service for his part in the match-fixing scandal that shook german soccer to its core .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.03.2006 german opposition agrees on terms of bnd affair inquiry großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opposition in parliament hopes to get to the bottom on the bnd 's role in iraq following a protracted tug-of-war , germany 's opposition parties friday agreed on the terms of reference for a parliamentary inquiry on the activities of german intelligence service bnd before and during the iraq war . germany 's three opposition parties , the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , the left party and the greens accuse the former government of social democratic chancellor gerhard schröder of having secretly supported the us-led war effort while publicly rejecting the 2003 invasion . the parties have overcome their differences on the issue and on friday agreed on a brief for the planned parliamentary inquiry .
stating the need for an inquiry had been one thing , but agreeing on joint terms of reference quite another , especially since one of the opposition parties - the greens - was in government at the time and is worried about what the inquiry will reveal . now that this stumbling block is out of the way , the opposition has to collect the required 154 signatures in favor of the inquiry next week .
altogether , the three parties have 166 members in the bundestag , meaning that they can afford over 10 dissidents in their own ranks . bnd 's role in baghdad crucial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did bnd agents help the us in preparing the invasion of iraq ?
the opposition wants the probe to deal first and foremost with the role of bnd agents stationed in baghdad before and during the war on iraq .
of particular interest are all issues related to the question as to whether these agents or their bosses at home passed on any information to the us military or intelligence which might have helped the americans pick bombing targets . this would have meant direct involvement in the war effort and would have stood in stark contrast to the official line of the german government , which openly and vociferously opposed the war . but the inquiry will deal with a number of other aspects as well , such as the abduction of a lebanese-born german national to afghanistan by the cia and the interrogation of terror suspects by german intelligence agents in detention camps located in countries with a record of using torture . government rejects inquiry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's foreign minister frank-walter belonged to the former and current government it did n't come as a major surprise that the ruling grand coalition of social and christian democrats showed little understanding for the opposition 's intentions . " the free democrats should be ashamed of forging an alliance with the left party and the greens in such a sensitive matter , " said peter ramsauer , the parliamentary leader of bavaria 's christian social union .
" the really should n't ignore the damage they 're about to do .
the reputation of germany 's intelligence service is bound to suffer .
and i doubt whether in such a situation the bnd can do its job and provide maximum safety for our citizens in the months ahead . " for the opposition , the fdp 's jörg van essen said he was certain the inquiry would not serve to discredit the work of the german intelligence , but would rather look into what he believes was a double game being played by the schröder government . he also brushed aside allegations that his party wanted to use the probe mainly as an instrument to win over voters during elections in several german states later this month . swift process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hearings will take place in a room like this one the opposition parties have suggested that the inquiry could start as soon as the end of march .
they - especially the greens - do n't want it to drag on for months on end , turning into a general investigation of the previous government 's foreign policy . they are planning to appoint a special investigator to speed up things .
the cross-party panel will most likely be made up of only seven parliamentarians . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de politicians warn iraq inquiry could harm intelligence work with an inquiry into the role of german bnd agents in iraq looking likely , the parties in the ruling coalition have warned that such public scrutiny could damage the ability of intelligence officers to work effectively .
-lrb- march 7 , 2006 -rrb- germany 's opposition parties force iraq spy investigation the liberal free democrats have joined the greens and the left party in voting in favor of an inquiry into german involvement in iraq .
an investigation will almost certainly now go ahead .

the city council agreed to the sale with a vote of 40 in favor and 29 against . the controversial decision , which went against the wishes of 45,000 residents who signed a petition protesting against the deal , makes dresden the first major german city to sell its entire residential real estate holdings and could have a knock on effect for other cash-strapped cities . poorly performing economies and high social costs have saddled larger german towns and cities with mountains of debt .
in recent years , the sale of apartments built to serve lower-income workers has become a quick way of reducing debt , to the chagrin of tenant associations . the sale of dresden 's real estate holdings may lead to other cities taking similar action .
berlin has already sold more than 260,000 apartments to private investors in the last three years .
hamburg and cologne are also considering such sales . " dresden sale is no blueprint for debt solution " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sale of dresden 's real estate worries residents however , gerd landsberg , the managing director of the german city and districts organization , said that dresden 's decision should not become a model for other cities wanting to clear their debts through such a scheme .
" this is an individual case , " he said , " and should not become a blueprint for the solution of financial problems . " landsberg said he would be pleased if dresden succeeds to free itself from debt but added that such sales are not the answer to financial crises .
only the government and individual states can solve the problems by reducing financial demands and increasing investment , he said . the german tenants association called the deal " wrong and short-sighted , " saying that the tenants would be expected to pay the bill in the long run .
" the high purchase price paid by fortress will have to recouped somewhere , " association director franz-georg rips said in a statement . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dresden sells gdr legacy , eliminates debt in a highly-controversial move , dresden on thursday will become the first major german city to sell its entire residential real estate holdings .

the court revealed that it is believed that at least one of the offers of payment was accepted .
the court also refused to acknowledge or deny any connection with the match fixing operation involving hoyzer . the dfb also revealed that it was carrying out its own investigation into the possibility that matches in the amateur regional league might have been fixed this season after hearing claims to that effect .
the dfb said in a statement that it had no evidence yet and had handed all relevant information to the state prosecutors in frankfurt . no refereeing or top tier involvement , dfb says the ruling body was quick to add that the current probe had so far shown that the new cases of match fixing were nowhere near as large as those of last year and that there had been no evidence as yet to indicate the top tier of the game had been infiltrated or officials bribed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dfb 's theo zwanziger promised swift action " we have to state clearly that , according to the results of the ongoing investigation , no referee is involved and no first division club is concerned , " dfb chief executive theo zwanziger said in a statement .
" as long as there is money circulating around games , sadly , you can not rule out manipulation and cheating , " zwanziger added . " the dfb has been investigating for several weeks .
there was a very small suspicion of a criminal act and we decided that in the interests of a clear explanation we would work together with the investigators , " zwanziger continued .
" if anything is confirmed , it will be investigated and action will be taken .
those involved will be removed , and that includes from football circles . " retrial possibility in hoyzer case meanwhile the hoyzer scandal threatens to surface once more to add further insult to injury after it was revealed that the disgraced referee was not the official at one of the matches that he was accused of fixing and that as this was included in the court case against him , the mistake may lead to a retrial . legal experts were investigating the claim and the prospect of the case returning to court .
the dfb will be hoping that no mistake was made but if there was , the retrial is scheduled for sometime after july 9 this year - the day of the world cup final . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ex-bundesliga player jailed for fixing matches former fc chemitz player steffen karl received a nine-month suspended sentence and 50 hours of community service for his part in the match-fixing scandal that shook german soccer to its core .

stating the need for an inquiry had been one thing , but agreeing on joint terms of reference quite another , especially since one of the opposition parties - the greens - was in government at the time and is worried about what the inquiry will reveal . now that this stumbling block is out of the way , the opposition has to collect the required 154 signatures in favor of the inquiry next week .
altogether , the three parties have 166 members in the bundestag , meaning that they can afford over 10 dissidents in their own ranks . bnd 's role in baghdad crucial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did bnd agents help the us in preparing the invasion of iraq ?
the opposition wants the probe to deal first and foremost with the role of bnd agents stationed in baghdad before and during the war on iraq .
of particular interest are all issues related to the question as to whether these agents or their bosses at home passed on any information to the us military or intelligence which might have helped the americans pick bombing targets . this would have meant direct involvement in the war effort and would have stood in stark contrast to the official line of the german government , which openly and vociferously opposed the war . but the inquiry will deal with a number of other aspects as well , such as the abduction of a lebanese-born german national to afghanistan by the cia and the interrogation of terror suspects by german intelligence agents in detention camps located in countries with a record of using torture . government rejects inquiry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's foreign minister frank-walter belonged to the former and current government it did n't come as a major surprise that the ruling grand coalition of social and christian democrats showed little understanding for the opposition 's intentions . " the free democrats should be ashamed of forging an alliance with the left party and the greens in such a sensitive matter , " said peter ramsauer , the parliamentary leader of bavaria 's christian social union .
" the really should n't ignore the damage they 're about to do .
the reputation of germany 's intelligence service is bound to suffer .
and i doubt whether in such a situation the bnd can do its job and provide maximum safety for our citizens in the months ahead . " for the opposition , the fdp 's jörg van essen said he was certain the inquiry would not serve to discredit the work of the german intelligence , but would rather look into what he believes was a double game being played by the schröder government . he also brushed aside allegations that his party wanted to use the probe mainly as an instrument to win over voters during elections in several german states later this month . swift process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hearings will take place in a room like this one the opposition parties have suggested that the inquiry could start as soon as the end of march .
they - especially the greens - do n't want it to drag on for months on end , turning into a general investigation of the previous government 's foreign policy . they are planning to appoint a special investigator to speed up things .
the cross-party panel will most likely be made up of only seven parliamentarians . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de politicians warn iraq inquiry could harm intelligence work with an inquiry into the role of german bnd agents in iraq looking likely , the parties in the ruling coalition have warned that such public scrutiny could damage the ability of intelligence officers to work effectively .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.03.2006 german opposition agrees on terms of bnd affair inquiry großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opposition in parliament hopes to get to the bottom on the bnd 's role in iraq following a protracted tug-of-war , germany 's opposition parties friday agreed on the terms of reference for a parliamentary inquiry on the activities of german intelligence service bnd before and during the iraq war . germany 's three opposition parties , the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , the left party and the greens accuse the former government of social democratic chancellor gerhard schröder of having secretly supported the us-led war effort while publicly rejecting the 2003 invasion . the parties have overcome their differences on the issue and on friday agreed on a brief for the planned parliamentary inquiry .
stating the need for an inquiry had been one thing , but agreeing on joint terms of reference quite another , especially since one of the opposition parties - the greens - was in government at the time and is worried about what the inquiry will reveal . now that this stumbling block is out of the way , the opposition has to collect the required 154 signatures in favor of the inquiry next week .
altogether , the three parties have 166 members in the bundestag , meaning that they can afford over 10 dissidents in their own ranks . bnd 's role in baghdad crucial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did bnd agents help the us in preparing the invasion of iraq ?
the opposition wants the probe to deal first and foremost with the role of bnd agents stationed in baghdad before and during the war on iraq .
of particular interest are all issues related to the question as to whether these agents or their bosses at home passed on any information to the us military or intelligence which might have helped the americans pick bombing targets . this would have meant direct involvement in the war effort and would have stood in stark contrast to the official line of the german government , which openly and vociferously opposed the war . but the inquiry will deal with a number of other aspects as well , such as the abduction of a lebanese-born german national to afghanistan by the cia and the interrogation of terror suspects by german intelligence agents in detention camps located in countries with a record of using torture . government rejects inquiry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's foreign minister frank-walter belonged to the former and current government it did n't come as a major surprise that the ruling grand coalition of social and christian democrats showed little understanding for the opposition 's intentions . " the free democrats should be ashamed of forging an alliance with the left party and the greens in such a sensitive matter , " said peter ramsauer , the parliamentary leader of bavaria 's christian social union .
" the really should n't ignore the damage they 're about to do .
the reputation of germany 's intelligence service is bound to suffer .
and i doubt whether in such a situation the bnd can do its job and provide maximum safety for our citizens in the months ahead . " for the opposition , the fdp 's jörg van essen said he was certain the inquiry would not serve to discredit the work of the german intelligence , but would rather look into what he believes was a double game being played by the schröder government . he also brushed aside allegations that his party wanted to use the probe mainly as an instrument to win over voters during elections in several german states later this month . swift process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hearings will take place in a room like this one the opposition parties have suggested that the inquiry could start as soon as the end of march .
they - especially the greens - do n't want it to drag on for months on end , turning into a general investigation of the previous government 's foreign policy . they are planning to appoint a special investigator to speed up things .
the cross-party panel will most likely be made up of only seven parliamentarians . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de politicians warn iraq inquiry could harm intelligence work with an inquiry into the role of german bnd agents in iraq looking likely , the parties in the ruling coalition have warned that such public scrutiny could damage the ability of intelligence officers to work effectively .
-lrb- march 7 , 2006 -rrb- germany 's opposition parties force iraq spy investigation the liberal free democrats have joined the greens and the left party in voting in favor of an inquiry into german involvement in iraq .
an investigation will almost certainly now go ahead .
-lrb- march 6 , 2006 -rrb- " we have to shed light on the issue " even as germany 's federal intelligence agency denies reports its spies in baghdad helped the us in selecting bombing targets there , jürgen trittin of the opposition green party told dw-world the fog has to be cleared .

the court revealed that it is believed that at least one of the offers of payment was accepted .
the court also refused to acknowledge or deny any connection with the match fixing operation involving hoyzer . the dfb also revealed that it was carrying out its own investigation into the possibility that matches in the amateur regional league might have been fixed this season after hearing claims to that effect .
the dfb said in a statement that it had no evidence yet and had handed all relevant information to the state prosecutors in frankfurt . no refereeing or top tier involvement , dfb says the ruling body was quick to add that the current probe had so far shown that the new cases of match fixing were nowhere near as large as those of last year and that there had been no evidence as yet to indicate the top tier of the game had been infiltrated or officials bribed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dfb 's theo zwanziger promised swift action " we have to state clearly that , according to the results of the ongoing investigation , no referee is involved and no first division club is concerned , " dfb chief executive theo zwanziger said in a statement .
" as long as there is money circulating around games , sadly , you can not rule out manipulation and cheating , " zwanziger added . " the dfb has been investigating for several weeks .
there was a very small suspicion of a criminal act and we decided that in the interests of a clear explanation we would work together with the investigators , " zwanziger continued .
" if anything is confirmed , it will be investigated and action will be taken .
those involved will be removed , and that includes from football circles . " retrial possibility in hoyzer case meanwhile the hoyzer scandal threatens to surface once more to add further insult to injury after it was revealed that the disgraced referee was not the official at one of the matches that he was accused of fixing and that as this was included in the court case against him , the mistake may lead to a retrial . legal experts were investigating the claim and the prospect of the case returning to court .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.03.2006 german opposition agrees on terms of bnd affair inquiry großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opposition in parliament hopes to get to the bottom on the bnd 's role in iraq following a protracted tug-of-war , germany 's opposition parties friday agreed on the terms of reference for a parliamentary inquiry on the activities of german intelligence service bnd before and during the iraq war . germany 's three opposition parties , the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , the left party and the greens accuse the former government of social democratic chancellor gerhard schröder of having secretly supported the us-led war effort while publicly rejecting the 2003 invasion . the parties have overcome their differences on the issue and on friday agreed on a brief for the planned parliamentary inquiry .
stating the need for an inquiry had been one thing , but agreeing on joint terms of reference quite another , especially since one of the opposition parties - the greens - was in government at the time and is worried about what the inquiry will reveal . now that this stumbling block is out of the way , the opposition has to collect the required 154 signatures in favor of the inquiry next week .
altogether , the three parties have 166 members in the bundestag , meaning that they can afford over 10 dissidents in their own ranks . bnd 's role in baghdad crucial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did bnd agents help the us in preparing the invasion of iraq ?
the opposition wants the probe to deal first and foremost with the role of bnd agents stationed in baghdad before and during the war on iraq .
of particular interest are all issues related to the question as to whether these agents or their bosses at home passed on any information to the us military or intelligence which might have helped the americans pick bombing targets . this would have meant direct involvement in the war effort and would have stood in stark contrast to the official line of the german government , which openly and vociferously opposed the war . but the inquiry will deal with a number of other aspects as well , such as the abduction of a lebanese-born german national to afghanistan by the cia and the interrogation of terror suspects by german intelligence agents in detention camps located in countries with a record of using torture . government rejects inquiry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's foreign minister frank-walter belonged to the former and current government it did n't come as a major surprise that the ruling grand coalition of social and christian democrats showed little understanding for the opposition 's intentions . " the free democrats should be ashamed of forging an alliance with the left party and the greens in such a sensitive matter , " said peter ramsauer , the parliamentary leader of bavaria 's christian social union .
" the really should n't ignore the damage they 're about to do .
the reputation of germany 's intelligence service is bound to suffer .
and i doubt whether in such a situation the bnd can do its job and provide maximum safety for our citizens in the months ahead . " for the opposition , the fdp 's jörg van essen said he was certain the inquiry would not serve to discredit the work of the german intelligence , but would rather look into what he believes was a double game being played by the schröder government . he also brushed aside allegations that his party wanted to use the probe mainly as an instrument to win over voters during elections in several german states later this month . swift process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hearings will take place in a room like this one the opposition parties have suggested that the inquiry could start as soon as the end of march .
they - especially the greens - do n't want it to drag on for months on end , turning into a general investigation of the previous government 's foreign policy . they are planning to appoint a special investigator to speed up things .
the cross-party panel will most likely be made up of only seven parliamentarians . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de politicians warn iraq inquiry could harm intelligence work with an inquiry into the role of german bnd agents in iraq looking likely , the parties in the ruling coalition have warned that such public scrutiny could damage the ability of intelligence officers to work effectively .
-lrb- march 7 , 2006 -rrb- germany 's opposition parties force iraq spy investigation the liberal free democrats have joined the greens and the left party in voting in favor of an inquiry into german involvement in iraq .
an investigation will almost certainly now go ahead .
-lrb- march 6 , 2006 -rrb- " we have to shed light on the issue " even as germany 's federal intelligence agency denies reports its spies in baghdad helped the us in selecting bombing targets there , jürgen trittin of the opposition green party told dw-world the fog has to be cleared .

if we have different model , we can test which one works best and choose it . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : theodor heuss germany 's nazi dictatorship also influenced the postwar constitution , which was meant to prevent a concentration of power in berlin .
germany 's first federal president , theodor heuss , declared his support for federalism in september 1949 . " we are a federal republic , " he said .
" we do n't want centralism in german .
we have behind us the lesson of national socialism that showed us what happens when germans are meant to fit a norm .
we do n't want that . " federal rights increase but there are cases - by now a majority - where the federal government has the power to legislate . " there are a number of areas , such as foreign policy , where it would not make sense to leave it up to the states , " morlok said , adding that globalization has increased the number of areas where laws are made in the country 's administrative center . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr is a federal matter defense , trade and currency issues and transport are fields were federal legislation is warranted .
in other areas , states can only adopt laws if the federal government has not done so already .
this includes social , civil and criminal law .
the federal state also regulates almost everything that has to do with immigration . the states maintain jurisdiction over police and education matters .
but even in these areas , states are increasingly coordinating their decisions . " there are no less than 1,000 coordinating committees , " von arnim said . adding the eu layer adding to the confusion is the supranational level of the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu also has a say when it comes to agriculture " we have some areas , such as agriculture and environmental protection , where the basic guidelines come from brussels and national parliaments have to turn them into law , " morlok said .
" that means that federal and state governments have to deal with this one after the other .
and that leads to people being totally confused about who is in charge . " reacting to a waning right to legislate , states have been trying to influence federal legislation .
since they have to approve regulations that affect them directly , if they reject them in germany 's upper house , the bundesrat , proposed legislation can not become law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the bundesrat have to approve fewer federal laws in the future ?
the number of laws that require state approval has risen from 40 percent to 60 percent , allowing states to block laws in power struggles with the national government .
this happened frequently under the previous red-green coalition as the bundesrat was controlled by the christian democratic opposition . federalism reform is meant to untie these sometimes gnarled interconnections and make the state more effective again . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chancellor merkel riding high after first 100 days the dire predictions once made about germany 's current " grand coalition " government have proven untrue .

for germans , the reporting of the world cup preparation process has become almost a daily soap opera but how do issues such as the struggles with hooliganism , security and stadium safety look to those outside germany ? inside germany 's borders , the country 's world cup preparations - with all their successes and failures - have been followed almost daily by the media .
as a result , even the most mundane twists and turns of the process have been reported and passed on to the public .
people in germany are now either very well informed or fed up with the whole thing . but the world cup , of course , is not just a german event .
from the beginning of june , the teams and supporters of 31 other countries will begin to descend on germany for the actual tournament . while the world cup soap opera has been playing almost constantly in the host country since it was awarded the championships in 2002 , the other participating countries have had other things on their minds , like qualification and their own chances of lifting the trophy . so have such widely debated topics as security , stadium safety and ticket allocation made any impact outside germany ?
do the other nations really care about the preparations as long as the world cup takes place ? patrice armand of the french football supporters union remembers the build up to france 's tournament in 1998 , the last world cup to be played on european soil .
" in france it felt like we were cut off from the rest of the world while preparing for the tournament in 1998 , " he said . the french faced a number of similar challenges to the germans in the build-up to their world cup but armand believes germany has had a tougher job this time round . a changing world with changing challenges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french celebrated after preparation stress subsided " the world has changed dramatically since 1998 .
germany has had to deal with the increased threat from international terrorism , something that was less of a worry for france eight years ago .
i think germany is doing the best it can to protect the world cup from attack but it could do more . " when asked if he thought the german army should be deployed as an added security force , armand said : " that is an issue for the germans to decide .
for the french , it would be no problem but we do not have such a weight of history on us as the germans do .
i think the germans should do whatever it takes to secure the world cup . " france suffered from the scourge of hooliganism in ' 98 and the germans are hoping they have learnt from the lessons of the past .
they have prepared a plan for dealing with the threat , specifically from renowned hooligans and bitter rivals from england and the netherlands . judge us on behavior , not reputation , say england fans with the german police under orders to watch these sets of fans in particular , what feeling does that create in these countries in the build-up to the tournament ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : england fans have worked hard to change perceptions " england fans want to be judged on their behavior and not their reputation , " said andrin cooper from the english football association -lrb- fa -rrb- .
" our fans have made huge strides in recent years to change perceptions .
we had just one arrest at euro 2004 in portugal and none at the 2002 world cup . " " the fa is expecting a great world cup in a real football country with a real football culture .
germany has great infrastructure and great stadiums and the organizing committee and host cities have really made an effort to welcome everyone with open arms .
we 're confident it will be a successful , safe world cup . " dutch expert fears open-space hooliganism ron elsker , an expert on dutch soccer hooliganism , agreed but had concerns about security away from the stadiums .
" i think the idea of having public viewing areas is unavoidable considering the demand for the world cup , but i also feel that the germans have dug themselves into a hole with this idea , " elsker said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the idea of " fanparks " has some security experts concerned " i do n't think they are prepared enough to deal with the potential for violence at these events .
a stadium is one thing , a wide open public place is a lot harder to police . " even if the stadiums are secure when it comes to potential violence , there have been concerns raised about the condition and safety precautions in place at the grounds . after a widely reported spat between the organizing committee and consumer watchdog magazine stiftung warentest over a report that four world cup stadiums had inadequate safety measures in place , a recent uefa cup clash between stuttgart and english team middlesbrough at the gottlieb daimler stadium once again raised these concerns . no safety fears for fans despite stuttgart incident a burst pipe in a kitchen caused an alert 30 minutes before kick-off and the announcements which followed were made in german , with no translation , meaning many boro fans remained in their seats during the evacuation . paddy cronesberry , the chairman of middlesbrough 's disabled supporters club was in stuttgart for the game .
" most of the disabled supporters were stopped from entering once the alarm went off , but those supporters in the ground had no idea what was happening . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traveling fans were impressed by stuttgart 's stadium " despite that , i was very impressed by the stadium and the safety measures although access could have been better .
we only had a couple of thousand fans and the two gates for the away end still made it tight .
a large contingent may have bigger problems . " " the germans are the best at organizing anything and have had a lot of experience of big sporting events .
i have no concerns about safety for fans in the german stadiums .
i think the attitudes of people are the most important thing .
if you go with a positive one , you will help the world cup be a huge success .

for germans , the reporting of the world cup preparation process has become almost a daily soap opera but how do issues such as the struggles with hooliganism , security and stadium safety look to those outside germany ? inside germany 's borders , the country 's world cup preparations - with all their successes and failures - have been followed almost daily by the media .
as a result , even the most mundane twists and turns of the process have been reported and passed on to the public .
people in germany are now either very well informed or fed up with the whole thing . but the world cup , of course , is not just a german event .
from the beginning of june , the teams and supporters of 31 other countries will begin to descend on germany for the actual tournament . while the world cup soap opera has been playing almost constantly in the host country since it was awarded the championships in 2002 , the other participating countries have had other things on their minds , like qualification and their own chances of lifting the trophy . so have such widely debated topics as security , stadium safety and ticket allocation made any impact outside germany ?
do the other nations really care about the preparations as long as the world cup takes place ? patrice armand of the french football supporters union remembers the build up to france 's tournament in 1998 , the last world cup to be played on european soil .
" in france it felt like we were cut off from the rest of the world while preparing for the tournament in 1998 , " he said . the french faced a number of similar challenges to the germans in the build-up to their world cup but armand believes germany has had a tougher job this time round . a changing world with changing challenges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french celebrated after preparation stress subsided " the world has changed dramatically since 1998 .
germany has had to deal with the increased threat from international terrorism , something that was less of a worry for france eight years ago .
i think germany is doing the best it can to protect the world cup from attack but it could do more . " when asked if he thought the german army should be deployed as an added security force , armand said : " that is an issue for the germans to decide .
for the french , it would be no problem but we do not have such a weight of history on us as the germans do .
i think the germans should do whatever it takes to secure the world cup . " france suffered from the scourge of hooliganism in ' 98 and the germans are hoping they have learnt from the lessons of the past .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.03.2006 opposition criticizes federalism reform plan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : balancing federal and state interests : merkel with german states ' coat of arms on stars both houses of germany 's parliament on friday debated the draft of the country 's so-called federalism reform - a mammoth piece of legislation that includes more than 20 changes to the german constitution . german chancellor angela merkel and the premiers of the 16 federal states brought the reform before the german parliament in a joint effort to overhaul the country 's complex federal system . the amendments are deemed crucial in streamlining political decision-making in germany that has increasingly become a drawn-out affair with legislation being substantially watered down at the end of the process . but in spite of substantial agreement between federal and state governments , the " mother of all reforms , " as one of its authors called it , still has a rocky road ahead of it .
speakers for the opposition in parliament called it a monster .
they feel it can not take care of the task of untangling the web of interlocking powers between federal and state governments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast served as minister for agriculture and consumer protection in the previous government " the reform was meant to separate powers , but it now does n't , " said renate künast , the parliamentary leader of the greens party .
" it was meant to speed up decision-making and tackle the huge challenges facing germany .
on all of this the reform fails .
what was supposed to be the masterpiece of the grand coalition government has become a bungled piece of legislation that wo n't bring germany forward . " current system blocks legislation currently around 60 percent of german laws have to be approved by both chambers of parliament , the bundestag and the bundesrat , which represents the states .
this system has led to a blockade of important legislation in the past when the two houses have been controlled by different parties .
if ratified , the new bill would substantially reduce the number of laws which the bundesrat can veto . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesrat in session in exchange for the concessions by the states , the central government in berlin has been forced to relinquish powers in areas such as education , the environment , the penal system and the civil service .
opposition parties therefore accused chancellor angela merkel of fostering separatist tendencies among state leaders who are bent on destroying national solidarity . in times of limited finances , they warned , this would lead to a race for the lowest standards in environmental protection and public administration , and foster growing inequality in education . government mulls changes to reform this fear was even shared by peter struck , parliamentary leader of the social democrats . although the spd ministers in chancellor merkel 's cabinet are supporting the draft , he openly called for changes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter struck does n't want to rush things " simply because the bill has been brought into parliament , this does n't mean we adopt it all at once , " he said .
" there is no doubt that a reform is necessary .
but this draft can not be the last word on it and parliamentary deputies have every right to change it according to their convictions . " but klaus wowereit , the social democrat mayor of the city-state of berlin , warned against unraveling the hard-won compromise . " if all those who have not seen their wishes fulfilled start demanding changes , we 'll end up in a difficult situation , " he said .
" in this case i expect the reform to founder in the end . " but some voices in the bundesrat said they were worried that the poorer states could suffer from the reforms . both houses of parliament must pass the bill with a two-thirds majority before the constitutional amendments can go through .
the reform is the first key domestic hurdle for chancellor angela merkel and a major test of the ability of her grand coalition government to sell controversial measures not only to the public at large but also to its own members of parliament . uwe hessler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany starts constitutional overhaul germany 's parliament on friday is starting the process of reforming the country 's federal structure .
it 's the biggest overhaul of germany 's governmental system and will require more than 20 constitutional amendments .

on the contrary , harmony is the watchword so far .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.03.2006 german opposition agrees on terms of bnd affair inquiry großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opposition in parliament hopes to get to the bottom on the bnd 's role in iraq following a protracted tug-of-war , germany 's opposition parties friday agreed on the terms of reference for a parliamentary inquiry on the activities of german intelligence service bnd before and during the iraq war . germany 's three opposition parties , the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , the left party and the greens accuse the former government of social democratic chancellor gerhard schröder of having secretly supported the us-led war effort while publicly rejecting the 2003 invasion . the parties have overcome their differences on the issue and on friday agreed on a brief for the planned parliamentary inquiry .
stating the need for an inquiry had been one thing , but agreeing on joint terms of reference quite another , especially since one of the opposition parties - the greens - was in government at the time and is worried about what the inquiry will reveal . now that this stumbling block is out of the way , the opposition has to collect the required 154 signatures in favor of the inquiry next week .
altogether , the three parties have 166 members in the bundestag , meaning that they can afford over 10 dissidents in their own ranks . bnd 's role in baghdad crucial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did bnd agents help the us in preparing the invasion of iraq ?
the opposition wants the probe to deal first and foremost with the role of bnd agents stationed in baghdad before and during the war on iraq .
of particular interest are all issues related to the question as to whether these agents or their bosses at home passed on any information to the us military or intelligence which might have helped the americans pick bombing targets . this would have meant direct involvement in the war effort and would have stood in stark contrast to the official line of the german government , which openly and vociferously opposed the war . but the inquiry will deal with a number of other aspects as well , such as the abduction of a lebanese-born german national to afghanistan by the cia and the interrogation of terror suspects by german intelligence agents in detention camps located in countries with a record of using torture . government rejects inquiry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's foreign minister frank-walter belonged to the former and current government it did n't come as a major surprise that the ruling grand coalition of social and christian democrats showed little understanding for the opposition 's intentions . " the free democrats should be ashamed of forging an alliance with the left party and the greens in such a sensitive matter , " said peter ramsauer , the parliamentary leader of bavaria 's christian social union .
" the really should n't ignore the damage they 're about to do .
the reputation of germany 's intelligence service is bound to suffer .
and i doubt whether in such a situation the bnd can do its job and provide maximum safety for our citizens in the months ahead . " for the opposition , the fdp 's jörg van essen said he was certain the inquiry would not serve to discredit the work of the german intelligence , but would rather look into what he believes was a double game being played by the schröder government . he also brushed aside allegations that his party wanted to use the probe mainly as an instrument to win over voters during elections in several german states later this month . swift process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hearings will take place in a room like this one the opposition parties have suggested that the inquiry could start as soon as the end of march .
they - especially the greens - do n't want it to drag on for months on end , turning into a general investigation of the previous government 's foreign policy . they are planning to appoint a special investigator to speed up things .
the cross-party panel will most likely be made up of only seven parliamentarians . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de politicians warn iraq inquiry could harm intelligence work with an inquiry into the role of german bnd agents in iraq looking likely , the parties in the ruling coalition have warned that such public scrutiny could damage the ability of intelligence officers to work effectively .
-lrb- march 7 , 2006 -rrb- germany 's opposition parties force iraq spy investigation the liberal free democrats have joined the greens and the left party in voting in favor of an inquiry into german involvement in iraq .
an investigation will almost certainly now go ahead .
-lrb- march 6 , 2006 -rrb- " we have to shed light on the issue " even as germany 's federal intelligence agency denies reports its spies in baghdad helped the us in selecting bombing targets there , jürgen trittin of the opposition green party told dw-world the fog has to be cleared .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.03.2006 german opposition agrees on terms of bnd affair inquiry großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opposition in parliament hopes to get to the bottom on the bnd 's role in iraq following a protracted tug-of-war , germany 's opposition parties friday agreed on the terms of reference for a parliamentary inquiry on the activities of german intelligence service bnd before and during the iraq war . germany 's three opposition parties , the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , the left party and the greens accuse the former government of social democratic chancellor gerhard schröder of having secretly supported the us-led war effort while publicly rejecting the 2003 invasion . the parties have overcome their differences on the issue and on friday agreed on a brief for the planned parliamentary inquiry .
stating the need for an inquiry had been one thing , but agreeing on joint terms of reference quite another , especially since one of the opposition parties - the greens - was in government at the time and is worried about what the inquiry will reveal . now that this stumbling block is out of the way , the opposition has to collect the required 154 signatures in favor of the inquiry next week .
altogether , the three parties have 166 members in the bundestag , meaning that they can afford over 10 dissidents in their own ranks . bnd 's role in baghdad crucial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did bnd agents help the us in preparing the invasion of iraq ?
the opposition wants the probe to deal first and foremost with the role of bnd agents stationed in baghdad before and during the war on iraq .
of particular interest are all issues related to the question as to whether these agents or their bosses at home passed on any information to the us military or intelligence which might have helped the americans pick bombing targets . this would have meant direct involvement in the war effort and would have stood in stark contrast to the official line of the german government , which openly and vociferously opposed the war . but the inquiry will deal with a number of other aspects as well , such as the abduction of a lebanese-born german national to afghanistan by the cia and the interrogation of terror suspects by german intelligence agents in detention camps located in countries with a record of using torture . government rejects inquiry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's foreign minister frank-walter belonged to the former and current government it did n't come as a major surprise that the ruling grand coalition of social and christian democrats showed little understanding for the opposition 's intentions . " the free democrats should be ashamed of forging an alliance with the left party and the greens in such a sensitive matter , " said peter ramsauer , the parliamentary leader of bavaria 's christian social union .
" the really should n't ignore the damage they 're about to do .
the reputation of germany 's intelligence service is bound to suffer .
and i doubt whether in such a situation the bnd can do its job and provide maximum safety for our citizens in the months ahead . " for the opposition , the fdp 's jörg van essen said he was certain the inquiry would not serve to discredit the work of the german intelligence , but would rather look into what he believes was a double game being played by the schröder government . he also brushed aside allegations that his party wanted to use the probe mainly as an instrument to win over voters during elections in several german states later this month . swift process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hearings will take place in a room like this one the opposition parties have suggested that the inquiry could start as soon as the end of march .
they - especially the greens - do n't want it to drag on for months on end , turning into a general investigation of the previous government 's foreign policy . they are planning to appoint a special investigator to speed up things .
the cross-party panel will most likely be made up of only seven parliamentarians . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de politicians warn iraq inquiry could harm intelligence work with an inquiry into the role of german bnd agents in iraq looking likely , the parties in the ruling coalition have warned that such public scrutiny could damage the ability of intelligence officers to work effectively .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.03.2006 opposition criticizes federalism reform plan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : balancing federal and state interests : merkel with german states ' coat of arms on stars both houses of germany 's parliament on friday debated the draft of the country 's so-called federalism reform - a mammoth piece of legislation that includes more than 20 changes to the german constitution . german chancellor angela merkel and the premiers of the 16 federal states brought the reform before the german parliament in a joint effort to overhaul the country 's complex federal system . the amendments are deemed crucial in streamlining political decision-making in germany that has increasingly become a drawn-out affair with legislation being substantially watered down at the end of the process . but in spite of substantial agreement between federal and state governments , the " mother of all reforms , " as one of its authors called it , still has a rocky road ahead of it .
speakers for the opposition in parliament called it a monster .
they feel it can not take care of the task of untangling the web of interlocking powers between federal and state governments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast served as minister for agriculture and consumer protection in the previous government " the reform was meant to separate powers , but it now does n't , " said renate künast , the parliamentary leader of the greens party .
" it was meant to speed up decision-making and tackle the huge challenges facing germany .
on all of this the reform fails .
what was supposed to be the masterpiece of the grand coalition government has become a bungled piece of legislation that wo n't bring germany forward . " current system blocks legislation currently around 60 percent of german laws have to be approved by both chambers of parliament , the bundestag and the bundesrat , which represents the states .
this system has led to a blockade of important legislation in the past when the two houses have been controlled by different parties .
if ratified , the new bill would substantially reduce the number of laws which the bundesrat can veto . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesrat in session in exchange for the concessions by the states , the central government in berlin has been forced to relinquish powers in areas such as education , the environment , the penal system and the civil service .
opposition parties therefore accused chancellor angela merkel of fostering separatist tendencies among state leaders who are bent on destroying national solidarity . in times of limited finances , they warned , this would lead to a race for the lowest standards in environmental protection and public administration , and foster growing inequality in education . government mulls changes to reform this fear was even shared by peter struck , parliamentary leader of the social democrats . although the spd ministers in chancellor merkel 's cabinet are supporting the draft , he openly called for changes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter struck does n't want to rush things " simply because the bill has been brought into parliament , this does n't mean we adopt it all at once , " he said .
" there is no doubt that a reform is necessary .
but this draft can not be the last word on it and parliamentary deputies have every right to change it according to their convictions . " but klaus wowereit , the social democrat mayor of the city-state of berlin , warned against unraveling the hard-won compromise . " if all those who have not seen their wishes fulfilled start demanding changes , we 'll end up in a difficult situation , " he said .
" in this case i expect the reform to founder in the end . " but some voices in the bundesrat said they were worried that the poorer states could suffer from the reforms . both houses of parliament must pass the bill with a two-thirds majority before the constitutional amendments can go through .
the reform is the first key domestic hurdle for chancellor angela merkel and a major test of the ability of her grand coalition government to sell controversial measures not only to the public at large but also to its own members of parliament . uwe hessler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany starts constitutional overhaul germany 's parliament on friday is starting the process of reforming the country 's federal structure .
it 's the biggest overhaul of germany 's governmental system and will require more than 20 constitutional amendments .
-lrb- march 10 , 2006 -rrb- chancellor merkel riding high after first 100 days the dire predictions once made about germany 's current " grand coalition " government have proven untrue .
on the contrary , harmony is the watchword so far .

protestors were heading rallying calls against plans by some state and local authorities to increase the working week from 38.5 hours to 40 or more and to cut christmas and holiday bonuses . around 6,000 teachers represented by the gew union also held demonstrations outside kindergartens , schools and universities in berlin thursday , further boosting the numbers of protestors on the german streets . the strikes have been gaining momentum in their fifth week and the turnout on the day before the services union verdi was due to hold talks with employers was an obvious sign of the growing discontent around germany at the idea of extending working hours . the industrial action is also making a visible impact on german cities and towns , where piles of uncollected rubbish are growing and kindergartens , hospitals and public administration services are becoming increasingly disrupted . while union and employer negotiators are due to hold talks on friday , prospects of reaching a deal look slim , especially since verdi rejected an offer from municipal employers in the southern state of baden-württemberg on wednesday which the employers said went to " the absolute limit . " warring sides show no sign of securing a deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verdi 's frank bsirske rallies a crowd of protestors " i 'm skeptical , " hartmut möllring , chief negotiator for tarifgemeinschaft der länder -lrb- tdl -rrb- , the state employers ' umbrella organization , told reporters when asked about the prospects of a deal being reached by the end of this week . the employers ' organization has been accused by verdi of deliberately dragging the conflict out in a bid to make the strike unpopular and to overshadow the protestors ' objectives . according to the bdb banking association , whose 200 member banks include deutsche bank ag and hvb group , a prolonged disruption of services would also pose a risk to a domestic economy that 's recovering after five years of stagnation . " the policy of möllring and company threatens the interests of hundreds of thousands .
it 's a declaration of war against the people in this country , " verdi chief frank bsirske told a demonstration attended by around 20,000 people in hanover .

protestors were heading rallying calls against plans by some state and local authorities to increase the working week from 38.5 hours to 40 or more and to cut christmas and holiday bonuses . around 6,000 teachers represented by the gew union also held demonstrations outside kindergartens , schools and universities in berlin thursday , further boosting the numbers of protestors on the german streets . the strikes have been gaining momentum in their fifth week and the turnout on the day before the services union verdi was due to hold talks with employers was an obvious sign of the growing discontent around germany at the idea of extending working hours . the industrial action is also making a visible impact on german cities and towns , where piles of uncollected rubbish are growing and kindergartens , hospitals and public administration services are becoming increasingly disrupted . while union and employer negotiators are due to hold talks on friday , prospects of reaching a deal look slim , especially since verdi rejected an offer from municipal employers in the southern state of baden-württemberg on wednesday which the employers said went to " the absolute limit . " warring sides show no sign of securing a deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verdi 's frank bsirske rallies a crowd of protestors " i 'm skeptical , " hartmut möllring , chief negotiator for tarifgemeinschaft der länder -lrb- tdl -rrb- , the state employers ' umbrella organization , told reporters when asked about the prospects of a deal being reached by the end of this week . the employers ' organization has been accused by verdi of deliberately dragging the conflict out in a bid to make the strike unpopular and to overshadow the protestors ' objectives . according to the bdb banking association , whose 200 member banks include deutsche bank ag and hvb group , a prolonged disruption of services would also pose a risk to a domestic economy that 's recovering after five years of stagnation . " the policy of möllring and company threatens the interests of hundreds of thousands .
it 's a declaration of war against the people in this country , " verdi chief frank bsirske told a demonstration attended by around 20,000 people in hanover .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.03.2006 german opposition agrees on terms of bnd affair inquiry großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opposition in parliament hopes to get to the bottom on the bnd 's role in iraq following a protracted tug-of-war , germany 's opposition parties friday agreed on the terms of reference for a parliamentary inquiry on the activities of german intelligence service bnd before and during the iraq war . germany 's three opposition parties , the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , the left party and the greens accuse the former government of social democratic chancellor gerhard schröder of having secretly supported the us-led war effort while publicly rejecting the 2003 invasion . the parties have overcome their differences on the issue and on friday agreed on a brief for the planned parliamentary inquiry .
stating the need for an inquiry had been one thing , but agreeing on joint terms of reference quite another , especially since one of the opposition parties - the greens - was in government at the time and is worried about what the inquiry will reveal . now that this stumbling block is out of the way , the opposition has to collect the required 154 signatures in favor of the inquiry next week .
altogether , the three parties have 166 members in the bundestag , meaning that they can afford over 10 dissidents in their own ranks . bnd 's role in baghdad crucial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did bnd agents help the us in preparing the invasion of iraq ?
the opposition wants the probe to deal first and foremost with the role of bnd agents stationed in baghdad before and during the war on iraq .
of particular interest are all issues related to the question as to whether these agents or their bosses at home passed on any information to the us military or intelligence which might have helped the americans pick bombing targets . this would have meant direct involvement in the war effort and would have stood in stark contrast to the official line of the german government , which openly and vociferously opposed the war . but the inquiry will deal with a number of other aspects as well , such as the abduction of a lebanese-born german national to afghanistan by the cia and the interrogation of terror suspects by german intelligence agents in detention camps located in countries with a record of using torture . government rejects inquiry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's foreign minister frank-walter belonged to the former and current government it did n't come as a major surprise that the ruling grand coalition of social and christian democrats showed little understanding for the opposition 's intentions . " the free democrats should be ashamed of forging an alliance with the left party and the greens in such a sensitive matter , " said peter ramsauer , the parliamentary leader of bavaria 's christian social union .
" the really should n't ignore the damage they 're about to do .
the reputation of germany 's intelligence service is bound to suffer .
and i doubt whether in such a situation the bnd can do its job and provide maximum safety for our citizens in the months ahead . " for the opposition , the fdp 's jörg van essen said he was certain the inquiry would not serve to discredit the work of the german intelligence , but would rather look into what he believes was a double game being played by the schröder government . he also brushed aside allegations that his party wanted to use the probe mainly as an instrument to win over voters during elections in several german states later this month . swift process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hearings will take place in a room like this one the opposition parties have suggested that the inquiry could start as soon as the end of march .
they - especially the greens - do n't want it to drag on for months on end , turning into a general investigation of the previous government 's foreign policy . they are planning to appoint a special investigator to speed up things .
the cross-party panel will most likely be made up of only seven parliamentarians . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de politicians warn iraq inquiry could harm intelligence work with an inquiry into the role of german bnd agents in iraq looking likely , the parties in the ruling coalition have warned that such public scrutiny could damage the ability of intelligence officers to work effectively .
-lrb- march 7 , 2006 -rrb- germany 's opposition parties force iraq spy investigation the liberal free democrats have joined the greens and the left party in voting in favor of an inquiry into german involvement in iraq .
an investigation will almost certainly now go ahead .
-lrb- march 6 , 2006 -rrb- " we have to shed light on the issue " even as germany 's federal intelligence agency denies reports its spies in baghdad helped the us in selecting bombing targets there , jürgen trittin of the opposition green party told dw-world the fog has to be cleared .

the court revealed that it is believed that at least one of the offers of payment was accepted .
the court also refused to acknowledge or deny any connection with the match fixing operation involving hoyzer . the dfb also revealed that it was carrying out its own investigation into the possibility that matches in the amateur regional league might have been fixed this season after hearing claims to that effect .
the dfb said in a statement that it had no evidence yet and had handed all relevant information to the state prosecutors in frankfurt . no refereeing or top tier involvement , dfb says the ruling body was quick to add that the current probe had so far shown that the new cases of match fixing were nowhere near as large as those of last year and that there had been no evidence as yet to indicate the top tier of the game had been infiltrated or officials bribed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dfb 's theo zwanziger promised swift action " we have to state clearly that , according to the results of the ongoing investigation , no referee is involved and no first division club is concerned , " dfb chief executive theo zwanziger said in a statement .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 10.03.2006 germany fears new match fixing scandal ahead of world cup großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prosecutors say players from the lower leagues were offered bribes to throw games four people are in custody as part of an investigation into a new match fixing affair that threatens to blacken germany 's name ahead of the world cup and resurrect the shame of the hoyzer scandal from last year . just when the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- thought it had swept the debris from last year 's refereeing scandal under the carpet in time to host a scandal-free world cup , frankfurt state prosecutors revealed on friday that four people were arrested this week as a result of an investigation into alleged match fixing . chief prosecutor thomas bechtel said the four were arrested on monday and were still in custody but he refused to name them or the teams involved in the suspected betting fraud in the german second division and regional league as not to endanger the ongoing investigation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert hoyzer was convicted in november last year according to the court statement , the alleged match fixing involves worrying similarities to that which engulfed the bundesliga in 2005 when referee robert hoyzer admitted fixing a number of games as part of a balkan mafia operation . hoyzer was sentenced to two years and five months in prison last november after admitting fixing several matches in return for payment from a croatian ringleader . prosecutors believe at least one bribe was accepted in this latest episode , it has been confirmed that players have been allegedly approached and offered several thousand euros if they could influence the result of at least five games .
the court revealed that it is believed that at least one of the offers of payment was accepted .
the court also refused to acknowledge or deny any connection with the match fixing operation involving hoyzer . the dfb also revealed that it was carrying out its own investigation into the possibility that matches in the amateur regional league might have been fixed this season after hearing claims to that effect .
the dfb said in a statement that it had no evidence yet and had handed all relevant information to the state prosecutors in frankfurt . no refereeing or top tier involvement , dfb says the ruling body was quick to add that the current probe had so far shown that the new cases of match fixing were nowhere near as large as those of last year and that there had been no evidence as yet to indicate the top tier of the game had been infiltrated or officials bribed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dfb 's theo zwanziger promised swift action " we have to state clearly that , according to the results of the ongoing investigation , no referee is involved and no first division club is concerned , " dfb chief executive theo zwanziger said in a statement .
" as long as there is money circulating around games , sadly , you can not rule out manipulation and cheating , " zwanziger added . " the dfb has been investigating for several weeks .
there was a very small suspicion of a criminal act and we decided that in the interests of a clear explanation we would work together with the investigators , " zwanziger continued .
" if anything is confirmed , it will be investigated and action will be taken .

the court revealed that it is believed that at least one of the offers of payment was accepted .
the court also refused to acknowledge or deny any connection with the match fixing operation involving hoyzer . the dfb also revealed that it was carrying out its own investigation into the possibility that matches in the amateur regional league might have been fixed this season after hearing claims to that effect .
the dfb said in a statement that it had no evidence yet and had handed all relevant information to the state prosecutors in frankfurt . no refereeing or top tier involvement , dfb says the ruling body was quick to add that the current probe had so far shown that the new cases of match fixing were nowhere near as large as those of last year and that there had been no evidence as yet to indicate the top tier of the game had been infiltrated or officials bribed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dfb 's theo zwanziger promised swift action " we have to state clearly that , according to the results of the ongoing investigation , no referee is involved and no first division club is concerned , " dfb chief executive theo zwanziger said in a statement .
" as long as there is money circulating around games , sadly , you can not rule out manipulation and cheating , " zwanziger added . " the dfb has been investigating for several weeks .
there was a very small suspicion of a criminal act and we decided that in the interests of a clear explanation we would work together with the investigators , " zwanziger continued .
" if anything is confirmed , it will be investigated and action will be taken .
those involved will be removed , and that includes from football circles .

it 's the biggest overhaul of germany 's governmental system and will require 40 constitutional amendments . the long-awaited federalism reform is expected to newly regulate the jurisdictions of the federal government and germany 's 16 states . the latter are generally responsible for making laws - a concept that forms the basis of the original idea of federalism , according to herbert von arnim , a professor at the university for administrative sciences in speyer . " states are closer to the citizens , " he said .
" they know what things are like on the ground and find it easier to adjust rules to the needs of the people .
they can also compete with each other , meaning that the best system will succeed in the end . " historic foundation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto von bismarck became germany 's first chancellor in 1871 after uniting the country under the prussian crown germany 's principle of federalism has its roots in history . for centuries , germany consisted of autonomous principalities and so-called " free cities . "
this patchwork quilt long resisted any attempts for unification .
when the german reich was eventually founded in 1871 , individual states still did n't hand over much sovereignty . some of this diversity has been preserved today , such as in the area of culture .
few countries have as many opera houses and theaters as germany . " federalism clearly brings about diversity , " said martin molok , a law professor at düsseldorf university .
" it encourages progress .
if we have different model , we can test which one works best and choose it . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : theodor heuss germany 's nazi dictatorship also influenced the postwar constitution , which was meant to prevent a concentration of power in berlin .
germany 's first federal president , theodor heuss , declared his support for federalism in september 1949 . " we are a federal republic , " he said .
" we do n't want centralism in german .
we have behind us the lesson of national socialism that showed us what happens when germans are meant to fit a norm .
we do n't want that . " federal rights increase but there are cases - by now a majority - where the federal government has the power to legislate . " there are a number of areas , such as foreign policy , where it would not make sense to leave it up to the states , " morlok said , adding that globalization has increased the number of areas where laws are made in the country 's administrative center . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr is a federal matter defense , trade and currency issues and transport are fields were federal legislation is warranted .
in other areas , states can only adopt laws if the federal government has not done so already .
this includes social , civil and criminal law .
the federal state also regulates almost everything that has to do with immigration . the states maintain jurisdiction over police and education matters .
but even in these areas , states are increasingly coordinating their decisions . " there are no less than 1,000 coordinating committees , " von arnim said . adding the eu layer adding to the confusion is the supranational level of the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu also has a say when it comes to agriculture " we have some areas , such as agriculture and environmental protection , where the basic guidelines come from brussels and national parliaments have to turn them into law , " morlok said .
" that means that federal and state governments have to deal with this one after the other .
and that leads to people being totally confused about who is in charge . " reacting to a waning right to legislate , states have been trying to influence federal legislation .
since they have to approve regulations that affect them directly , if they reject them in germany 's upper house , the bundesrat , proposed legislation can not become law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the bundesrat have to approve fewer federal laws in the future ?
the number of laws that require state approval has risen from 40 percent to 60 percent , allowing states to block laws in power struggles with the national government .
this happened frequently under the previous red-green coalition as the bundesrat was controlled by the christian democratic opposition . federalism reform is meant to untie these sometimes gnarled interconnections and make the state more effective again . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chancellor merkel riding high after first 100 days the dire predictions once made about germany 's current " grand coalition " government have proven untrue .

for germans , the reporting of the world cup preparation process has become almost a daily soap opera but how do issues such as the struggles with hooliganism , security and stadium safety look to those outside germany ? inside germany 's borders , the country 's world cup preparations - with all their successes and failures - have been followed almost daily by the media .
as a result , even the most mundane twists and turns of the process have been reported and passed on to the public .
people in germany are now either very well informed or fed up with the whole thing . but the world cup , of course , is not just a german event .
from the beginning of june , the teams and supporters of 31 other countries will begin to descend on germany for the actual tournament . while the world cup soap opera has been playing almost constantly in the host country since it was awarded the championships in 2002 , the other participating countries have had other things on their minds , like qualification and their own chances of lifting the trophy . so have such widely debated topics as security , stadium safety and ticket allocation made any impact outside germany ?
do the other nations really care about the preparations as long as the world cup takes place ? patrice armand of the french football supporters union remembers the build up to france 's tournament in 1998 , the last world cup to be played on european soil .
" in france it felt like we were cut off from the rest of the world while preparing for the tournament in 1998 , " he said . the french faced a number of similar challenges to the germans in the build-up to their world cup but armand believes germany has had a tougher job this time round . a changing world with changing challenges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french celebrated after preparation stress subsided " the world has changed dramatically since 1998 .
germany has had to deal with the increased threat from international terrorism , something that was less of a worry for france eight years ago .
i think germany is doing the best it can to protect the world cup from attack but it could do more . " when asked if he thought the german army should be deployed as an added security force , armand said : " that is an issue for the germans to decide .
for the french , it would be no problem but we do not have such a weight of history on us as the germans do .
i think the germans should do whatever it takes to secure the world cup . " france suffered from the scourge of hooliganism in ' 98 and the germans are hoping they have learnt from the lessons of the past .
they have prepared a plan for dealing with the threat , specifically from renowned hooligans and bitter rivals from england and the netherlands . judge us on behavior , not reputation , say england fans with the german police under orders to watch these sets of fans in particular , what feeling does that create in these countries in the build-up to the tournament ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : england fans have worked hard to change perceptions " england fans want to be judged on their behavior and not their reputation , " said andrin cooper from the english football association -lrb- fa -rrb- .
" our fans have made huge strides in recent years to change perceptions .
we had just one arrest at euro 2004 in portugal and none at the 2002 world cup . " " the fa is expecting a great world cup in a real football country with a real football culture .
germany has great infrastructure and great stadiums and the organizing committee and host cities have really made an effort to welcome everyone with open arms .
we 're confident it will be a successful , safe world cup . " dutch expert fears open-space hooliganism ron elsker , an expert on dutch soccer hooliganism , agreed but had concerns about security away from the stadiums .
" i think the idea of having public viewing areas is unavoidable considering the demand for the world cup , but i also feel that the germans have dug themselves into a hole with this idea , " elsker said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the idea of " fanparks " has some security experts concerned " i do n't think they are prepared enough to deal with the potential for violence at these events .
a stadium is one thing , a wide open public place is a lot harder to police . " even if the stadiums are secure when it comes to potential violence , there have been concerns raised about the condition and safety precautions in place at the grounds . after a widely reported spat between the organizing committee and consumer watchdog magazine stiftung warentest over a report that four world cup stadiums had inadequate safety measures in place , a recent uefa cup clash between stuttgart and english team middlesbrough at the gottlieb daimler stadium once again raised these concerns . no safety fears for fans despite stuttgart incident a burst pipe in a kitchen caused an alert 30 minutes before kick-off and the announcements which followed were made in german , with no translation , meaning many boro fans remained in their seats during the evacuation . paddy cronesberry , the chairman of middlesbrough 's disabled supporters club was in stuttgart for the game .
" most of the disabled supporters were stopped from entering once the alarm went off , but those supporters in the ground had no idea what was happening . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traveling fans were impressed by stuttgart 's stadium " despite that , i was very impressed by the stadium and the safety measures although access could have been better .
we only had a couple of thousand fans and the two gates for the away end still made it tight .
a large contingent may have bigger problems . " " the germans are the best at organizing anything and have had a lot of experience of big sporting events .
i have no concerns about safety for fans in the german stadiums .
i think the attitudes of people are the most important thing .
if you go with a positive one , you will help the world cup be a huge success .

for germans , the reporting of the world cup preparation process has become almost a daily soap opera but how do issues such as the struggles with hooliganism , security and stadium safety look to those outside germany ? inside germany 's borders , the country 's world cup preparations - with all their successes and failures - have been followed almost daily by the media .
as a result , even the most mundane twists and turns of the process have been reported and passed on to the public .
people in germany are now either very well informed or fed up with the whole thing . but the world cup , of course , is not just a german event .
from the beginning of june , the teams and supporters of 31 other countries will begin to descend on germany for the actual tournament . while the world cup soap opera has been playing almost constantly in the host country since it was awarded the championships in 2002 , the other participating countries have had other things on their minds , like qualification and their own chances of lifting the trophy . so have such widely debated topics as security , stadium safety and ticket allocation made any impact outside germany ?
do the other nations really care about the preparations as long as the world cup takes place ? patrice armand of the french football supporters union remembers the build up to france 's tournament in 1998 , the last world cup to be played on european soil .
" in france it felt like we were cut off from the rest of the world while preparing for the tournament in 1998 , " he said . the french faced a number of similar challenges to the germans in the build-up to their world cup but armand believes germany has had a tougher job this time round . a changing world with changing challenges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french celebrated after preparation stress subsided " the world has changed dramatically since 1998 .

for germans , the reporting of the world cup preparation process has become almost a daily soap opera but how do issues such as the struggles with hooliganism , security and stadium safety look to those outside germany ? inside germany 's borders , the country 's world cup preparations - with all their successes and failures - have been followed almost daily by the media .
as a result , even the most mundane twists and turns of the process have been reported and passed on to the public .
people in germany are now either very well informed or fed up with the whole thing . but the world cup , of course , is not just a german event .
from the beginning of june , the teams and supporters of 31 other countries will begin to descend on germany for the actual tournament . while the world cup soap opera has been playing almost constantly in the host country since it was awarded the championships in 2002 , the other participating countries have had other things on their minds , like qualification and their own chances of lifting the trophy . so have such widely debated topics as security , stadium safety and ticket allocation made any impact outside germany ?
do the other nations really care about the preparations as long as the world cup takes place ? patrice armand of the french football supporters union remembers the build up to france 's tournament in 1998 , the last world cup to be played on european soil .
" in france it felt like we were cut off from the rest of the world while preparing for the tournament in 1998 , " he said . the french faced a number of similar challenges to the germans in the build-up to their world cup but armand believes germany has had a tougher job this time round . a changing world with changing challenges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french celebrated after preparation stress subsided " the world has changed dramatically since 1998 .

from the beginning of june , the teams and supporters of 31 other countries will begin to descend on germany for the actual tournament . while the world cup soap opera has been playing almost constantly in the host country since it was awarded the championships in 2002 , the other participating countries have had other things on their minds , like qualification and their own chances of lifting the trophy . so have such widely debated topics as security , stadium safety and ticket allocation made any impact outside germany ?
do the other nations really care about the preparations as long as the world cup takes place ? patrice armand of the french football supporters union remembers the build up to france 's tournament in 1998 , the last world cup to be played on european soil .
" in france it felt like we were cut off from the rest of the world while preparing for the tournament in 1998 , " he said . the french faced a number of similar challenges to the germans in the build-up to their world cup but armand believes germany has had a tougher job this time round . a changing world with changing challenges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french celebrated after preparation stress subsided " the world has changed dramatically since 1998 .
germany has had to deal with the increased threat from international terrorism , something that was less of a worry for france eight years ago .
i think germany is doing the best it can to protect the world cup from attack but it could do more . " when asked if he thought the german army should be deployed as an added security force , armand said : " that is an issue for the germans to decide .
for the french , it would be no problem but we do not have such a weight of history on us as the germans do .
i think the germans should do whatever it takes to secure the world cup . " france suffered from the scourge of hooliganism in ' 98 and the germans are hoping they have learnt from the lessons of the past .
they have prepared a plan for dealing with the threat , specifically from renowned hooligans and bitter rivals from england and the netherlands . judge us on behavior , not reputation , say england fans with the german police under orders to watch these sets of fans in particular , what feeling does that create in these countries in the build-up to the tournament ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : england fans have worked hard to change perceptions " england fans want to be judged on their behavior and not their reputation , " said andrin cooper from the english football association -lrb- fa -rrb- .
" our fans have made huge strides in recent years to change perceptions .
we had just one arrest at euro 2004 in portugal and none at the 2002 world cup . " " the fa is expecting a great world cup in a real football country with a real football culture .
germany has great infrastructure and great stadiums and the organizing committee and host cities have really made an effort to welcome everyone with open arms .
we 're confident it will be a successful , safe world cup . " dutch expert fears open-space hooliganism ron elsker , an expert on dutch soccer hooliganism , agreed but had concerns about security away from the stadiums .
" i think the idea of having public viewing areas is unavoidable considering the demand for the world cup , but i also feel that the germans have dug themselves into a hole with this idea , " elsker said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the idea of " fanparks " has some security experts concerned " i do n't think they are prepared enough to deal with the potential for violence at these events .
a stadium is one thing , a wide open public place is a lot harder to police . " even if the stadiums are secure when it comes to potential violence , there have been concerns raised about the condition and safety precautions in place at the grounds . after a widely reported spat between the organizing committee and consumer watchdog magazine stiftung warentest over a report that four world cup stadiums had inadequate safety measures in place , a recent uefa cup clash between stuttgart and english team middlesbrough at the gottlieb daimler stadium once again raised these concerns . no safety fears for fans despite stuttgart incident a burst pipe in a kitchen caused an alert 30 minutes before kick-off and the announcements which followed were made in german , with no translation , meaning many boro fans remained in their seats during the evacuation . paddy cronesberry , the chairman of middlesbrough 's disabled supporters club was in stuttgart for the game .
" most of the disabled supporters were stopped from entering once the alarm went off , but those supporters in the ground had no idea what was happening . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traveling fans were impressed by stuttgart 's stadium " despite that , i was very impressed by the stadium and the safety measures although access could have been better .
we only had a couple of thousand fans and the two gates for the away end still made it tight .
a large contingent may have bigger problems . " " the germans are the best at organizing anything and have had a lot of experience of big sporting events .
i have no concerns about safety for fans in the german stadiums .
i think the attitudes of people are the most important thing .
if you go with a positive one , you will help the world cup be a huge success .

speakers for the opposition in parliament called it a monster .
they feel it can not take care of the task of untangling the web of interlocking powers between federal and state governments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast served as minister for agriculture and consumer protection in the previous government " the reform was meant to separate powers , but it now does n't , " said renate künast , the parliamentary leader of the greens party .
" it was meant to speed up decision-making and tackle the huge challenges facing germany .
on all of this the reform fails .
what was supposed to be the masterpiece of the grand coalition government has become a bungled piece of legislation that wo n't bring germany forward . " current system blocks legislation currently around 60 percent of german laws have to be approved by both chambers of parliament , the bundestag and the bundesrat , which represents the states .
this system has led to a blockade of important legislation in the past when the two houses have been controlled by different parties .
if ratified , the new bill would substantially reduce the number of laws which the bundesrat can veto . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesrat in session in exchange for the concessions by the states , the central government in berlin has been forced to relinquish powers in areas such as education , the environment , the penal system and the civil service .
opposition parties therefore accused chancellor angela merkel of fostering separatist tendencies among state leaders who are bent on destroying national solidarity . in times of limited finances , they warned , this would lead to a race for the lowest standards in environmental protection and public administration , and foster growing inequality in education . government mulls changes to reform this fear was even shared by peter struck , parliamentary leader of the social democrats . although the spd ministers in chancellor merkel 's cabinet are supporting the draft , he openly called for changes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter struck does n't want to rush things " simply because the bill has been brought into parliament , this does n't mean we adopt it all at once , " he said .
" there is no doubt that a reform is necessary .
but this draft can not be the last word on it and parliamentary deputies have every right to change it according to their convictions . " but klaus wowereit , the social democrat mayor of the city-state of berlin , warned against unraveling the hard-won compromise . " if all those who have not seen their wishes fulfilled start demanding changes , we 'll end up in a difficult situation , " he said .
" in this case i expect the reform to founder in the end . " but some voices in the bundesrat said they were worried that the poorer states could suffer from the reforms . both houses of parliament must pass the bill with a two-thirds majority before the constitutional amendments can go through .
the reform is the first key domestic hurdle for chancellor angela merkel and a major test of the ability of her grand coalition government to sell controversial measures not only to the public at large but also to its own members of parliament . uwe hessler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany starts constitutional overhaul germany 's parliament on friday is starting the process of reforming the country 's federal structure .

the court revealed that it is believed that at least one of the offers of payment was accepted .
the court also refused to acknowledge or deny any connection with the match fixing operation involving hoyzer . the dfb also revealed that it was carrying out its own investigation into the possibility that matches in the amateur regional league might have been fixed this season after hearing claims to that effect .
the dfb said in a statement that it had no evidence yet and had handed all relevant information to the state prosecutors in frankfurt . no refereeing or top tier involvement , dfb says the ruling body was quick to add that the current probe had so far shown that the new cases of match fixing were nowhere near as large as those of last year and that there had been no evidence as yet to indicate the top tier of the game had been infiltrated or officials bribed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dfb 's theo zwanziger promised swift action " we have to state clearly that , according to the results of the ongoing investigation , no referee is involved and no first division club is concerned , " dfb chief executive theo zwanziger said in a statement .

the court revealed that it is believed that at least one of the offers of payment was accepted .
the court also refused to acknowledge or deny any connection with the match fixing operation involving hoyzer . the dfb also revealed that it was carrying out its own investigation into the possibility that matches in the amateur regional league might have been fixed this season after hearing claims to that effect .
the dfb said in a statement that it had no evidence yet and had handed all relevant information to the state prosecutors in frankfurt . no refereeing or top tier involvement , dfb says the ruling body was quick to add that the current probe had so far shown that the new cases of match fixing were nowhere near as large as those of last year and that there had been no evidence as yet to indicate the top tier of the game had been infiltrated or officials bribed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dfb 's theo zwanziger promised swift action " we have to state clearly that , according to the results of the ongoing investigation , no referee is involved and no first division club is concerned , " dfb chief executive theo zwanziger said in a statement .
" as long as there is money circulating around games , sadly , you can not rule out manipulation and cheating , " zwanziger added . " the dfb has been investigating for several weeks .
there was a very small suspicion of a criminal act and we decided that in the interests of a clear explanation we would work together with the investigators , " zwanziger continued .

stating the need for an inquiry had been one thing , but agreeing on joint terms of reference quite another , especially since one of the opposition parties - the greens - was in government at the time and is worried about what the inquiry will reveal . now that this stumbling block is out of the way , the opposition has to collect the required 154 signatures in favor of the inquiry next week .

the opposition wants the probe to deal first and foremost with the role of bnd agents stationed in baghdad before and during the war on iraq .
of particular interest are all issues related to the question as to whether these agents or their bosses at home passed on any information to the us military or intelligence which might have helped the americans pick bombing targets . this would have meant direct involvement in the war effort and would have stood in stark contrast to the official line of the german government , which openly and vociferously opposed the war . but the inquiry will deal with a number of other aspects as well , such as the abduction of a lebanese-born german national to afghanistan by the cia and the interrogation of terror suspects by german intelligence agents in detention camps located in countries with a record of using torture . government rejects inquiry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's foreign minister frank-walter belonged to the former and current government it did n't come as a major surprise that the ruling grand coalition of social and christian democrats showed little understanding for the opposition 's intentions . " the free democrats should be ashamed of forging an alliance with the left party and the greens in such a sensitive matter , " said peter ramsauer , the parliamentary leader of bavaria 's christian social union .
" the really should n't ignore the damage they 're about to do .
the reputation of germany 's intelligence service is bound to suffer .
and i doubt whether in such a situation the bnd can do its job and provide maximum safety for our citizens in the months ahead . " for the opposition , the fdp 's jörg van essen said he was certain the inquiry would not serve to discredit the work of the german intelligence , but would rather look into what he believes was a double game being played by the schröder government . he also brushed aside allegations that his party wanted to use the probe mainly as an instrument to win over voters during elections in several german states later this month . swift process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hearings will take place in a room like this one the opposition parties have suggested that the inquiry could start as soon as the end of march .
they - especially the greens - do n't want it to drag on for months on end , turning into a general investigation of the previous government 's foreign policy . they are planning to appoint a special investigator to speed up things .

for germans , the reporting of the world cup preparation process has become almost a daily soap opera but how do issues such as the struggles with hooliganism , security and stadium safety look to those outside germany ? inside germany 's borders , the country 's world cup preparations - with all their successes and failures - have been followed almost daily by the media .
as a result , even the most mundane twists and turns of the process have been reported and passed on to the public .
people in germany are now either very well informed or fed up with the whole thing . but the world cup , of course , is not just a german event .
from the beginning of june , the teams and supporters of 31 other countries will begin to descend on germany for the actual tournament . while the world cup soap opera has been playing almost constantly in the host country since it was awarded the championships in 2002 , the other participating countries have had other things on their minds , like qualification and their own chances of lifting the trophy . so have such widely debated topics as security , stadium safety and ticket allocation made any impact outside germany ?
do the other nations really care about the preparations as long as the world cup takes place ? patrice armand of the french football supporters union remembers the build up to france 's tournament in 1998 , the last world cup to be played on european soil .
" in france it felt like we were cut off from the rest of the world while preparing for the tournament in 1998 , " he said . the french faced a number of similar challenges to the germans in the build-up to their world cup but armand believes germany has had a tougher job this time round . a changing world with changing challenges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french celebrated after preparation stress subsided " the world has changed dramatically since 1998 .
germany has had to deal with the increased threat from international terrorism , something that was less of a worry for france eight years ago .
i think germany is doing the best it can to protect the world cup from attack but it could do more . " when asked if he thought the german army should be deployed as an added security force , armand said : " that is an issue for the germans to decide .
for the french , it would be no problem but we do not have such a weight of history on us as the germans do .
i think the germans should do whatever it takes to secure the world cup . " france suffered from the scourge of hooliganism in ' 98 and the germans are hoping they have learnt from the lessons of the past .
they have prepared a plan for dealing with the threat , specifically from renowned hooligans and bitter rivals from england and the netherlands . judge us on behavior , not reputation , say england fans with the german police under orders to watch these sets of fans in particular , what feeling does that create in these countries in the build-up to the tournament ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : england fans have worked hard to change perceptions " england fans want to be judged on their behavior and not their reputation , " said andrin cooper from the english football association -lrb- fa -rrb- .
" our fans have made huge strides in recent years to change perceptions .
we had just one arrest at euro 2004 in portugal and none at the 2002 world cup . " " the fa is expecting a great world cup in a real football country with a real football culture .
germany has great infrastructure and great stadiums and the organizing committee and host cities have really made an effort to welcome everyone with open arms .
we 're confident it will be a successful , safe world cup . " dutch expert fears open-space hooliganism ron elsker , an expert on dutch soccer hooliganism , agreed but had concerns about security away from the stadiums .
" i think the idea of having public viewing areas is unavoidable considering the demand for the world cup , but i also feel that the germans have dug themselves into a hole with this idea , " elsker said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the idea of " fanparks " has some security experts concerned " i do n't think they are prepared enough to deal with the potential for violence at these events .
a stadium is one thing , a wide open public place is a lot harder to police . " even if the stadiums are secure when it comes to potential violence , there have been concerns raised about the condition and safety precautions in place at the grounds . after a widely reported spat between the organizing committee and consumer watchdog magazine stiftung warentest over a report that four world cup stadiums had inadequate safety measures in place , a recent uefa cup clash between stuttgart and english team middlesbrough at the gottlieb daimler stadium once again raised these concerns . no safety fears for fans despite stuttgart incident a burst pipe in a kitchen caused an alert 30 minutes before kick-off and the announcements which followed were made in german , with no translation , meaning many boro fans remained in their seats during the evacuation . paddy cronesberry , the chairman of middlesbrough 's disabled supporters club was in stuttgart for the game .
" most of the disabled supporters were stopped from entering once the alarm went off , but those supporters in the ground had no idea what was happening . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traveling fans were impressed by stuttgart 's stadium " despite that , i was very impressed by the stadium and the safety measures although access could have been better .
we only had a couple of thousand fans and the two gates for the away end still made it tight .
a large contingent may have bigger problems . " " the germans are the best at organizing anything and have had a lot of experience of big sporting events .
i have no concerns about safety for fans in the german stadiums .
i think the attitudes of people are the most important thing .
if you go with a positive one , you will help the world cup be a huge success .

it 's the biggest overhaul of germany 's governmental system and will require 40 constitutional amendments . the long-awaited federalism reform is expected to newly regulate the jurisdictions of the federal government and germany 's 16 states . the latter are generally responsible for making laws - a concept that forms the basis of the original idea of federalism , according to herbert von arnim , a professor at the university for administrative sciences in speyer . " states are closer to the citizens , " he said .
" they know what things are like on the ground and find it easier to adjust rules to the needs of the people .
they can also compete with each other , meaning that the best system will succeed in the end . " historic foundation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto von bismarck became germany 's first chancellor in 1871 after uniting the country under the prussian crown germany 's principle of federalism has its roots in history . for centuries , germany consisted of autonomous principalities and so-called " free cities . "
this patchwork quilt long resisted any attempts for unification .
when the german reich was eventually founded in 1871 , individual states still did n't hand over much sovereignty . some of this diversity has been preserved today , such as in the area of culture .
few countries have as many opera houses and theaters as germany . " federalism clearly brings about diversity , " said martin molok , a law professor at düsseldorf university .
" it encourages progress .
if we have different model , we can test which one works best and choose it . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : theodor heuss germany 's nazi dictatorship also influenced the postwar constitution , which was meant to prevent a concentration of power in berlin .
germany 's first federal president , theodor heuss , declared his support for federalism in september 1949 . " we are a federal republic , " he said .
" we do n't want centralism in german .
we have behind us the lesson of national socialism that showed us what happens when germans are meant to fit a norm .
we do n't want that . " federal rights increase but there are cases - by now a majority - where the federal government has the power to legislate . " there are a number of areas , such as foreign policy , where it would not make sense to leave it up to the states , " morlok said , adding that globalization has increased the number of areas where laws are made in the country 's administrative center . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr is a federal matter defense , trade and currency issues and transport are fields were federal legislation is warranted .
in other areas , states can only adopt laws if the federal government has not done so already .
this includes social , civil and criminal law .
the federal state also regulates almost everything that has to do with immigration . the states maintain jurisdiction over police and education matters .
but even in these areas , states are increasingly coordinating their decisions . " there are no less than 1,000 coordinating committees , " von arnim said . adding the eu layer adding to the confusion is the supranational level of the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu also has a say when it comes to agriculture " we have some areas , such as agriculture and environmental protection , where the basic guidelines come from brussels and national parliaments have to turn them into law , " morlok said .
" that means that federal and state governments have to deal with this one after the other .
and that leads to people being totally confused about who is in charge . " reacting to a waning right to legislate , states have been trying to influence federal legislation .
since they have to approve regulations that affect them directly , if they reject them in germany 's upper house , the bundesrat , proposed legislation can not become law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the bundesrat have to approve fewer federal laws in the future ?
the number of laws that require state approval has risen from 40 percent to 60 percent , allowing states to block laws in power struggles with the national government .
this happened frequently under the previous red-green coalition as the bundesrat was controlled by the christian democratic opposition . federalism reform is meant to untie these sometimes gnarled interconnections and make the state more effective again . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chancellor merkel riding high after first 100 days the dire predictions once made about germany 's current " grand coalition " government have proven untrue .

the court revealed that it is believed that at least one of the offers of payment was accepted .
the court also refused to acknowledge or deny any connection with the match fixing operation involving hoyzer . the dfb also revealed that it was carrying out its own investigation into the possibility that matches in the amateur regional league might have been fixed this season after hearing claims to that effect .
the dfb said in a statement that it had no evidence yet and had handed all relevant information to the state prosecutors in frankfurt . no refereeing or top tier involvement , dfb says the ruling body was quick to add that the current probe had so far shown that the new cases of match fixing were nowhere near as large as those of last year and that there had been no evidence as yet to indicate the top tier of the game had been infiltrated or officials bribed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dfb 's theo zwanziger promised swift action " we have to state clearly that , according to the results of the ongoing investigation , no referee is involved and no first division club is concerned , " dfb chief executive theo zwanziger said in a statement .
" as long as there is money circulating around games , sadly , you can not rule out manipulation and cheating , " zwanziger added . " the dfb has been investigating for several weeks .
there was a very small suspicion of a criminal act and we decided that in the interests of a clear explanation we would work together with the investigators , " zwanziger continued .
" if anything is confirmed , it will be investigated and action will be taken .

the city council agreed to the sale with a vote of 40 in favor and 29 against . the controversial decision , which went against the wishes of 45,000 residents who signed a petition protesting against the deal , makes dresden the first major german city to sell its entire residential real estate holdings and could have a knock on effect for other cash-strapped cities . poorly performing economies and high social costs have saddled larger german towns and cities with mountains of debt .
in recent years , the sale of apartments built to serve lower-income workers has become a quick way of reducing debt , to the chagrin of tenant associations . the sale of dresden 's real estate holdings may lead to other cities taking similar action .

only the government and individual states can solve the problems by reducing financial demands and increasing investment , he said . the german tenants association called the deal " wrong and short-sighted , " saying that the tenants would be expected to pay the bill in the long run .

the court revealed that it is believed that at least one of the offers of payment was accepted .
the court also refused to acknowledge or deny any connection with the match fixing operation involving hoyzer . the dfb also revealed that it was carrying out its own investigation into the possibility that matches in the amateur regional league might have been fixed this season after hearing claims to that effect .
the dfb said in a statement that it had no evidence yet and had handed all relevant information to the state prosecutors in frankfurt . no refereeing or top tier involvement , dfb says the ruling body was quick to add that the current probe had so far shown that the new cases of match fixing were nowhere near as large as those of last year and that there had been no evidence as yet to indicate the top tier of the game had been infiltrated or officials bribed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dfb 's theo zwanziger promised swift action " we have to state clearly that , according to the results of the ongoing investigation , no referee is involved and no first division club is concerned , " dfb chief executive theo zwanziger said in a statement .
" as long as there is money circulating around games , sadly , you can not rule out manipulation and cheating , " zwanziger added . " the dfb has been investigating for several weeks .
there was a very small suspicion of a criminal act and we decided that in the interests of a clear explanation we would work together with the investigators , " zwanziger continued .
" if anything is confirmed , it will be investigated and action will be taken .
those involved will be removed , and that includes from football circles .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.03.2006 germany starts constitutional overhaul großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is trying to untie the knot of federalism germany 's parliament on friday is starting the process of reforming the country 's federal structure .
it 's the biggest overhaul of germany 's governmental system and will require 40 constitutional amendments . the long-awaited federalism reform is expected to newly regulate the jurisdictions of the federal government and germany 's 16 states . the latter are generally responsible for making laws - a concept that forms the basis of the original idea of federalism , according to herbert von arnim , a professor at the university for administrative sciences in speyer . " states are closer to the citizens , " he said .
" they know what things are like on the ground and find it easier to adjust rules to the needs of the people .
they can also compete with each other , meaning that the best system will succeed in the end . " historic foundation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto von bismarck became germany 's first chancellor in 1871 after uniting the country under the prussian crown germany 's principle of federalism has its roots in history . for centuries , germany consisted of autonomous principalities and so-called " free cities . "
this patchwork quilt long resisted any attempts for unification .
when the german reich was eventually founded in 1871 , individual states still did n't hand over much sovereignty . some of this diversity has been preserved today , such as in the area of culture .
few countries have as many opera houses and theaters as germany . " federalism clearly brings about diversity , " said martin molok , a law professor at düsseldorf university .
" it encourages progress .
if we have different model , we can test which one works best and choose it . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : theodor heuss germany 's nazi dictatorship also influenced the postwar constitution , which was meant to prevent a concentration of power in berlin .
germany 's first federal president , theodor heuss , declared his support for federalism in september 1949 . " we are a federal republic , " he said .
" we do n't want centralism in german .
we have behind us the lesson of national socialism that showed us what happens when germans are meant to fit a norm .
we do n't want that . " federal rights increase but there are cases - by now a majority - where the federal government has the power to legislate . " there are a number of areas , such as foreign policy , where it would not make sense to leave it up to the states , " morlok said , adding that globalization has increased the number of areas where laws are made in the country 's administrative center . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr is a federal matter defense , trade and currency issues and transport are fields were federal legislation is warranted .
in other areas , states can only adopt laws if the federal government has not done so already .
this includes social , civil and criminal law .
the federal state also regulates almost everything that has to do with immigration . the states maintain jurisdiction over police and education matters .
but even in these areas , states are increasingly coordinating their decisions . " there are no less than 1,000 coordinating committees , " von arnim said . adding the eu layer adding to the confusion is the supranational level of the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu also has a say when it comes to agriculture " we have some areas , such as agriculture and environmental protection , where the basic guidelines come from brussels and national parliaments have to turn them into law , " morlok said .
" that means that federal and state governments have to deal with this one after the other .
and that leads to people being totally confused about who is in charge . " reacting to a waning right to legislate , states have been trying to influence federal legislation .
since they have to approve regulations that affect them directly , if they reject them in germany 's upper house , the bundesrat , proposed legislation can not become law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the bundesrat have to approve fewer federal laws in the future ?
the number of laws that require state approval has risen from 40 percent to 60 percent , allowing states to block laws in power struggles with the national government .
this happened frequently under the previous red-green coalition as the bundesrat was controlled by the christian democratic opposition . federalism reform is meant to untie these sometimes gnarled interconnections and make the state more effective again . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chancellor merkel riding high after first 100 days the dire predictions once made about germany 's current " grand coalition " government have proven untrue .

for germans , the reporting of the world cup preparation process has become almost a daily soap opera but how do issues such as the struggles with hooliganism , security and stadium safety look to those outside germany ? inside germany 's borders , the country 's world cup preparations - with all their successes and failures - have been followed almost daily by the media .
as a result , even the most mundane twists and turns of the process have been reported and passed on to the public .
people in germany are now either very well informed or fed up with the whole thing . but the world cup , of course , is not just a german event .
from the beginning of june , the teams and supporters of 31 other countries will begin to descend on germany for the actual tournament . while the world cup soap opera has been playing almost constantly in the host country since it was awarded the championships in 2002 , the other participating countries have had other things on their minds , like qualification and their own chances of lifting the trophy . so have such widely debated topics as security , stadium safety and ticket allocation made any impact outside germany ?
do the other nations really care about the preparations as long as the world cup takes place ? patrice armand of the french football supporters union remembers the build up to france 's tournament in 1998 , the last world cup to be played on european soil .
" in france it felt like we were cut off from the rest of the world while preparing for the tournament in 1998 , " he said . the french faced a number of similar challenges to the germans in the build-up to their world cup but armand believes germany has had a tougher job this time round . a changing world with changing challenges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french celebrated after preparation stress subsided " the world has changed dramatically since 1998 .
germany has had to deal with the increased threat from international terrorism , something that was less of a worry for france eight years ago .
i think germany is doing the best it can to protect the world cup from attack but it could do more . " when asked if he thought the german army should be deployed as an added security force , armand said : " that is an issue for the germans to decide .
for the french , it would be no problem but we do not have such a weight of history on us as the germans do .
i think the germans should do whatever it takes to secure the world cup . " france suffered from the scourge of hooliganism in ' 98 and the germans are hoping they have learnt from the lessons of the past .
they have prepared a plan for dealing with the threat , specifically from renowned hooligans and bitter rivals from england and the netherlands . judge us on behavior , not reputation , say england fans with the german police under orders to watch these sets of fans in particular , what feeling does that create in these countries in the build-up to the tournament ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : england fans have worked hard to change perceptions " england fans want to be judged on their behavior and not their reputation , " said andrin cooper from the english football association -lrb- fa -rrb- .
" our fans have made huge strides in recent years to change perceptions .
we had just one arrest at euro 2004 in portugal and none at the 2002 world cup . " " the fa is expecting a great world cup in a real football country with a real football culture .
germany has great infrastructure and great stadiums and the organizing committee and host cities have really made an effort to welcome everyone with open arms .
we 're confident it will be a successful , safe world cup . " dutch expert fears open-space hooliganism ron elsker , an expert on dutch soccer hooliganism , agreed but had concerns about security away from the stadiums .
" i think the idea of having public viewing areas is unavoidable considering the demand for the world cup , but i also feel that the germans have dug themselves into a hole with this idea , " elsker said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the idea of " fanparks " has some security experts concerned " i do n't think they are prepared enough to deal with the potential for violence at these events .
a stadium is one thing , a wide open public place is a lot harder to police . " even if the stadiums are secure when it comes to potential violence , there have been concerns raised about the condition and safety precautions in place at the grounds . after a widely reported spat between the organizing committee and consumer watchdog magazine stiftung warentest over a report that four world cup stadiums had inadequate safety measures in place , a recent uefa cup clash between stuttgart and english team middlesbrough at the gottlieb daimler stadium once again raised these concerns . no safety fears for fans despite stuttgart incident a burst pipe in a kitchen caused an alert 30 minutes before kick-off and the announcements which followed were made in german , with no translation , meaning many boro fans remained in their seats during the evacuation . paddy cronesberry , the chairman of middlesbrough 's disabled supporters club was in stuttgart for the game .
" most of the disabled supporters were stopped from entering once the alarm went off , but those supporters in the ground had no idea what was happening . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traveling fans were impressed by stuttgart 's stadium " despite that , i was very impressed by the stadium and the safety measures although access could have been better .
we only had a couple of thousand fans and the two gates for the away end still made it tight .
a large contingent may have bigger problems . " " the germans are the best at organizing anything and have had a lot of experience of big sporting events .
i have no concerns about safety for fans in the german stadiums .
i think the attitudes of people are the most important thing .
if you go with a positive one , you will help the world cup be a huge success .

for germans , the reporting of the world cup preparation process has become almost a daily soap opera but how do issues such as the struggles with hooliganism , security and stadium safety look to those outside germany ? inside germany 's borders , the country 's world cup preparations - with all their successes and failures - have been followed almost daily by the media .
as a result , even the most mundane twists and turns of the process have been reported and passed on to the public .
people in germany are now either very well informed or fed up with the whole thing . but the world cup , of course , is not just a german event .
from the beginning of june , the teams and supporters of 31 other countries will begin to descend on germany for the actual tournament . while the world cup soap opera has been playing almost constantly in the host country since it was awarded the championships in 2002 , the other participating countries have had other things on their minds , like qualification and their own chances of lifting the trophy . so have such widely debated topics as security , stadium safety and ticket allocation made any impact outside germany ?
do the other nations really care about the preparations as long as the world cup takes place ? patrice armand of the french football supporters union remembers the build up to france 's tournament in 1998 , the last world cup to be played on european soil .
" in france it felt like we were cut off from the rest of the world while preparing for the tournament in 1998 , " he said . the french faced a number of similar challenges to the germans in the build-up to their world cup but armand believes germany has had a tougher job this time round . a changing world with changing challenges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french celebrated after preparation stress subsided " the world has changed dramatically since 1998 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.03.2006 german opposition agrees on terms of bnd affair inquiry großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opposition in parliament hopes to get to the bottom on the bnd 's role in iraq following a protracted tug-of-war , germany 's opposition parties friday agreed on the terms of reference for a parliamentary inquiry on the activities of german intelligence service bnd before and during the iraq war . germany 's three opposition parties , the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , the left party and the greens accuse the former government of social democratic chancellor gerhard schröder of having secretly supported the us-led war effort while publicly rejecting the 2003 invasion . the parties have overcome their differences on the issue and on friday agreed on a brief for the planned parliamentary inquiry .
stating the need for an inquiry had been one thing , but agreeing on joint terms of reference quite another , especially since one of the opposition parties - the greens - was in government at the time and is worried about what the inquiry will reveal . now that this stumbling block is out of the way , the opposition has to collect the required 154 signatures in favor of the inquiry next week .
altogether , the three parties have 166 members in the bundestag , meaning that they can afford over 10 dissidents in their own ranks . bnd 's role in baghdad crucial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did bnd agents help the us in preparing the invasion of iraq ?
the opposition wants the probe to deal first and foremost with the role of bnd agents stationed in baghdad before and during the war on iraq .
of particular interest are all issues related to the question as to whether these agents or their bosses at home passed on any information to the us military or intelligence which might have helped the americans pick bombing targets . this would have meant direct involvement in the war effort and would have stood in stark contrast to the official line of the german government , which openly and vociferously opposed the war . but the inquiry will deal with a number of other aspects as well , such as the abduction of a lebanese-born german national to afghanistan by the cia and the interrogation of terror suspects by german intelligence agents in detention camps located in countries with a record of using torture . government rejects inquiry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's foreign minister frank-walter belonged to the former and current government it did n't come as a major surprise that the ruling grand coalition of social and christian democrats showed little understanding for the opposition 's intentions . " the free democrats should be ashamed of forging an alliance with the left party and the greens in such a sensitive matter , " said peter ramsauer , the parliamentary leader of bavaria 's christian social union .
" the really should n't ignore the damage they 're about to do .
the reputation of germany 's intelligence service is bound to suffer .
and i doubt whether in such a situation the bnd can do its job and provide maximum safety for our citizens in the months ahead .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.03.2006 german opposition agrees on terms of bnd affair inquiry großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opposition in parliament hopes to get to the bottom on the bnd 's role in iraq following a protracted tug-of-war , germany 's opposition parties friday agreed on the terms of reference for a parliamentary inquiry on the activities of german intelligence service bnd before and during the iraq war . germany 's three opposition parties , the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , the left party and the greens accuse the former government of social democratic chancellor gerhard schröder of having secretly supported the us-led war effort while publicly rejecting the 2003 invasion . the parties have overcome their differences on the issue and on friday agreed on a brief for the planned parliamentary inquiry .
stating the need for an inquiry had been one thing , but agreeing on joint terms of reference quite another , especially since one of the opposition parties - the greens - was in government at the time and is worried about what the inquiry will reveal . now that this stumbling block is out of the way , the opposition has to collect the required 154 signatures in favor of the inquiry next week .
altogether , the three parties have 166 members in the bundestag , meaning that they can afford over 10 dissidents in their own ranks . bnd 's role in baghdad crucial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did bnd agents help the us in preparing the invasion of iraq ?
the opposition wants the probe to deal first and foremost with the role of bnd agents stationed in baghdad before and during the war on iraq .
of particular interest are all issues related to the question as to whether these agents or their bosses at home passed on any information to the us military or intelligence which might have helped the americans pick bombing targets . this would have meant direct involvement in the war effort and would have stood in stark contrast to the official line of the german government , which openly and vociferously opposed the war . but the inquiry will deal with a number of other aspects as well , such as the abduction of a lebanese-born german national to afghanistan by the cia and the interrogation of terror suspects by german intelligence agents in detention camps located in countries with a record of using torture . government rejects inquiry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's foreign minister frank-walter belonged to the former and current government it did n't come as a major surprise that the ruling grand coalition of social and christian democrats showed little understanding for the opposition 's intentions . " the free democrats should be ashamed of forging an alliance with the left party and the greens in such a sensitive matter , " said peter ramsauer , the parliamentary leader of bavaria 's christian social union .
" the really should n't ignore the damage they 're about to do .
the reputation of germany 's intelligence service is bound to suffer .
and i doubt whether in such a situation the bnd can do its job and provide maximum safety for our citizens in the months ahead . " for the opposition , the fdp 's jörg van essen said he was certain the inquiry would not serve to discredit the work of the german intelligence , but would rather look into what he believes was a double game being played by the schröder government . he also brushed aside allegations that his party wanted to use the probe mainly as an instrument to win over voters during elections in several german states later this month . swift process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hearings will take place in a room like this one the opposition parties have suggested that the inquiry could start as soon as the end of march .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.03.2006 opposition criticizes federalism reform plan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : balancing federal and state interests : merkel with german states ' coat of arms on stars both houses of germany 's parliament on friday debated the draft of the country 's so-called federalism reform - a mammoth piece of legislation that includes more than 20 changes to the german constitution . german chancellor angela merkel and the premiers of the 16 federal states brought the reform before the german parliament in a joint effort to overhaul the country 's complex federal system . the amendments are deemed crucial in streamlining political decision-making in germany that has increasingly become a drawn-out affair with legislation being substantially watered down at the end of the process . but in spite of substantial agreement between federal and state governments , the " mother of all reforms , " as one of its authors called it , still has a rocky road ahead of it .
speakers for the opposition in parliament called it a monster .
they feel it can not take care of the task of untangling the web of interlocking powers between federal and state governments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast served as minister for agriculture and consumer protection in the previous government " the reform was meant to separate powers , but it now does n't , " said renate künast , the parliamentary leader of the greens party .
" it was meant to speed up decision-making and tackle the huge challenges facing germany .
on all of this the reform fails .
what was supposed to be the masterpiece of the grand coalition government has become a bungled piece of legislation that wo n't bring germany forward . " current system blocks legislation currently around 60 percent of german laws have to be approved by both chambers of parliament , the bundestag and the bundesrat , which represents the states .
this system has led to a blockade of important legislation in the past when the two houses have been controlled by different parties .
if ratified , the new bill would substantially reduce the number of laws which the bundesrat can veto . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesrat in session in exchange for the concessions by the states , the central government in berlin has been forced to relinquish powers in areas such as education , the environment , the penal system and the civil service .
opposition parties therefore accused chancellor angela merkel of fostering separatist tendencies among state leaders who are bent on destroying national solidarity . in times of limited finances , they warned , this would lead to a race for the lowest standards in environmental protection and public administration , and foster growing inequality in education . government mulls changes to reform this fear was even shared by peter struck , parliamentary leader of the social democrats . although the spd ministers in chancellor merkel 's cabinet are supporting the draft , he openly called for changes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter struck does n't want to rush things " simply because the bill has been brought into parliament , this does n't mean we adopt it all at once , " he said .
" there is no doubt that a reform is necessary .
but this draft can not be the last word on it and parliamentary deputies have every right to change it according to their convictions . " but klaus wowereit , the social democrat mayor of the city-state of berlin , warned against unraveling the hard-won compromise . " if all those who have not seen their wishes fulfilled start demanding changes , we 'll end up in a difficult situation , " he said .
" in this case i expect the reform to founder in the end . " but some voices in the bundesrat said they were worried that the poorer states could suffer from the reforms . both houses of parliament must pass the bill with a two-thirds majority before the constitutional amendments can go through .
the reform is the first key domestic hurdle for chancellor angela merkel and a major test of the ability of her grand coalition government to sell controversial measures not only to the public at large but also to its own members of parliament . uwe hessler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany starts constitutional overhaul germany 's parliament on friday is starting the process of reforming the country 's federal structure .

the city council agreed to the sale with a vote of 40 in favor and 29 against . the controversial decision , which went against the wishes of 45,000 residents who signed a petition protesting against the deal , makes dresden the first major german city to sell its entire residential real estate holdings and could have a knock on effect for other cash-strapped cities . poorly performing economies and high social costs have saddled larger german towns and cities with mountains of debt .
in recent years , the sale of apartments built to serve lower-income workers has become a quick way of reducing debt , to the chagrin of tenant associations . the sale of dresden 's real estate holdings may lead to other cities taking similar action .
berlin has already sold more than 260,000 apartments to private investors in the last three years .
hamburg and cologne are also considering such sales . " dresden sale is no blueprint for debt solution " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sale of dresden 's real estate worries residents however , gerd landsberg , the managing director of the german city and districts organization , said that dresden 's decision should not become a model for other cities wanting to clear their debts through such a scheme .
" this is an individual case , " he said , " and should not become a blueprint for the solution of financial problems . " landsberg said he would be pleased if dresden succeeds to free itself from debt but added that such sales are not the answer to financial crises .
only the government and individual states can solve the problems by reducing financial demands and increasing investment , he said . the german tenants association called the deal " wrong and short-sighted , " saying that the tenants would be expected to pay the bill in the long run .
" the high purchase price paid by fortress will have to recouped somewhere , " association director franz-georg rips said in a statement . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : dresden sells gdr legacy , eliminates debt in a highly-controversial move , dresden on thursday will become the first major german city to sell its entire residential real estate holdings .

john profumo 's public life was dramatically split into two parts : disgrace and redemption .
nearly 40 years after he misled the house of commons and helped bring down the macmillan government , the former politician was a dedicated charity worker , for whom his friend lord longford " felt more admiration than all the men i 've known in my lifetime " .
21 may 1963 was the date of mr profumo 's own journey on the road to damascus .
that was the day the then secretary for war addressed the house of commons and stressed there had been no impropriety in his relations with a woman called christine keeler .
unfortunate liaison in fact , mr profumo had met miss keeler two years previously at cliveden , the home of lord astor , and embarked on an affair .
christine keeler helped " bring down government " a government minister compromised by a love scandal was nothing unprecedented , and has happened since , but this liaison proved particularly ill-judged .
christine keeler was a high class call girl who , under the auspices of her social-climbing svengali stephen ward , had infiltrated some of the higher echelons of london society .
unfortunately for mr profumo , one of her acquaintances was the soviet military attache , eugene ivanov .
wife 's loyalty although an investigation later established that fiercely patriotic john profumo had never surrendered national secrets in his conversations with keeler , their liaison provided a heady media cocktail of sex and security , and mr profumo 's government days were numbered .
lifelong devotion : profumo with his wife valerie he explained that he had misled the house to protect his family .
in fact , when he confessed his infidelity to his wife , actress valerie hobson , during a trip to venice , she made it clear where her loyalty lay .
they would return to london , she said , to face the music together .
mr profumo 's fall from grace over one shameful episode was described by harold macmillan as " a great tragedy " , for this was a man whose skills could have taken him to the top of the conservative party .
kept regrets to himself graced with an italian ancestry , a family fortune and the title of baron which he never used , john profumo , known to all his friends as jack , was educated at harrow and oxford .
in 1940. aged 25 , he entered the commons after winning a by-election at kettering and becoming the youngest member of the house .
it was a tumultuous time and , following the anglo-french withdrawal from narvik , profumo - an army officer - was among a number of conservative mps to vote against prime minister neville chamberlain , in a move which paved the way for winston churchill to enter downing street .
profumo enjoyed a " good war " , rising to the rank of brigadier , but lost kettering in the labour election landslide of 1945 .
having re-entered the commons in 1950 as member for stratford-on-avon in 1950 , he held a series of ministerial posts , most notably minister for foreign affairs .
then , in july 1960 , he was made secretary of state for war .
in 1960 macmillan made profumo his war secretary but if he had regrets about his curtailed career , after may 1963 , mr profumo kept them to himself .
instead , he dedicated his energies to helping the poor and disadvantaged in london 's east end .
within days of his political decline , he turned up at the refuge centre toynbee hall and asked to help with the washing up .
" one of our national heroes " he stayed for nearly 40 years , used his still intact political skills to raise huge funds , and expanded the charity 's activities to include social programmes and youth training .
his wife , too , gave her time to helping others , working until her death in 1998 for the leprosy charity lepra .
in 1975 , john profumo received a cbe for his services to charity .
and 20 years later , margaret thatcher , who called him " one of our national heroes " , invited him to her 70th birthday dinner , and seated him next to the queen .
to the residents of toynbee hall , he was " a saint " his rehabilitation was complete .
lady thatcher said then : " it 's time to forget the keeler business .
his has been a very good life . "
the 1989 film scandal and later keeler 's autobiography kept the profumo affair alive in the public imagination .
however , for four decades after his downfall , the beleaguered protagonist always maintained a dignified silence .
he always judged his own actions harshly , but by his friends , peers and society , john profumo had been long since forgiven .

restrictions on alcohol , licensing dealers and the provision of help for problem gamblers are some of the measures operators should implement .
all new casinos must adhere by the guidelines , if passed , or face being fined or having their licences revoked .
last year £ 53bn was spent on gambling , including the national lottery , and one million people regularly gamble online .
the draft licence conditions and codes of practice aim to reduce crime , ensure fair play and prevent underage gambling .
what can be a harmless pastime for one person can be a life-destroying addiction for another culture secretary tessa jowell online gaming websites , which have seen a huge growth in recent years , will be regulated for the first time and rules will govern the treatment of addicts .
the proposed rules are being put out for consultation , and they follow legislation passed last year by parliament .
the gambling act 2005 comes fully into force in september 2007 .
it relaxes some laws on the activity and permits the building of 17 more casinos .
critics of the bill feared an increase in problem gambling and the bill was diluted to reduce the number of regional " super casinos " to one .
a further eight large and eight small casinos were included in the bill which was eventually passed .
the act also created the commission to regulate all gambling apart from the national lottery and spread betting .
the proposed new rules include : operators publishing policies and procedures for promoting " socially responsible gambling " information and advice for problem gamblers being prominently displayed online operators informing customers how much time and money they are spending on the site operators training their staff about problem gambling prevention of underage gambling , including age checks on those who appear to be under 21 licensing of casino employees such as dealers and cashiers gambling commission chairman peter dean said : " we 've drawn from international experience to make sure that standards of social responsibility amongst britain gambling operators will be the highest in the world .
dealers will have to be licensed " we will monitor all british gambling operators to make sure they comply with our rules . "

arab-owned dpw made the move as members of both the house of representatives and the senate warned they would block the takeover over security concerns .
the white house welcomed dpw 's offer saying it should defuse the standoff .
" it does provide a way forward and resolve the matter so we can continue working on other important priorities , " white house spokesman scott mcclellan said .
the deal would have made dpw a top-three global port operator , with 51 terminals in 30 countries across five continents and an interest in more than 20 us ports .

justin webb , the bbc 's washington correspondent , said it was unclear whether the deal would result in dpw forfeiting ownership of the ports in question , but if that was the case , the issue would be settled .
dpw 's statement added that the decision was " based on an understanding that dp world will have time to affect the transfer in an orderly fashion and that dp world will not suffer economic loss " .

the research was carried out by the national farmers ' union -lrb- nfu -rrb- and the country land and business association .
the result showed 94 % in favour of a cull , although less than 50 % said they would be willing to take part in the actual culling of the animals .
badger groups deny the creatures are responsible for bovine tb .
the department for environment food and rural affairs -lrb- defra -rrb- has admitted tb in cattle is one of its biggest problems .
the government said more measures were necessary to stop the increase of the disease and it has been carrying out a three month long public consultation on whether to introduce badger culling .
that consultation period ends on friday .
opposition to the consultation has been submitted in writing to the government by some environmental and wildlife groups in the region , stating a cull of badgers made " no scientific or economic sense " .
in january , the west country badger action group said it would take whatever action it felt was necessary to save the animals if a cull was introduced .
the south west is one of the worst-affected areas for bovine tb .
in devon , 1,144 farms were put under restrictions at some point because of positive tb tests between january and november 2005 .
that is almost 20 % of the county 's cattle farms .
in cornwall , the figure was 635 .
