" terrorism , the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , failing states - these are the scourges of our times , " german defense minister franz josef jung told the conference . " the old nato as a purely defensive alliance is history , " he added . us defense secretary donald rumsfeld thanked merkel for her " thoughtful and important remarks on nato " in his own conference speech devoted to islamic militancy . " the competences that exist within nato can be used to advantage in other parts of the world , " rumsfeld said . the us defense chief praised the alliance 's deployment in afghanistan after the fall of the taliban regime and in giving humanitarian assistance to pakistan after a massive earthquake last year . but nato 's potential was being held back by insufficient defense spending in members of the alliance , rumsfeld said . the united states was spending 3.7 percent of its gdp on defense but other nato members were spending far less , he said . " unless we invest in defense and security , the reality is that our homelands can be at risk . " french disagree and promote stronger eu forces bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of the european union 's growing military strength oppose the nato expansion ideas .
french defense minister michele alliot-marie took a more skeptical view on nato 's role and stressed the importance of the european union 's growing security capability , reflecting widespread concerns in france that a stronger nato would mean a weaker eu . " let 's take care ... not to spill into areas where the competence of other organizations is more suitable .
let 's not waste our financial means , which are vital for fighting crises and upgrading our equipment , " alliot-marie said . nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer , however , supported " pragmatic " cooperation between nato and the european union and sought to calm french fears . nato is no global cop says de hoop scheffer " nato is not a global policeman , " he said .
among the new global threats that nato could help combat , de hoop scheffer mentioned the protection of energy supply lines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer does not want the alliance to act as the world police .
" for reasons that are obvious - including the potential of terrorists targeting our energy supplies - it makes sense to me that the allies should discuss this issue , " he said . supplies of russian gas to ukraine and georgia have recently been disrupted . heads of state , government ministers , top defense officials and security experts gathered in a heavily-guarded five star hotel for the conference , entitled " restoring the transatlantic partnership .

" the concerns and fears over iran 's nuclear program are legitimate . " the un 's nuclear watchdog , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , voted on saturday to report iran to the un security council , paving the way to possible sanctions over its atomic program . iran retaliated by saying it would begin full-scale uranium enrichment and limit inspections by iaea officials . merkel said iran still had a chance to avoid the sanctions by accepting a russian proposal to allow iranian uranium enrichment to take place in russia , which would prevent tehran from mastering sensitive nuclear technology . she called on iran to consider the compromise as a " window of opportunity .

the german leader had strong words for iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who has called for israel to be " wiped off the map " and has branded the holocaust a " myth . " " a president who denies the existence of israel and the holocaust can not expect to receive any tolerance from germany , " merkel said . she compared ahmadinejad 's statements to when adolf hitler came to power and began threatening to exterminate european jews .

" the world does not want , and must work together to prevent , a nuclear iran , " he added , urging the global powers to unite and find a diplomatic solution to halt iran 's nuclear program . in tehran , rumsfeld 's iranian counterpart mostafa mohammad najjar said in response that the leaders of the united states were " terrorists " who represented the " real axis of evil . " iran insists it is developing a peaceful atomic energy program , but the western world suspects it is planning to build nuclear weapons . responding to merkel 's speech and speaking before the iaea decision , iran 's deputy foreign minister for legal and international affairs , abbas araghchi , said that referral to the security council would not lead the islamic republic to halt its nuclear activities . araghchi blames europe for failure of diplomacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abbas araghchi blamed the eu-3 for the collapse of talks .
" if the case is sent or even reported to the un security council , based on the law of our parliament , our government has no way of stopping nuclear activities , " araghchi said during merkel 's question and answer session . he blamed the three eu nations - britain , france and germany - which have negotiated with tehran over its nuclear ambitions , for creating the conflict . " we did whatever we could .
but as you know after three years of negotiations we left empty-handed , " araghchi said . merkel brushed off his statement , saying that iran " should consider amending its laws " and adding that she would have liked to hear him comment on his president 's denial of israel 's existence .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 05.02.2006 ski patrols curbing the fast and the furious großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everybody can get to the bottom of the slope in one piece skiing has become an increasingly dangerous sport .
now one swiss resort has come up with a novel way to try to ensure that guests leave the slopes as they arrived - in one piece . across europe 's alps , the winter ski season is in full swing .
thousands of holiday makers are already enjoying almost perfect snow conditions , while thousands more are packing their skis and getting ready to go . but at the hugely popular swiss resort of grindelwald , located 75 km -lrb- 50 miles -rrb- from the swiss capital bern , not everybody has the time to enjoy the scenery . " we have to be prepared to go out and get the injured , " said martin mathys of the grindelwald mountain rescue service . " with the speed , of course , we have a problem .
the equipment is always getting better , you can ski faster , and then you have also the head injuries , " he said . chasing the wind bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's a mad , mad world : where cows can fly and skiiers get pulled over with today 's modern carving skis , skiers can reach 80 kilometers an hour .
losing one 's balance at that speed , let alone crashing into somebody else , can really put a dramatic twist on an otherwise wonderful winter vacation . " speed is the big danger factor , but it 's not just speed , it 's also the way people ski , " said paul gunter , who is head of the emergency ward at the local hospital . " they make turns where they really do use the whole width of the slope , and that leads to collisions .
we 're seeing injuries now that are more like what you see in car accidents - head injuries , and back injuries , " gunter said . staying on the safe side bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hardcore skiing aficionados can even cause traffic jams the rising number of accidents is making some skiers stay away - even the keen ones .
that 's not a good development for a resort like grindelwald , which has attracted tourists since the 17th century .
so , local officials have come up with a novel solution to decrease the number of visitors leaving grindelwald overdosed on painkillers and wearing a cast . " we were asking people on the slopes , how do you feel , and a lot of people , especially families , said i just do n't feel safe because there are so many fast skiers around me , " benny kaufmann of the grindelwald tourism organization explained . " and then we thought we 'd make a new slope , with speed limits , and people will feel safer , " kaufmann said . speed patrols the new 30 km an hour slope has an electronic monitor to check the skiers ' speed , and patrols who pull them over if they break the limit .
the fast and the furious do n't get fined , but asked to move to a faster slope .
the idea has already found favor with holiday makers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enjoy the view - hopefully not through a hospital window " i think it 's excellent , " said a grindelwald skier .
" it 's quite intimidating when you 're coming down and you hear snowboarders especially rushing behind you .
you think , oh , which way are they going ?
so i 'm all in favor of it . " the speed limits are n't designed to spoil the fun : quite the opposite , they are there to ensure that every skier , regardless of their skill level , has fun while making sure everybody stays as safe as possible . so , if you 're heading to the alps this winter , and you 're not intentionally trying to break some part of your body , you should try to follow the advice your mother would give you : do n't ski too fast , do n't ski above your ability , and wear a helmet .
if you do that , and with just a bit of luck , your après ski will be spent , not in hospital , but outside - glass of mulled wine in hand - watching the sun set over the alps . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de strings and skis in bavaria 's living picture book nestled in the bavarian alps , this picturesque town was for years one of the best kept secrets among ski travellers .

" terrorism , the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , failing states - these are the scourges of our times , " german defense minister franz josef jung told the conference . " the old nato as a purely defensive alliance is history , " he added . us defense secretary donald rumsfeld thanked merkel for her " thoughtful and important remarks on nato " in his own conference speech devoted to islamic militancy . " the competences that exist within nato can be used to advantage in other parts of the world , " rumsfeld said . the us defense chief praised the alliance 's deployment in afghanistan after the fall of the taliban regime and in giving humanitarian assistance to pakistan after a massive earthquake last year . but nato 's potential was being held back by insufficient defense spending in members of the alliance , rumsfeld said . the united states was spending 3.7 percent of its gdp on defense but other nato members were spending far less , he said . " unless we invest in defense and security , the reality is that our homelands can be at risk . " french disagree and promote stronger eu forces bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of the european union 's growing military strength oppose the nato expansion ideas .
french defense minister michele alliot-marie took a more skeptical view on nato 's role and stressed the importance of the european union 's growing security capability , reflecting widespread concerns in france that a stronger nato would mean a weaker eu . " let 's take care ... not to spill into areas where the competence of other organizations is more suitable .
let 's not waste our financial means , which are vital for fighting crises and upgrading our equipment , " alliot-marie said . nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer , however , supported " pragmatic " cooperation between nato and the european union and sought to calm french fears . nato is no global cop says de hoop scheffer " nato is not a global policeman , " he said .
among the new global threats that nato could help combat , de hoop scheffer mentioned the protection of energy supply lines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer does not want the alliance to act as the world police .
" for reasons that are obvious - including the potential of terrorists targeting our energy supplies - it makes sense to me that the allies should discuss this issue , " he said . supplies of russian gas to ukraine and georgia have recently been disrupted . heads of state , government ministers , top defense officials and security experts gathered in a heavily-guarded five star hotel for the conference , entitled " restoring the transatlantic partnership .

now one swiss resort has come up with a novel way to try to ensure that guests leave the slopes as they arrived - in one piece . across europe 's alps , the winter ski season is in full swing .
thousands of holiday makers are already enjoying almost perfect snow conditions , while thousands more are packing their skis and getting ready to go . but at the hugely popular swiss resort of grindelwald , located 75 km -lrb- 50 miles -rrb- from the swiss capital bern , not everybody has the time to enjoy the scenery . " we have to be prepared to go out and get the injured , " said martin mathys of the grindelwald mountain rescue service . " with the speed , of course , we have a problem .
the equipment is always getting better , you can ski faster , and then you have also the head injuries , " he said . chasing the wind bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's a mad , mad world : where cows can fly and skiiers get pulled over with today 's modern carving skis , skiers can reach 80 kilometers an hour .
losing one 's balance at that speed , let alone crashing into somebody else , can really put a dramatic twist on an otherwise wonderful winter vacation . " speed is the big danger factor , but it 's not just speed , it 's also the way people ski , " said paul gunter , who is head of the emergency ward at the local hospital . " they make turns where they really do use the whole width of the slope , and that leads to collisions .
we 're seeing injuries now that are more like what you see in car accidents - head injuries , and back injuries , " gunter said . staying on the safe side bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hardcore skiing aficionados can even cause traffic jams the rising number of accidents is making some skiers stay away - even the keen ones .
that 's not a good development for a resort like grindelwald , which has attracted tourists since the 17th century .
so , local officials have come up with a novel solution to decrease the number of visitors leaving grindelwald overdosed on painkillers and wearing a cast . " we were asking people on the slopes , how do you feel , and a lot of people , especially families , said i just do n't feel safe because there are so many fast skiers around me , " benny kaufmann of the grindelwald tourism organization explained . " and then we thought we 'd make a new slope , with speed limits , and people will feel safer , " kaufmann said . speed patrols the new 30 km an hour slope has an electronic monitor to check the skiers ' speed , and patrols who pull them over if they break the limit .
the fast and the furious do n't get fined , but asked to move to a faster slope .
the idea has already found favor with holiday makers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enjoy the view - hopefully not through a hospital window " i think it 's excellent , " said a grindelwald skier .
" it 's quite intimidating when you 're coming down and you hear snowboarders especially rushing behind you .
you think , oh , which way are they going ?
so i 'm all in favor of it . " the speed limits are n't designed to spoil the fun : quite the opposite , they are there to ensure that every skier , regardless of their skill level , has fun while making sure everybody stays as safe as possible . so , if you 're heading to the alps this winter , and you 're not intentionally trying to break some part of your body , you should try to follow the advice your mother would give you : do n't ski too fast , do n't ski above your ability , and wear a helmet .
if you do that , and with just a bit of luck , your après ski will be spent , not in hospital , but outside - glass of mulled wine in hand - watching the sun set over the alps . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de strings and skis in bavaria 's living picture book nestled in the bavarian alps , this picturesque town was for years one of the best kept secrets among ski travellers .

" you can issue as many resolutions as you like and have fun with it , but you can not prevent iran 's progress , " said the hard-line president , who has steered his country on a collision course with the west since his shock election win last june . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad remains defiant .
" you know that you can not do anything .
the era of bullying is over , " he said of the west 's determination to prevent iran from acquiring nuclear fuel technology that can also be used to make the fissile core of a nuclear bomb . iranian fm says resolution removes possible of further diplomacy foreign minister manouchehr mottaki meanwhile confirmed iran had laid down the gauntlet with immediate retaliation .
" all voluntary measures taken over the past two-and-a-half or three years have been halted and we have no further commitment to the additional protocol and other voluntary commitments , " he told a news conference . " this resolution has no legal basis .
all it does is simply remove the opportunity for voluntary cooperation between iran and the agency . " the additional protocol to the non-proliferation treaty hands the iaea stronger inspection powers and is central to the un watchdog 's now three-year-old effort to determine what iran is actually up to . mottaki did not specify what other steps had already been taken , but iran 's voluntary measures had notably included a freeze on uranium enrichment . iran says it only wants to enrich uranium to make reactor fuel .
it prompted the latest crisis by resuming uranium conversion activities last august and enrichment research on january 10 . us president george w. bush , however , said the text " is not the end of diplomacy or the iaea 's role " and merely the " beginning of an intensified diplomatic effort . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president george w. bush says diplomacy is still alive but an atomic iran will not be allowed .
" this important step sends a clear message to the regime in iran that the world will not permit the iranian regime to gain nuclear weapons , " bush said . russia favored by iran as negotiator although iranian retaliation is set to worsen tensions , the islamic regime also signaled it was ready to press on with negotiations with russia - which now has a one month window to talk with tehran before the security council actually takes up the matter . moscow 's proposal is for enrichment to be carried out on russian soil in order to allay proliferation concerns whilst at the same time allowing iran to have nuclear fuel for civilian purposes . " the second round of talks will go ahead , but the russian proposal must be adapted to the new situation so that we can examine it , " foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi told reporters . the two sides are scheduled to meet in moscow on february 16 , with russia keen to reach a negotiated settlement and guard its economic interests - which include a one-billion dollar deal to build iran 's first reactor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian defence minister sergei ivanov hopes iran will consider his country 's proposals .
" i am sure that the iranian leadership will look with all seriousness at russia 's proposal , " russian defense minister sergei ivanov said .
" this suggestion is the best way out of the situation .

" let the hostages go immediately , " the chairman of the islamic council for germany , ali kizilkaya , wrote in the bild am sonntag newspaper . " it is regrettable that religion is being abused once again and all of islam is brought into disrepute .
our thoughts are with the families of the two hostages . " the deputy general secretary of the islamic group milli gorus , mustafa yeneroglu , said bräunlich and nitzschke , had gone to iraq to assist its people . " the fact that two people have been kidnapped who have helped iraq economically with their work demonstrates how absurd this act is , " he said . the president of the turkish-german muslim organization ditib , ridvan cakir , said the kidnapping marked a clear violation of the tenets of islam . " i call on the kidnappers to let the two germans go at once , " he said . and the chairman of the central council of muslims in germany , nadeem elyas , said that in light of berlin 's fierce opposition to the us-led iraq war in 2003 , the german engineers should be seen as innocent bystanders . " there is no logic in the world that could justify the kidnapping .
the german people are linked to the iraqi people in friendship - after all it was the german government that opposed the iraq war at the time , " he said in a statement . the fate of german engineers rene bräunlich and thomas nitzschke remained uncertain . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier meanwhile used al jazeera friday to issue a new appeal for the release of the two engineers . " german chancellor angela merkel and myself call upon you , on behalf of all germans , to release the two hostages without subjecting them to any pain , " steinmeier said . bräunlich and nitzschke , who work for german gas equipment installation company cryotec , were abducted near a key oil refinery in the northern town of baiji on january 24 by armed men in military uniform . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gate of baiji plant where iraqi insurgents kidnapped the two german engineers their kidnappers threatened on tuesday to kill them unless berlin cut all links with baghdad within 72 hours . president horst köhler said on friday he was " very concerned " by the kidnapping .
a foreign ministry spokesman described the situation as " extremely serious " . amid growing concern at home , he said germany was making all possible efforts to ensure the release of the two men but declined to " comment on or interpret the kidnappers ' ultimatum " . more detainee releases seen as leverage in hostage crisis iraq on sunday freed more than 50 male prisoners but held back female detainees as the fate of us and german hostages remained unknown amid a tight security clampdown for the main shiite festival .
the us military said it had released 50 male detainees , but later the iraqi government said 53 prisoners were freed .
" there was no female detainee release today , " the spokesman for the us detention facility in iraq told reporters .
" today 's release was done after a review by the joint board and at this stage i can not offer any other details . it is believed the us military release of the detainees was an attempt to gain some leverage in the kidnappings of bräunlich and nitzschke and us reporter jill carroll . last month , iraq released more than 400 detainees , including five women , in a move widely seen as a response to demands from the kidnappers of carroll for the freeing of all female prisoners in iraq . both us and iraqi spokesmen strongly denied any link at the time . shortly after those releases , a new videotape from the kidnappers was broadcast by al jazeera in which they broadened their demand to include all detainees , male or female . " the journalist called on her family , her colleagues and americans throughout the world to ask the us military authorities and the iraqi interior ministry to free all iraqi prisoners , saying this could contribute to her release , " the channel 's presenter said . us reporter still missing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emergency teams in and outside iraq are working to find and free the hostages .
carroll , who was working for the christian science monitor , was abducted in baghdad on january 7 by a group calling itself the brigades of vengeance as she traveled to a meeting with a leading sunni arab politician . " we have no new information on the hostage , " a us military spokesman said referring to carroll . the three hostages are among nearly 250 foreigners kidnapped in iraq since the march 2003 invasion .
many of them have been killed . the fate of two kenyan telecommunications engineers abducted last month and two iraqi television journalists seized wednesday also remained unknown . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de video shows german hostages alive a video of the two german engineers kidnapped in northern iraq was broadcast by al jazeera on friday .

" let the hostages go immediately , " the chairman of the islamic council for germany , ali kizilkaya , wrote in the bild am sonntag newspaper . " it is regrettable that religion is being abused once again and all of islam is brought into disrepute .
our thoughts are with the families of the two hostages . " the deputy general secretary of the islamic group milli gorus , mustafa yeneroglu , said bräunlich and nitzschke , had gone to iraq to assist its people . " the fact that two people have been kidnapped who have helped iraq economically with their work demonstrates how absurd this act is , " he said . the president of the turkish-german muslim organization ditib , ridvan cakir , said the kidnapping marked a clear violation of the tenets of islam . " i call on the kidnappers to let the two germans go at once , " he said . and the chairman of the central council of muslims in germany , nadeem elyas , said that in light of berlin 's fierce opposition to the us-led iraq war in 2003 , the german engineers should be seen as innocent bystanders . " there is no logic in the world that could justify the kidnapping .
the german people are linked to the iraqi people in friendship - after all it was the german government that opposed the iraq war at the time , " he said in a statement . the fate of german engineers rene bräunlich and thomas nitzschke remained uncertain . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier meanwhile used al jazeera friday to issue a new appeal for the release of the two engineers . " german chancellor angela merkel and myself call upon you , on behalf of all germans , to release the two hostages without subjecting them to any pain , " steinmeier said . bräunlich and nitzschke , who work for german gas equipment installation company cryotec , were abducted near a key oil refinery in the northern town of baiji on january 24 by armed men in military uniform . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gate of baiji plant where iraqi insurgents kidnapped the two german engineers their kidnappers threatened on tuesday to kill them unless berlin cut all links with baghdad within 72 hours . president horst köhler said on friday he was " very concerned " by the kidnapping .
a foreign ministry spokesman described the situation as " extremely serious " . amid growing concern at home , he said germany was making all possible efforts to ensure the release of the two men but declined to " comment on or interpret the kidnappers ' ultimatum " . more detainee releases seen as leverage in hostage crisis iraq on sunday freed more than 50 male prisoners but held back female detainees as the fate of us and german hostages remained unknown amid a tight security clampdown for the main shiite festival .
the us military said it had released 50 male detainees , but later the iraqi government said 53 prisoners were freed .
" there was no female detainee release today , " the spokesman for the us detention facility in iraq told reporters .
" today 's release was done after a review by the joint board and at this stage i can not offer any other details . it is believed the us military release of the detainees was an attempt to gain some leverage in the kidnappings of bräunlich and nitzschke and us reporter jill carroll . last month , iraq released more than 400 detainees , including five women , in a move widely seen as a response to demands from the kidnappers of carroll for the freeing of all female prisoners in iraq . both us and iraqi spokesmen strongly denied any link at the time . shortly after those releases , a new videotape from the kidnappers was broadcast by al jazeera in which they broadened their demand to include all detainees , male or female . " the journalist called on her family , her colleagues and americans throughout the world to ask the us military authorities and the iraqi interior ministry to free all iraqi prisoners , saying this could contribute to her release , " the channel 's presenter said . us reporter still missing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emergency teams in and outside iraq are working to find and free the hostages .
carroll , who was working for the christian science monitor , was abducted in baghdad on january 7 by a group calling itself the brigades of vengeance as she traveled to a meeting with a leading sunni arab politician . " we have no new information on the hostage , " a us military spokesman said referring to carroll . the three hostages are among nearly 250 foreigners kidnapped in iraq since the march 2003 invasion .
many of them have been killed . the fate of two kenyan telecommunications engineers abducted last month and two iraqi television journalists seized wednesday also remained unknown . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de video shows german hostages alive a video of the two german engineers kidnapped in northern iraq was broadcast by al jazeera on friday .

" all voluntary measures taken over the past two-and-a-half or three years have been halted and we have no further commitment to the additional protocol and other voluntary commitments , " he told a news conference . " this resolution has no legal basis .

" the second round of talks will go ahead , but the russian proposal must be adapted to the new situation so that we can examine it , " foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi told reporters . the two sides are scheduled to meet in moscow on february 16 , with russia keen to reach a negotiated settlement and guard its economic interests - which include a one-billion dollar deal to build iran 's first reactor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian defence minister sergei ivanov hopes iran will consider his country 's proposals .

" you can issue as many resolutions as you like and have fun with it , but you can not prevent iran 's progress , " said the hard-line president , who has steered his country on a collision course with the west since his shock election win last june . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad remains defiant .
" you know that you can not do anything .
the era of bullying is over , " he said of the west 's determination to prevent iran from acquiring nuclear fuel technology that can also be used to make the fissile core of a nuclear bomb . iranian fm says resolution removes possible of further diplomacy foreign minister manouchehr mottaki meanwhile confirmed iran had laid down the gauntlet with immediate retaliation .
" all voluntary measures taken over the past two-and-a-half or three years have been halted and we have no further commitment to the additional protocol and other voluntary commitments , " he told a news conference . " this resolution has no legal basis .
all it does is simply remove the opportunity for voluntary cooperation between iran and the agency .

" let the hostages go immediately , " the chairman of the islamic council for germany , ali kizilkaya , wrote in the bild am sonntag newspaper . " it is regrettable that religion is being abused once again and all of islam is brought into disrepute .
our thoughts are with the families of the two hostages . " the deputy general secretary of the islamic group milli gorus , mustafa yeneroglu , said bräunlich and nitzschke , had gone to iraq to assist its people . " the fact that two people have been kidnapped who have helped iraq economically with their work demonstrates how absurd this act is , " he said . the president of the turkish-german muslim organization ditib , ridvan cakir , said the kidnapping marked a clear violation of the tenets of islam . " i call on the kidnappers to let the two germans go at once , " he said . and the chairman of the central council of muslims in germany , nadeem elyas , said that in light of berlin 's fierce opposition to the us-led iraq war in 2003 , the german engineers should be seen as innocent bystanders .

the us military said it had released 50 male detainees , but later the iraqi government said 53 prisoners were freed .
" there was no female detainee release today , " the spokesman for the us detention facility in iraq told reporters .
" today 's release was done after a review by the joint board and at this stage i can not offer any other details . it is believed the us military release of the detainees was an attempt to gain some leverage in the kidnappings of bräunlich and nitzschke and us reporter jill carroll . last month , iraq released more than 400 detainees , including five women , in a move widely seen as a response to demands from the kidnappers of carroll for the freeing of all female prisoners in iraq . both us and iraqi spokesmen strongly denied any link at the time . shortly after those releases , a new videotape from the kidnappers was broadcast by al jazeera in which they broadened their demand to include all detainees , male or female .

" terrorism , the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , failing states - these are the scourges of our times , " german defense minister franz josef jung told the conference . " the old nato as a purely defensive alliance is history , " he added . us defense secretary donald rumsfeld thanked merkel for her " thoughtful and important remarks on nato " in his own conference speech devoted to islamic militancy . " the competences that exist within nato can be used to advantage in other parts of the world , " rumsfeld said . the us defense chief praised the alliance 's deployment in afghanistan after the fall of the taliban regime and in giving humanitarian assistance to pakistan after a massive earthquake last year . but nato 's potential was being held back by insufficient defense spending in members of the alliance , rumsfeld said . the united states was spending 3.7 percent of its gdp on defense but other nato members were spending far less , he said . " unless we invest in defense and security , the reality is that our homelands can be at risk . " french disagree and promote stronger eu forces bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of the european union 's growing military strength oppose the nato expansion ideas .
french defense minister michele alliot-marie took a more skeptical view on nato 's role and stressed the importance of the european union 's growing security capability , reflecting widespread concerns in france that a stronger nato would mean a weaker eu . " let 's take care ... not to spill into areas where the competence of other organizations is more suitable .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 05.02.2006 ski patrols curbing the fast and the furious großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everybody can get to the bottom of the slope in one piece skiing has become an increasingly dangerous sport .
now one swiss resort has come up with a novel way to try to ensure that guests leave the slopes as they arrived - in one piece . across europe 's alps , the winter ski season is in full swing .
thousands of holiday makers are already enjoying almost perfect snow conditions , while thousands more are packing their skis and getting ready to go . but at the hugely popular swiss resort of grindelwald , located 75 km -lrb- 50 miles -rrb- from the swiss capital bern , not everybody has the time to enjoy the scenery . " we have to be prepared to go out and get the injured , " said martin mathys of the grindelwald mountain rescue service . " with the speed , of course , we have a problem .
the equipment is always getting better , you can ski faster , and then you have also the head injuries , " he said . chasing the wind bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's a mad , mad world : where cows can fly and skiiers get pulled over with today 's modern carving skis , skiers can reach 80 kilometers an hour .
losing one 's balance at that speed , let alone crashing into somebody else , can really put a dramatic twist on an otherwise wonderful winter vacation . " speed is the big danger factor , but it 's not just speed , it 's also the way people ski , " said paul gunter , who is head of the emergency ward at the local hospital . " they make turns where they really do use the whole width of the slope , and that leads to collisions .
we 're seeing injuries now that are more like what you see in car accidents - head injuries , and back injuries , " gunter said . staying on the safe side bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hardcore skiing aficionados can even cause traffic jams the rising number of accidents is making some skiers stay away - even the keen ones .
that 's not a good development for a resort like grindelwald , which has attracted tourists since the 17th century .
so , local officials have come up with a novel solution to decrease the number of visitors leaving grindelwald overdosed on painkillers and wearing a cast . " we were asking people on the slopes , how do you feel , and a lot of people , especially families , said i just do n't feel safe because there are so many fast skiers around me , " benny kaufmann of the grindelwald tourism organization explained . " and then we thought we 'd make a new slope , with speed limits , and people will feel safer , " kaufmann said . speed patrols the new 30 km an hour slope has an electronic monitor to check the skiers ' speed , and patrols who pull them over if they break the limit .
the fast and the furious do n't get fined , but asked to move to a faster slope .
the idea has already found favor with holiday makers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enjoy the view - hopefully not through a hospital window " i think it 's excellent , " said a grindelwald skier .
" it 's quite intimidating when you 're coming down and you hear snowboarders especially rushing behind you .
you think , oh , which way are they going ?
so i 'm all in favor of it . " the speed limits are n't designed to spoil the fun : quite the opposite , they are there to ensure that every skier , regardless of their skill level , has fun while making sure everybody stays as safe as possible . so , if you 're heading to the alps this winter , and you 're not intentionally trying to break some part of your body , you should try to follow the advice your mother would give you : do n't ski too fast , do n't ski above your ability , and wear a helmet .
if you do that , and with just a bit of luck , your après ski will be spent , not in hospital , but outside - glass of mulled wine in hand - watching the sun set over the alps . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de strings and skis in bavaria 's living picture book nestled in the bavarian alps , this picturesque town was for years one of the best kept secrets among ski travellers .

" terrorism , the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , failing states - these are the scourges of our times , " german defense minister franz josef jung told the conference . " the old nato as a purely defensive alliance is history , " he added . us defense secretary donald rumsfeld thanked merkel for her " thoughtful and important remarks on nato " in his own conference speech devoted to islamic militancy . " the competences that exist within nato can be used to advantage in other parts of the world , " rumsfeld said . the us defense chief praised the alliance 's deployment in afghanistan after the fall of the taliban regime and in giving humanitarian assistance to pakistan after a massive earthquake last year . but nato 's potential was being held back by insufficient defense spending in members of the alliance , rumsfeld said . the united states was spending 3.7 percent of its gdp on defense but other nato members were spending far less , he said . " unless we invest in defense and security , the reality is that our homelands can be at risk . " french disagree and promote stronger eu forces bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of the european union 's growing military strength oppose the nato expansion ideas .
french defense minister michele alliot-marie took a more skeptical view on nato 's role and stressed the importance of the european union 's growing security capability , reflecting widespread concerns in france that a stronger nato would mean a weaker eu . " let 's take care ... not to spill into areas where the competence of other organizations is more suitable .
let 's not waste our financial means , which are vital for fighting crises and upgrading our equipment , " alliot-marie said . nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer , however , supported " pragmatic " cooperation between nato and the european union and sought to calm french fears . nato is no global cop says de hoop scheffer " nato is not a global policeman , " he said .
among the new global threats that nato could help combat , de hoop scheffer mentioned the protection of energy supply lines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer does not want the alliance to act as the world police .
" for reasons that are obvious - including the potential of terrorists targeting our energy supplies - it makes sense to me that the allies should discuss this issue , " he said . supplies of russian gas to ukraine and georgia have recently been disrupted . heads of state , government ministers , top defense officials and security experts gathered in a heavily-guarded five star hotel for the conference , entitled " restoring the transatlantic partnership .

" terrorism , the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , failing states - these are the scourges of our times , " german defense minister franz josef jung told the conference . " the old nato as a purely defensive alliance is history , " he added . us defense secretary donald rumsfeld thanked merkel for her " thoughtful and important remarks on nato " in his own conference speech devoted to islamic militancy . " the competences that exist within nato can be used to advantage in other parts of the world , " rumsfeld said . the us defense chief praised the alliance 's deployment in afghanistan after the fall of the taliban regime and in giving humanitarian assistance to pakistan after a massive earthquake last year . but nato 's potential was being held back by insufficient defense spending in members of the alliance , rumsfeld said . the united states was spending 3.7 percent of its gdp on defense but other nato members were spending far less , he said . " unless we invest in defense and security , the reality is that our homelands can be at risk . " french disagree and promote stronger eu forces bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of the european union 's growing military strength oppose the nato expansion ideas .
french defense minister michele alliot-marie took a more skeptical view on nato 's role and stressed the importance of the european union 's growing security capability , reflecting widespread concerns in france that a stronger nato would mean a weaker eu . " let 's take care ... not to spill into areas where the competence of other organizations is more suitable .
let 's not waste our financial means , which are vital for fighting crises and upgrading our equipment , " alliot-marie said . nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer , however , supported " pragmatic " cooperation between nato and the european union and sought to calm french fears . nato is no global cop says de hoop scheffer " nato is not a global policeman , " he said .
among the new global threats that nato could help combat , de hoop scheffer mentioned the protection of energy supply lines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer does not want the alliance to act as the world police .
" for reasons that are obvious - including the potential of terrorists targeting our energy supplies - it makes sense to me that the allies should discuss this issue , " he said . supplies of russian gas to ukraine and georgia have recently been disrupted . heads of state , government ministers , top defense officials and security experts gathered in a heavily-guarded five star hotel for the conference , entitled " restoring the transatlantic partnership .

" you can issue as many resolutions as you like and have fun with it , but you can not prevent iran 's progress , " said the hard-line president , who has steered his country on a collision course with the west since his shock election win last june . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad remains defiant .
" you know that you can not do anything .
the era of bullying is over , " he said of the west 's determination to prevent iran from acquiring nuclear fuel technology that can also be used to make the fissile core of a nuclear bomb . iranian fm says resolution removes possible of further diplomacy foreign minister manouchehr mottaki meanwhile confirmed iran had laid down the gauntlet with immediate retaliation .
" all voluntary measures taken over the past two-and-a-half or three years have been halted and we have no further commitment to the additional protocol and other voluntary commitments , " he told a news conference . " this resolution has no legal basis .
all it does is simply remove the opportunity for voluntary cooperation between iran and the agency . " the additional protocol to the non-proliferation treaty hands the iaea stronger inspection powers and is central to the un watchdog 's now three-year-old effort to determine what iran is actually up to . mottaki did not specify what other steps had already been taken , but iran 's voluntary measures had notably included a freeze on uranium enrichment . iran says it only wants to enrich uranium to make reactor fuel .
it prompted the latest crisis by resuming uranium conversion activities last august and enrichment research on january 10 . us president george w. bush , however , said the text " is not the end of diplomacy or the iaea 's role " and merely the " beginning of an intensified diplomatic effort . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president george w. bush says diplomacy is still alive but an atomic iran will not be allowed .
" this important step sends a clear message to the regime in iran that the world will not permit the iranian regime to gain nuclear weapons , " bush said . russia favored by iran as negotiator although iranian retaliation is set to worsen tensions , the islamic regime also signaled it was ready to press on with negotiations with russia - which now has a one month window to talk with tehran before the security council actually takes up the matter . moscow 's proposal is for enrichment to be carried out on russian soil in order to allay proliferation concerns whilst at the same time allowing iran to have nuclear fuel for civilian purposes . " the second round of talks will go ahead , but the russian proposal must be adapted to the new situation so that we can examine it , " foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi told reporters . the two sides are scheduled to meet in moscow on february 16 , with russia keen to reach a negotiated settlement and guard its economic interests - which include a one-billion dollar deal to build iran 's first reactor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian defence minister sergei ivanov hopes iran will consider his country 's proposals .
" i am sure that the iranian leadership will look with all seriousness at russia 's proposal , " russian defense minister sergei ivanov said .
" this suggestion is the best way out of the situation . " widespread international pressure for iran to comply iran is under massive pressure from elsewhere to comply with the iaea 's demands to return to a moratorium on fuel cycle work , show better cooperation with iaea inspectors and return to negotiations . in the iaea vote , 27 countries including the un security council 's permanent five - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - voted in favor and five abstained .
iran 's only support came from cuba , syria and venezuela . japan also said the resolution was " a clear message to iran " , and called on the tehran to " take this resolution seriously and respond to it sincerely . " " iran has still a crucial opportunity between now and the march iaea board to comply , " said british foreign secretary jack straw .
" otherwise , decisions by the security council are almost inevitable .

thousands of holiday makers are already enjoying almost perfect snow conditions , while thousands more are packing their skis and getting ready to go . but at the hugely popular swiss resort of grindelwald , located 75 km -lrb- 50 miles -rrb- from the swiss capital bern , not everybody has the time to enjoy the scenery . " we have to be prepared to go out and get the injured , " said martin mathys of the grindelwald mountain rescue service . " with the speed , of course , we have a problem .

" speed is the big danger factor , but it 's not just speed , it 's also the way people ski , " said paul gunter , who is head of the emergency ward at the local hospital .

" you can issue as many resolutions as you like and have fun with it , but you can not prevent iran 's progress , " said the hard-line president , who has steered his country on a collision course with the west since his shock election win last june . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad remains defiant .
" you know that you can not do anything .
the era of bullying is over , " he said of the west 's determination to prevent iran from acquiring nuclear fuel technology that can also be used to make the fissile core of a nuclear bomb . iranian fm says resolution removes possible of further diplomacy foreign minister manouchehr mottaki meanwhile confirmed iran had laid down the gauntlet with immediate retaliation .
" all voluntary measures taken over the past two-and-a-half or three years have been halted and we have no further commitment to the additional protocol and other voluntary commitments , " he told a news conference . " this resolution has no legal basis .
all it does is simply remove the opportunity for voluntary cooperation between iran and the agency . " the additional protocol to the non-proliferation treaty hands the iaea stronger inspection powers and is central to the un watchdog 's now three-year-old effort to determine what iran is actually up to . mottaki did not specify what other steps had already been taken , but iran 's voluntary measures had notably included a freeze on uranium enrichment . iran says it only wants to enrich uranium to make reactor fuel .
it prompted the latest crisis by resuming uranium conversion activities last august and enrichment research on january 10 . us president george w. bush , however , said the text " is not the end of diplomacy or the iaea 's role " and merely the " beginning of an intensified diplomatic effort . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president george w. bush says diplomacy is still alive but an atomic iran will not be allowed .
" this important step sends a clear message to the regime in iran that the world will not permit the iranian regime to gain nuclear weapons , " bush said . russia favored by iran as negotiator although iranian retaliation is set to worsen tensions , the islamic regime also signaled it was ready to press on with negotiations with russia - which now has a one month window to talk with tehran before the security council actually takes up the matter . moscow 's proposal is for enrichment to be carried out on russian soil in order to allay proliferation concerns whilst at the same time allowing iran to have nuclear fuel for civilian purposes . " the second round of talks will go ahead , but the russian proposal must be adapted to the new situation so that we can examine it , " foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi told reporters . the two sides are scheduled to meet in moscow on february 16 , with russia keen to reach a negotiated settlement and guard its economic interests - which include a one-billion dollar deal to build iran 's first reactor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian defence minister sergei ivanov hopes iran will consider his country 's proposals .
" i am sure that the iranian leadership will look with all seriousness at russia 's proposal , " russian defense minister sergei ivanov said .
" this suggestion is the best way out of the situation . " widespread international pressure for iran to comply iran is under massive pressure from elsewhere to comply with the iaea 's demands to return to a moratorium on fuel cycle work , show better cooperation with iaea inspectors and return to negotiations . in the iaea vote , 27 countries including the un security council 's permanent five - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - voted in favor and five abstained .
iran 's only support came from cuba , syria and venezuela . japan also said the resolution was " a clear message to iran " , and called on the tehran to " take this resolution seriously and respond to it sincerely . " " iran has still a crucial opportunity between now and the march iaea board to comply , " said british foreign secretary jack straw .
" otherwise , decisions by the security council are almost inevitable .

" you can issue as many resolutions as you like and have fun with it , but you can not prevent iran 's progress , " said the hard-line president , who has steered his country on a collision course with the west since his shock election win last june . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad remains defiant .
" you know that you can not do anything .
the era of bullying is over , " he said of the west 's determination to prevent iran from acquiring nuclear fuel technology that can also be used to make the fissile core of a nuclear bomb . iranian fm says resolution removes possible of further diplomacy foreign minister manouchehr mottaki meanwhile confirmed iran had laid down the gauntlet with immediate retaliation .
" all voluntary measures taken over the past two-and-a-half or three years have been halted and we have no further commitment to the additional protocol and other voluntary commitments , " he told a news conference . " this resolution has no legal basis .

now one swiss resort has come up with a novel way to try to ensure that guests leave the slopes as they arrived - in one piece . across europe 's alps , the winter ski season is in full swing .
thousands of holiday makers are already enjoying almost perfect snow conditions , while thousands more are packing their skis and getting ready to go . but at the hugely popular swiss resort of grindelwald , located 75 km -lrb- 50 miles -rrb- from the swiss capital bern , not everybody has the time to enjoy the scenery . " we have to be prepared to go out and get the injured , " said martin mathys of the grindelwald mountain rescue service . " with the speed , of course , we have a problem .
the equipment is always getting better , you can ski faster , and then you have also the head injuries , " he said . chasing the wind bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's a mad , mad world : where cows can fly and skiiers get pulled over with today 's modern carving skis , skiers can reach 80 kilometers an hour .
losing one 's balance at that speed , let alone crashing into somebody else , can really put a dramatic twist on an otherwise wonderful winter vacation . " speed is the big danger factor , but it 's not just speed , it 's also the way people ski , " said paul gunter , who is head of the emergency ward at the local hospital . " they make turns where they really do use the whole width of the slope , and that leads to collisions .

so , local officials have come up with a novel solution to decrease the number of visitors leaving grindelwald overdosed on painkillers and wearing a cast . " we were asking people on the slopes , how do you feel , and a lot of people , especially families , said i just do n't feel safe because there are so many fast skiers around me , " benny kaufmann of the grindelwald tourism organization explained . " and then we thought we 'd make a new slope , with speed limits , and people will feel safer , " kaufmann said . speed patrols the new 30 km an hour slope has an electronic monitor to check the skiers ' speed , and patrols who pull them over if they break the limit .
the fast and the furious do n't get fined , but asked to move to a faster slope .
the idea has already found favor with holiday makers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enjoy the view - hopefully not through a hospital window " i think it 's excellent , " said a grindelwald skier .
" it 's quite intimidating when you 're coming down and you hear snowboarders especially rushing behind you .
you think , oh , which way are they going ?
so i 'm all in favor of it . " the speed limits are n't designed to spoil the fun : quite the opposite , they are there to ensure that every skier , regardless of their skill level , has fun while making sure everybody stays as safe as possible . so , if you 're heading to the alps this winter , and you 're not intentionally trying to break some part of your body , you should try to follow the advice your mother would give you : do n't ski too fast , do n't ski above your ability , and wear a helmet .

but the background certainly will be . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the official poster for the first berlinale in 1951 the first berlinale , which opened with alfred hitchcock 's " rebecca , " took place against a bleak backdrop of a bombed-out german capital .
six years after the end of world war ii , large parts of the city still lay in ruins .
reconstruction had begun , but berlin was still far removed from the pulsating metropolis it once had been in the 1920s . still the berlinale did manage to inject some much-needed excitement and flamboyance into postwar berlin .
ever since american cult actress joan fontaine , who starred in " rebecca , " glided down the red carpet at the first berlinale , the film festival rapidly established itself in the 1950s as an international meeting point for the stars of world cinema . it was n't just hollywood , but also celebrities from other big cinema nations and studios in germany , such as sophia lauren , errol flynn , hans albers and hildegard knef , who graced the berlinale .
the film festival became a byword for glamour and fashion . artsy and intellectual in the 1960s , it was n't just divas and hollywood celebrities making the headlines at the berlinale . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french director jean-luc godard the film festival transformed itself into a hub for artsy and intelligent cinema with directors like jean-luc godard and francois truffaut presenting their works in berlin . in the politically-laden 1970s , the reverberations of the 1968 student revolts and the vietnam war made an impact on the berlinale too .
the festival witnessed angry protests against the us-critical film " o.k. " by german director michael verhoeven . following a few more turbulent years , the berlin film festival underwent a further change with the emergence of the " forum " section in addition to its mainstay , " competion " category which ends in the ceremonial awarding of the golden and silver bears . the " forum " section provided a showcase in particular for documentary and experimental films .
it also offered a platform for films from countries , which until then had never been in the spotlight of international cinema . for ulrich gregor , longtime former head of the section , the new developments finally completed the berlinale 's claim to be a showcase for international cinema by including all forms and genres . " it included the whole spectrum - right from hollywood films to independent ones from various countries , europe and also non-european nations right to documentaries and other experimental forms , " gregor said . boost for german films bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the coveted golden and silver bears however , the " competition " category has remained the centerpiece of the berlinale with hits such as " la notte " by michelangelo antonioni or " hong gaoliang " by zhang yimou being premiered here .
it 's this section that has also traditionally drawn the stars , given the prestige attached to winning the golden and silver bears . current berlinale director dieter kosslick has ensured that the section continues to take center stage at the festival . " what we do is also cultivate a so-called connections business , where you really have to know a lot of people and where you have to understand them , " kosslick said .
" you have to speak their language and i think you have to have a certain passion for that . " part of kosslick 's passion in the past years has also been the focus on homegrown cinema - something that was ignored by his predecessor moritz de hadeln for a long time . for a few years now , german films have been and have been prominently visible in several categories at the berlinale . heinz badewitz , head of the " perspective german cinema " section , says the international movers and shakers in the movie business also come to germany to watch and potentially buy homegrown entries . " our target group includes international buyers and festival directors from the whole world who come here to see the latest in german film in a compact manner , " badewitz said . asian cinema in the spotlight another relatively new development at the berlinale in the past decade has been the increasing presence of films from asian countries .
movies from china , taiwan , korea and vietnam have celebrated huge successes at the film festival in recent years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from taiwanese film " the wayward cloud " by tsai ming liang moritz de hadeln , the previous berlinale director , who also encouraged asian cinema during his term , says political films in particular find a deep resonance in berlin , which was long politically and physically divided itself . " asian filmmakers have something exciting to offer at the moment .
one of the new things is a contemporary korean film , it 's about relations between north and south korea , " de hadeln said .
" it 's a film that would not have been made two or three years ago in korea . " a political festival at heart indeed , the berlinale has long been a political festival . in the 1970s and 80s in particular , it was a platform for eastern european filmmakers .
many films from the soviet union or from east germany , which were controversial at home , celebrated their international premieres at the berlinale . and , last year the film festival embraced another continent , which had never before been among the victors - the film " carmen khayelitsha " by south african mark dornford-may picked up the coveted golden bear . jochen kürten -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlinale strikes a serious note the berlin international film festival , which opens on feb .

" let the hostages go immediately , " the chairman of the islamic council for germany , ali kizilkaya , wrote in the bild am sonntag newspaper . " it is regrettable that religion is being abused once again and all of islam is brought into disrepute .
our thoughts are with the families of the two hostages . " the deputy general secretary of the islamic group milli gorus , mustafa yeneroglu , said bräunlich and nitzschke , had gone to iraq to assist its people . " the fact that two people have been kidnapped who have helped iraq economically with their work demonstrates how absurd this act is , " he said . the president of the turkish-german muslim organization ditib , ridvan cakir , said the kidnapping marked a clear violation of the tenets of islam . " i call on the kidnappers to let the two germans go at once , " he said . and the chairman of the central council of muslims in germany , nadeem elyas , said that in light of berlin 's fierce opposition to the us-led iraq war in 2003 , the german engineers should be seen as innocent bystanders . " there is no logic in the world that could justify the kidnapping .
the german people are linked to the iraqi people in friendship - after all it was the german government that opposed the iraq war at the time , " he said in a statement . the fate of german engineers rene bräunlich and thomas nitzschke remained uncertain . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier meanwhile used al jazeera friday to issue a new appeal for the release of the two engineers . " german chancellor angela merkel and myself call upon you , on behalf of all germans , to release the two hostages without subjecting them to any pain , " steinmeier said . bräunlich and nitzschke , who work for german gas equipment installation company cryotec , were abducted near a key oil refinery in the northern town of baiji on january 24 by armed men in military uniform . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gate of baiji plant where iraqi insurgents kidnapped the two german engineers their kidnappers threatened on tuesday to kill them unless berlin cut all links with baghdad within 72 hours . president horst köhler said on friday he was " very concerned " by the kidnapping .
a foreign ministry spokesman described the situation as " extremely serious " . amid growing concern at home , he said germany was making all possible efforts to ensure the release of the two men but declined to " comment on or interpret the kidnappers ' ultimatum " . more detainee releases seen as leverage in hostage crisis iraq on sunday freed more than 50 male prisoners but held back female detainees as the fate of us and german hostages remained unknown amid a tight security clampdown for the main shiite festival .
the us military said it had released 50 male detainees , but later the iraqi government said 53 prisoners were freed .
" there was no female detainee release today , " the spokesman for the us detention facility in iraq told reporters .
" today 's release was done after a review by the joint board and at this stage i can not offer any other details . it is believed the us military release of the detainees was an attempt to gain some leverage in the kidnappings of bräunlich and nitzschke and us reporter jill carroll . last month , iraq released more than 400 detainees , including five women , in a move widely seen as a response to demands from the kidnappers of carroll for the freeing of all female prisoners in iraq . both us and iraqi spokesmen strongly denied any link at the time . shortly after those releases , a new videotape from the kidnappers was broadcast by al jazeera in which they broadened their demand to include all detainees , male or female .

" you can issue as many resolutions as you like and have fun with it , but you can not prevent iran 's progress , " said the hard-line president , who has steered his country on a collision course with the west since his shock election win last june . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad remains defiant .
" you know that you can not do anything .
the era of bullying is over , " he said of the west 's determination to prevent iran from acquiring nuclear fuel technology that can also be used to make the fissile core of a nuclear bomb . iranian fm says resolution removes possible of further diplomacy foreign minister manouchehr mottaki meanwhile confirmed iran had laid down the gauntlet with immediate retaliation .
" all voluntary measures taken over the past two-and-a-half or three years have been halted and we have no further commitment to the additional protocol and other voluntary commitments , " he told a news conference . " this resolution has no legal basis .
all it does is simply remove the opportunity for voluntary cooperation between iran and the agency . " the additional protocol to the non-proliferation treaty hands the iaea stronger inspection powers and is central to the un watchdog 's now three-year-old effort to determine what iran is actually up to . mottaki did not specify what other steps had already been taken , but iran 's voluntary measures had notably included a freeze on uranium enrichment . iran says it only wants to enrich uranium to make reactor fuel .
it prompted the latest crisis by resuming uranium conversion activities last august and enrichment research on january 10 . us president george w. bush , however , said the text " is not the end of diplomacy or the iaea 's role " and merely the " beginning of an intensified diplomatic effort . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president george w. bush says diplomacy is still alive but an atomic iran will not be allowed .
" this important step sends a clear message to the regime in iran that the world will not permit the iranian regime to gain nuclear weapons , " bush said . russia favored by iran as negotiator although iranian retaliation is set to worsen tensions , the islamic regime also signaled it was ready to press on with negotiations with russia - which now has a one month window to talk with tehran before the security council actually takes up the matter . moscow 's proposal is for enrichment to be carried out on russian soil in order to allay proliferation concerns whilst at the same time allowing iran to have nuclear fuel for civilian purposes . " the second round of talks will go ahead , but the russian proposal must be adapted to the new situation so that we can examine it , " foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi told reporters . the two sides are scheduled to meet in moscow on february 16 , with russia keen to reach a negotiated settlement and guard its economic interests - which include a one-billion dollar deal to build iran 's first reactor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian defence minister sergei ivanov hopes iran will consider his country 's proposals .
" i am sure that the iranian leadership will look with all seriousness at russia 's proposal , " russian defense minister sergei ivanov said .
" this suggestion is the best way out of the situation . " widespread international pressure for iran to comply iran is under massive pressure from elsewhere to comply with the iaea 's demands to return to a moratorium on fuel cycle work , show better cooperation with iaea inspectors and return to negotiations . in the iaea vote , 27 countries including the un security council 's permanent five - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - voted in favor and five abstained .
iran 's only support came from cuba , syria and venezuela . japan also said the resolution was " a clear message to iran " , and called on the tehran to " take this resolution seriously and respond to it sincerely . " " iran has still a crucial opportunity between now and the march iaea board to comply , " said british foreign secretary jack straw .
" otherwise , decisions by the security council are almost inevitable .

9 , deutsche welle takes a look back at the turbulent and glamour-filled history of the festival and its founding amid a war-ravaged germany . when the 56th edition of the berlinale gets underway on feb .
9 , stars , journalists , paparazzi and film producers will throng the glitzy potsdamer platz in downtown berlin , where most of the action takes place . the buzz and hoopla wo n't be that different from the first berlinale , which took place on june 6 , 1951 .
but the background certainly will be . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the official poster for the first berlinale in 1951 the first berlinale , which opened with alfred hitchcock 's " rebecca , " took place against a bleak backdrop of a bombed-out german capital .
six years after the end of world war ii , large parts of the city still lay in ruins .
reconstruction had begun , but berlin was still far removed from the pulsating metropolis it once had been in the 1920s . still the berlinale did manage to inject some much-needed excitement and flamboyance into postwar berlin .
ever since american cult actress joan fontaine , who starred in " rebecca , " glided down the red carpet at the first berlinale , the film festival rapidly established itself in the 1950s as an international meeting point for the stars of world cinema . it was n't just hollywood , but also celebrities from other big cinema nations and studios in germany , such as sophia lauren , errol flynn , hans albers and hildegard knef , who graced the berlinale .
the film festival became a byword for glamour and fashion . artsy and intellectual in the 1960s , it was n't just divas and hollywood celebrities making the headlines at the berlinale . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french director jean-luc godard the film festival transformed itself into a hub for artsy and intelligent cinema with directors like jean-luc godard and francois truffaut presenting their works in berlin . in the politically-laden 1970s , the reverberations of the 1968 student revolts and the vietnam war made an impact on the berlinale too .
the festival witnessed angry protests against the us-critical film " o.k. " by german director michael verhoeven . following a few more turbulent years , the berlin film festival underwent a further change with the emergence of the " forum " section in addition to its mainstay , " competion " category which ends in the ceremonial awarding of the golden and silver bears . the " forum " section provided a showcase in particular for documentary and experimental films .
it also offered a platform for films from countries , which until then had never been in the spotlight of international cinema . for ulrich gregor , longtime former head of the section , the new developments finally completed the berlinale 's claim to be a showcase for international cinema by including all forms and genres . " it included the whole spectrum - right from hollywood films to independent ones from various countries , europe and also non-european nations right to documentaries and other experimental forms , " gregor said . boost for german films bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the coveted golden and silver bears however , the " competition " category has remained the centerpiece of the berlinale with hits such as " la notte " by michelangelo antonioni or " hong gaoliang " by zhang yimou being premiered here .
it 's this section that has also traditionally drawn the stars , given the prestige attached to winning the golden and silver bears . current berlinale director dieter kosslick has ensured that the section continues to take center stage at the festival . " what we do is also cultivate a so-called connections business , where you really have to know a lot of people and where you have to understand them , " kosslick said .
" you have to speak their language and i think you have to have a certain passion for that . " part of kosslick 's passion in the past years has also been the focus on homegrown cinema - something that was ignored by his predecessor moritz de hadeln for a long time . for a few years now , german films have been and have been prominently visible in several categories at the berlinale . heinz badewitz , head of the " perspective german cinema " section , says the international movers and shakers in the movie business also come to germany to watch and potentially buy homegrown entries . " our target group includes international buyers and festival directors from the whole world who come here to see the latest in german film in a compact manner , " badewitz said . asian cinema in the spotlight another relatively new development at the berlinale in the past decade has been the increasing presence of films from asian countries .
movies from china , taiwan , korea and vietnam have celebrated huge successes at the film festival in recent years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from taiwanese film " the wayward cloud " by tsai ming liang moritz de hadeln , the previous berlinale director , who also encouraged asian cinema during his term , says political films in particular find a deep resonance in berlin , which was long politically and physically divided itself . " asian filmmakers have something exciting to offer at the moment .
one of the new things is a contemporary korean film , it 's about relations between north and south korea , " de hadeln said .
" it 's a film that would not have been made two or three years ago in korea . " a political festival at heart indeed , the berlinale has long been a political festival . in the 1970s and 80s in particular , it was a platform for eastern european filmmakers .
many films from the soviet union or from east germany , which were controversial at home , celebrated their international premieres at the berlinale . and , last year the film festival embraced another continent , which had never before been among the victors - the film " carmen khayelitsha " by south african mark dornford-may picked up the coveted golden bear . jochen kürten -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlinale strikes a serious note the berlin international film festival , which opens on feb .

" " we want to prevent and we must prevent iran from developing nuclear weapons , " merkel said in her speech .
" the concerns and fears over iran 's nuclear program are legitimate . " the un 's nuclear watchdog , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , voted on saturday to report iran to the un security council , paving the way to possible sanctions over its atomic program . iran retaliated by saying it would begin full-scale uranium enrichment and limit inspections by iaea officials . merkel said iran still had a chance to avoid the sanctions by accepting a russian proposal to allow iranian uranium enrichment to take place in russia , which would prevent tehran from mastering sensitive nuclear technology . she called on iran to consider the compromise as a " window of opportunity . " merkel alludes to nazi rise in speech on iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad said israel should be moved to europe and questioned whether the holocaust took place .
the german leader had strong words for iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who has called for israel to be " wiped off the map " and has branded the holocaust a " myth . " " a president who denies the existence of israel and the holocaust can not expect to receive any tolerance from germany , " merkel said . she compared ahmadinejad 's statements to when adolf hitler came to power and began threatening to exterminate european jews .
" remember that in 1933 many people said it was just rhetoric , " merkel said . the international community " must fight these beginnings now , " she said . rumsfeld tell conference iran is a global threat rumsfeld told the 300 high-level delegates at the conference that iran was a genuine threat to global peace .
" the iranian regime is today the world 's leading state sponsor of terrorism , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests have turned increasingly violent over the past few days .
" the world does not want , and must work together to prevent , a nuclear iran , " he added , urging the global powers to unite and find a diplomatic solution to halt iran 's nuclear program . in tehran , rumsfeld 's iranian counterpart mostafa mohammad najjar said in response that the leaders of the united states were " terrorists " who represented the " real axis of evil . " iran insists it is developing a peaceful atomic energy program , but the western world suspects it is planning to build nuclear weapons . responding to merkel 's speech and speaking before the iaea decision , iran 's deputy foreign minister for legal and international affairs , abbas araghchi , said that referral to the security council would not lead the islamic republic to halt its nuclear activities . araghchi blames europe for failure of diplomacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abbas araghchi blamed the eu-3 for the collapse of talks .
" if the case is sent or even reported to the un security council , based on the law of our parliament , our government has no way of stopping nuclear activities , " araghchi said during merkel 's question and answer session . he blamed the three eu nations - britain , france and germany - which have negotiated with tehran over its nuclear ambitions , for creating the conflict . " we did whatever we could .
but as you know after three years of negotiations we left empty-handed , " araghchi said . merkel brushed off his statement , saying that iran " should consider amending its laws " and adding that she would have liked to hear him comment on his president 's denial of israel 's existence .
" that was missing , " merkel said . the three-day munich conference concludes on sunday when russia 's influential defense minister sergei ivanov will be the main speaker . more than 1,700 people demonstrated in central munich against the conference , police said . the protest , organized by left-wing and pacifist groups , featured placards demanding : " we want disarmament , not job losses " and " stop the warmongers .

" " we want to prevent and we must prevent iran from developing nuclear weapons , " merkel said in her speech .
" the concerns and fears over iran 's nuclear program are legitimate . " the un 's nuclear watchdog , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , voted on saturday to report iran to the un security council , paving the way to possible sanctions over its atomic program . iran retaliated by saying it would begin full-scale uranium enrichment and limit inspections by iaea officials . merkel said iran still had a chance to avoid the sanctions by accepting a russian proposal to allow iranian uranium enrichment to take place in russia , which would prevent tehran from mastering sensitive nuclear technology . she called on iran to consider the compromise as a " window of opportunity .

" if the case is sent or even reported to the un security council , based on the law of our parliament , our government has no way of stopping nuclear activities , " araghchi said during merkel 's question and answer session . he blamed the three eu nations - britain , france and germany - which have negotiated with tehran over its nuclear ambitions , for creating the conflict . " we did whatever we could .

" " a president who denies the existence of israel and the holocaust can not expect to receive any tolerance from germany , " merkel said . she compared ahmadinejad 's statements to when adolf hitler came to power and began threatening to exterminate european jews .
" remember that in 1933 many people said it was just rhetoric , " merkel said . the international community " must fight these beginnings now , " she said . rumsfeld tell conference iran is a global threat rumsfeld told the 300 high-level delegates at the conference that iran was a genuine threat to global peace .

" we did whatever we could .
but as you know after three years of negotiations we left empty-handed , " araghchi said . merkel brushed off his statement , saying that iran " should consider amending its laws " and adding that she would have liked to hear him comment on his president 's denial of israel 's existence .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : spotlight on the berlinale berlinale film lineup includes four german entries " love never goes out of fashion " berlinale strikes a serious note german favorite at berlinale disappoints culture & lifestyle -pipe- 05.02.2006 tracking the golden bear großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bear of the year as the 56th berlinale opens its doors on feb .
9 , deutsche welle takes a look back at the turbulent and glamour-filled history of the festival and its founding amid a war-ravaged germany . when the 56th edition of the berlinale gets underway on feb .
9 , stars , journalists , paparazzi and film producers will throng the glitzy potsdamer platz in downtown berlin , where most of the action takes place . the buzz and hoopla wo n't be that different from the first berlinale , which took place on june 6 , 1951 .
but the background certainly will be . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the official poster for the first berlinale in 1951 the first berlinale , which opened with alfred hitchcock 's " rebecca , " took place against a bleak backdrop of a bombed-out german capital .
six years after the end of world war ii , large parts of the city still lay in ruins .
reconstruction had begun , but berlin was still far removed from the pulsating metropolis it once had been in the 1920s . still the berlinale did manage to inject some much-needed excitement and flamboyance into postwar berlin .
ever since american cult actress joan fontaine , who starred in " rebecca , " glided down the red carpet at the first berlinale , the film festival rapidly established itself in the 1950s as an international meeting point for the stars of world cinema . it was n't just hollywood , but also celebrities from other big cinema nations and studios in germany , such as sophia lauren , errol flynn , hans albers and hildegard knef , who graced the berlinale .
the film festival became a byword for glamour and fashion . artsy and intellectual in the 1960s , it was n't just divas and hollywood celebrities making the headlines at the berlinale . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french director jean-luc godard the film festival transformed itself into a hub for artsy and intelligent cinema with directors like jean-luc godard and francois truffaut presenting their works in berlin . in the politically-laden 1970s , the reverberations of the 1968 student revolts and the vietnam war made an impact on the berlinale too .
the festival witnessed angry protests against the us-critical film " o.k. " by german director michael verhoeven . following a few more turbulent years , the berlin film festival underwent a further change with the emergence of the " forum " section in addition to its mainstay , " competion " category which ends in the ceremonial awarding of the golden and silver bears . the " forum " section provided a showcase in particular for documentary and experimental films .
it also offered a platform for films from countries , which until then had never been in the spotlight of international cinema . for ulrich gregor , longtime former head of the section , the new developments finally completed the berlinale 's claim to be a showcase for international cinema by including all forms and genres . " it included the whole spectrum - right from hollywood films to independent ones from various countries , europe and also non-european nations right to documentaries and other experimental forms , " gregor said . boost for german films bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the coveted golden and silver bears however , the " competition " category has remained the centerpiece of the berlinale with hits such as " la notte " by michelangelo antonioni or " hong gaoliang " by zhang yimou being premiered here .
it 's this section that has also traditionally drawn the stars , given the prestige attached to winning the golden and silver bears . current berlinale director dieter kosslick has ensured that the section continues to take center stage at the festival . " what we do is also cultivate a so-called connections business , where you really have to know a lot of people and where you have to understand them , " kosslick said .
" you have to speak their language and i think you have to have a certain passion for that . " part of kosslick 's passion in the past years has also been the focus on homegrown cinema - something that was ignored by his predecessor moritz de hadeln for a long time . for a few years now , german films have been and have been prominently visible in several categories at the berlinale . heinz badewitz , head of the " perspective german cinema " section , says the international movers and shakers in the movie business also come to germany to watch and potentially buy homegrown entries . " our target group includes international buyers and festival directors from the whole world who come here to see the latest in german film in a compact manner , " badewitz said . asian cinema in the spotlight another relatively new development at the berlinale in the past decade has been the increasing presence of films from asian countries .
movies from china , taiwan , korea and vietnam have celebrated huge successes at the film festival in recent years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from taiwanese film " the wayward cloud " by tsai ming liang moritz de hadeln , the previous berlinale director , who also encouraged asian cinema during his term , says political films in particular find a deep resonance in berlin , which was long politically and physically divided itself . " asian filmmakers have something exciting to offer at the moment .
one of the new things is a contemporary korean film , it 's about relations between north and south korea , " de hadeln said .
" it 's a film that would not have been made two or three years ago in korea . " a political festival at heart indeed , the berlinale has long been a political festival . in the 1970s and 80s in particular , it was a platform for eastern european filmmakers .
many films from the soviet union or from east germany , which were controversial at home , celebrated their international premieres at the berlinale . and , last year the film festival embraced another continent , which had never before been among the victors - the film " carmen khayelitsha " by south african mark dornford-may picked up the coveted golden bear . jochen kürten -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlinale strikes a serious note the berlin international film festival , which opens on feb .

" " we want to prevent and we must prevent iran from developing nuclear weapons , " merkel said in her speech .
" the concerns and fears over iran 's nuclear program are legitimate . " the un 's nuclear watchdog , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , voted on saturday to report iran to the un security council , paving the way to possible sanctions over its atomic program . iran retaliated by saying it would begin full-scale uranium enrichment and limit inspections by iaea officials . merkel said iran still had a chance to avoid the sanctions by accepting a russian proposal to allow iranian uranium enrichment to take place in russia , which would prevent tehran from mastering sensitive nuclear technology . she called on iran to consider the compromise as a " window of opportunity . " merkel alludes to nazi rise in speech on iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad said israel should be moved to europe and questioned whether the holocaust took place .
the german leader had strong words for iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who has called for israel to be " wiped off the map " and has branded the holocaust a " myth . " " a president who denies the existence of israel and the holocaust can not expect to receive any tolerance from germany , " merkel said . she compared ahmadinejad 's statements to when adolf hitler came to power and began threatening to exterminate european jews .
" remember that in 1933 many people said it was just rhetoric , " merkel said . the international community " must fight these beginnings now , " she said . rumsfeld tell conference iran is a global threat rumsfeld told the 300 high-level delegates at the conference that iran was a genuine threat to global peace .
" the iranian regime is today the world 's leading state sponsor of terrorism , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests have turned increasingly violent over the past few days .
" the world does not want , and must work together to prevent , a nuclear iran , " he added , urging the global powers to unite and find a diplomatic solution to halt iran 's nuclear program . in tehran , rumsfeld 's iranian counterpart mostafa mohammad najjar said in response that the leaders of the united states were " terrorists " who represented the " real axis of evil . " iran insists it is developing a peaceful atomic energy program , but the western world suspects it is planning to build nuclear weapons . responding to merkel 's speech and speaking before the iaea decision , iran 's deputy foreign minister for legal and international affairs , abbas araghchi , said that referral to the security council would not lead the islamic republic to halt its nuclear activities . araghchi blames europe for failure of diplomacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abbas araghchi blamed the eu-3 for the collapse of talks .
" if the case is sent or even reported to the un security council , based on the law of our parliament , our government has no way of stopping nuclear activities , " araghchi said during merkel 's question and answer session . he blamed the three eu nations - britain , france and germany - which have negotiated with tehran over its nuclear ambitions , for creating the conflict . " we did whatever we could .
but as you know after three years of negotiations we left empty-handed , " araghchi said . merkel brushed off his statement , saying that iran " should consider amending its laws " and adding that she would have liked to hear him comment on his president 's denial of israel 's existence .
" that was missing , " merkel said . the three-day munich conference concludes on sunday when russia 's influential defense minister sergei ivanov will be the main speaker . more than 1,700 people demonstrated in central munich against the conference , police said . the protest , organized by left-wing and pacifist groups , featured placards demanding : " we want disarmament , not job losses " and " stop the warmongers .

" it is regrettable that religion is being abused once again and all of islam is brought into disrepute .
our thoughts are with the families of the two hostages . " the deputy general secretary of the islamic group milli gorus , mustafa yeneroglu , said bräunlich and nitzschke , had gone to iraq to assist its people . " the fact that two people have been kidnapped who have helped iraq economically with their work demonstrates how absurd this act is , " he said . the president of the turkish-german muslim organization ditib , ridvan cakir , said the kidnapping marked a clear violation of the tenets of islam . " i call on the kidnappers to let the two germans go at once , " he said . and the chairman of the central council of muslims in germany , nadeem elyas , said that in light of berlin 's fierce opposition to the us-led iraq war in 2003 , the german engineers should be seen as innocent bystanders .

" there was no female detainee release today , " the spokesman for the us detention facility in iraq told reporters .
" today 's release was done after a review by the joint board and at this stage i can not offer any other details . it is believed the us military release of the detainees was an attempt to gain some leverage in the kidnappings of bräunlich and nitzschke and us reporter jill carroll . last month , iraq released more than 400 detainees , including five women , in a move widely seen as a response to demands from the kidnappers of carroll for the freeing of all female prisoners in iraq . both us and iraqi spokesmen strongly denied any link at the time . shortly after those releases , a new videotape from the kidnappers was broadcast by al jazeera in which they broadened their demand to include all detainees , male or female .

" you can issue as many resolutions as you like and have fun with it , but you can not prevent iran 's progress , " said the hard-line president , who has steered his country on a collision course with the west since his shock election win last june . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad remains defiant .
" you know that you can not do anything .
the era of bullying is over , " he said of the west 's determination to prevent iran from acquiring nuclear fuel technology that can also be used to make the fissile core of a nuclear bomb . iranian fm says resolution removes possible of further diplomacy foreign minister manouchehr mottaki meanwhile confirmed iran had laid down the gauntlet with immediate retaliation .
" all voluntary measures taken over the past two-and-a-half or three years have been halted and we have no further commitment to the additional protocol and other voluntary commitments , " he told a news conference . " this resolution has no legal basis .
all it does is simply remove the opportunity for voluntary cooperation between iran and the agency . " the additional protocol to the non-proliferation treaty hands the iaea stronger inspection powers and is central to the un watchdog 's now three-year-old effort to determine what iran is actually up to . mottaki did not specify what other steps had already been taken , but iran 's voluntary measures had notably included a freeze on uranium enrichment . iran says it only wants to enrich uranium to make reactor fuel .
it prompted the latest crisis by resuming uranium conversion activities last august and enrichment research on january 10 . us president george w. bush , however , said the text " is not the end of diplomacy or the iaea 's role " and merely the " beginning of an intensified diplomatic effort . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president george w. bush says diplomacy is still alive but an atomic iran will not be allowed .
" this important step sends a clear message to the regime in iran that the world will not permit the iranian regime to gain nuclear weapons , " bush said . russia favored by iran as negotiator although iranian retaliation is set to worsen tensions , the islamic regime also signaled it was ready to press on with negotiations with russia - which now has a one month window to talk with tehran before the security council actually takes up the matter . moscow 's proposal is for enrichment to be carried out on russian soil in order to allay proliferation concerns whilst at the same time allowing iran to have nuclear fuel for civilian purposes . " the second round of talks will go ahead , but the russian proposal must be adapted to the new situation so that we can examine it , " foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi told reporters . the two sides are scheduled to meet in moscow on february 16 , with russia keen to reach a negotiated settlement and guard its economic interests - which include a one-billion dollar deal to build iran 's first reactor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian defence minister sergei ivanov hopes iran will consider his country 's proposals .
" i am sure that the iranian leadership will look with all seriousness at russia 's proposal , " russian defense minister sergei ivanov said .
" this suggestion is the best way out of the situation . " widespread international pressure for iran to comply iran is under massive pressure from elsewhere to comply with the iaea 's demands to return to a moratorium on fuel cycle work , show better cooperation with iaea inspectors and return to negotiations . in the iaea vote , 27 countries including the un security council 's permanent five - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - voted in favor and five abstained .
iran 's only support came from cuba , syria and venezuela . japan also said the resolution was " a clear message to iran " , and called on the tehran to " take this resolution seriously and respond to it sincerely . " " iran has still a crucial opportunity between now and the march iaea board to comply , " said british foreign secretary jack straw .
" otherwise , decisions by the security council are almost inevitable .

" let the hostages go immediately , " the chairman of the islamic council for germany , ali kizilkaya , wrote in the bild am sonntag newspaper . " it is regrettable that religion is being abused once again and all of islam is brought into disrepute .
our thoughts are with the families of the two hostages . " the deputy general secretary of the islamic group milli gorus , mustafa yeneroglu , said bräunlich and nitzschke , had gone to iraq to assist its people . " the fact that two people have been kidnapped who have helped iraq economically with their work demonstrates how absurd this act is , " he said . the president of the turkish-german muslim organization ditib , ridvan cakir , said the kidnapping marked a clear violation of the tenets of islam . " i call on the kidnappers to let the two germans go at once , " he said . and the chairman of the central council of muslims in germany , nadeem elyas , said that in light of berlin 's fierce opposition to the us-led iraq war in 2003 , the german engineers should be seen as innocent bystanders . " there is no logic in the world that could justify the kidnapping .
the german people are linked to the iraqi people in friendship - after all it was the german government that opposed the iraq war at the time , " he said in a statement . the fate of german engineers rene bräunlich and thomas nitzschke remained uncertain . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier meanwhile used al jazeera friday to issue a new appeal for the release of the two engineers . " german chancellor angela merkel and myself call upon you , on behalf of all germans , to release the two hostages without subjecting them to any pain , " steinmeier said . bräunlich and nitzschke , who work for german gas equipment installation company cryotec , were abducted near a key oil refinery in the northern town of baiji on january 24 by armed men in military uniform . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gate of baiji plant where iraqi insurgents kidnapped the two german engineers their kidnappers threatened on tuesday to kill them unless berlin cut all links with baghdad within 72 hours . president horst köhler said on friday he was " very concerned " by the kidnapping .
a foreign ministry spokesman described the situation as " extremely serious " . amid growing concern at home , he said germany was making all possible efforts to ensure the release of the two men but declined to " comment on or interpret the kidnappers ' ultimatum " . more detainee releases seen as leverage in hostage crisis iraq on sunday freed more than 50 male prisoners but held back female detainees as the fate of us and german hostages remained unknown amid a tight security clampdown for the main shiite festival .
the us military said it had released 50 male detainees , but later the iraqi government said 53 prisoners were freed .
" there was no female detainee release today , " the spokesman for the us detention facility in iraq told reporters .
" today 's release was done after a review by the joint board and at this stage i can not offer any other details . it is believed the us military release of the detainees was an attempt to gain some leverage in the kidnappings of bräunlich and nitzschke and us reporter jill carroll . last month , iraq released more than 400 detainees , including five women , in a move widely seen as a response to demands from the kidnappers of carroll for the freeing of all female prisoners in iraq . both us and iraqi spokesmen strongly denied any link at the time . shortly after those releases , a new videotape from the kidnappers was broadcast by al jazeera in which they broadened their demand to include all detainees , male or female . " the journalist called on her family , her colleagues and americans throughout the world to ask the us military authorities and the iraqi interior ministry to free all iraqi prisoners , saying this could contribute to her release , " the channel 's presenter said . us reporter still missing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emergency teams in and outside iraq are working to find and free the hostages .
carroll , who was working for the christian science monitor , was abducted in baghdad on january 7 by a group calling itself the brigades of vengeance as she traveled to a meeting with a leading sunni arab politician . " we have no new information on the hostage , " a us military spokesman said referring to carroll . the three hostages are among nearly 250 foreigners kidnapped in iraq since the march 2003 invasion .
many of them have been killed . the fate of two kenyan telecommunications engineers abducted last month and two iraqi television journalists seized wednesday also remained unknown . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de video shows german hostages alive a video of the two german engineers kidnapped in northern iraq was broadcast by al jazeera on friday .

" let the hostages go immediately , " the chairman of the islamic council for germany , ali kizilkaya , wrote in the bild am sonntag newspaper . " it is regrettable that religion is being abused once again and all of islam is brought into disrepute .
our thoughts are with the families of the two hostages . " the deputy general secretary of the islamic group milli gorus , mustafa yeneroglu , said bräunlich and nitzschke , had gone to iraq to assist its people . " the fact that two people have been kidnapped who have helped iraq economically with their work demonstrates how absurd this act is , " he said . the president of the turkish-german muslim organization ditib , ridvan cakir , said the kidnapping marked a clear violation of the tenets of islam . " i call on the kidnappers to let the two germans go at once , " he said . and the chairman of the central council of muslims in germany , nadeem elyas , said that in light of berlin 's fierce opposition to the us-led iraq war in 2003 , the german engineers should be seen as innocent bystanders . " there is no logic in the world that could justify the kidnapping .
the german people are linked to the iraqi people in friendship - after all it was the german government that opposed the iraq war at the time , " he said in a statement . the fate of german engineers rene bräunlich and thomas nitzschke remained uncertain . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier meanwhile used al jazeera friday to issue a new appeal for the release of the two engineers . " german chancellor angela merkel and myself call upon you , on behalf of all germans , to release the two hostages without subjecting them to any pain , " steinmeier said . bräunlich and nitzschke , who work for german gas equipment installation company cryotec , were abducted near a key oil refinery in the northern town of baiji on january 24 by armed men in military uniform . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gate of baiji plant where iraqi insurgents kidnapped the two german engineers their kidnappers threatened on tuesday to kill them unless berlin cut all links with baghdad within 72 hours . president horst köhler said on friday he was " very concerned " by the kidnapping .
a foreign ministry spokesman described the situation as " extremely serious " . amid growing concern at home , he said germany was making all possible efforts to ensure the release of the two men but declined to " comment on or interpret the kidnappers ' ultimatum " . more detainee releases seen as leverage in hostage crisis iraq on sunday freed more than 50 male prisoners but held back female detainees as the fate of us and german hostages remained unknown amid a tight security clampdown for the main shiite festival .
the us military said it had released 50 male detainees , but later the iraqi government said 53 prisoners were freed .
" there was no female detainee release today , " the spokesman for the us detention facility in iraq told reporters .
" today 's release was done after a review by the joint board and at this stage i can not offer any other details . it is believed the us military release of the detainees was an attempt to gain some leverage in the kidnappings of bräunlich and nitzschke and us reporter jill carroll . last month , iraq released more than 400 detainees , including five women , in a move widely seen as a response to demands from the kidnappers of carroll for the freeing of all female prisoners in iraq . both us and iraqi spokesmen strongly denied any link at the time . shortly after those releases , a new videotape from the kidnappers was broadcast by al jazeera in which they broadened their demand to include all detainees , male or female . " the journalist called on her family , her colleagues and americans throughout the world to ask the us military authorities and the iraqi interior ministry to free all iraqi prisoners , saying this could contribute to her release , " the channel 's presenter said . us reporter still missing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emergency teams in and outside iraq are working to find and free the hostages .
carroll , who was working for the christian science monitor , was abducted in baghdad on january 7 by a group calling itself the brigades of vengeance as she traveled to a meeting with a leading sunni arab politician . " we have no new information on the hostage , " a us military spokesman said referring to carroll . the three hostages are among nearly 250 foreigners kidnapped in iraq since the march 2003 invasion .
many of them have been killed . the fate of two kenyan telecommunications engineers abducted last month and two iraqi television journalists seized wednesday also remained unknown . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de video shows german hostages alive a video of the two german engineers kidnapped in northern iraq was broadcast by al jazeera on friday .

" i call on the kidnappers to let the two germans go at once , " he said . and the chairman of the central council of muslims in germany , nadeem elyas , said that in light of berlin 's fierce opposition to the us-led iraq war in 2003 , the german engineers should be seen as innocent bystanders . " there is no logic in the world that could justify the kidnapping .
the german people are linked to the iraqi people in friendship - after all it was the german government that opposed the iraq war at the time , " he said in a statement . the fate of german engineers rene bräunlich and thomas nitzschke remained uncertain . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier meanwhile used al jazeera friday to issue a new appeal for the release of the two engineers . " german chancellor angela merkel and myself call upon you , on behalf of all germans , to release the two hostages without subjecting them to any pain , " steinmeier said . bräunlich and nitzschke , who work for german gas equipment installation company cryotec , were abducted near a key oil refinery in the northern town of baiji on january 24 by armed men in military uniform . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gate of baiji plant where iraqi insurgents kidnapped the two german engineers their kidnappers threatened on tuesday to kill them unless berlin cut all links with baghdad within 72 hours . president horst köhler said on friday he was " very concerned " by the kidnapping .
a foreign ministry spokesman described the situation as " extremely serious " . amid growing concern at home , he said germany was making all possible efforts to ensure the release of the two men but declined to " comment on or interpret the kidnappers ' ultimatum " . more detainee releases seen as leverage in hostage crisis iraq on sunday freed more than 50 male prisoners but held back female detainees as the fate of us and german hostages remained unknown amid a tight security clampdown for the main shiite festival .
the us military said it had released 50 male detainees , but later the iraqi government said 53 prisoners were freed .
" there was no female detainee release today , " the spokesman for the us detention facility in iraq told reporters .
" today 's release was done after a review by the joint board and at this stage i can not offer any other details . it is believed the us military release of the detainees was an attempt to gain some leverage in the kidnappings of bräunlich and nitzschke and us reporter jill carroll . last month , iraq released more than 400 detainees , including five women , in a move widely seen as a response to demands from the kidnappers of carroll for the freeing of all female prisoners in iraq . both us and iraqi spokesmen strongly denied any link at the time . shortly after those releases , a new videotape from the kidnappers was broadcast by al jazeera in which they broadened their demand to include all detainees , male or female . " the journalist called on her family , her colleagues and americans throughout the world to ask the us military authorities and the iraqi interior ministry to free all iraqi prisoners , saying this could contribute to her release , " the channel 's presenter said . us reporter still missing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emergency teams in and outside iraq are working to find and free the hostages .
carroll , who was working for the christian science monitor , was abducted in baghdad on january 7 by a group calling itself the brigades of vengeance as she traveled to a meeting with a leading sunni arab politician . " we have no new information on the hostage , " a us military spokesman said referring to carroll . the three hostages are among nearly 250 foreigners kidnapped in iraq since the march 2003 invasion .
many of them have been killed . the fate of two kenyan telecommunications engineers abducted last month and two iraqi television journalists seized wednesday also remained unknown . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de video shows german hostages alive a video of the two german engineers kidnapped in northern iraq was broadcast by al jazeera on friday .

thousands of holiday makers are already enjoying almost perfect snow conditions , while thousands more are packing their skis and getting ready to go . but at the hugely popular swiss resort of grindelwald , located 75 km -lrb- 50 miles -rrb- from the swiss capital bern , not everybody has the time to enjoy the scenery . " we have to be prepared to go out and get the injured , " said martin mathys of the grindelwald mountain rescue service . " with the speed , of course , we have a problem .

losing one 's balance at that speed , let alone crashing into somebody else , can really put a dramatic twist on an otherwise wonderful winter vacation . " speed is the big danger factor , but it 's not just speed , it 's also the way people ski , " said paul gunter , who is head of the emergency ward at the local hospital .

thousands of holiday makers are already enjoying almost perfect snow conditions , while thousands more are packing their skis and getting ready to go . but at the hugely popular swiss resort of grindelwald , located 75 km -lrb- 50 miles -rrb- from the swiss capital bern , not everybody has the time to enjoy the scenery . " we have to be prepared to go out and get the injured , " said martin mathys of the grindelwald mountain rescue service . " with the speed , of course , we have a problem .

" let the hostages go immediately , " the chairman of the islamic council for germany , ali kizilkaya , wrote in the bild am sonntag newspaper . " it is regrettable that religion is being abused once again and all of islam is brought into disrepute .
our thoughts are with the families of the two hostages . " the deputy general secretary of the islamic group milli gorus , mustafa yeneroglu , said bräunlich and nitzschke , had gone to iraq to assist its people . " the fact that two people have been kidnapped who have helped iraq economically with their work demonstrates how absurd this act is , " he said . the president of the turkish-german muslim organization ditib , ridvan cakir , said the kidnapping marked a clear violation of the tenets of islam . " i call on the kidnappers to let the two germans go at once , " he said . and the chairman of the central council of muslims in germany , nadeem elyas , said that in light of berlin 's fierce opposition to the us-led iraq war in 2003 , the german engineers should be seen as innocent bystanders . " there is no logic in the world that could justify the kidnapping .
the german people are linked to the iraqi people in friendship - after all it was the german government that opposed the iraq war at the time , " he said in a statement . the fate of german engineers rene bräunlich and thomas nitzschke remained uncertain . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier meanwhile used al jazeera friday to issue a new appeal for the release of the two engineers . " german chancellor angela merkel and myself call upon you , on behalf of all germans , to release the two hostages without subjecting them to any pain , " steinmeier said . bräunlich and nitzschke , who work for german gas equipment installation company cryotec , were abducted near a key oil refinery in the northern town of baiji on january 24 by armed men in military uniform . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gate of baiji plant where iraqi insurgents kidnapped the two german engineers their kidnappers threatened on tuesday to kill them unless berlin cut all links with baghdad within 72 hours . president horst köhler said on friday he was " very concerned " by the kidnapping .

the us military said it had released 50 male detainees , but later the iraqi government said 53 prisoners were freed .
" there was no female detainee release today , " the spokesman for the us detention facility in iraq told reporters .
" today 's release was done after a review by the joint board and at this stage i can not offer any other details . it is believed the us military release of the detainees was an attempt to gain some leverage in the kidnappings of bräunlich and nitzschke and us reporter jill carroll . last month , iraq released more than 400 detainees , including five women , in a move widely seen as a response to demands from the kidnappers of carroll for the freeing of all female prisoners in iraq . both us and iraqi spokesmen strongly denied any link at the time . shortly after those releases , a new videotape from the kidnappers was broadcast by al jazeera in which they broadened their demand to include all detainees , male or female .

carroll , who was working for the christian science monitor , was abducted in baghdad on january 7 by a group calling itself the brigades of vengeance as she traveled to a meeting with a leading sunni arab politician .

" if the case is sent or even reported to the un security council , based on the law of our parliament , our government has no way of stopping nuclear activities , " araghchi said during merkel 's question and answer session . he blamed the three eu nations - britain , france and germany - which have negotiated with tehran over its nuclear ambitions , for creating the conflict .

" the un 's nuclear watchdog , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , voted on saturday to report iran to the un security council , paving the way to possible sanctions over its atomic program . iran retaliated by saying it would begin full-scale uranium enrichment and limit inspections by iaea officials . merkel said iran still had a chance to avoid the sanctions by accepting a russian proposal to allow iranian uranium enrichment to take place in russia , which would prevent tehran from mastering sensitive nuclear technology . she called on iran to consider the compromise as a " window of opportunity . " merkel alludes to nazi rise in speech on iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad said israel should be moved to europe and questioned whether the holocaust took place .
the german leader had strong words for iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who has called for israel to be " wiped off the map " and has branded the holocaust a " myth . " " a president who denies the existence of israel and the holocaust can not expect to receive any tolerance from germany , " merkel said . she compared ahmadinejad 's statements to when adolf hitler came to power and began threatening to exterminate european jews .
" remember that in 1933 many people said it was just rhetoric , " merkel said . the international community " must fight these beginnings now , " she said . rumsfeld tell conference iran is a global threat rumsfeld told the 300 high-level delegates at the conference that iran was a genuine threat to global peace .
" the iranian regime is today the world 's leading state sponsor of terrorism , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests have turned increasingly violent over the past few days .
" the world does not want , and must work together to prevent , a nuclear iran , " he added , urging the global powers to unite and find a diplomatic solution to halt iran 's nuclear program . in tehran , rumsfeld 's iranian counterpart mostafa mohammad najjar said in response that the leaders of the united states were " terrorists " who represented the " real axis of evil . " iran insists it is developing a peaceful atomic energy program , but the western world suspects it is planning to build nuclear weapons . responding to merkel 's speech and speaking before the iaea decision , iran 's deputy foreign minister for legal and international affairs , abbas araghchi , said that referral to the security council would not lead the islamic republic to halt its nuclear activities . araghchi blames europe for failure of diplomacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abbas araghchi blamed the eu-3 for the collapse of talks .
" if the case is sent or even reported to the un security council , based on the law of our parliament , our government has no way of stopping nuclear activities , " araghchi said during merkel 's question and answer session . he blamed the three eu nations - britain , france and germany - which have negotiated with tehran over its nuclear ambitions , for creating the conflict . " we did whatever we could .
but as you know after three years of negotiations we left empty-handed , " araghchi said . merkel brushed off his statement , saying that iran " should consider amending its laws " and adding that she would have liked to hear him comment on his president 's denial of israel 's existence .
" that was missing , " merkel said . the three-day munich conference concludes on sunday when russia 's influential defense minister sergei ivanov will be the main speaker . more than 1,700 people demonstrated in central munich against the conference , police said . the protest , organized by left-wing and pacifist groups , featured placards demanding : " we want disarmament , not job losses " and " stop the warmongers .

" terrorism , the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , failing states - these are the scourges of our times , " german defense minister franz josef jung told the conference . " the old nato as a purely defensive alliance is history , " he added . us defense secretary donald rumsfeld thanked merkel for her " thoughtful and important remarks on nato " in his own conference speech devoted to islamic militancy . " the competences that exist within nato can be used to advantage in other parts of the world , " rumsfeld said . the us defense chief praised the alliance 's deployment in afghanistan after the fall of the taliban regime and in giving humanitarian assistance to pakistan after a massive earthquake last year . but nato 's potential was being held back by insufficient defense spending in members of the alliance , rumsfeld said . the united states was spending 3.7 percent of its gdp on defense but other nato members were spending far less , he said . " unless we invest in defense and security , the reality is that our homelands can be at risk . " french disagree and promote stronger eu forces bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of the european union 's growing military strength oppose the nato expansion ideas .
french defense minister michele alliot-marie took a more skeptical view on nato 's role and stressed the importance of the european union 's growing security capability , reflecting widespread concerns in france that a stronger nato would mean a weaker eu . " let 's take care ... not to spill into areas where the competence of other organizations is more suitable .
let 's not waste our financial means , which are vital for fighting crises and upgrading our equipment , " alliot-marie said . nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer , however , supported " pragmatic " cooperation between nato and the european union and sought to calm french fears . nato is no global cop says de hoop scheffer " nato is not a global policeman , " he said .
among the new global threats that nato could help combat , de hoop scheffer mentioned the protection of energy supply lines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer does not want the alliance to act as the world police .
" for reasons that are obvious - including the potential of terrorists targeting our energy supplies - it makes sense to me that the allies should discuss this issue , " he said . supplies of russian gas to ukraine and georgia have recently been disrupted . heads of state , government ministers , top defense officials and security experts gathered in a heavily-guarded five star hotel for the conference , entitled " restoring the transatlantic partnership .

9 , deutsche welle takes a look back at the turbulent and glamour-filled history of the festival and its founding amid a war-ravaged germany . when the 56th edition of the berlinale gets underway on feb .
9 , stars , journalists , paparazzi and film producers will throng the glitzy potsdamer platz in downtown berlin , where most of the action takes place . the buzz and hoopla wo n't be that different from the first berlinale , which took place on june 6 , 1951 .
but the background certainly will be . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the official poster for the first berlinale in 1951 the first berlinale , which opened with alfred hitchcock 's " rebecca , " took place against a bleak backdrop of a bombed-out german capital .
six years after the end of world war ii , large parts of the city still lay in ruins .
reconstruction had begun , but berlin was still far removed from the pulsating metropolis it once had been in the 1920s . still the berlinale did manage to inject some much-needed excitement and flamboyance into postwar berlin .
ever since american cult actress joan fontaine , who starred in " rebecca , " glided down the red carpet at the first berlinale , the film festival rapidly established itself in the 1950s as an international meeting point for the stars of world cinema . it was n't just hollywood , but also celebrities from other big cinema nations and studios in germany , such as sophia lauren , errol flynn , hans albers and hildegard knef , who graced the berlinale .
the film festival became a byword for glamour and fashion . artsy and intellectual in the 1960s , it was n't just divas and hollywood celebrities making the headlines at the berlinale . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french director jean-luc godard the film festival transformed itself into a hub for artsy and intelligent cinema with directors like jean-luc godard and francois truffaut presenting their works in berlin . in the politically-laden 1970s , the reverberations of the 1968 student revolts and the vietnam war made an impact on the berlinale too .
the festival witnessed angry protests against the us-critical film " o.k. " by german director michael verhoeven . following a few more turbulent years , the berlin film festival underwent a further change with the emergence of the " forum " section in addition to its mainstay , " competion " category which ends in the ceremonial awarding of the golden and silver bears . the " forum " section provided a showcase in particular for documentary and experimental films .
it also offered a platform for films from countries , which until then had never been in the spotlight of international cinema . for ulrich gregor , longtime former head of the section , the new developments finally completed the berlinale 's claim to be a showcase for international cinema by including all forms and genres . " it included the whole spectrum - right from hollywood films to independent ones from various countries , europe and also non-european nations right to documentaries and other experimental forms , " gregor said . boost for german films bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the coveted golden and silver bears however , the " competition " category has remained the centerpiece of the berlinale with hits such as " la notte " by michelangelo antonioni or " hong gaoliang " by zhang yimou being premiered here .
it 's this section that has also traditionally drawn the stars , given the prestige attached to winning the golden and silver bears . current berlinale director dieter kosslick has ensured that the section continues to take center stage at the festival . " what we do is also cultivate a so-called connections business , where you really have to know a lot of people and where you have to understand them , " kosslick said .
" you have to speak their language and i think you have to have a certain passion for that . " part of kosslick 's passion in the past years has also been the focus on homegrown cinema - something that was ignored by his predecessor moritz de hadeln for a long time . for a few years now , german films have been and have been prominently visible in several categories at the berlinale . heinz badewitz , head of the " perspective german cinema " section , says the international movers and shakers in the movie business also come to germany to watch and potentially buy homegrown entries . " our target group includes international buyers and festival directors from the whole world who come here to see the latest in german film in a compact manner , " badewitz said . asian cinema in the spotlight another relatively new development at the berlinale in the past decade has been the increasing presence of films from asian countries .
movies from china , taiwan , korea and vietnam have celebrated huge successes at the film festival in recent years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from taiwanese film " the wayward cloud " by tsai ming liang moritz de hadeln , the previous berlinale director , who also encouraged asian cinema during his term , says political films in particular find a deep resonance in berlin , which was long politically and physically divided itself . " asian filmmakers have something exciting to offer at the moment .
one of the new things is a contemporary korean film , it 's about relations between north and south korea , " de hadeln said .
" it 's a film that would not have been made two or three years ago in korea . " a political festival at heart indeed , the berlinale has long been a political festival . in the 1970s and 80s in particular , it was a platform for eastern european filmmakers .
many films from the soviet union or from east germany , which were controversial at home , celebrated their international premieres at the berlinale . and , last year the film festival embraced another continent , which had never before been among the victors - the film " carmen khayelitsha " by south african mark dornford-may picked up the coveted golden bear . jochen kürten -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlinale strikes a serious note the berlin international film festival , which opens on feb .

" it included the whole spectrum - right from hollywood films to independent ones from various countries , europe and also non-european nations right to documentaries and other experimental forms , " gregor said . boost for german films bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the coveted golden and silver bears however , the " competition " category has remained the centerpiece of the berlinale with hits such as " la notte " by michelangelo antonioni or " hong gaoliang " by zhang yimou being premiered here .
it 's this section that has also traditionally drawn the stars , given the prestige attached to winning the golden and silver bears . current berlinale director dieter kosslick has ensured that the section continues to take center stage at the festival . " what we do is also cultivate a so-called connections business , where you really have to know a lot of people and where you have to understand them , " kosslick said .
" you have to speak their language and i think you have to have a certain passion for that . " part of kosslick 's passion in the past years has also been the focus on homegrown cinema - something that was ignored by his predecessor moritz de hadeln for a long time . for a few years now , german films have been and have been prominently visible in several categories at the berlinale . heinz badewitz , head of the " perspective german cinema " section , says the international movers and shakers in the movie business also come to germany to watch and potentially buy homegrown entries . " our target group includes international buyers and festival directors from the whole world who come here to see the latest in german film in a compact manner , " badewitz said . asian cinema in the spotlight another relatively new development at the berlinale in the past decade has been the increasing presence of films from asian countries .
movies from china , taiwan , korea and vietnam have celebrated huge successes at the film festival in recent years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from taiwanese film " the wayward cloud " by tsai ming liang moritz de hadeln , the previous berlinale director , who also encouraged asian cinema during his term , says political films in particular find a deep resonance in berlin , which was long politically and physically divided itself . " asian filmmakers have something exciting to offer at the moment .
one of the new things is a contemporary korean film , it 's about relations between north and south korea , " de hadeln said .
" it 's a film that would not have been made two or three years ago in korea . " a political festival at heart indeed , the berlinale has long been a political festival . in the 1970s and 80s in particular , it was a platform for eastern european filmmakers .
many films from the soviet union or from east germany , which were controversial at home , celebrated their international premieres at the berlinale . and , last year the film festival embraced another continent , which had never before been among the victors - the film " carmen khayelitsha " by south african mark dornford-may picked up the coveted golden bear . jochen kürten -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlinale strikes a serious note the berlin international film festival , which opens on feb .

9 , deutsche welle takes a look back at the turbulent and glamour-filled history of the festival and its founding amid a war-ravaged germany . when the 56th edition of the berlinale gets underway on feb .
9 , stars , journalists , paparazzi and film producers will throng the glitzy potsdamer platz in downtown berlin , where most of the action takes place . the buzz and hoopla wo n't be that different from the first berlinale , which took place on june 6 , 1951 .
but the background certainly will be . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the official poster for the first berlinale in 1951 the first berlinale , which opened with alfred hitchcock 's " rebecca , " took place against a bleak backdrop of a bombed-out german capital .
six years after the end of world war ii , large parts of the city still lay in ruins .
reconstruction had begun , but berlin was still far removed from the pulsating metropolis it once had been in the 1920s . still the berlinale did manage to inject some much-needed excitement and flamboyance into postwar berlin .
ever since american cult actress joan fontaine , who starred in " rebecca , " glided down the red carpet at the first berlinale , the film festival rapidly established itself in the 1950s as an international meeting point for the stars of world cinema . it was n't just hollywood , but also celebrities from other big cinema nations and studios in germany , such as sophia lauren , errol flynn , hans albers and hildegard knef , who graced the berlinale .
the film festival became a byword for glamour and fashion . artsy and intellectual in the 1960s , it was n't just divas and hollywood celebrities making the headlines at the berlinale . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french director jean-luc godard the film festival transformed itself into a hub for artsy and intelligent cinema with directors like jean-luc godard and francois truffaut presenting their works in berlin . in the politically-laden 1970s , the reverberations of the 1968 student revolts and the vietnam war made an impact on the berlinale too .
the festival witnessed angry protests against the us-critical film " o.k. " by german director michael verhoeven . following a few more turbulent years , the berlin film festival underwent a further change with the emergence of the " forum " section in addition to its mainstay , " competion " category which ends in the ceremonial awarding of the golden and silver bears . the " forum " section provided a showcase in particular for documentary and experimental films .

now one swiss resort has come up with a novel way to try to ensure that guests leave the slopes as they arrived - in one piece . across europe 's alps , the winter ski season is in full swing .
thousands of holiday makers are already enjoying almost perfect snow conditions , while thousands more are packing their skis and getting ready to go . but at the hugely popular swiss resort of grindelwald , located 75 km -lrb- 50 miles -rrb- from the swiss capital bern , not everybody has the time to enjoy the scenery . " we have to be prepared to go out and get the injured , " said martin mathys of the grindelwald mountain rescue service . " with the speed , of course , we have a problem .
the equipment is always getting better , you can ski faster , and then you have also the head injuries , " he said . chasing the wind bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's a mad , mad world : where cows can fly and skiiers get pulled over with today 's modern carving skis , skiers can reach 80 kilometers an hour .
losing one 's balance at that speed , let alone crashing into somebody else , can really put a dramatic twist on an otherwise wonderful winter vacation . " speed is the big danger factor , but it 's not just speed , it 's also the way people ski , " said paul gunter , who is head of the emergency ward at the local hospital . " they make turns where they really do use the whole width of the slope , and that leads to collisions .
we 're seeing injuries now that are more like what you see in car accidents - head injuries , and back injuries , " gunter said . staying on the safe side bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hardcore skiing aficionados can even cause traffic jams the rising number of accidents is making some skiers stay away - even the keen ones .
that 's not a good development for a resort like grindelwald , which has attracted tourists since the 17th century .
so , local officials have come up with a novel solution to decrease the number of visitors leaving grindelwald overdosed on painkillers and wearing a cast . " we were asking people on the slopes , how do you feel , and a lot of people , especially families , said i just do n't feel safe because there are so many fast skiers around me , " benny kaufmann of the grindelwald tourism organization explained . " and then we thought we 'd make a new slope , with speed limits , and people will feel safer , " kaufmann said . speed patrols the new 30 km an hour slope has an electronic monitor to check the skiers ' speed , and patrols who pull them over if they break the limit .
the fast and the furious do n't get fined , but asked to move to a faster slope .
the idea has already found favor with holiday makers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enjoy the view - hopefully not through a hospital window " i think it 's excellent , " said a grindelwald skier .
" it 's quite intimidating when you 're coming down and you hear snowboarders especially rushing behind you .
you think , oh , which way are they going ?
so i 'm all in favor of it . " the speed limits are n't designed to spoil the fun : quite the opposite , they are there to ensure that every skier , regardless of their skill level , has fun while making sure everybody stays as safe as possible . so , if you 're heading to the alps this winter , and you 're not intentionally trying to break some part of your body , you should try to follow the advice your mother would give you : do n't ski too fast , do n't ski above your ability , and wear a helmet .

" let the hostages go immediately , " the chairman of the islamic council for germany , ali kizilkaya , wrote in the bild am sonntag newspaper . " it is regrettable that religion is being abused once again and all of islam is brought into disrepute .
our thoughts are with the families of the two hostages . " the deputy general secretary of the islamic group milli gorus , mustafa yeneroglu , said bräunlich and nitzschke , had gone to iraq to assist its people . " the fact that two people have been kidnapped who have helped iraq economically with their work demonstrates how absurd this act is , " he said . the president of the turkish-german muslim organization ditib , ridvan cakir , said the kidnapping marked a clear violation of the tenets of islam . " i call on the kidnappers to let the two germans go at once , " he said . and the chairman of the central council of muslims in germany , nadeem elyas , said that in light of berlin 's fierce opposition to the us-led iraq war in 2003 , the german engineers should be seen as innocent bystanders . " there is no logic in the world that could justify the kidnapping .
the german people are linked to the iraqi people in friendship - after all it was the german government that opposed the iraq war at the time , " he said in a statement . the fate of german engineers rene bräunlich and thomas nitzschke remained uncertain . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier meanwhile used al jazeera friday to issue a new appeal for the release of the two engineers . " german chancellor angela merkel and myself call upon you , on behalf of all germans , to release the two hostages without subjecting them to any pain , " steinmeier said . bräunlich and nitzschke , who work for german gas equipment installation company cryotec , were abducted near a key oil refinery in the northern town of baiji on january 24 by armed men in military uniform . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gate of baiji plant where iraqi insurgents kidnapped the two german engineers their kidnappers threatened on tuesday to kill them unless berlin cut all links with baghdad within 72 hours . president horst köhler said on friday he was " very concerned " by the kidnapping .
a foreign ministry spokesman described the situation as " extremely serious " . amid growing concern at home , he said germany was making all possible efforts to ensure the release of the two men but declined to " comment on or interpret the kidnappers ' ultimatum " . more detainee releases seen as leverage in hostage crisis iraq on sunday freed more than 50 male prisoners but held back female detainees as the fate of us and german hostages remained unknown amid a tight security clampdown for the main shiite festival .
the us military said it had released 50 male detainees , but later the iraqi government said 53 prisoners were freed .
" there was no female detainee release today , " the spokesman for the us detention facility in iraq told reporters .
" today 's release was done after a review by the joint board and at this stage i can not offer any other details . it is believed the us military release of the detainees was an attempt to gain some leverage in the kidnappings of bräunlich and nitzschke and us reporter jill carroll . last month , iraq released more than 400 detainees , including five women , in a move widely seen as a response to demands from the kidnappers of carroll for the freeing of all female prisoners in iraq . both us and iraqi spokesmen strongly denied any link at the time . shortly after those releases , a new videotape from the kidnappers was broadcast by al jazeera in which they broadened their demand to include all detainees , male or female . " the journalist called on her family , her colleagues and americans throughout the world to ask the us military authorities and the iraqi interior ministry to free all iraqi prisoners , saying this could contribute to her release , " the channel 's presenter said . us reporter still missing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emergency teams in and outside iraq are working to find and free the hostages .
carroll , who was working for the christian science monitor , was abducted in baghdad on january 7 by a group calling itself the brigades of vengeance as she traveled to a meeting with a leading sunni arab politician . " we have no new information on the hostage , " a us military spokesman said referring to carroll . the three hostages are among nearly 250 foreigners kidnapped in iraq since the march 2003 invasion .
many of them have been killed . the fate of two kenyan telecommunications engineers abducted last month and two iraqi television journalists seized wednesday also remained unknown . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de video shows german hostages alive a video of the two german engineers kidnapped in northern iraq was broadcast by al jazeera on friday .

" terrorism , the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , failing states - these are the scourges of our times , " german defense minister franz josef jung told the conference . " the old nato as a purely defensive alliance is history , " he added . us defense secretary donald rumsfeld thanked merkel for her " thoughtful and important remarks on nato " in his own conference speech devoted to islamic militancy . " the competences that exist within nato can be used to advantage in other parts of the world , " rumsfeld said . the us defense chief praised the alliance 's deployment in afghanistan after the fall of the taliban regime and in giving humanitarian assistance to pakistan after a massive earthquake last year . but nato 's potential was being held back by insufficient defense spending in members of the alliance , rumsfeld said . the united states was spending 3.7 percent of its gdp on defense but other nato members were spending far less , he said . " unless we invest in defense and security , the reality is that our homelands can be at risk . " french disagree and promote stronger eu forces bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of the european union 's growing military strength oppose the nato expansion ideas .
french defense minister michele alliot-marie took a more skeptical view on nato 's role and stressed the importance of the european union 's growing security capability , reflecting widespread concerns in france that a stronger nato would mean a weaker eu . " let 's take care ... not to spill into areas where the competence of other organizations is more suitable .
let 's not waste our financial means , which are vital for fighting crises and upgrading our equipment , " alliot-marie said . nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer , however , supported " pragmatic " cooperation between nato and the european union and sought to calm french fears . nato is no global cop says de hoop scheffer " nato is not a global policeman , " he said .
among the new global threats that nato could help combat , de hoop scheffer mentioned the protection of energy supply lines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer does not want the alliance to act as the world police .
" for reasons that are obvious - including the potential of terrorists targeting our energy supplies - it makes sense to me that the allies should discuss this issue , " he said . supplies of russian gas to ukraine and georgia have recently been disrupted . heads of state , government ministers , top defense officials and security experts gathered in a heavily-guarded five star hotel for the conference , entitled " restoring the transatlantic partnership .

" you can issue as many resolutions as you like and have fun with it , but you can not prevent iran 's progress , " said the hard-line president , who has steered his country on a collision course with the west since his shock election win last june . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad remains defiant .
" you know that you can not do anything .
the era of bullying is over , " he said of the west 's determination to prevent iran from acquiring nuclear fuel technology that can also be used to make the fissile core of a nuclear bomb . iranian fm says resolution removes possible of further diplomacy foreign minister manouchehr mottaki meanwhile confirmed iran had laid down the gauntlet with immediate retaliation .
" all voluntary measures taken over the past two-and-a-half or three years have been halted and we have no further commitment to the additional protocol and other voluntary commitments , " he told a news conference . " this resolution has no legal basis .
all it does is simply remove the opportunity for voluntary cooperation between iran and the agency . " the additional protocol to the non-proliferation treaty hands the iaea stronger inspection powers and is central to the un watchdog 's now three-year-old effort to determine what iran is actually up to . mottaki did not specify what other steps had already been taken , but iran 's voluntary measures had notably included a freeze on uranium enrichment . iran says it only wants to enrich uranium to make reactor fuel .
it prompted the latest crisis by resuming uranium conversion activities last august and enrichment research on january 10 . us president george w. bush , however , said the text " is not the end of diplomacy or the iaea 's role " and merely the " beginning of an intensified diplomatic effort . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president george w. bush says diplomacy is still alive but an atomic iran will not be allowed .
" this important step sends a clear message to the regime in iran that the world will not permit the iranian regime to gain nuclear weapons , " bush said . russia favored by iran as negotiator although iranian retaliation is set to worsen tensions , the islamic regime also signaled it was ready to press on with negotiations with russia - which now has a one month window to talk with tehran before the security council actually takes up the matter . moscow 's proposal is for enrichment to be carried out on russian soil in order to allay proliferation concerns whilst at the same time allowing iran to have nuclear fuel for civilian purposes . " the second round of talks will go ahead , but the russian proposal must be adapted to the new situation so that we can examine it , " foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi told reporters . the two sides are scheduled to meet in moscow on february 16 , with russia keen to reach a negotiated settlement and guard its economic interests - which include a one-billion dollar deal to build iran 's first reactor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian defence minister sergei ivanov hopes iran will consider his country 's proposals .
" i am sure that the iranian leadership will look with all seriousness at russia 's proposal , " russian defense minister sergei ivanov said .
" this suggestion is the best way out of the situation . " widespread international pressure for iran to comply iran is under massive pressure from elsewhere to comply with the iaea 's demands to return to a moratorium on fuel cycle work , show better cooperation with iaea inspectors and return to negotiations . in the iaea vote , 27 countries including the un security council 's permanent five - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - voted in favor and five abstained .
iran 's only support came from cuba , syria and venezuela . japan also said the resolution was " a clear message to iran " , and called on the tehran to " take this resolution seriously and respond to it sincerely . " " iran has still a crucial opportunity between now and the march iaea board to comply , " said british foreign secretary jack straw .
" otherwise , decisions by the security council are almost inevitable .

" terrorism , the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , failing states - these are the scourges of our times , " german defense minister franz josef jung told the conference . " the old nato as a purely defensive alliance is history , " he added . us defense secretary donald rumsfeld thanked merkel for her " thoughtful and important remarks on nato " in his own conference speech devoted to islamic militancy . " the competences that exist within nato can be used to advantage in other parts of the world , " rumsfeld said . the us defense chief praised the alliance 's deployment in afghanistan after the fall of the taliban regime and in giving humanitarian assistance to pakistan after a massive earthquake last year . but nato 's potential was being held back by insufficient defense spending in members of the alliance , rumsfeld said . the united states was spending 3.7 percent of its gdp on defense but other nato members were spending far less , he said . " unless we invest in defense and security , the reality is that our homelands can be at risk . " french disagree and promote stronger eu forces bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of the european union 's growing military strength oppose the nato expansion ideas .
french defense minister michele alliot-marie took a more skeptical view on nato 's role and stressed the importance of the european union 's growing security capability , reflecting widespread concerns in france that a stronger nato would mean a weaker eu . " let 's take care ... not to spill into areas where the competence of other organizations is more suitable .
let 's not waste our financial means , which are vital for fighting crises and upgrading our equipment , " alliot-marie said . nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer , however , supported " pragmatic " cooperation between nato and the european union and sought to calm french fears . nato is no global cop says de hoop scheffer " nato is not a global policeman , " he said .
among the new global threats that nato could help combat , de hoop scheffer mentioned the protection of energy supply lines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer does not want the alliance to act as the world police .
" for reasons that are obvious - including the potential of terrorists targeting our energy supplies - it makes sense to me that the allies should discuss this issue , " he said . supplies of russian gas to ukraine and georgia have recently been disrupted . heads of state , government ministers , top defense officials and security experts gathered in a heavily-guarded five star hotel for the conference , entitled " restoring the transatlantic partnership .

" let the hostages go immediately , " the chairman of the islamic council for germany , ali kizilkaya , wrote in the bild am sonntag newspaper . " it is regrettable that religion is being abused once again and all of islam is brought into disrepute .
our thoughts are with the families of the two hostages . " the deputy general secretary of the islamic group milli gorus , mustafa yeneroglu , said bräunlich and nitzschke , had gone to iraq to assist its people . " the fact that two people have been kidnapped who have helped iraq economically with their work demonstrates how absurd this act is , " he said . the president of the turkish-german muslim organization ditib , ridvan cakir , said the kidnapping marked a clear violation of the tenets of islam . " i call on the kidnappers to let the two germans go at once , " he said . and the chairman of the central council of muslims in germany , nadeem elyas , said that in light of berlin 's fierce opposition to the us-led iraq war in 2003 , the german engineers should be seen as innocent bystanders . " there is no logic in the world that could justify the kidnapping .

9 , deutsche welle takes a look back at the turbulent and glamour-filled history of the festival and its founding amid a war-ravaged germany . when the 56th edition of the berlinale gets underway on feb .
9 , stars , journalists , paparazzi and film producers will throng the glitzy potsdamer platz in downtown berlin , where most of the action takes place . the buzz and hoopla wo n't be that different from the first berlinale , which took place on june 6 , 1951 .
but the background certainly will be . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the official poster for the first berlinale in 1951 the first berlinale , which opened with alfred hitchcock 's " rebecca , " took place against a bleak backdrop of a bombed-out german capital .
six years after the end of world war ii , large parts of the city still lay in ruins .
reconstruction had begun , but berlin was still far removed from the pulsating metropolis it once had been in the 1920s . still the berlinale did manage to inject some much-needed excitement and flamboyance into postwar berlin .
ever since american cult actress joan fontaine , who starred in " rebecca , " glided down the red carpet at the first berlinale , the film festival rapidly established itself in the 1950s as an international meeting point for the stars of world cinema . it was n't just hollywood , but also celebrities from other big cinema nations and studios in germany , such as sophia lauren , errol flynn , hans albers and hildegard knef , who graced the berlinale .
the film festival became a byword for glamour and fashion . artsy and intellectual in the 1960s , it was n't just divas and hollywood celebrities making the headlines at the berlinale . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french director jean-luc godard the film festival transformed itself into a hub for artsy and intelligent cinema with directors like jean-luc godard and francois truffaut presenting their works in berlin . in the politically-laden 1970s , the reverberations of the 1968 student revolts and the vietnam war made an impact on the berlinale too .
the festival witnessed angry protests against the us-critical film " o.k. " by german director michael verhoeven . following a few more turbulent years , the berlin film festival underwent a further change with the emergence of the " forum " section in addition to its mainstay , " competion " category which ends in the ceremonial awarding of the golden and silver bears . the " forum " section provided a showcase in particular for documentary and experimental films .
it also offered a platform for films from countries , which until then had never been in the spotlight of international cinema . for ulrich gregor , longtime former head of the section , the new developments finally completed the berlinale 's claim to be a showcase for international cinema by including all forms and genres . " it included the whole spectrum - right from hollywood films to independent ones from various countries , europe and also non-european nations right to documentaries and other experimental forms , " gregor said . boost for german films bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the coveted golden and silver bears however , the " competition " category has remained the centerpiece of the berlinale with hits such as " la notte " by michelangelo antonioni or " hong gaoliang " by zhang yimou being premiered here .
it 's this section that has also traditionally drawn the stars , given the prestige attached to winning the golden and silver bears . current berlinale director dieter kosslick has ensured that the section continues to take center stage at the festival . " what we do is also cultivate a so-called connections business , where you really have to know a lot of people and where you have to understand them , " kosslick said .
" you have to speak their language and i think you have to have a certain passion for that . " part of kosslick 's passion in the past years has also been the focus on homegrown cinema - something that was ignored by his predecessor moritz de hadeln for a long time . for a few years now , german films have been and have been prominently visible in several categories at the berlinale . heinz badewitz , head of the " perspective german cinema " section , says the international movers and shakers in the movie business also come to germany to watch and potentially buy homegrown entries . " our target group includes international buyers and festival directors from the whole world who come here to see the latest in german film in a compact manner , " badewitz said . asian cinema in the spotlight another relatively new development at the berlinale in the past decade has been the increasing presence of films from asian countries .
movies from china , taiwan , korea and vietnam have celebrated huge successes at the film festival in recent years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from taiwanese film " the wayward cloud " by tsai ming liang moritz de hadeln , the previous berlinale director , who also encouraged asian cinema during his term , says political films in particular find a deep resonance in berlin , which was long politically and physically divided itself . " asian filmmakers have something exciting to offer at the moment .
one of the new things is a contemporary korean film , it 's about relations between north and south korea , " de hadeln said .
" it 's a film that would not have been made two or three years ago in korea . " a political festival at heart indeed , the berlinale has long been a political festival . in the 1970s and 80s in particular , it was a platform for eastern european filmmakers .
many films from the soviet union or from east germany , which were controversial at home , celebrated their international premieres at the berlinale . and , last year the film festival embraced another continent , which had never before been among the victors - the film " carmen khayelitsha " by south african mark dornford-may picked up the coveted golden bear . jochen kürten -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlinale strikes a serious note the berlin international film festival , which opens on feb .

ever since american cult actress joan fontaine , who starred in " rebecca , " glided down the red carpet at the first berlinale , the film festival rapidly established itself in the 1950s as an international meeting point for the stars of world cinema . it was n't just hollywood , but also celebrities from other big cinema nations and studios in germany , such as sophia lauren , errol flynn , hans albers and hildegard knef , who graced the berlinale .
the film festival became a byword for glamour and fashion . artsy and intellectual in the 1960s , it was n't just divas and hollywood celebrities making the headlines at the berlinale . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french director jean-luc godard the film festival transformed itself into a hub for artsy and intelligent cinema with directors like jean-luc godard and francois truffaut presenting their works in berlin . in the politically-laden 1970s , the reverberations of the 1968 student revolts and the vietnam war made an impact on the berlinale too .
the festival witnessed angry protests against the us-critical film " o.k. " by german director michael verhoeven . following a few more turbulent years , the berlin film festival underwent a further change with the emergence of the " forum " section in addition to its mainstay , " competion " category which ends in the ceremonial awarding of the golden and silver bears . the " forum " section provided a showcase in particular for documentary and experimental films .
it also offered a platform for films from countries , which until then had never been in the spotlight of international cinema . for ulrich gregor , longtime former head of the section , the new developments finally completed the berlinale 's claim to be a showcase for international cinema by including all forms and genres . " it included the whole spectrum - right from hollywood films to independent ones from various countries , europe and also non-european nations right to documentaries and other experimental forms , " gregor said . boost for german films bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the coveted golden and silver bears however , the " competition " category has remained the centerpiece of the berlinale with hits such as " la notte " by michelangelo antonioni or " hong gaoliang " by zhang yimou being premiered here .
it 's this section that has also traditionally drawn the stars , given the prestige attached to winning the golden and silver bears . current berlinale director dieter kosslick has ensured that the section continues to take center stage at the festival . " what we do is also cultivate a so-called connections business , where you really have to know a lot of people and where you have to understand them , " kosslick said .
" you have to speak their language and i think you have to have a certain passion for that . " part of kosslick 's passion in the past years has also been the focus on homegrown cinema - something that was ignored by his predecessor moritz de hadeln for a long time . for a few years now , german films have been and have been prominently visible in several categories at the berlinale . heinz badewitz , head of the " perspective german cinema " section , says the international movers and shakers in the movie business also come to germany to watch and potentially buy homegrown entries . " our target group includes international buyers and festival directors from the whole world who come here to see the latest in german film in a compact manner , " badewitz said . asian cinema in the spotlight another relatively new development at the berlinale in the past decade has been the increasing presence of films from asian countries .
movies from china , taiwan , korea and vietnam have celebrated huge successes at the film festival in recent years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from taiwanese film " the wayward cloud " by tsai ming liang moritz de hadeln , the previous berlinale director , who also encouraged asian cinema during his term , says political films in particular find a deep resonance in berlin , which was long politically and physically divided itself . " asian filmmakers have something exciting to offer at the moment .
one of the new things is a contemporary korean film , it 's about relations between north and south korea , " de hadeln said .
" it 's a film that would not have been made two or three years ago in korea . " a political festival at heart indeed , the berlinale has long been a political festival . in the 1970s and 80s in particular , it was a platform for eastern european filmmakers .
many films from the soviet union or from east germany , which were controversial at home , celebrated their international premieres at the berlinale . and , last year the film festival embraced another continent , which had never before been among the victors - the film " carmen khayelitsha " by south african mark dornford-may picked up the coveted golden bear . jochen kürten -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlinale strikes a serious note the berlin international film festival , which opens on feb .

" you can issue as many resolutions as you like and have fun with it , but you can not prevent iran 's progress , " said the hard-line president , who has steered his country on a collision course with the west since his shock election win last june . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad remains defiant .
" you know that you can not do anything .
the era of bullying is over , " he said of the west 's determination to prevent iran from acquiring nuclear fuel technology that can also be used to make the fissile core of a nuclear bomb . iranian fm says resolution removes possible of further diplomacy foreign minister manouchehr mottaki meanwhile confirmed iran had laid down the gauntlet with immediate retaliation .
" all voluntary measures taken over the past two-and-a-half or three years have been halted and we have no further commitment to the additional protocol and other voluntary commitments , " he told a news conference . " this resolution has no legal basis .
all it does is simply remove the opportunity for voluntary cooperation between iran and the agency . " the additional protocol to the non-proliferation treaty hands the iaea stronger inspection powers and is central to the un watchdog 's now three-year-old effort to determine what iran is actually up to . mottaki did not specify what other steps had already been taken , but iran 's voluntary measures had notably included a freeze on uranium enrichment . iran says it only wants to enrich uranium to make reactor fuel .
it prompted the latest crisis by resuming uranium conversion activities last august and enrichment research on january 10 . us president george w. bush , however , said the text " is not the end of diplomacy or the iaea 's role " and merely the " beginning of an intensified diplomatic effort . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president george w. bush says diplomacy is still alive but an atomic iran will not be allowed .
" this important step sends a clear message to the regime in iran that the world will not permit the iranian regime to gain nuclear weapons , " bush said . russia favored by iran as negotiator although iranian retaliation is set to worsen tensions , the islamic regime also signaled it was ready to press on with negotiations with russia - which now has a one month window to talk with tehran before the security council actually takes up the matter . moscow 's proposal is for enrichment to be carried out on russian soil in order to allay proliferation concerns whilst at the same time allowing iran to have nuclear fuel for civilian purposes . " the second round of talks will go ahead , but the russian proposal must be adapted to the new situation so that we can examine it , " foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi told reporters . the two sides are scheduled to meet in moscow on february 16 , with russia keen to reach a negotiated settlement and guard its economic interests - which include a one-billion dollar deal to build iran 's first reactor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian defence minister sergei ivanov hopes iran will consider his country 's proposals .
" i am sure that the iranian leadership will look with all seriousness at russia 's proposal , " russian defense minister sergei ivanov said .
" this suggestion is the best way out of the situation . " widespread international pressure for iran to comply iran is under massive pressure from elsewhere to comply with the iaea 's demands to return to a moratorium on fuel cycle work , show better cooperation with iaea inspectors and return to negotiations . in the iaea vote , 27 countries including the un security council 's permanent five - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - voted in favor and five abstained .
iran 's only support came from cuba , syria and venezuela . japan also said the resolution was " a clear message to iran " , and called on the tehran to " take this resolution seriously and respond to it sincerely . " " iran has still a crucial opportunity between now and the march iaea board to comply , " said british foreign secretary jack straw .
" otherwise , decisions by the security council are almost inevitable .

nine-year-old mahjoub jemili 's complexion may not fit the stereotype , but his thick regional accent certainly bears it up . mahjoub the first has already faced one of the biggest tests of his reign as the children 's prince of wesseling .
he addressed cologne cardinal joachim meissner , which had invited wesseling 's carnival society to coffee .
and he was a success .
" he did his job very well .
and his command of the cologne dialect is a huge achievement , " remarked meissner .
" i ca n't do it at all .
when i try people just laugh - justifiably so . " nevertheless , the children 's prince bestowed his very own carnival medal on the cardinal .
the medal was decorated with his title , wesseling 's coat of arms , a soccer ball and a camel , in reference to his favorite hobby and his origin . born in the rhineland , the boy speaks fluent german in the dialect of the cologne area .
his dialect is so thick that many a german from beyond the rhine would n't understand him . it was work which brought jemili 's grandparents to wesseling , south of cologne , in 1970 , decades before mahjoub was born .
mahjoub is the third generation of wesselingers , after his parents , lamia and foued .
years of carnival-going though born in tunisia , mahjoub 's mother identifies more strongly with germany than with her country of birth , and she sees the choice of mahjoub as carnival prince as an example of successful integration .
but she and her husband were still a bit nervous when they got the news .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rhineland carnival reaches its apogee in late february this year " we were a little concerned and thought , ' what will happen when the boy goes on stage ?
will people accept it ? '
at a meeting of senior citizens , when the boy 's name was called out - ' here comes the children 's price mahjoub i ' - they did n't know what to make of it .
and then they saw the boy , " recalled lamia jemili .
" but once he was on stage and said the first word in cologne dialect , and then his speech .
the people turned around and said , ' is that your son ?
that 's great ' ! " mahjoub is already well-seasoned when it comes to carnival .
like many rhineland kids , he 's celebrated the event every year since he can remember - the first time at the age of eight months .
the jemilis have always been part of the wessling 's carnival society .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mahjoub , like other rhineland kids , started celebrating carnival at a young age " in my eyes , you have to want to be integrated , " said lamia jemili .

" the second round of talks will go ahead , but the russian proposal must be adapted to the new situation so that we can examine it , " foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi told reporters . the two sides are scheduled to meet in moscow on february 16 , with russia keen to reach a negotiated settlement and guard its economic interests - which include a one-billion dollar deal to build iran 's first reactor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian defence minister sergei ivanov hopes iran will consider his country 's proposals .

" the concerns and fears over iran 's nuclear program are legitimate . " the un 's nuclear watchdog , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , voted on saturday to report iran to the un security council , paving the way to possible sanctions over its atomic program . iran retaliated by saying it would begin full-scale uranium enrichment and limit inspections by iaea officials . merkel said iran still had a chance to avoid the sanctions by accepting a russian proposal to allow iranian uranium enrichment to take place in russia , which would prevent tehran from mastering sensitive nuclear technology . she called on iran to consider the compromise as a " window of opportunity .

" if the case is sent or even reported to the un security council , based on the law of our parliament , our government has no way of stopping nuclear activities , " araghchi said during merkel 's question and answer session . he blamed the three eu nations - britain , france and germany - which have negotiated with tehran over its nuclear ambitions , for creating the conflict .

" you can issue as many resolutions as you like and have fun with it , but you can not prevent iran 's progress , " said the hard-line president , who has steered his country on a collision course with the west since his shock election win last june . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad remains defiant .
" you know that you can not do anything .
the era of bullying is over , " he said of the west 's determination to prevent iran from acquiring nuclear fuel technology that can also be used to make the fissile core of a nuclear bomb . iranian fm says resolution removes possible of further diplomacy foreign minister manouchehr mottaki meanwhile confirmed iran had laid down the gauntlet with immediate retaliation .
" all voluntary measures taken over the past two-and-a-half or three years have been halted and we have no further commitment to the additional protocol and other voluntary commitments , " he told a news conference . " this resolution has no legal basis .
all it does is simply remove the opportunity for voluntary cooperation between iran and the agency . " the additional protocol to the non-proliferation treaty hands the iaea stronger inspection powers and is central to the un watchdog 's now three-year-old effort to determine what iran is actually up to . mottaki did not specify what other steps had already been taken , but iran 's voluntary measures had notably included a freeze on uranium enrichment . iran says it only wants to enrich uranium to make reactor fuel .
it prompted the latest crisis by resuming uranium conversion activities last august and enrichment research on january 10 . us president george w. bush , however , said the text " is not the end of diplomacy or the iaea 's role " and merely the " beginning of an intensified diplomatic effort . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president george w. bush says diplomacy is still alive but an atomic iran will not be allowed .
" this important step sends a clear message to the regime in iran that the world will not permit the iranian regime to gain nuclear weapons , " bush said . russia favored by iran as negotiator although iranian retaliation is set to worsen tensions , the islamic regime also signaled it was ready to press on with negotiations with russia - which now has a one month window to talk with tehran before the security council actually takes up the matter . moscow 's proposal is for enrichment to be carried out on russian soil in order to allay proliferation concerns whilst at the same time allowing iran to have nuclear fuel for civilian purposes . " the second round of talks will go ahead , but the russian proposal must be adapted to the new situation so that we can examine it , " foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi told reporters . the two sides are scheduled to meet in moscow on february 16 , with russia keen to reach a negotiated settlement and guard its economic interests - which include a one-billion dollar deal to build iran 's first reactor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian defence minister sergei ivanov hopes iran will consider his country 's proposals .
" i am sure that the iranian leadership will look with all seriousness at russia 's proposal , " russian defense minister sergei ivanov said .
" this suggestion is the best way out of the situation . " widespread international pressure for iran to comply iran is under massive pressure from elsewhere to comply with the iaea 's demands to return to a moratorium on fuel cycle work , show better cooperation with iaea inspectors and return to negotiations . in the iaea vote , 27 countries including the un security council 's permanent five - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - voted in favor and five abstained .
iran 's only support came from cuba , syria and venezuela . japan also said the resolution was " a clear message to iran " , and called on the tehran to " take this resolution seriously and respond to it sincerely . " " iran has still a crucial opportunity between now and the march iaea board to comply , " said british foreign secretary jack straw .

" terrorism , the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , failing states - these are the scourges of our times , " german defense minister franz josef jung told the conference . " the old nato as a purely defensive alliance is history , " he added . us defense secretary donald rumsfeld thanked merkel for her " thoughtful and important remarks on nato " in his own conference speech devoted to islamic militancy . " the competences that exist within nato can be used to advantage in other parts of the world , " rumsfeld said . the us defense chief praised the alliance 's deployment in afghanistan after the fall of the taliban regime and in giving humanitarian assistance to pakistan after a massive earthquake last year . but nato 's potential was being held back by insufficient defense spending in members of the alliance , rumsfeld said . the united states was spending 3.7 percent of its gdp on defense but other nato members were spending far less , he said .

" french disagree and promote stronger eu forces bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of the european union 's growing military strength oppose the nato expansion ideas .
french defense minister michele alliot-marie took a more skeptical view on nato 's role and stressed the importance of the european union 's growing security capability , reflecting widespread concerns in france that a stronger nato would mean a weaker eu . " let 's take care ... not to spill into areas where the competence of other organizations is more suitable .
let 's not waste our financial means , which are vital for fighting crises and upgrading our equipment , " alliot-marie said . nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer , however , supported " pragmatic " cooperation between nato and the european union and sought to calm french fears . nato is no global cop says de hoop scheffer " nato is not a global policeman , " he said .
among the new global threats that nato could help combat , de hoop scheffer mentioned the protection of energy supply lines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer does not want the alliance to act as the world police .
" for reasons that are obvious - including the potential of terrorists targeting our energy supplies - it makes sense to me that the allies should discuss this issue , " he said . supplies of russian gas to ukraine and georgia have recently been disrupted . heads of state , government ministers , top defense officials and security experts gathered in a heavily-guarded five star hotel for the conference , entitled " restoring the transatlantic partnership .

six years after the end of world war ii , large parts of the city still lay in ruins .
reconstruction had begun , but berlin was still far removed from the pulsating metropolis it once had been in the 1920s . still the berlinale did manage to inject some much-needed excitement and flamboyance into postwar berlin .
ever since american cult actress joan fontaine , who starred in " rebecca , " glided down the red carpet at the first berlinale , the film festival rapidly established itself in the 1950s as an international meeting point for the stars of world cinema . it was n't just hollywood , but also celebrities from other big cinema nations and studios in germany , such as sophia lauren , errol flynn , hans albers and hildegard knef , who graced the berlinale .
the film festival became a byword for glamour and fashion . artsy and intellectual in the 1960s , it was n't just divas and hollywood celebrities making the headlines at the berlinale . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french director jean-luc godard the film festival transformed itself into a hub for artsy and intelligent cinema with directors like jean-luc godard and francois truffaut presenting their works in berlin . in the politically-laden 1970s , the reverberations of the 1968 student revolts and the vietnam war made an impact on the berlinale too .

" you have to speak their language and i think you have to have a certain passion for that .

" asian filmmakers have something exciting to offer at the moment .
one of the new things is a contemporary korean film , it 's about relations between north and south korea , " de hadeln said .
" it 's a film that would not have been made two or three years ago in korea . " a political festival at heart indeed , the berlinale has long been a political festival . in the 1970s and 80s in particular , it was a platform for eastern european filmmakers .
many films from the soviet union or from east germany , which were controversial at home , celebrated their international premieres at the berlinale . and , last year the film festival embraced another continent , which had never before been among the victors - the film " carmen khayelitsha " by south african mark dornford-may picked up the coveted golden bear . jochen kürten -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlinale strikes a serious note the berlin international film festival , which opens on feb .

9 , deutsche welle takes a look back at the turbulent and glamour-filled history of the festival and its founding amid a war-ravaged germany . when the 56th edition of the berlinale gets underway on feb .
9 , stars , journalists , paparazzi and film producers will throng the glitzy potsdamer platz in downtown berlin , where most of the action takes place . the buzz and hoopla wo n't be that different from the first berlinale , which took place on june 6 , 1951 .
but the background certainly will be . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the official poster for the first berlinale in 1951 the first berlinale , which opened with alfred hitchcock 's " rebecca , " took place against a bleak backdrop of a bombed-out german capital .
six years after the end of world war ii , large parts of the city still lay in ruins .
reconstruction had begun , but berlin was still far removed from the pulsating metropolis it once had been in the 1920s . still the berlinale did manage to inject some much-needed excitement and flamboyance into postwar berlin .
ever since american cult actress joan fontaine , who starred in " rebecca , " glided down the red carpet at the first berlinale , the film festival rapidly established itself in the 1950s as an international meeting point for the stars of world cinema . it was n't just hollywood , but also celebrities from other big cinema nations and studios in germany , such as sophia lauren , errol flynn , hans albers and hildegard knef , who graced the berlinale .
the film festival became a byword for glamour and fashion . artsy and intellectual in the 1960s , it was n't just divas and hollywood celebrities making the headlines at the berlinale . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french director jean-luc godard the film festival transformed itself into a hub for artsy and intelligent cinema with directors like jean-luc godard and francois truffaut presenting their works in berlin . in the politically-laden 1970s , the reverberations of the 1968 student revolts and the vietnam war made an impact on the berlinale too .
the festival witnessed angry protests against the us-critical film " o.k. " by german director michael verhoeven . following a few more turbulent years , the berlin film festival underwent a further change with the emergence of the " forum " section in addition to its mainstay , " competion " category which ends in the ceremonial awarding of the golden and silver bears . the " forum " section provided a showcase in particular for documentary and experimental films .
it also offered a platform for films from countries , which until then had never been in the spotlight of international cinema . for ulrich gregor , longtime former head of the section , the new developments finally completed the berlinale 's claim to be a showcase for international cinema by including all forms and genres . " it included the whole spectrum - right from hollywood films to independent ones from various countries , europe and also non-european nations right to documentaries and other experimental forms , " gregor said . boost for german films bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the coveted golden and silver bears however , the " competition " category has remained the centerpiece of the berlinale with hits such as " la notte " by michelangelo antonioni or " hong gaoliang " by zhang yimou being premiered here .

nine-year-old mahjoub jemili 's complexion may not fit the stereotype , but his thick regional accent certainly bears it up . mahjoub the first has already faced one of the biggest tests of his reign as the children 's prince of wesseling .
he addressed cologne cardinal joachim meissner , which had invited wesseling 's carnival society to coffee .
and he was a success .
" he did his job very well .
and his command of the cologne dialect is a huge achievement , " remarked meissner .
" i ca n't do it at all .
when i try people just laugh - justifiably so . " nevertheless , the children 's prince bestowed his very own carnival medal on the cardinal .
the medal was decorated with his title , wesseling 's coat of arms , a soccer ball and a camel , in reference to his favorite hobby and his origin . born in the rhineland , the boy speaks fluent german in the dialect of the cologne area .
his dialect is so thick that many a german from beyond the rhine would n't understand him . it was work which brought jemili 's grandparents to wesseling , south of cologne , in 1970 , decades before mahjoub was born .
mahjoub is the third generation of wesselingers , after his parents , lamia and foued .
years of carnival-going though born in tunisia , mahjoub 's mother identifies more strongly with germany than with her country of birth , and she sees the choice of mahjoub as carnival prince as an example of successful integration .

nine-year-old mahjoub jemili 's complexion may not fit the stereotype , but his thick regional accent certainly bears it up . mahjoub the first has already faced one of the biggest tests of his reign as the children 's prince of wesseling .
he addressed cologne cardinal joachim meissner , which had invited wesseling 's carnival society to coffee .
and he was a success .
" he did his job very well .
and his command of the cologne dialect is a huge achievement , " remarked meissner .
" i ca n't do it at all .
when i try people just laugh - justifiably so . " nevertheless , the children 's prince bestowed his very own carnival medal on the cardinal .
the medal was decorated with his title , wesseling 's coat of arms , a soccer ball and a camel , in reference to his favorite hobby and his origin . born in the rhineland , the boy speaks fluent german in the dialect of the cologne area .
his dialect is so thick that many a german from beyond the rhine would n't understand him . it was work which brought jemili 's grandparents to wesseling , south of cologne , in 1970 , decades before mahjoub was born .
mahjoub is the third generation of wesselingers , after his parents , lamia and foued .
years of carnival-going though born in tunisia , mahjoub 's mother identifies more strongly with germany than with her country of birth , and she sees the choice of mahjoub as carnival prince as an example of successful integration .
but she and her husband were still a bit nervous when they got the news .

at a meeting of senior citizens , when the boy 's name was called out - ' here comes the children 's price mahjoub i ' - they did n't know what to make of it .
and then they saw the boy , " recalled lamia jemili .
" but once he was on stage and said the first word in cologne dialect , and then his speech .
the people turned around and said , ' is that your son ?
that 's great ' ! " mahjoub is already well-seasoned when it comes to carnival .
like many rhineland kids , he 's celebrated the event every year since he can remember - the first time at the age of eight months .
the jemilis have always been part of the wessling 's carnival society .

but the background certainly will be . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the official poster for the first berlinale in 1951 the first berlinale , which opened with alfred hitchcock 's " rebecca , " took place against a bleak backdrop of a bombed-out german capital .
six years after the end of world war ii , large parts of the city still lay in ruins .
reconstruction had begun , but berlin was still far removed from the pulsating metropolis it once had been in the 1920s . still the berlinale did manage to inject some much-needed excitement and flamboyance into postwar berlin .
ever since american cult actress joan fontaine , who starred in " rebecca , " glided down the red carpet at the first berlinale , the film festival rapidly established itself in the 1950s as an international meeting point for the stars of world cinema . it was n't just hollywood , but also celebrities from other big cinema nations and studios in germany , such as sophia lauren , errol flynn , hans albers and hildegard knef , who graced the berlinale .
the film festival became a byword for glamour and fashion . artsy and intellectual in the 1960s , it was n't just divas and hollywood celebrities making the headlines at the berlinale . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french director jean-luc godard the film festival transformed itself into a hub for artsy and intelligent cinema with directors like jean-luc godard and francois truffaut presenting their works in berlin . in the politically-laden 1970s , the reverberations of the 1968 student revolts and the vietnam war made an impact on the berlinale too .
the festival witnessed angry protests against the us-critical film " o.k. " by german director michael verhoeven . following a few more turbulent years , the berlin film festival underwent a further change with the emergence of the " forum " section in addition to its mainstay , " competion " category which ends in the ceremonial awarding of the golden and silver bears . the " forum " section provided a showcase in particular for documentary and experimental films .
it also offered a platform for films from countries , which until then had never been in the spotlight of international cinema . for ulrich gregor , longtime former head of the section , the new developments finally completed the berlinale 's claim to be a showcase for international cinema by including all forms and genres . " it included the whole spectrum - right from hollywood films to independent ones from various countries , europe and also non-european nations right to documentaries and other experimental forms , " gregor said . boost for german films bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the coveted golden and silver bears however , the " competition " category has remained the centerpiece of the berlinale with hits such as " la notte " by michelangelo antonioni or " hong gaoliang " by zhang yimou being premiered here .
it 's this section that has also traditionally drawn the stars , given the prestige attached to winning the golden and silver bears . current berlinale director dieter kosslick has ensured that the section continues to take center stage at the festival . " what we do is also cultivate a so-called connections business , where you really have to know a lot of people and where you have to understand them , " kosslick said .
" you have to speak their language and i think you have to have a certain passion for that . " part of kosslick 's passion in the past years has also been the focus on homegrown cinema - something that was ignored by his predecessor moritz de hadeln for a long time . for a few years now , german films have been and have been prominently visible in several categories at the berlinale . heinz badewitz , head of the " perspective german cinema " section , says the international movers and shakers in the movie business also come to germany to watch and potentially buy homegrown entries . " our target group includes international buyers and festival directors from the whole world who come here to see the latest in german film in a compact manner , " badewitz said . asian cinema in the spotlight another relatively new development at the berlinale in the past decade has been the increasing presence of films from asian countries .
movies from china , taiwan , korea and vietnam have celebrated huge successes at the film festival in recent years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from taiwanese film " the wayward cloud " by tsai ming liang moritz de hadeln , the previous berlinale director , who also encouraged asian cinema during his term , says political films in particular find a deep resonance in berlin , which was long politically and physically divided itself . " asian filmmakers have something exciting to offer at the moment .
one of the new things is a contemporary korean film , it 's about relations between north and south korea , " de hadeln said .
" it 's a film that would not have been made two or three years ago in korea . " a political festival at heart indeed , the berlinale has long been a political festival . in the 1970s and 80s in particular , it was a platform for eastern european filmmakers .
many films from the soviet union or from east germany , which were controversial at home , celebrated their international premieres at the berlinale . and , last year the film festival embraced another continent , which had never before been among the victors - the film " carmen khayelitsha " by south african mark dornford-may picked up the coveted golden bear . jochen kürten -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlinale strikes a serious note the berlin international film festival , which opens on feb .

" you can issue as many resolutions as you like and have fun with it , but you can not prevent iran 's progress , " said the hard-line president , who has steered his country on a collision course with the west since his shock election win last june . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad remains defiant .
" you know that you can not do anything .
the era of bullying is over , " he said of the west 's determination to prevent iran from acquiring nuclear fuel technology that can also be used to make the fissile core of a nuclear bomb . iranian fm says resolution removes possible of further diplomacy foreign minister manouchehr mottaki meanwhile confirmed iran had laid down the gauntlet with immediate retaliation .
" all voluntary measures taken over the past two-and-a-half or three years have been halted and we have no further commitment to the additional protocol and other voluntary commitments , " he told a news conference . " this resolution has no legal basis .
all it does is simply remove the opportunity for voluntary cooperation between iran and the agency . " the additional protocol to the non-proliferation treaty hands the iaea stronger inspection powers and is central to the un watchdog 's now three-year-old effort to determine what iran is actually up to . mottaki did not specify what other steps had already been taken , but iran 's voluntary measures had notably included a freeze on uranium enrichment . iran says it only wants to enrich uranium to make reactor fuel .

" the second round of talks will go ahead , but the russian proposal must be adapted to the new situation so that we can examine it , " foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi told reporters . the two sides are scheduled to meet in moscow on february 16 , with russia keen to reach a negotiated settlement and guard its economic interests - which include a one-billion dollar deal to build iran 's first reactor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian defence minister sergei ivanov hopes iran will consider his country 's proposals .
" i am sure that the iranian leadership will look with all seriousness at russia 's proposal , " russian defense minister sergei ivanov said .
" this suggestion is the best way out of the situation .

iran 's only support came from cuba , syria and venezuela . japan also said the resolution was " a clear message to iran " , and called on the tehran to " take this resolution seriously and respond to it sincerely .

" you can issue as many resolutions as you like and have fun with it , but you can not prevent iran 's progress , " said the hard-line president , who has steered his country on a collision course with the west since his shock election win last june . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad remains defiant .
" you know that you can not do anything .
the era of bullying is over , " he said of the west 's determination to prevent iran from acquiring nuclear fuel technology that can also be used to make the fissile core of a nuclear bomb . iranian fm says resolution removes possible of further diplomacy foreign minister manouchehr mottaki meanwhile confirmed iran had laid down the gauntlet with immediate retaliation .
" all voluntary measures taken over the past two-and-a-half or three years have been halted and we have no further commitment to the additional protocol and other voluntary commitments , " he told a news conference . " this resolution has no legal basis .
all it does is simply remove the opportunity for voluntary cooperation between iran and the agency . " the additional protocol to the non-proliferation treaty hands the iaea stronger inspection powers and is central to the un watchdog 's now three-year-old effort to determine what iran is actually up to . mottaki did not specify what other steps had already been taken , but iran 's voluntary measures had notably included a freeze on uranium enrichment . iran says it only wants to enrich uranium to make reactor fuel .
it prompted the latest crisis by resuming uranium conversion activities last august and enrichment research on january 10 . us president george w. bush , however , said the text " is not the end of diplomacy or the iaea 's role " and merely the " beginning of an intensified diplomatic effort . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president george w. bush says diplomacy is still alive but an atomic iran will not be allowed .
" this important step sends a clear message to the regime in iran that the world will not permit the iranian regime to gain nuclear weapons , " bush said . russia favored by iran as negotiator although iranian retaliation is set to worsen tensions , the islamic regime also signaled it was ready to press on with negotiations with russia - which now has a one month window to talk with tehran before the security council actually takes up the matter . moscow 's proposal is for enrichment to be carried out on russian soil in order to allay proliferation concerns whilst at the same time allowing iran to have nuclear fuel for civilian purposes . " the second round of talks will go ahead , but the russian proposal must be adapted to the new situation so that we can examine it , " foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi told reporters . the two sides are scheduled to meet in moscow on february 16 , with russia keen to reach a negotiated settlement and guard its economic interests - which include a one-billion dollar deal to build iran 's first reactor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian defence minister sergei ivanov hopes iran will consider his country 's proposals .
" i am sure that the iranian leadership will look with all seriousness at russia 's proposal , " russian defense minister sergei ivanov said .
" this suggestion is the best way out of the situation . " widespread international pressure for iran to comply iran is under massive pressure from elsewhere to comply with the iaea 's demands to return to a moratorium on fuel cycle work , show better cooperation with iaea inspectors and return to negotiations . in the iaea vote , 27 countries including the un security council 's permanent five - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - voted in favor and five abstained .
iran 's only support came from cuba , syria and venezuela . japan also said the resolution was " a clear message to iran " , and called on the tehran to " take this resolution seriously and respond to it sincerely . " " iran has still a crucial opportunity between now and the march iaea board to comply , " said british foreign secretary jack straw .

now one swiss resort has come up with a novel way to try to ensure that guests leave the slopes as they arrived - in one piece . across europe 's alps , the winter ski season is in full swing .
thousands of holiday makers are already enjoying almost perfect snow conditions , while thousands more are packing their skis and getting ready to go . but at the hugely popular swiss resort of grindelwald , located 75 km -lrb- 50 miles -rrb- from the swiss capital bern , not everybody has the time to enjoy the scenery . " we have to be prepared to go out and get the injured , " said martin mathys of the grindelwald mountain rescue service . " with the speed , of course , we have a problem .
the equipment is always getting better , you can ski faster , and then you have also the head injuries , " he said . chasing the wind bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's a mad , mad world : where cows can fly and skiiers get pulled over with today 's modern carving skis , skiers can reach 80 kilometers an hour .
losing one 's balance at that speed , let alone crashing into somebody else , can really put a dramatic twist on an otherwise wonderful winter vacation . " speed is the big danger factor , but it 's not just speed , it 's also the way people ski , " said paul gunter , who is head of the emergency ward at the local hospital . " they make turns where they really do use the whole width of the slope , and that leads to collisions .
we 're seeing injuries now that are more like what you see in car accidents - head injuries , and back injuries , " gunter said . staying on the safe side bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hardcore skiing aficionados can even cause traffic jams the rising number of accidents is making some skiers stay away - even the keen ones .
that 's not a good development for a resort like grindelwald , which has attracted tourists since the 17th century .
so , local officials have come up with a novel solution to decrease the number of visitors leaving grindelwald overdosed on painkillers and wearing a cast . " we were asking people on the slopes , how do you feel , and a lot of people , especially families , said i just do n't feel safe because there are so many fast skiers around me , " benny kaufmann of the grindelwald tourism organization explained . " and then we thought we 'd make a new slope , with speed limits , and people will feel safer , " kaufmann said . speed patrols the new 30 km an hour slope has an electronic monitor to check the skiers ' speed , and patrols who pull them over if they break the limit .
the fast and the furious do n't get fined , but asked to move to a faster slope .
the idea has already found favor with holiday makers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enjoy the view - hopefully not through a hospital window " i think it 's excellent , " said a grindelwald skier .
" it 's quite intimidating when you 're coming down and you hear snowboarders especially rushing behind you .
you think , oh , which way are they going ?
so i 'm all in favor of it . " the speed limits are n't designed to spoil the fun : quite the opposite , they are there to ensure that every skier , regardless of their skill level , has fun while making sure everybody stays as safe as possible . so , if you 're heading to the alps this winter , and you 're not intentionally trying to break some part of your body , you should try to follow the advice your mother would give you : do n't ski too fast , do n't ski above your ability , and wear a helmet .

" " we want to prevent and we must prevent iran from developing nuclear weapons , " merkel said in her speech .
" the concerns and fears over iran 's nuclear program are legitimate . " the un 's nuclear watchdog , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , voted on saturday to report iran to the un security council , paving the way to possible sanctions over its atomic program . iran retaliated by saying it would begin full-scale uranium enrichment and limit inspections by iaea officials . merkel said iran still had a chance to avoid the sanctions by accepting a russian proposal to allow iranian uranium enrichment to take place in russia , which would prevent tehran from mastering sensitive nuclear technology . she called on iran to consider the compromise as a " window of opportunity . " merkel alludes to nazi rise in speech on iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad said israel should be moved to europe and questioned whether the holocaust took place .
the german leader had strong words for iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who has called for israel to be " wiped off the map " and has branded the holocaust a " myth . " " a president who denies the existence of israel and the holocaust can not expect to receive any tolerance from germany , " merkel said . she compared ahmadinejad 's statements to when adolf hitler came to power and began threatening to exterminate european jews .
" remember that in 1933 many people said it was just rhetoric , " merkel said . the international community " must fight these beginnings now , " she said . rumsfeld tell conference iran is a global threat rumsfeld told the 300 high-level delegates at the conference that iran was a genuine threat to global peace .
" the iranian regime is today the world 's leading state sponsor of terrorism , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests have turned increasingly violent over the past few days .
" the world does not want , and must work together to prevent , a nuclear iran , " he added , urging the global powers to unite and find a diplomatic solution to halt iran 's nuclear program . in tehran , rumsfeld 's iranian counterpart mostafa mohammad najjar said in response that the leaders of the united states were " terrorists " who represented the " real axis of evil . " iran insists it is developing a peaceful atomic energy program , but the western world suspects it is planning to build nuclear weapons . responding to merkel 's speech and speaking before the iaea decision , iran 's deputy foreign minister for legal and international affairs , abbas araghchi , said that referral to the security council would not lead the islamic republic to halt its nuclear activities . araghchi blames europe for failure of diplomacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abbas araghchi blamed the eu-3 for the collapse of talks .
" if the case is sent or even reported to the un security council , based on the law of our parliament , our government has no way of stopping nuclear activities , " araghchi said during merkel 's question and answer session . he blamed the three eu nations - britain , france and germany - which have negotiated with tehran over its nuclear ambitions , for creating the conflict . " we did whatever we could .
but as you know after three years of negotiations we left empty-handed , " araghchi said . merkel brushed off his statement , saying that iran " should consider amending its laws " and adding that she would have liked to hear him comment on his president 's denial of israel 's existence .
" that was missing , " merkel said . the three-day munich conference concludes on sunday when russia 's influential defense minister sergei ivanov will be the main speaker . more than 1,700 people demonstrated in central munich against the conference , police said . the protest , organized by left-wing and pacifist groups , featured placards demanding : " we want disarmament , not job losses " and " stop the warmongers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.02.2006 germany 's islamic leaders call for release of iraq hostages großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamic leaders have condemned the kidnappers for bringing islam into disrupte german islamic leaders urged for the kidnappers of two german hostages in iraq to release the men as the us military announced sunday that a new batch of iraq detainees had been freed . germany 's largest islamic groups issued urgent appeals for the release of the two german hostages on sunday . " let the hostages go immediately , " the chairman of the islamic council for germany , ali kizilkaya , wrote in the bild am sonntag newspaper . " it is regrettable that religion is being abused once again and all of islam is brought into disrepute .
our thoughts are with the families of the two hostages . " the deputy general secretary of the islamic group milli gorus , mustafa yeneroglu , said bräunlich and nitzschke , had gone to iraq to assist its people . " the fact that two people have been kidnapped who have helped iraq economically with their work demonstrates how absurd this act is , " he said . the president of the turkish-german muslim organization ditib , ridvan cakir , said the kidnapping marked a clear violation of the tenets of islam . " i call on the kidnappers to let the two germans go at once , " he said . and the chairman of the central council of muslims in germany , nadeem elyas , said that in light of berlin 's fierce opposition to the us-led iraq war in 2003 , the german engineers should be seen as innocent bystanders . " there is no logic in the world that could justify the kidnapping .
the german people are linked to the iraqi people in friendship - after all it was the german government that opposed the iraq war at the time , " he said in a statement . the fate of german engineers rene bräunlich and thomas nitzschke remained uncertain . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier meanwhile used al jazeera friday to issue a new appeal for the release of the two engineers . " german chancellor angela merkel and myself call upon you , on behalf of all germans , to release the two hostages without subjecting them to any pain , " steinmeier said . bräunlich and nitzschke , who work for german gas equipment installation company cryotec , were abducted near a key oil refinery in the northern town of baiji on january 24 by armed men in military uniform . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gate of baiji plant where iraqi insurgents kidnapped the two german engineers their kidnappers threatened on tuesday to kill them unless berlin cut all links with baghdad within 72 hours . president horst köhler said on friday he was " very concerned " by the kidnapping .
a foreign ministry spokesman described the situation as " extremely serious " . amid growing concern at home , he said germany was making all possible efforts to ensure the release of the two men but declined to " comment on or interpret the kidnappers ' ultimatum " . more detainee releases seen as leverage in hostage crisis iraq on sunday freed more than 50 male prisoners but held back female detainees as the fate of us and german hostages remained unknown amid a tight security clampdown for the main shiite festival .
the us military said it had released 50 male detainees , but later the iraqi government said 53 prisoners were freed .
" there was no female detainee release today , " the spokesman for the us detention facility in iraq told reporters .
" today 's release was done after a review by the joint board and at this stage i can not offer any other details . it is believed the us military release of the detainees was an attempt to gain some leverage in the kidnappings of bräunlich and nitzschke and us reporter jill carroll . last month , iraq released more than 400 detainees , including five women , in a move widely seen as a response to demands from the kidnappers of carroll for the freeing of all female prisoners in iraq . both us and iraqi spokesmen strongly denied any link at the time . shortly after those releases , a new videotape from the kidnappers was broadcast by al jazeera in which they broadened their demand to include all detainees , male or female . " the journalist called on her family , her colleagues and americans throughout the world to ask the us military authorities and the iraqi interior ministry to free all iraqi prisoners , saying this could contribute to her release , " the channel 's presenter said . us reporter still missing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emergency teams in and outside iraq are working to find and free the hostages .

" let the hostages go immediately , " the chairman of the islamic council for germany , ali kizilkaya , wrote in the bild am sonntag newspaper . " it is regrettable that religion is being abused once again and all of islam is brought into disrepute .
our thoughts are with the families of the two hostages . " the deputy general secretary of the islamic group milli gorus , mustafa yeneroglu , said bräunlich and nitzschke , had gone to iraq to assist its people . " the fact that two people have been kidnapped who have helped iraq economically with their work demonstrates how absurd this act is , " he said . the president of the turkish-german muslim organization ditib , ridvan cakir , said the kidnapping marked a clear violation of the tenets of islam . " i call on the kidnappers to let the two germans go at once , " he said . and the chairman of the central council of muslims in germany , nadeem elyas , said that in light of berlin 's fierce opposition to the us-led iraq war in 2003 , the german engineers should be seen as innocent bystanders . " there is no logic in the world that could justify the kidnapping .
the german people are linked to the iraqi people in friendship - after all it was the german government that opposed the iraq war at the time , " he said in a statement . the fate of german engineers rene bräunlich and thomas nitzschke remained uncertain . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier meanwhile used al jazeera friday to issue a new appeal for the release of the two engineers . " german chancellor angela merkel and myself call upon you , on behalf of all germans , to release the two hostages without subjecting them to any pain , " steinmeier said . bräunlich and nitzschke , who work for german gas equipment installation company cryotec , were abducted near a key oil refinery in the northern town of baiji on january 24 by armed men in military uniform . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gate of baiji plant where iraqi insurgents kidnapped the two german engineers their kidnappers threatened on tuesday to kill them unless berlin cut all links with baghdad within 72 hours . president horst köhler said on friday he was " very concerned " by the kidnapping .
a foreign ministry spokesman described the situation as " extremely serious " . amid growing concern at home , he said germany was making all possible efforts to ensure the release of the two men but declined to " comment on or interpret the kidnappers ' ultimatum " . more detainee releases seen as leverage in hostage crisis iraq on sunday freed more than 50 male prisoners but held back female detainees as the fate of us and german hostages remained unknown amid a tight security clampdown for the main shiite festival .
the us military said it had released 50 male detainees , but later the iraqi government said 53 prisoners were freed .
" there was no female detainee release today , " the spokesman for the us detention facility in iraq told reporters .
" today 's release was done after a review by the joint board and at this stage i can not offer any other details . it is believed the us military release of the detainees was an attempt to gain some leverage in the kidnappings of bräunlich and nitzschke and us reporter jill carroll . last month , iraq released more than 400 detainees , including five women , in a move widely seen as a response to demands from the kidnappers of carroll for the freeing of all female prisoners in iraq . both us and iraqi spokesmen strongly denied any link at the time . shortly after those releases , a new videotape from the kidnappers was broadcast by al jazeera in which they broadened their demand to include all detainees , male or female . " the journalist called on her family , her colleagues and americans throughout the world to ask the us military authorities and the iraqi interior ministry to free all iraqi prisoners , saying this could contribute to her release , " the channel 's presenter said . us reporter still missing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emergency teams in and outside iraq are working to find and free the hostages .
carroll , who was working for the christian science monitor , was abducted in baghdad on january 7 by a group calling itself the brigades of vengeance as she traveled to a meeting with a leading sunni arab politician . " we have no new information on the hostage , " a us military spokesman said referring to carroll . the three hostages are among nearly 250 foreigners kidnapped in iraq since the march 2003 invasion .
many of them have been killed . the fate of two kenyan telecommunications engineers abducted last month and two iraqi television journalists seized wednesday also remained unknown . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de video shows german hostages alive a video of the two german engineers kidnapped in northern iraq was broadcast by al jazeera on friday .

nine-year-old mahjoub jemili 's complexion may not fit the stereotype , but his thick regional accent certainly bears it up . mahjoub the first has already faced one of the biggest tests of his reign as the children 's prince of wesseling .
he addressed cologne cardinal joachim meissner , which had invited wesseling 's carnival society to coffee .
and he was a success .
" he did his job very well .
and his command of the cologne dialect is a huge achievement , " remarked meissner .
" i ca n't do it at all .
when i try people just laugh - justifiably so . " nevertheless , the children 's prince bestowed his very own carnival medal on the cardinal .
the medal was decorated with his title , wesseling 's coat of arms , a soccer ball and a camel , in reference to his favorite hobby and his origin . born in the rhineland , the boy speaks fluent german in the dialect of the cologne area .
his dialect is so thick that many a german from beyond the rhine would n't understand him . it was work which brought jemili 's grandparents to wesseling , south of cologne , in 1970 , decades before mahjoub was born .
mahjoub is the third generation of wesselingers , after his parents , lamia and foued .
years of carnival-going though born in tunisia , mahjoub 's mother identifies more strongly with germany than with her country of birth , and she sees the choice of mahjoub as carnival prince as an example of successful integration .
but she and her husband were still a bit nervous when they got the news .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rhineland carnival reaches its apogee in late february this year " we were a little concerned and thought , ' what will happen when the boy goes on stage ?
will people accept it ? '
at a meeting of senior citizens , when the boy 's name was called out - ' here comes the children 's price mahjoub i ' - they did n't know what to make of it .
and then they saw the boy , " recalled lamia jemili .
" but once he was on stage and said the first word in cologne dialect , and then his speech .
the people turned around and said , ' is that your son ?
that 's great ' ! " mahjoub is already well-seasoned when it comes to carnival .
like many rhineland kids , he 's celebrated the event every year since he can remember - the first time at the age of eight months .
the jemilis have always been part of the wessling 's carnival society .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mahjoub , like other rhineland kids , started celebrating carnival at a young age " in my eyes , you have to want to be integrated , " said lamia jemili .
" and i say over and over again : language is essential .
if we had n't had our surroundings , were n't so linguistically able , if we had n't really had the will to become part of the wesseling community , it would n't have been possible at all . talk of integration goes over mahjoub 's head .
he just likes to be carnival prince , and he 's good at it .
despite his living the life of a german boy , though mahjoub remains conscious of his roots and visits his extended family in tunisia each year . anne passow -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cologne 's carnival-goers get roaring stereotypes may portray germans as being punctual , practical and lacking in humor , but they clearly overlook german carnival-goers .

" terrorism , the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , failing states - these are the scourges of our times , " german defense minister franz josef jung told the conference . " the old nato as a purely defensive alliance is history , " he added . us defense secretary donald rumsfeld thanked merkel for her " thoughtful and important remarks on nato " in his own conference speech devoted to islamic militancy . " the competences that exist within nato can be used to advantage in other parts of the world , " rumsfeld said . the us defense chief praised the alliance 's deployment in afghanistan after the fall of the taliban regime and in giving humanitarian assistance to pakistan after a massive earthquake last year . but nato 's potential was being held back by insufficient defense spending in members of the alliance , rumsfeld said . the united states was spending 3.7 percent of its gdp on defense but other nato members were spending far less , he said . " unless we invest in defense and security , the reality is that our homelands can be at risk . " french disagree and promote stronger eu forces bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of the european union 's growing military strength oppose the nato expansion ideas .
french defense minister michele alliot-marie took a more skeptical view on nato 's role and stressed the importance of the european union 's growing security capability , reflecting widespread concerns in france that a stronger nato would mean a weaker eu .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 05.02.2006 ski patrols curbing the fast and the furious großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everybody can get to the bottom of the slope in one piece skiing has become an increasingly dangerous sport .
now one swiss resort has come up with a novel way to try to ensure that guests leave the slopes as they arrived - in one piece . across europe 's alps , the winter ski season is in full swing .
thousands of holiday makers are already enjoying almost perfect snow conditions , while thousands more are packing their skis and getting ready to go . but at the hugely popular swiss resort of grindelwald , located 75 km -lrb- 50 miles -rrb- from the swiss capital bern , not everybody has the time to enjoy the scenery . " we have to be prepared to go out and get the injured , " said martin mathys of the grindelwald mountain rescue service . " with the speed , of course , we have a problem .
the equipment is always getting better , you can ski faster , and then you have also the head injuries , " he said . chasing the wind bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's a mad , mad world : where cows can fly and skiiers get pulled over with today 's modern carving skis , skiers can reach 80 kilometers an hour .
losing one 's balance at that speed , let alone crashing into somebody else , can really put a dramatic twist on an otherwise wonderful winter vacation . " speed is the big danger factor , but it 's not just speed , it 's also the way people ski , " said paul gunter , who is head of the emergency ward at the local hospital . " they make turns where they really do use the whole width of the slope , and that leads to collisions .
we 're seeing injuries now that are more like what you see in car accidents - head injuries , and back injuries , " gunter said . staying on the safe side bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hardcore skiing aficionados can even cause traffic jams the rising number of accidents is making some skiers stay away - even the keen ones .
that 's not a good development for a resort like grindelwald , which has attracted tourists since the 17th century .
so , local officials have come up with a novel solution to decrease the number of visitors leaving grindelwald overdosed on painkillers and wearing a cast . " we were asking people on the slopes , how do you feel , and a lot of people , especially families , said i just do n't feel safe because there are so many fast skiers around me , " benny kaufmann of the grindelwald tourism organization explained . " and then we thought we 'd make a new slope , with speed limits , and people will feel safer , " kaufmann said . speed patrols the new 30 km an hour slope has an electronic monitor to check the skiers ' speed , and patrols who pull them over if they break the limit .
the fast and the furious do n't get fined , but asked to move to a faster slope .
the idea has already found favor with holiday makers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enjoy the view - hopefully not through a hospital window " i think it 's excellent , " said a grindelwald skier .
" it 's quite intimidating when you 're coming down and you hear snowboarders especially rushing behind you .
you think , oh , which way are they going ?
so i 'm all in favor of it . " the speed limits are n't designed to spoil the fun : quite the opposite , they are there to ensure that every skier , regardless of their skill level , has fun while making sure everybody stays as safe as possible . so , if you 're heading to the alps this winter , and you 're not intentionally trying to break some part of your body , you should try to follow the advice your mother would give you : do n't ski too fast , do n't ski above your ability , and wear a helmet .
if you do that , and with just a bit of luck , your après ski will be spent , not in hospital , but outside - glass of mulled wine in hand - watching the sun set over the alps . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de strings and skis in bavaria 's living picture book nestled in the bavarian alps , this picturesque town was for years one of the best kept secrets among ski travellers .

let 's not waste our financial means , which are vital for fighting crises and upgrading our equipment , " alliot-marie said . nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer , however , supported " pragmatic " cooperation between nato and the european union and sought to calm french fears . nato is no global cop says de hoop scheffer " nato is not a global policeman , " he said .
among the new global threats that nato could help combat , de hoop scheffer mentioned the protection of energy supply lines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer does not want the alliance to act as the world police .
" for reasons that are obvious - including the potential of terrorists targeting our energy supplies - it makes sense to me that the allies should discuss this issue , " he said . supplies of russian gas to ukraine and georgia have recently been disrupted . heads of state , government ministers , top defense officials and security experts gathered in a heavily-guarded five star hotel for the conference , entitled " restoring the transatlantic partnership .

9 , deutsche welle takes a look back at the turbulent and glamour-filled history of the festival and its founding amid a war-ravaged germany . when the 56th edition of the berlinale gets underway on feb .
9 , stars , journalists , paparazzi and film producers will throng the glitzy potsdamer platz in downtown berlin , where most of the action takes place . the buzz and hoopla wo n't be that different from the first berlinale , which took place on june 6 , 1951 .
but the background certainly will be . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the official poster for the first berlinale in 1951 the first berlinale , which opened with alfred hitchcock 's " rebecca , " took place against a bleak backdrop of a bombed-out german capital .
six years after the end of world war ii , large parts of the city still lay in ruins .
reconstruction had begun , but berlin was still far removed from the pulsating metropolis it once had been in the 1920s . still the berlinale did manage to inject some much-needed excitement and flamboyance into postwar berlin .
ever since american cult actress joan fontaine , who starred in " rebecca , " glided down the red carpet at the first berlinale , the film festival rapidly established itself in the 1950s as an international meeting point for the stars of world cinema . it was n't just hollywood , but also celebrities from other big cinema nations and studios in germany , such as sophia lauren , errol flynn , hans albers and hildegard knef , who graced the berlinale .
the film festival became a byword for glamour and fashion . artsy and intellectual in the 1960s , it was n't just divas and hollywood celebrities making the headlines at the berlinale . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french director jean-luc godard the film festival transformed itself into a hub for artsy and intelligent cinema with directors like jean-luc godard and francois truffaut presenting their works in berlin . in the politically-laden 1970s , the reverberations of the 1968 student revolts and the vietnam war made an impact on the berlinale too .
the festival witnessed angry protests against the us-critical film " o.k. " by german director michael verhoeven . following a few more turbulent years , the berlin film festival underwent a further change with the emergence of the " forum " section in addition to its mainstay , " competion " category which ends in the ceremonial awarding of the golden and silver bears . the " forum " section provided a showcase in particular for documentary and experimental films .
it also offered a platform for films from countries , which until then had never been in the spotlight of international cinema . for ulrich gregor , longtime former head of the section , the new developments finally completed the berlinale 's claim to be a showcase for international cinema by including all forms and genres . " it included the whole spectrum - right from hollywood films to independent ones from various countries , europe and also non-european nations right to documentaries and other experimental forms , " gregor said . boost for german films bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the coveted golden and silver bears however , the " competition " category has remained the centerpiece of the berlinale with hits such as " la notte " by michelangelo antonioni or " hong gaoliang " by zhang yimou being premiered here .
it 's this section that has also traditionally drawn the stars , given the prestige attached to winning the golden and silver bears . current berlinale director dieter kosslick has ensured that the section continues to take center stage at the festival . " what we do is also cultivate a so-called connections business , where you really have to know a lot of people and where you have to understand them , " kosslick said .
" you have to speak their language and i think you have to have a certain passion for that . " part of kosslick 's passion in the past years has also been the focus on homegrown cinema - something that was ignored by his predecessor moritz de hadeln for a long time . for a few years now , german films have been and have been prominently visible in several categories at the berlinale . heinz badewitz , head of the " perspective german cinema " section , says the international movers and shakers in the movie business also come to germany to watch and potentially buy homegrown entries . " our target group includes international buyers and festival directors from the whole world who come here to see the latest in german film in a compact manner , " badewitz said . asian cinema in the spotlight another relatively new development at the berlinale in the past decade has been the increasing presence of films from asian countries .
movies from china , taiwan , korea and vietnam have celebrated huge successes at the film festival in recent years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from taiwanese film " the wayward cloud " by tsai ming liang moritz de hadeln , the previous berlinale director , who also encouraged asian cinema during his term , says political films in particular find a deep resonance in berlin , which was long politically and physically divided itself . " asian filmmakers have something exciting to offer at the moment .
one of the new things is a contemporary korean film , it 's about relations between north and south korea , " de hadeln said .
" it 's a film that would not have been made two or three years ago in korea . " a political festival at heart indeed , the berlinale has long been a political festival . in the 1970s and 80s in particular , it was a platform for eastern european filmmakers .
many films from the soviet union or from east germany , which were controversial at home , celebrated their international premieres at the berlinale . and , last year the film festival embraced another continent , which had never before been among the victors - the film " carmen khayelitsha " by south african mark dornford-may picked up the coveted golden bear . jochen kürten -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlinale strikes a serious note the berlin international film festival , which opens on feb .

" you can issue as many resolutions as you like and have fun with it , but you can not prevent iran 's progress , " said the hard-line president , who has steered his country on a collision course with the west since his shock election win last june . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad remains defiant .
" you know that you can not do anything .
the era of bullying is over , " he said of the west 's determination to prevent iran from acquiring nuclear fuel technology that can also be used to make the fissile core of a nuclear bomb . iranian fm says resolution removes possible of further diplomacy foreign minister manouchehr mottaki meanwhile confirmed iran had laid down the gauntlet with immediate retaliation .
" all voluntary measures taken over the past two-and-a-half or three years have been halted and we have no further commitment to the additional protocol and other voluntary commitments , " he told a news conference . " this resolution has no legal basis .
all it does is simply remove the opportunity for voluntary cooperation between iran and the agency . " the additional protocol to the non-proliferation treaty hands the iaea stronger inspection powers and is central to the un watchdog 's now three-year-old effort to determine what iran is actually up to . mottaki did not specify what other steps had already been taken , but iran 's voluntary measures had notably included a freeze on uranium enrichment . iran says it only wants to enrich uranium to make reactor fuel .
it prompted the latest crisis by resuming uranium conversion activities last august and enrichment research on january 10 . us president george w. bush , however , said the text " is not the end of diplomacy or the iaea 's role " and merely the " beginning of an intensified diplomatic effort . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president george w. bush says diplomacy is still alive but an atomic iran will not be allowed .
" this important step sends a clear message to the regime in iran that the world will not permit the iranian regime to gain nuclear weapons , " bush said . russia favored by iran as negotiator although iranian retaliation is set to worsen tensions , the islamic regime also signaled it was ready to press on with negotiations with russia - which now has a one month window to talk with tehran before the security council actually takes up the matter . moscow 's proposal is for enrichment to be carried out on russian soil in order to allay proliferation concerns whilst at the same time allowing iran to have nuclear fuel for civilian purposes . " the second round of talks will go ahead , but the russian proposal must be adapted to the new situation so that we can examine it , " foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi told reporters . the two sides are scheduled to meet in moscow on february 16 , with russia keen to reach a negotiated settlement and guard its economic interests - which include a one-billion dollar deal to build iran 's first reactor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian defence minister sergei ivanov hopes iran will consider his country 's proposals .
" i am sure that the iranian leadership will look with all seriousness at russia 's proposal , " russian defense minister sergei ivanov said .
" this suggestion is the best way out of the situation . " widespread international pressure for iran to comply iran is under massive pressure from elsewhere to comply with the iaea 's demands to return to a moratorium on fuel cycle work , show better cooperation with iaea inspectors and return to negotiations . in the iaea vote , 27 countries including the un security council 's permanent five - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - voted in favor and five abstained .
iran 's only support came from cuba , syria and venezuela . japan also said the resolution was " a clear message to iran " , and called on the tehran to " take this resolution seriously and respond to it sincerely . " " iran has still a crucial opportunity between now and the march iaea board to comply , " said british foreign secretary jack straw .
" otherwise , decisions by the security council are almost inevitable .

thousands of holiday makers are already enjoying almost perfect snow conditions , while thousands more are packing their skis and getting ready to go . but at the hugely popular swiss resort of grindelwald , located 75 km -lrb- 50 miles -rrb- from the swiss capital bern , not everybody has the time to enjoy the scenery . " we have to be prepared to go out and get the injured , " said martin mathys of the grindelwald mountain rescue service . " with the speed , of course , we have a problem .

losing one 's balance at that speed , let alone crashing into somebody else , can really put a dramatic twist on an otherwise wonderful winter vacation . " speed is the big danger factor , but it 's not just speed , it 's also the way people ski , " said paul gunter , who is head of the emergency ward at the local hospital .

" speed is the big danger factor , but it 's not just speed , it 's also the way people ski , " said paul gunter , who is head of the emergency ward at the local hospital . " they make turns where they really do use the whole width of the slope , and that leads to collisions .

" we were asking people on the slopes , how do you feel , and a lot of people , especially families , said i just do n't feel safe because there are so many fast skiers around me , " benny kaufmann of the grindelwald tourism organization explained . " and then we thought we 'd make a new slope , with speed limits , and people will feel safer , " kaufmann said . speed patrols the new 30 km an hour slope has an electronic monitor to check the skiers ' speed , and patrols who pull them over if they break the limit .

" " we want to prevent and we must prevent iran from developing nuclear weapons , " merkel said in her speech .
" the concerns and fears over iran 's nuclear program are legitimate . " the un 's nuclear watchdog , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , voted on saturday to report iran to the un security council , paving the way to possible sanctions over its atomic program . iran retaliated by saying it would begin full-scale uranium enrichment and limit inspections by iaea officials . merkel said iran still had a chance to avoid the sanctions by accepting a russian proposal to allow iranian uranium enrichment to take place in russia , which would prevent tehran from mastering sensitive nuclear technology . she called on iran to consider the compromise as a " window of opportunity .

" " a president who denies the existence of israel and the holocaust can not expect to receive any tolerance from germany , " merkel said . she compared ahmadinejad 's statements to when adolf hitler came to power and began threatening to exterminate european jews .

" if the case is sent or even reported to the un security council , based on the law of our parliament , our government has no way of stopping nuclear activities , " araghchi said during merkel 's question and answer session . he blamed the three eu nations - britain , france and germany - which have negotiated with tehran over its nuclear ambitions , for creating the conflict .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.02.2006 " time of bullying over " says defiant iran over sanctions threat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian foreign minister , manouchehr mottaki says the un resolution has no legal basis a defiant iran moved sunday to block snap un nuclear inspections and kick-start sensitive fuel work after being reported to the security council , deepening a crisis over its disputed atomic ambitions . president mahmoud ahmadinejad shrugged off the threat of un action , which could see his country badly isolated and slapped with sanctions , and vowed to ignore even a long stream of tough resolutions . on saturday the international atomic energy agency 's 35-nation board voted to report iran to new york amid fears the country is using a nuclear power drive as a cover for weapons development . " you can issue as many resolutions as you like and have fun with it , but you can not prevent iran 's progress , " said the hard-line president , who has steered his country on a collision course with the west since his shock election win last june . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad remains defiant .
" you know that you can not do anything .
the era of bullying is over , " he said of the west 's determination to prevent iran from acquiring nuclear fuel technology that can also be used to make the fissile core of a nuclear bomb . iranian fm says resolution removes possible of further diplomacy foreign minister manouchehr mottaki meanwhile confirmed iran had laid down the gauntlet with immediate retaliation .
" all voluntary measures taken over the past two-and-a-half or three years have been halted and we have no further commitment to the additional protocol and other voluntary commitments , " he told a news conference . " this resolution has no legal basis .
all it does is simply remove the opportunity for voluntary cooperation between iran and the agency . " the additional protocol to the non-proliferation treaty hands the iaea stronger inspection powers and is central to the un watchdog 's now three-year-old effort to determine what iran is actually up to . mottaki did not specify what other steps had already been taken , but iran 's voluntary measures had notably included a freeze on uranium enrichment . iran says it only wants to enrich uranium to make reactor fuel .
it prompted the latest crisis by resuming uranium conversion activities last august and enrichment research on january 10 . us president george w. bush , however , said the text " is not the end of diplomacy or the iaea 's role " and merely the " beginning of an intensified diplomatic effort . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president george w. bush says diplomacy is still alive but an atomic iran will not be allowed .
" this important step sends a clear message to the regime in iran that the world will not permit the iranian regime to gain nuclear weapons , " bush said . russia favored by iran as negotiator although iranian retaliation is set to worsen tensions , the islamic regime also signaled it was ready to press on with negotiations with russia - which now has a one month window to talk with tehran before the security council actually takes up the matter . moscow 's proposal is for enrichment to be carried out on russian soil in order to allay proliferation concerns whilst at the same time allowing iran to have nuclear fuel for civilian purposes . " the second round of talks will go ahead , but the russian proposal must be adapted to the new situation so that we can examine it , " foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi told reporters . the two sides are scheduled to meet in moscow on february 16 , with russia keen to reach a negotiated settlement and guard its economic interests - which include a one-billion dollar deal to build iran 's first reactor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian defence minister sergei ivanov hopes iran will consider his country 's proposals .

" let the hostages go immediately , " the chairman of the islamic council for germany , ali kizilkaya , wrote in the bild am sonntag newspaper . " it is regrettable that religion is being abused once again and all of islam is brought into disrepute .
our thoughts are with the families of the two hostages . " the deputy general secretary of the islamic group milli gorus , mustafa yeneroglu , said bräunlich and nitzschke , had gone to iraq to assist its people . " the fact that two people have been kidnapped who have helped iraq economically with their work demonstrates how absurd this act is , " he said . the president of the turkish-german muslim organization ditib , ridvan cakir , said the kidnapping marked a clear violation of the tenets of islam . " i call on the kidnappers to let the two germans go at once , " he said . and the chairman of the central council of muslims in germany , nadeem elyas , said that in light of berlin 's fierce opposition to the us-led iraq war in 2003 , the german engineers should be seen as innocent bystanders . " there is no logic in the world that could justify the kidnapping .
the german people are linked to the iraqi people in friendship - after all it was the german government that opposed the iraq war at the time , " he said in a statement . the fate of german engineers rene bräunlich and thomas nitzschke remained uncertain . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier meanwhile used al jazeera friday to issue a new appeal for the release of the two engineers . " german chancellor angela merkel and myself call upon you , on behalf of all germans , to release the two hostages without subjecting them to any pain , " steinmeier said . bräunlich and nitzschke , who work for german gas equipment installation company cryotec , were abducted near a key oil refinery in the northern town of baiji on january 24 by armed men in military uniform . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gate of baiji plant where iraqi insurgents kidnapped the two german engineers their kidnappers threatened on tuesday to kill them unless berlin cut all links with baghdad within 72 hours . president horst köhler said on friday he was " very concerned " by the kidnapping .
a foreign ministry spokesman described the situation as " extremely serious " . amid growing concern at home , he said germany was making all possible efforts to ensure the release of the two men but declined to " comment on or interpret the kidnappers ' ultimatum " . more detainee releases seen as leverage in hostage crisis iraq on sunday freed more than 50 male prisoners but held back female detainees as the fate of us and german hostages remained unknown amid a tight security clampdown for the main shiite festival .
the us military said it had released 50 male detainees , but later the iraqi government said 53 prisoners were freed .
" there was no female detainee release today , " the spokesman for the us detention facility in iraq told reporters .

" let the hostages go immediately , " the chairman of the islamic council for germany , ali kizilkaya , wrote in the bild am sonntag newspaper . " it is regrettable that religion is being abused once again and all of islam is brought into disrepute .
our thoughts are with the families of the two hostages . " the deputy general secretary of the islamic group milli gorus , mustafa yeneroglu , said bräunlich and nitzschke , had gone to iraq to assist its people . " the fact that two people have been kidnapped who have helped iraq economically with their work demonstrates how absurd this act is , " he said . the president of the turkish-german muslim organization ditib , ridvan cakir , said the kidnapping marked a clear violation of the tenets of islam . " i call on the kidnappers to let the two germans go at once , " he said . and the chairman of the central council of muslims in germany , nadeem elyas , said that in light of berlin 's fierce opposition to the us-led iraq war in 2003 , the german engineers should be seen as innocent bystanders . " there is no logic in the world that could justify the kidnapping .
the german people are linked to the iraqi people in friendship - after all it was the german government that opposed the iraq war at the time , " he said in a statement . the fate of german engineers rene bräunlich and thomas nitzschke remained uncertain . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier meanwhile used al jazeera friday to issue a new appeal for the release of the two engineers . " german chancellor angela merkel and myself call upon you , on behalf of all germans , to release the two hostages without subjecting them to any pain , " steinmeier said . bräunlich and nitzschke , who work for german gas equipment installation company cryotec , were abducted near a key oil refinery in the northern town of baiji on january 24 by armed men in military uniform . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gate of baiji plant where iraqi insurgents kidnapped the two german engineers their kidnappers threatened on tuesday to kill them unless berlin cut all links with baghdad within 72 hours . president horst köhler said on friday he was " very concerned " by the kidnapping .
a foreign ministry spokesman described the situation as " extremely serious " . amid growing concern at home , he said germany was making all possible efforts to ensure the release of the two men but declined to " comment on or interpret the kidnappers ' ultimatum " . more detainee releases seen as leverage in hostage crisis iraq on sunday freed more than 50 male prisoners but held back female detainees as the fate of us and german hostages remained unknown amid a tight security clampdown for the main shiite festival .
the us military said it had released 50 male detainees , but later the iraqi government said 53 prisoners were freed .
" there was no female detainee release today , " the spokesman for the us detention facility in iraq told reporters .
" today 's release was done after a review by the joint board and at this stage i can not offer any other details . it is believed the us military release of the detainees was an attempt to gain some leverage in the kidnappings of bräunlich and nitzschke and us reporter jill carroll . last month , iraq released more than 400 detainees , including five women , in a move widely seen as a response to demands from the kidnappers of carroll for the freeing of all female prisoners in iraq . both us and iraqi spokesmen strongly denied any link at the time . shortly after those releases , a new videotape from the kidnappers was broadcast by al jazeera in which they broadened their demand to include all detainees , male or female . " the journalist called on her family , her colleagues and americans throughout the world to ask the us military authorities and the iraqi interior ministry to free all iraqi prisoners , saying this could contribute to her release , " the channel 's presenter said . us reporter still missing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emergency teams in and outside iraq are working to find and free the hostages .
carroll , who was working for the christian science monitor , was abducted in baghdad on january 7 by a group calling itself the brigades of vengeance as she traveled to a meeting with a leading sunni arab politician . " we have no new information on the hostage , " a us military spokesman said referring to carroll . the three hostages are among nearly 250 foreigners kidnapped in iraq since the march 2003 invasion .
many of them have been killed . the fate of two kenyan telecommunications engineers abducted last month and two iraqi television journalists seized wednesday also remained unknown . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de video shows german hostages alive a video of the two german engineers kidnapped in northern iraq was broadcast by al jazeera on friday .

" terrorism , the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , failing states - these are the scourges of our times , " german defense minister franz josef jung told the conference . " the old nato as a purely defensive alliance is history , " he added . us defense secretary donald rumsfeld thanked merkel for her " thoughtful and important remarks on nato " in his own conference speech devoted to islamic militancy . " the competences that exist within nato can be used to advantage in other parts of the world , " rumsfeld said . the us defense chief praised the alliance 's deployment in afghanistan after the fall of the taliban regime and in giving humanitarian assistance to pakistan after a massive earthquake last year . but nato 's potential was being held back by insufficient defense spending in members of the alliance , rumsfeld said . the united states was spending 3.7 percent of its gdp on defense but other nato members were spending far less , he said . " unless we invest in defense and security , the reality is that our homelands can be at risk . " french disagree and promote stronger eu forces bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of the european union 's growing military strength oppose the nato expansion ideas .
french defense minister michele alliot-marie took a more skeptical view on nato 's role and stressed the importance of the european union 's growing security capability , reflecting widespread concerns in france that a stronger nato would mean a weaker eu . " let 's take care ... not to spill into areas where the competence of other organizations is more suitable .
let 's not waste our financial means , which are vital for fighting crises and upgrading our equipment , " alliot-marie said . nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer , however , supported " pragmatic " cooperation between nato and the european union and sought to calm french fears . nato is no global cop says de hoop scheffer " nato is not a global policeman , " he said .
among the new global threats that nato could help combat , de hoop scheffer mentioned the protection of energy supply lines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer does not want the alliance to act as the world police .
" for reasons that are obvious - including the potential of terrorists targeting our energy supplies - it makes sense to me that the allies should discuss this issue , " he said . supplies of russian gas to ukraine and georgia have recently been disrupted . heads of state , government ministers , top defense officials and security experts gathered in a heavily-guarded five star hotel for the conference , entitled " restoring the transatlantic partnership .

9 , deutsche welle takes a look back at the turbulent and glamour-filled history of the festival and its founding amid a war-ravaged germany . when the 56th edition of the berlinale gets underway on feb .
9 , stars , journalists , paparazzi and film producers will throng the glitzy potsdamer platz in downtown berlin , where most of the action takes place . the buzz and hoopla wo n't be that different from the first berlinale , which took place on june 6 , 1951 .
but the background certainly will be . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the official poster for the first berlinale in 1951 the first berlinale , which opened with alfred hitchcock 's " rebecca , " took place against a bleak backdrop of a bombed-out german capital .
six years after the end of world war ii , large parts of the city still lay in ruins .
reconstruction had begun , but berlin was still far removed from the pulsating metropolis it once had been in the 1920s . still the berlinale did manage to inject some much-needed excitement and flamboyance into postwar berlin .
ever since american cult actress joan fontaine , who starred in " rebecca , " glided down the red carpet at the first berlinale , the film festival rapidly established itself in the 1950s as an international meeting point for the stars of world cinema . it was n't just hollywood , but also celebrities from other big cinema nations and studios in germany , such as sophia lauren , errol flynn , hans albers and hildegard knef , who graced the berlinale .
the film festival became a byword for glamour and fashion . artsy and intellectual in the 1960s , it was n't just divas and hollywood celebrities making the headlines at the berlinale . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french director jean-luc godard the film festival transformed itself into a hub for artsy and intelligent cinema with directors like jean-luc godard and francois truffaut presenting their works in berlin . in the politically-laden 1970s , the reverberations of the 1968 student revolts and the vietnam war made an impact on the berlinale too .
the festival witnessed angry protests against the us-critical film " o.k. " by german director michael verhoeven . following a few more turbulent years , the berlin film festival underwent a further change with the emergence of the " forum " section in addition to its mainstay , " competion " category which ends in the ceremonial awarding of the golden and silver bears . the " forum " section provided a showcase in particular for documentary and experimental films .
it also offered a platform for films from countries , which until then had never been in the spotlight of international cinema . for ulrich gregor , longtime former head of the section , the new developments finally completed the berlinale 's claim to be a showcase for international cinema by including all forms and genres . " it included the whole spectrum - right from hollywood films to independent ones from various countries , europe and also non-european nations right to documentaries and other experimental forms , " gregor said . boost for german films bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the coveted golden and silver bears however , the " competition " category has remained the centerpiece of the berlinale with hits such as " la notte " by michelangelo antonioni or " hong gaoliang " by zhang yimou being premiered here .
it 's this section that has also traditionally drawn the stars , given the prestige attached to winning the golden and silver bears . current berlinale director dieter kosslick has ensured that the section continues to take center stage at the festival . " what we do is also cultivate a so-called connections business , where you really have to know a lot of people and where you have to understand them , " kosslick said .
" you have to speak their language and i think you have to have a certain passion for that . " part of kosslick 's passion in the past years has also been the focus on homegrown cinema - something that was ignored by his predecessor moritz de hadeln for a long time . for a few years now , german films have been and have been prominently visible in several categories at the berlinale . heinz badewitz , head of the " perspective german cinema " section , says the international movers and shakers in the movie business also come to germany to watch and potentially buy homegrown entries . " our target group includes international buyers and festival directors from the whole world who come here to see the latest in german film in a compact manner , " badewitz said . asian cinema in the spotlight another relatively new development at the berlinale in the past decade has been the increasing presence of films from asian countries .
movies from china , taiwan , korea and vietnam have celebrated huge successes at the film festival in recent years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from taiwanese film " the wayward cloud " by tsai ming liang moritz de hadeln , the previous berlinale director , who also encouraged asian cinema during his term , says political films in particular find a deep resonance in berlin , which was long politically and physically divided itself . " asian filmmakers have something exciting to offer at the moment .
one of the new things is a contemporary korean film , it 's about relations between north and south korea , " de hadeln said .
" it 's a film that would not have been made two or three years ago in korea . " a political festival at heart indeed , the berlinale has long been a political festival . in the 1970s and 80s in particular , it was a platform for eastern european filmmakers .
many films from the soviet union or from east germany , which were controversial at home , celebrated their international premieres at the berlinale . and , last year the film festival embraced another continent , which had never before been among the victors - the film " carmen khayelitsha " by south african mark dornford-may picked up the coveted golden bear . jochen kürten -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlinale strikes a serious note the berlin international film festival , which opens on feb .

9 , deutsche welle takes a look back at the turbulent and glamour-filled history of the festival and its founding amid a war-ravaged germany . when the 56th edition of the berlinale gets underway on feb .
9 , stars , journalists , paparazzi and film producers will throng the glitzy potsdamer platz in downtown berlin , where most of the action takes place . the buzz and hoopla wo n't be that different from the first berlinale , which took place on june 6 , 1951 .
but the background certainly will be . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the official poster for the first berlinale in 1951 the first berlinale , which opened with alfred hitchcock 's " rebecca , " took place against a bleak backdrop of a bombed-out german capital .
six years after the end of world war ii , large parts of the city still lay in ruins .
reconstruction had begun , but berlin was still far removed from the pulsating metropolis it once had been in the 1920s . still the berlinale did manage to inject some much-needed excitement and flamboyance into postwar berlin .
ever since american cult actress joan fontaine , who starred in " rebecca , " glided down the red carpet at the first berlinale , the film festival rapidly established itself in the 1950s as an international meeting point for the stars of world cinema . it was n't just hollywood , but also celebrities from other big cinema nations and studios in germany , such as sophia lauren , errol flynn , hans albers and hildegard knef , who graced the berlinale .
the film festival became a byword for glamour and fashion . artsy and intellectual in the 1960s , it was n't just divas and hollywood celebrities making the headlines at the berlinale . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french director jean-luc godard the film festival transformed itself into a hub for artsy and intelligent cinema with directors like jean-luc godard and francois truffaut presenting their works in berlin . in the politically-laden 1970s , the reverberations of the 1968 student revolts and the vietnam war made an impact on the berlinale too .
the festival witnessed angry protests against the us-critical film " o.k. " by german director michael verhoeven . following a few more turbulent years , the berlin film festival underwent a further change with the emergence of the " forum " section in addition to its mainstay , " competion " category which ends in the ceremonial awarding of the golden and silver bears . the " forum " section provided a showcase in particular for documentary and experimental films .
it also offered a platform for films from countries , which until then had never been in the spotlight of international cinema . for ulrich gregor , longtime former head of the section , the new developments finally completed the berlinale 's claim to be a showcase for international cinema by including all forms and genres . " it included the whole spectrum - right from hollywood films to independent ones from various countries , europe and also non-european nations right to documentaries and other experimental forms , " gregor said . boost for german films bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the coveted golden and silver bears however , the " competition " category has remained the centerpiece of the berlinale with hits such as " la notte " by michelangelo antonioni or " hong gaoliang " by zhang yimou being premiered here .
it 's this section that has also traditionally drawn the stars , given the prestige attached to winning the golden and silver bears . current berlinale director dieter kosslick has ensured that the section continues to take center stage at the festival . " what we do is also cultivate a so-called connections business , where you really have to know a lot of people and where you have to understand them , " kosslick said .
" you have to speak their language and i think you have to have a certain passion for that . " part of kosslick 's passion in the past years has also been the focus on homegrown cinema - something that was ignored by his predecessor moritz de hadeln for a long time . for a few years now , german films have been and have been prominently visible in several categories at the berlinale . heinz badewitz , head of the " perspective german cinema " section , says the international movers and shakers in the movie business also come to germany to watch and potentially buy homegrown entries . " our target group includes international buyers and festival directors from the whole world who come here to see the latest in german film in a compact manner , " badewitz said . asian cinema in the spotlight another relatively new development at the berlinale in the past decade has been the increasing presence of films from asian countries .
movies from china , taiwan , korea and vietnam have celebrated huge successes at the film festival in recent years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from taiwanese film " the wayward cloud " by tsai ming liang moritz de hadeln , the previous berlinale director , who also encouraged asian cinema during his term , says political films in particular find a deep resonance in berlin , which was long politically and physically divided itself . " asian filmmakers have something exciting to offer at the moment .
one of the new things is a contemporary korean film , it 's about relations between north and south korea , " de hadeln said .
" it 's a film that would not have been made two or three years ago in korea . " a political festival at heart indeed , the berlinale has long been a political festival . in the 1970s and 80s in particular , it was a platform for eastern european filmmakers .
many films from the soviet union or from east germany , which were controversial at home , celebrated their international premieres at the berlinale . and , last year the film festival embraced another continent , which had never before been among the victors - the film " carmen khayelitsha " by south african mark dornford-may picked up the coveted golden bear . jochen kürten -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlinale strikes a serious note the berlin international film festival , which opens on feb .

nine-year-old mahjoub jemili 's complexion may not fit the stereotype , but his thick regional accent certainly bears it up . mahjoub the first has already faced one of the biggest tests of his reign as the children 's prince of wesseling .
he addressed cologne cardinal joachim meissner , which had invited wesseling 's carnival society to coffee .
and he was a success .
" he did his job very well .
and his command of the cologne dialect is a huge achievement , " remarked meissner .
" i ca n't do it at all .
when i try people just laugh - justifiably so . " nevertheless , the children 's prince bestowed his very own carnival medal on the cardinal .
the medal was decorated with his title , wesseling 's coat of arms , a soccer ball and a camel , in reference to his favorite hobby and his origin . born in the rhineland , the boy speaks fluent german in the dialect of the cologne area .
his dialect is so thick that many a german from beyond the rhine would n't understand him . it was work which brought jemili 's grandparents to wesseling , south of cologne , in 1970 , decades before mahjoub was born .
mahjoub is the third generation of wesselingers , after his parents , lamia and foued .
years of carnival-going though born in tunisia , mahjoub 's mother identifies more strongly with germany than with her country of birth , and she sees the choice of mahjoub as carnival prince as an example of successful integration .
but she and her husband were still a bit nervous when they got the news .

and then they saw the boy , " recalled lamia jemili .
" but once he was on stage and said the first word in cologne dialect , and then his speech .
the people turned around and said , ' is that your son ?
that 's great ' ! " mahjoub is already well-seasoned when it comes to carnival .
like many rhineland kids , he 's celebrated the event every year since he can remember - the first time at the age of eight months .
the jemilis have always been part of the wessling 's carnival society .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mahjoub , like other rhineland kids , started celebrating carnival at a young age " in my eyes , you have to want to be integrated , " said lamia jemili .

if we had n't had our surroundings , were n't so linguistically able , if we had n't really had the will to become part of the wesseling community , it would n't have been possible at all . talk of integration goes over mahjoub 's head .

9 , deutsche welle takes a look back at the turbulent and glamour-filled history of the festival and its founding amid a war-ravaged germany . when the 56th edition of the berlinale gets underway on feb .
9 , stars , journalists , paparazzi and film producers will throng the glitzy potsdamer platz in downtown berlin , where most of the action takes place . the buzz and hoopla wo n't be that different from the first berlinale , which took place on june 6 , 1951 .
but the background certainly will be . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the official poster for the first berlinale in 1951 the first berlinale , which opened with alfred hitchcock 's " rebecca , " took place against a bleak backdrop of a bombed-out german capital .
six years after the end of world war ii , large parts of the city still lay in ruins .
reconstruction had begun , but berlin was still far removed from the pulsating metropolis it once had been in the 1920s . still the berlinale did manage to inject some much-needed excitement and flamboyance into postwar berlin .
ever since american cult actress joan fontaine , who starred in " rebecca , " glided down the red carpet at the first berlinale , the film festival rapidly established itself in the 1950s as an international meeting point for the stars of world cinema . it was n't just hollywood , but also celebrities from other big cinema nations and studios in germany , such as sophia lauren , errol flynn , hans albers and hildegard knef , who graced the berlinale .
the film festival became a byword for glamour and fashion . artsy and intellectual in the 1960s , it was n't just divas and hollywood celebrities making the headlines at the berlinale . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french director jean-luc godard the film festival transformed itself into a hub for artsy and intelligent cinema with directors like jean-luc godard and francois truffaut presenting their works in berlin . in the politically-laden 1970s , the reverberations of the 1968 student revolts and the vietnam war made an impact on the berlinale too .
the festival witnessed angry protests against the us-critical film " o.k. " by german director michael verhoeven . following a few more turbulent years , the berlin film festival underwent a further change with the emergence of the " forum " section in addition to its mainstay , " competion " category which ends in the ceremonial awarding of the golden and silver bears . the " forum " section provided a showcase in particular for documentary and experimental films .
it also offered a platform for films from countries , which until then had never been in the spotlight of international cinema . for ulrich gregor , longtime former head of the section , the new developments finally completed the berlinale 's claim to be a showcase for international cinema by including all forms and genres . " it included the whole spectrum - right from hollywood films to independent ones from various countries , europe and also non-european nations right to documentaries and other experimental forms , " gregor said . boost for german films bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the coveted golden and silver bears however , the " competition " category has remained the centerpiece of the berlinale with hits such as " la notte " by michelangelo antonioni or " hong gaoliang " by zhang yimou being premiered here .
it 's this section that has also traditionally drawn the stars , given the prestige attached to winning the golden and silver bears . current berlinale director dieter kosslick has ensured that the section continues to take center stage at the festival . " what we do is also cultivate a so-called connections business , where you really have to know a lot of people and where you have to understand them , " kosslick said .
" you have to speak their language and i think you have to have a certain passion for that . " part of kosslick 's passion in the past years has also been the focus on homegrown cinema - something that was ignored by his predecessor moritz de hadeln for a long time . for a few years now , german films have been and have been prominently visible in several categories at the berlinale . heinz badewitz , head of the " perspective german cinema " section , says the international movers and shakers in the movie business also come to germany to watch and potentially buy homegrown entries . " our target group includes international buyers and festival directors from the whole world who come here to see the latest in german film in a compact manner , " badewitz said . asian cinema in the spotlight another relatively new development at the berlinale in the past decade has been the increasing presence of films from asian countries .
movies from china , taiwan , korea and vietnam have celebrated huge successes at the film festival in recent years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from taiwanese film " the wayward cloud " by tsai ming liang moritz de hadeln , the previous berlinale director , who also encouraged asian cinema during his term , says political films in particular find a deep resonance in berlin , which was long politically and physically divided itself . " asian filmmakers have something exciting to offer at the moment .
one of the new things is a contemporary korean film , it 's about relations between north and south korea , " de hadeln said .
" it 's a film that would not have been made two or three years ago in korea . " a political festival at heart indeed , the berlinale has long been a political festival . in the 1970s and 80s in particular , it was a platform for eastern european filmmakers .
many films from the soviet union or from east germany , which were controversial at home , celebrated their international premieres at the berlinale . and , last year the film festival embraced another continent , which had never before been among the victors - the film " carmen khayelitsha " by south african mark dornford-may picked up the coveted golden bear . jochen kürten -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlinale strikes a serious note the berlin international film festival , which opens on feb .

nine-year-old mahjoub jemili 's complexion may not fit the stereotype , but his thick regional accent certainly bears it up . mahjoub the first has already faced one of the biggest tests of his reign as the children 's prince of wesseling .
he addressed cologne cardinal joachim meissner , which had invited wesseling 's carnival society to coffee .
and he was a success .
" he did his job very well .
and his command of the cologne dialect is a huge achievement , " remarked meissner .
" i ca n't do it at all .
when i try people just laugh - justifiably so . " nevertheless , the children 's prince bestowed his very own carnival medal on the cardinal .
the medal was decorated with his title , wesseling 's coat of arms , a soccer ball and a camel , in reference to his favorite hobby and his origin . born in the rhineland , the boy speaks fluent german in the dialect of the cologne area .
his dialect is so thick that many a german from beyond the rhine would n't understand him . it was work which brought jemili 's grandparents to wesseling , south of cologne , in 1970 , decades before mahjoub was born .
mahjoub is the third generation of wesselingers , after his parents , lamia and foued .

nine-year-old mahjoub jemili 's complexion may not fit the stereotype , but his thick regional accent certainly bears it up . mahjoub the first has already faced one of the biggest tests of his reign as the children 's prince of wesseling .
he addressed cologne cardinal joachim meissner , which had invited wesseling 's carnival society to coffee .

and his command of the cologne dialect is a huge achievement , " remarked meissner .
" i ca n't do it at all .

the medal was decorated with his title , wesseling 's coat of arms , a soccer ball and a camel , in reference to his favorite hobby and his origin . born in the rhineland , the boy speaks fluent german in the dialect of the cologne area .
his dialect is so thick that many a german from beyond the rhine would n't understand him . it was work which brought jemili 's grandparents to wesseling , south of cologne , in 1970 , decades before mahjoub was born .

nine-year-old mahjoub jemili 's complexion may not fit the stereotype , but his thick regional accent certainly bears it up . mahjoub the first has already faced one of the biggest tests of his reign as the children 's prince of wesseling .
he addressed cologne cardinal joachim meissner , which had invited wesseling 's carnival society to coffee .
and he was a success .
" he did his job very well .
and his command of the cologne dialect is a huge achievement , " remarked meissner .
" i ca n't do it at all .
when i try people just laugh - justifiably so . " nevertheless , the children 's prince bestowed his very own carnival medal on the cardinal .
the medal was decorated with his title , wesseling 's coat of arms , a soccer ball and a camel , in reference to his favorite hobby and his origin . born in the rhineland , the boy speaks fluent german in the dialect of the cologne area .
his dialect is so thick that many a german from beyond the rhine would n't understand him . it was work which brought jemili 's grandparents to wesseling , south of cologne , in 1970 , decades before mahjoub was born .
mahjoub is the third generation of wesselingers , after his parents , lamia and foued .
years of carnival-going though born in tunisia , mahjoub 's mother identifies more strongly with germany than with her country of birth , and she sees the choice of mahjoub as carnival prince as an example of successful integration .
but she and her husband were still a bit nervous when they got the news .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rhineland carnival reaches its apogee in late february this year " we were a little concerned and thought , ' what will happen when the boy goes on stage ?
will people accept it ? '
at a meeting of senior citizens , when the boy 's name was called out - ' here comes the children 's price mahjoub i ' - they did n't know what to make of it .
and then they saw the boy , " recalled lamia jemili .
" but once he was on stage and said the first word in cologne dialect , and then his speech .
the people turned around and said , ' is that your son ?
that 's great ' ! " mahjoub is already well-seasoned when it comes to carnival .
like many rhineland kids , he 's celebrated the event every year since he can remember - the first time at the age of eight months .
the jemilis have always been part of the wessling 's carnival society .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mahjoub , like other rhineland kids , started celebrating carnival at a young age " in my eyes , you have to want to be integrated , " said lamia jemili .
" and i say over and over again : language is essential .
if we had n't had our surroundings , were n't so linguistically able , if we had n't really had the will to become part of the wesseling community , it would n't have been possible at all . talk of integration goes over mahjoub 's head .
he just likes to be carnival prince , and he 's good at it .

9 , deutsche welle takes a look back at the turbulent and glamour-filled history of the festival and its founding amid a war-ravaged germany . when the 56th edition of the berlinale gets underway on feb .
9 , stars , journalists , paparazzi and film producers will throng the glitzy potsdamer platz in downtown berlin , where most of the action takes place . the buzz and hoopla wo n't be that different from the first berlinale , which took place on june 6 , 1951 .
but the background certainly will be . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the official poster for the first berlinale in 1951 the first berlinale , which opened with alfred hitchcock 's " rebecca , " took place against a bleak backdrop of a bombed-out german capital .
six years after the end of world war ii , large parts of the city still lay in ruins .
reconstruction had begun , but berlin was still far removed from the pulsating metropolis it once had been in the 1920s . still the berlinale did manage to inject some much-needed excitement and flamboyance into postwar berlin .
ever since american cult actress joan fontaine , who starred in " rebecca , " glided down the red carpet at the first berlinale , the film festival rapidly established itself in the 1950s as an international meeting point for the stars of world cinema . it was n't just hollywood , but also celebrities from other big cinema nations and studios in germany , such as sophia lauren , errol flynn , hans albers and hildegard knef , who graced the berlinale .
the film festival became a byword for glamour and fashion . artsy and intellectual in the 1960s , it was n't just divas and hollywood celebrities making the headlines at the berlinale . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french director jean-luc godard the film festival transformed itself into a hub for artsy and intelligent cinema with directors like jean-luc godard and francois truffaut presenting their works in berlin . in the politically-laden 1970s , the reverberations of the 1968 student revolts and the vietnam war made an impact on the berlinale too .
the festival witnessed angry protests against the us-critical film " o.k. " by german director michael verhoeven . following a few more turbulent years , the berlin film festival underwent a further change with the emergence of the " forum " section in addition to its mainstay , " competion " category which ends in the ceremonial awarding of the golden and silver bears . the " forum " section provided a showcase in particular for documentary and experimental films .
it also offered a platform for films from countries , which until then had never been in the spotlight of international cinema . for ulrich gregor , longtime former head of the section , the new developments finally completed the berlinale 's claim to be a showcase for international cinema by including all forms and genres . " it included the whole spectrum - right from hollywood films to independent ones from various countries , europe and also non-european nations right to documentaries and other experimental forms , " gregor said . boost for german films bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the coveted golden and silver bears however , the " competition " category has remained the centerpiece of the berlinale with hits such as " la notte " by michelangelo antonioni or " hong gaoliang " by zhang yimou being premiered here .
it 's this section that has also traditionally drawn the stars , given the prestige attached to winning the golden and silver bears . current berlinale director dieter kosslick has ensured that the section continues to take center stage at the festival . " what we do is also cultivate a so-called connections business , where you really have to know a lot of people and where you have to understand them , " kosslick said .
" you have to speak their language and i think you have to have a certain passion for that . " part of kosslick 's passion in the past years has also been the focus on homegrown cinema - something that was ignored by his predecessor moritz de hadeln for a long time . for a few years now , german films have been and have been prominently visible in several categories at the berlinale . heinz badewitz , head of the " perspective german cinema " section , says the international movers and shakers in the movie business also come to germany to watch and potentially buy homegrown entries . " our target group includes international buyers and festival directors from the whole world who come here to see the latest in german film in a compact manner , " badewitz said . asian cinema in the spotlight another relatively new development at the berlinale in the past decade has been the increasing presence of films from asian countries .
movies from china , taiwan , korea and vietnam have celebrated huge successes at the film festival in recent years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from taiwanese film " the wayward cloud " by tsai ming liang moritz de hadeln , the previous berlinale director , who also encouraged asian cinema during his term , says political films in particular find a deep resonance in berlin , which was long politically and physically divided itself . " asian filmmakers have something exciting to offer at the moment .
one of the new things is a contemporary korean film , it 's about relations between north and south korea , " de hadeln said .
" it 's a film that would not have been made two or three years ago in korea . " a political festival at heart indeed , the berlinale has long been a political festival . in the 1970s and 80s in particular , it was a platform for eastern european filmmakers .
many films from the soviet union or from east germany , which were controversial at home , celebrated their international premieres at the berlinale . and , last year the film festival embraced another continent , which had never before been among the victors - the film " carmen khayelitsha " by south african mark dornford-may picked up the coveted golden bear . jochen kürten -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlinale strikes a serious note the berlin international film festival , which opens on feb .

9 , deutsche welle takes a look back at the turbulent and glamour-filled history of the festival and its founding amid a war-ravaged germany . when the 56th edition of the berlinale gets underway on feb .
9 , stars , journalists , paparazzi and film producers will throng the glitzy potsdamer platz in downtown berlin , where most of the action takes place . the buzz and hoopla wo n't be that different from the first berlinale , which took place on june 6 , 1951 .
but the background certainly will be . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the official poster for the first berlinale in 1951 the first berlinale , which opened with alfred hitchcock 's " rebecca , " took place against a bleak backdrop of a bombed-out german capital .
six years after the end of world war ii , large parts of the city still lay in ruins .
reconstruction had begun , but berlin was still far removed from the pulsating metropolis it once had been in the 1920s . still the berlinale did manage to inject some much-needed excitement and flamboyance into postwar berlin .
ever since american cult actress joan fontaine , who starred in " rebecca , " glided down the red carpet at the first berlinale , the film festival rapidly established itself in the 1950s as an international meeting point for the stars of world cinema . it was n't just hollywood , but also celebrities from other big cinema nations and studios in germany , such as sophia lauren , errol flynn , hans albers and hildegard knef , who graced the berlinale .
the film festival became a byword for glamour and fashion . artsy and intellectual in the 1960s , it was n't just divas and hollywood celebrities making the headlines at the berlinale . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french director jean-luc godard the film festival transformed itself into a hub for artsy and intelligent cinema with directors like jean-luc godard and francois truffaut presenting their works in berlin . in the politically-laden 1970s , the reverberations of the 1968 student revolts and the vietnam war made an impact on the berlinale too .
the festival witnessed angry protests against the us-critical film " o.k. " by german director michael verhoeven . following a few more turbulent years , the berlin film festival underwent a further change with the emergence of the " forum " section in addition to its mainstay , " competion " category which ends in the ceremonial awarding of the golden and silver bears . the " forum " section provided a showcase in particular for documentary and experimental films .
it also offered a platform for films from countries , which until then had never been in the spotlight of international cinema . for ulrich gregor , longtime former head of the section , the new developments finally completed the berlinale 's claim to be a showcase for international cinema by including all forms and genres . " it included the whole spectrum - right from hollywood films to independent ones from various countries , europe and also non-european nations right to documentaries and other experimental forms , " gregor said . boost for german films bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the coveted golden and silver bears however , the " competition " category has remained the centerpiece of the berlinale with hits such as " la notte " by michelangelo antonioni or " hong gaoliang " by zhang yimou being premiered here .
it 's this section that has also traditionally drawn the stars , given the prestige attached to winning the golden and silver bears . current berlinale director dieter kosslick has ensured that the section continues to take center stage at the festival . " what we do is also cultivate a so-called connections business , where you really have to know a lot of people and where you have to understand them , " kosslick said .
" you have to speak their language and i think you have to have a certain passion for that . " part of kosslick 's passion in the past years has also been the focus on homegrown cinema - something that was ignored by his predecessor moritz de hadeln for a long time . for a few years now , german films have been and have been prominently visible in several categories at the berlinale . heinz badewitz , head of the " perspective german cinema " section , says the international movers and shakers in the movie business also come to germany to watch and potentially buy homegrown entries . " our target group includes international buyers and festival directors from the whole world who come here to see the latest in german film in a compact manner , " badewitz said . asian cinema in the spotlight another relatively new development at the berlinale in the past decade has been the increasing presence of films from asian countries .
movies from china , taiwan , korea and vietnam have celebrated huge successes at the film festival in recent years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from taiwanese film " the wayward cloud " by tsai ming liang moritz de hadeln , the previous berlinale director , who also encouraged asian cinema during his term , says political films in particular find a deep resonance in berlin , which was long politically and physically divided itself . " asian filmmakers have something exciting to offer at the moment .
one of the new things is a contemporary korean film , it 's about relations between north and south korea , " de hadeln said .
" it 's a film that would not have been made two or three years ago in korea . " a political festival at heart indeed , the berlinale has long been a political festival . in the 1970s and 80s in particular , it was a platform for eastern european filmmakers .
many films from the soviet union or from east germany , which were controversial at home , celebrated their international premieres at the berlinale . and , last year the film festival embraced another continent , which had never before been among the victors - the film " carmen khayelitsha " by south african mark dornford-may picked up the coveted golden bear . jochen kürten -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlinale strikes a serious note the berlin international film festival , which opens on feb .

nine-year-old mahjoub jemili 's complexion may not fit the stereotype , but his thick regional accent certainly bears it up . mahjoub the first has already faced one of the biggest tests of his reign as the children 's prince of wesseling .
he addressed cologne cardinal joachim meissner , which had invited wesseling 's carnival society to coffee .
and he was a success .
" he did his job very well .
and his command of the cologne dialect is a huge achievement , " remarked meissner .
" i ca n't do it at all .
when i try people just laugh - justifiably so . " nevertheless , the children 's prince bestowed his very own carnival medal on the cardinal .
the medal was decorated with his title , wesseling 's coat of arms , a soccer ball and a camel , in reference to his favorite hobby and his origin . born in the rhineland , the boy speaks fluent german in the dialect of the cologne area .
his dialect is so thick that many a german from beyond the rhine would n't understand him . it was work which brought jemili 's grandparents to wesseling , south of cologne , in 1970 , decades before mahjoub was born .
mahjoub is the third generation of wesselingers , after his parents , lamia and foued .
years of carnival-going though born in tunisia , mahjoub 's mother identifies more strongly with germany than with her country of birth , and she sees the choice of mahjoub as carnival prince as an example of successful integration .
but she and her husband were still a bit nervous when they got the news .

the people turned around and said , ' is that your son ?
that 's great ' ! " mahjoub is already well-seasoned when it comes to carnival .

nine-year-old mahjoub jemili 's complexion may not fit the stereotype , but his thick regional accent certainly bears it up . mahjoub the first has already faced one of the biggest tests of his reign as the children 's prince of wesseling .
he addressed cologne cardinal joachim meissner , which had invited wesseling 's carnival society to coffee .
and he was a success .
" he did his job very well .
and his command of the cologne dialect is a huge achievement , " remarked meissner .
" i ca n't do it at all .
when i try people just laugh - justifiably so . " nevertheless , the children 's prince bestowed his very own carnival medal on the cardinal .
the medal was decorated with his title , wesseling 's coat of arms , a soccer ball and a camel , in reference to his favorite hobby and his origin . born in the rhineland , the boy speaks fluent german in the dialect of the cologne area .
his dialect is so thick that many a german from beyond the rhine would n't understand him . it was work which brought jemili 's grandparents to wesseling , south of cologne , in 1970 , decades before mahjoub was born .
mahjoub is the third generation of wesselingers , after his parents , lamia and foued .
years of carnival-going though born in tunisia , mahjoub 's mother identifies more strongly with germany than with her country of birth , and she sees the choice of mahjoub as carnival prince as an example of successful integration .
but she and her husband were still a bit nervous when they got the news .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rhineland carnival reaches its apogee in late february this year " we were a little concerned and thought , ' what will happen when the boy goes on stage ?
will people accept it ? '
at a meeting of senior citizens , when the boy 's name was called out - ' here comes the children 's price mahjoub i ' - they did n't know what to make of it .
and then they saw the boy , " recalled lamia jemili .
" but once he was on stage and said the first word in cologne dialect , and then his speech .
the people turned around and said , ' is that your son ?
that 's great ' ! " mahjoub is already well-seasoned when it comes to carnival .
like many rhineland kids , he 's celebrated the event every year since he can remember - the first time at the age of eight months .
the jemilis have always been part of the wessling 's carnival society .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mahjoub , like other rhineland kids , started celebrating carnival at a young age " in my eyes , you have to want to be integrated , " said lamia jemili .
" and i say over and over again : language is essential .
if we had n't had our surroundings , were n't so linguistically able , if we had n't really had the will to become part of the wesseling community , it would n't have been possible at all . talk of integration goes over mahjoub 's head .

9 , deutsche welle takes a look back at the turbulent and glamour-filled history of the festival and its founding amid a war-ravaged germany . when the 56th edition of the berlinale gets underway on feb .
9 , stars , journalists , paparazzi and film producers will throng the glitzy potsdamer platz in downtown berlin , where most of the action takes place . the buzz and hoopla wo n't be that different from the first berlinale , which took place on june 6 , 1951 .
but the background certainly will be . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the official poster for the first berlinale in 1951 the first berlinale , which opened with alfred hitchcock 's " rebecca , " took place against a bleak backdrop of a bombed-out german capital .
six years after the end of world war ii , large parts of the city still lay in ruins .
reconstruction had begun , but berlin was still far removed from the pulsating metropolis it once had been in the 1920s . still the berlinale did manage to inject some much-needed excitement and flamboyance into postwar berlin .
ever since american cult actress joan fontaine , who starred in " rebecca , " glided down the red carpet at the first berlinale , the film festival rapidly established itself in the 1950s as an international meeting point for the stars of world cinema . it was n't just hollywood , but also celebrities from other big cinema nations and studios in germany , such as sophia lauren , errol flynn , hans albers and hildegard knef , who graced the berlinale .
the film festival became a byword for glamour and fashion . artsy and intellectual in the 1960s , it was n't just divas and hollywood celebrities making the headlines at the berlinale . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french director jean-luc godard the film festival transformed itself into a hub for artsy and intelligent cinema with directors like jean-luc godard and francois truffaut presenting their works in berlin . in the politically-laden 1970s , the reverberations of the 1968 student revolts and the vietnam war made an impact on the berlinale too .
the festival witnessed angry protests against the us-critical film " o.k. " by german director michael verhoeven . following a few more turbulent years , the berlin film festival underwent a further change with the emergence of the " forum " section in addition to its mainstay , " competion " category which ends in the ceremonial awarding of the golden and silver bears . the " forum " section provided a showcase in particular for documentary and experimental films .
it also offered a platform for films from countries , which until then had never been in the spotlight of international cinema . for ulrich gregor , longtime former head of the section , the new developments finally completed the berlinale 's claim to be a showcase for international cinema by including all forms and genres . " it included the whole spectrum - right from hollywood films to independent ones from various countries , europe and also non-european nations right to documentaries and other experimental forms , " gregor said . boost for german films bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the coveted golden and silver bears however , the " competition " category has remained the centerpiece of the berlinale with hits such as " la notte " by michelangelo antonioni or " hong gaoliang " by zhang yimou being premiered here .
it 's this section that has also traditionally drawn the stars , given the prestige attached to winning the golden and silver bears . current berlinale director dieter kosslick has ensured that the section continues to take center stage at the festival . " what we do is also cultivate a so-called connections business , where you really have to know a lot of people and where you have to understand them , " kosslick said .
" you have to speak their language and i think you have to have a certain passion for that . " part of kosslick 's passion in the past years has also been the focus on homegrown cinema - something that was ignored by his predecessor moritz de hadeln for a long time . for a few years now , german films have been and have been prominently visible in several categories at the berlinale . heinz badewitz , head of the " perspective german cinema " section , says the international movers and shakers in the movie business also come to germany to watch and potentially buy homegrown entries . " our target group includes international buyers and festival directors from the whole world who come here to see the latest in german film in a compact manner , " badewitz said . asian cinema in the spotlight another relatively new development at the berlinale in the past decade has been the increasing presence of films from asian countries .
movies from china , taiwan , korea and vietnam have celebrated huge successes at the film festival in recent years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from taiwanese film " the wayward cloud " by tsai ming liang moritz de hadeln , the previous berlinale director , who also encouraged asian cinema during his term , says political films in particular find a deep resonance in berlin , which was long politically and physically divided itself . " asian filmmakers have something exciting to offer at the moment .
one of the new things is a contemporary korean film , it 's about relations between north and south korea , " de hadeln said .
" it 's a film that would not have been made two or three years ago in korea . " a political festival at heart indeed , the berlinale has long been a political festival . in the 1970s and 80s in particular , it was a platform for eastern european filmmakers .
many films from the soviet union or from east germany , which were controversial at home , celebrated their international premieres at the berlinale . and , last year the film festival embraced another continent , which had never before been among the victors - the film " carmen khayelitsha " by south african mark dornford-may picked up the coveted golden bear . jochen kürten -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlinale strikes a serious note the berlin international film festival , which opens on feb .

9 , deutsche welle takes a look back at the turbulent and glamour-filled history of the festival and its founding amid a war-ravaged germany . when the 56th edition of the berlinale gets underway on feb .
9 , stars , journalists , paparazzi and film producers will throng the glitzy potsdamer platz in downtown berlin , where most of the action takes place . the buzz and hoopla wo n't be that different from the first berlinale , which took place on june 6 , 1951 .
but the background certainly will be . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the official poster for the first berlinale in 1951 the first berlinale , which opened with alfred hitchcock 's " rebecca , " took place against a bleak backdrop of a bombed-out german capital .
six years after the end of world war ii , large parts of the city still lay in ruins .
reconstruction had begun , but berlin was still far removed from the pulsating metropolis it once had been in the 1920s . still the berlinale did manage to inject some much-needed excitement and flamboyance into postwar berlin .
ever since american cult actress joan fontaine , who starred in " rebecca , " glided down the red carpet at the first berlinale , the film festival rapidly established itself in the 1950s as an international meeting point for the stars of world cinema . it was n't just hollywood , but also celebrities from other big cinema nations and studios in germany , such as sophia lauren , errol flynn , hans albers and hildegard knef , who graced the berlinale .
the film festival became a byword for glamour and fashion . artsy and intellectual in the 1960s , it was n't just divas and hollywood celebrities making the headlines at the berlinale . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french director jean-luc godard the film festival transformed itself into a hub for artsy and intelligent cinema with directors like jean-luc godard and francois truffaut presenting their works in berlin . in the politically-laden 1970s , the reverberations of the 1968 student revolts and the vietnam war made an impact on the berlinale too .
the festival witnessed angry protests against the us-critical film " o.k. " by german director michael verhoeven . following a few more turbulent years , the berlin film festival underwent a further change with the emergence of the " forum " section in addition to its mainstay , " competion " category which ends in the ceremonial awarding of the golden and silver bears . the " forum " section provided a showcase in particular for documentary and experimental films .
it also offered a platform for films from countries , which until then had never been in the spotlight of international cinema . for ulrich gregor , longtime former head of the section , the new developments finally completed the berlinale 's claim to be a showcase for international cinema by including all forms and genres . " it included the whole spectrum - right from hollywood films to independent ones from various countries , europe and also non-european nations right to documentaries and other experimental forms , " gregor said . boost for german films bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the coveted golden and silver bears however , the " competition " category has remained the centerpiece of the berlinale with hits such as " la notte " by michelangelo antonioni or " hong gaoliang " by zhang yimou being premiered here .
it 's this section that has also traditionally drawn the stars , given the prestige attached to winning the golden and silver bears . current berlinale director dieter kosslick has ensured that the section continues to take center stage at the festival . " what we do is also cultivate a so-called connections business , where you really have to know a lot of people and where you have to understand them , " kosslick said .
" you have to speak their language and i think you have to have a certain passion for that . " part of kosslick 's passion in the past years has also been the focus on homegrown cinema - something that was ignored by his predecessor moritz de hadeln for a long time . for a few years now , german films have been and have been prominently visible in several categories at the berlinale . heinz badewitz , head of the " perspective german cinema " section , says the international movers and shakers in the movie business also come to germany to watch and potentially buy homegrown entries . " our target group includes international buyers and festival directors from the whole world who come here to see the latest in german film in a compact manner , " badewitz said . asian cinema in the spotlight another relatively new development at the berlinale in the past decade has been the increasing presence of films from asian countries .
movies from china , taiwan , korea and vietnam have celebrated huge successes at the film festival in recent years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from taiwanese film " the wayward cloud " by tsai ming liang moritz de hadeln , the previous berlinale director , who also encouraged asian cinema during his term , says political films in particular find a deep resonance in berlin , which was long politically and physically divided itself . " asian filmmakers have something exciting to offer at the moment .
one of the new things is a contemporary korean film , it 's about relations between north and south korea , " de hadeln said .
" it 's a film that would not have been made two or three years ago in korea . " a political festival at heart indeed , the berlinale has long been a political festival . in the 1970s and 80s in particular , it was a platform for eastern european filmmakers .
many films from the soviet union or from east germany , which were controversial at home , celebrated their international premieres at the berlinale . and , last year the film festival embraced another continent , which had never before been among the victors - the film " carmen khayelitsha " by south african mark dornford-may picked up the coveted golden bear . jochen kürten -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlinale strikes a serious note the berlin international film festival , which opens on feb .

nine-year-old mahjoub jemili 's complexion may not fit the stereotype , but his thick regional accent certainly bears it up . mahjoub the first has already faced one of the biggest tests of his reign as the children 's prince of wesseling .
he addressed cologne cardinal joachim meissner , which had invited wesseling 's carnival society to coffee .
and he was a success .
" he did his job very well .
and his command of the cologne dialect is a huge achievement , " remarked meissner .
" i ca n't do it at all .
when i try people just laugh - justifiably so . " nevertheless , the children 's prince bestowed his very own carnival medal on the cardinal .
the medal was decorated with his title , wesseling 's coat of arms , a soccer ball and a camel , in reference to his favorite hobby and his origin . born in the rhineland , the boy speaks fluent german in the dialect of the cologne area .
his dialect is so thick that many a german from beyond the rhine would n't understand him . it was work which brought jemili 's grandparents to wesseling , south of cologne , in 1970 , decades before mahjoub was born .
mahjoub is the third generation of wesselingers , after his parents , lamia and foued .
years of carnival-going though born in tunisia , mahjoub 's mother identifies more strongly with germany than with her country of birth , and she sees the choice of mahjoub as carnival prince as an example of successful integration .
but she and her husband were still a bit nervous when they got the news .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rhineland carnival reaches its apogee in late february this year " we were a little concerned and thought , ' what will happen when the boy goes on stage ?
will people accept it ? '
at a meeting of senior citizens , when the boy 's name was called out - ' here comes the children 's price mahjoub i ' - they did n't know what to make of it .
and then they saw the boy , " recalled lamia jemili .
" but once he was on stage and said the first word in cologne dialect , and then his speech .
the people turned around and said , ' is that your son ?
that 's great ' ! " mahjoub is already well-seasoned when it comes to carnival .
like many rhineland kids , he 's celebrated the event every year since he can remember - the first time at the age of eight months .
the jemilis have always been part of the wessling 's carnival society .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mahjoub , like other rhineland kids , started celebrating carnival at a young age " in my eyes , you have to want to be integrated , " said lamia jemili .
" and i say over and over again : language is essential .

9 , deutsche welle takes a look back at the turbulent and glamour-filled history of the festival and its founding amid a war-ravaged germany . when the 56th edition of the berlinale gets underway on feb .
9 , stars , journalists , paparazzi and film producers will throng the glitzy potsdamer platz in downtown berlin , where most of the action takes place . the buzz and hoopla wo n't be that different from the first berlinale , which took place on june 6 , 1951 .
but the background certainly will be . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the official poster for the first berlinale in 1951 the first berlinale , which opened with alfred hitchcock 's " rebecca , " took place against a bleak backdrop of a bombed-out german capital .
six years after the end of world war ii , large parts of the city still lay in ruins .
reconstruction had begun , but berlin was still far removed from the pulsating metropolis it once had been in the 1920s . still the berlinale did manage to inject some much-needed excitement and flamboyance into postwar berlin .
ever since american cult actress joan fontaine , who starred in " rebecca , " glided down the red carpet at the first berlinale , the film festival rapidly established itself in the 1950s as an international meeting point for the stars of world cinema . it was n't just hollywood , but also celebrities from other big cinema nations and studios in germany , such as sophia lauren , errol flynn , hans albers and hildegard knef , who graced the berlinale .
the film festival became a byword for glamour and fashion . artsy and intellectual in the 1960s , it was n't just divas and hollywood celebrities making the headlines at the berlinale . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french director jean-luc godard the film festival transformed itself into a hub for artsy and intelligent cinema with directors like jean-luc godard and francois truffaut presenting their works in berlin . in the politically-laden 1970s , the reverberations of the 1968 student revolts and the vietnam war made an impact on the berlinale too .
the festival witnessed angry protests against the us-critical film " o.k. " by german director michael verhoeven . following a few more turbulent years , the berlin film festival underwent a further change with the emergence of the " forum " section in addition to its mainstay , " competion " category which ends in the ceremonial awarding of the golden and silver bears . the " forum " section provided a showcase in particular for documentary and experimental films .
it also offered a platform for films from countries , which until then had never been in the spotlight of international cinema . for ulrich gregor , longtime former head of the section , the new developments finally completed the berlinale 's claim to be a showcase for international cinema by including all forms and genres . " it included the whole spectrum - right from hollywood films to independent ones from various countries , europe and also non-european nations right to documentaries and other experimental forms , " gregor said . boost for german films bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the coveted golden and silver bears however , the " competition " category has remained the centerpiece of the berlinale with hits such as " la notte " by michelangelo antonioni or " hong gaoliang " by zhang yimou being premiered here .
it 's this section that has also traditionally drawn the stars , given the prestige attached to winning the golden and silver bears . current berlinale director dieter kosslick has ensured that the section continues to take center stage at the festival . " what we do is also cultivate a so-called connections business , where you really have to know a lot of people and where you have to understand them , " kosslick said .
" you have to speak their language and i think you have to have a certain passion for that . " part of kosslick 's passion in the past years has also been the focus on homegrown cinema - something that was ignored by his predecessor moritz de hadeln for a long time . for a few years now , german films have been and have been prominently visible in several categories at the berlinale . heinz badewitz , head of the " perspective german cinema " section , says the international movers and shakers in the movie business also come to germany to watch and potentially buy homegrown entries . " our target group includes international buyers and festival directors from the whole world who come here to see the latest in german film in a compact manner , " badewitz said . asian cinema in the spotlight another relatively new development at the berlinale in the past decade has been the increasing presence of films from asian countries .
movies from china , taiwan , korea and vietnam have celebrated huge successes at the film festival in recent years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from taiwanese film " the wayward cloud " by tsai ming liang moritz de hadeln , the previous berlinale director , who also encouraged asian cinema during his term , says political films in particular find a deep resonance in berlin , which was long politically and physically divided itself . " asian filmmakers have something exciting to offer at the moment .
one of the new things is a contemporary korean film , it 's about relations between north and south korea , " de hadeln said .

" let the hostages go immediately , " the chairman of the islamic council for germany , ali kizilkaya , wrote in the bild am sonntag newspaper . " it is regrettable that religion is being abused once again and all of islam is brought into disrepute .
our thoughts are with the families of the two hostages . " the deputy general secretary of the islamic group milli gorus , mustafa yeneroglu , said bräunlich and nitzschke , had gone to iraq to assist its people . " the fact that two people have been kidnapped who have helped iraq economically with their work demonstrates how absurd this act is , " he said . the president of the turkish-german muslim organization ditib , ridvan cakir , said the kidnapping marked a clear violation of the tenets of islam . " i call on the kidnappers to let the two germans go at once , " he said . and the chairman of the central council of muslims in germany , nadeem elyas , said that in light of berlin 's fierce opposition to the us-led iraq war in 2003 , the german engineers should be seen as innocent bystanders . " there is no logic in the world that could justify the kidnapping .
the german people are linked to the iraqi people in friendship - after all it was the german government that opposed the iraq war at the time , " he said in a statement . the fate of german engineers rene bräunlich and thomas nitzschke remained uncertain . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier meanwhile used al jazeera friday to issue a new appeal for the release of the two engineers . " german chancellor angela merkel and myself call upon you , on behalf of all germans , to release the two hostages without subjecting them to any pain , " steinmeier said . bräunlich and nitzschke , who work for german gas equipment installation company cryotec , were abducted near a key oil refinery in the northern town of baiji on january 24 by armed men in military uniform . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gate of baiji plant where iraqi insurgents kidnapped the two german engineers their kidnappers threatened on tuesday to kill them unless berlin cut all links with baghdad within 72 hours . president horst köhler said on friday he was " very concerned " by the kidnapping .
a foreign ministry spokesman described the situation as " extremely serious " . amid growing concern at home , he said germany was making all possible efforts to ensure the release of the two men but declined to " comment on or interpret the kidnappers ' ultimatum " . more detainee releases seen as leverage in hostage crisis iraq on sunday freed more than 50 male prisoners but held back female detainees as the fate of us and german hostages remained unknown amid a tight security clampdown for the main shiite festival .
the us military said it had released 50 male detainees , but later the iraqi government said 53 prisoners were freed .
" there was no female detainee release today , " the spokesman for the us detention facility in iraq told reporters .
" today 's release was done after a review by the joint board and at this stage i can not offer any other details . it is believed the us military release of the detainees was an attempt to gain some leverage in the kidnappings of bräunlich and nitzschke and us reporter jill carroll . last month , iraq released more than 400 detainees , including five women , in a move widely seen as a response to demands from the kidnappers of carroll for the freeing of all female prisoners in iraq . both us and iraqi spokesmen strongly denied any link at the time . shortly after those releases , a new videotape from the kidnappers was broadcast by al jazeera in which they broadened their demand to include all detainees , male or female . " the journalist called on her family , her colleagues and americans throughout the world to ask the us military authorities and the iraqi interior ministry to free all iraqi prisoners , saying this could contribute to her release , " the channel 's presenter said . us reporter still missing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emergency teams in and outside iraq are working to find and free the hostages .
carroll , who was working for the christian science monitor , was abducted in baghdad on january 7 by a group calling itself the brigades of vengeance as she traveled to a meeting with a leading sunni arab politician . " we have no new information on the hostage , " a us military spokesman said referring to carroll . the three hostages are among nearly 250 foreigners kidnapped in iraq since the march 2003 invasion .
many of them have been killed . the fate of two kenyan telecommunications engineers abducted last month and two iraqi television journalists seized wednesday also remained unknown . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : video shows german hostages alive a video of the two german engineers kidnapped in northern iraq was broadcast by al jazeera on friday .

as long , that is , as the school in question is the nearest state school designated by the local education authority .
pupils attending religious or grammar schools by choice have no such entitlement .
whether they get free or subsidised buses or have to pay the full cost is entirely at the discretion of local councils .
torbay council stopped providing this service free in september 2005 .
parents are currently expected to pay up to half of the cost , meaning each parent pays about £ 200 a year .
and now the council is reviewing its policy again .
it could lead to support being withdrawn completely - and parents having to find £ 400 for each child who attends the school .
at st cuthbert mayne comprehensive school in torquay , the staff have noticed a fall in its intake because of the policy .
the school is joint anglican and roman catholic .
parent sue witchell , who has three children who attend the school , has started to pay the cost of sending her 12-year-old daughter rebecca there as she has just started there .
" if the prices increase i think parents will be discouraged from sending their children to the school , particularly if they have more than one child going because it will cost them a lot of money . "
tony jordan , of torbay borough council , said : " for families in the future it may mean that some will not be able to choose the school they go to and that a consequence of the difficult choices we have to make . "
the council , which says it has had a tough budget settlement , says it has three options - keep things as they are , withdraw more of the subsidy -lrb- and increase the amount parents pay for school transport -rrb- , or scrap it completely .
torbay mp adrian sanders says he does not agree with the principle of faith schools , but would defend parents rights to send their children to them if that was the system favoured by the local education authority .
he has urged torbay borough council to be consistent .
he says it needs to decide if it wants the current mix of schools and should continue to help parents if they choose to send them to a selective or denominational one .

secondary school children are legally entitled to free school transport if they live more than three miles away from school .
as long , that is , as the school in question is the nearest state school designated by the local education authority .
pupils attending religious or grammar schools by choice have no such entitlement .
whether they get free or subsidised buses or have to pay the full cost is entirely at the discretion of local councils .
torbay council stopped providing this service free in september 2005 .
parents are currently expected to pay up to half of the cost , meaning each parent pays about £ 200 a year .
and now the council is reviewing its policy again .
it could lead to support being withdrawn completely - and parents having to find £ 400 for each child who attends the school .
at st cuthbert mayne comprehensive school in torquay , the staff have noticed a fall in its intake because of the policy .
the school is joint anglican and roman catholic .
parent sue witchell , who has three children who attend the school , has started to pay the cost of sending her 12-year-old daughter rebecca there as she has just started there .
" if the prices increase i think parents will be discouraged from sending their children to the school , particularly if they have more than one child going because it will cost them a lot of money . "
tony jordan , of torbay borough council , said : " for families in the future it may mean that some will not be able to choose the school they go to and that a consequence of the difficult choices we have to make . "
the council , which says it has had a tough budget settlement , says it has three options - keep things as they are , withdraw more of the subsidy -lrb- and increase the amount parents pay for school transport -rrb- , or scrap it completely .
torbay mp adrian sanders says he does not agree with the principle of faith schools , but would defend parents rights to send their children to them if that was the system favoured by the local education authority .
he has urged torbay borough council to be consistent .
he says it needs to decide if it wants the current mix of schools and should continue to help parents if they choose to send them to a selective or denominational one .
" you have choice so long as that can be exercised .
that choice is taken away if you put a financial barrier is put in its place . "
a decision on whether subsidies will continue or be scrapped will be made after the budget for the next financial year is set in march 2006 .

estimated daily average requirements are 2,550 for men , and 1,940 for women .

people are getting used to speed limit this season grindelwald , in switzerland , has become the first resort to introduce a 30km / h speed limit on one of its runs and other resorts are watching closely .
a random survey of two dozens resorts by bbc news reveals all are looking at the experiment and some may now impose further speed limits in certain areas .
the issue has sharply divided the ski community ; some welcome the safety move as long overdue while others fear it will severely curtail their freedom .
speed kills it follows a growing number of collisions caused by people skiing too fast as the slopes become ever more crowded .
in france last season the number of collisions on the slopes went up 15 % and included several fatalities .
susanne daxelhoffer from the area 's tourist office told the bbc news website said the grindelwald slope had been a great success .
susanne daxelhoffer says it is what skiers want " we did it because that 's what people wanted , " she said .
" the project is based on complaints of people skiing too fast and therefore fulfils a need " .
the slope in question is divided by safety netting and skiers opt to ski down an easy blue run with a 30km / h limit or go for a more difficult red slope without a restriction .
a random selection of people i canvassed on the slope in grindelwald all thought it was a good idea .
" it 's particularly good if you have young children and want them to be able to ski without being hit by out of control skiers going too fast , " british skier and father of three , richard slater , told me .
angry reaction however , not everyone welcomes the move and it has sparked a fierce debate on ski chatrooms on the internet .
the ski club of great britain has more than 30,000 members and though many are broadly supportive others fear it will restrict their freedom .
one person has even threatened to give up skiing altogether if there are further restrictions .
on another internet chatroom , snowheads , feelings have been running just as high with many critical of new rules and regulations .
" although on the surface it seems a good idea people should have the freedom to go as fast as they like as long as they are in control , " says iain martin the director of natives , the organisation representing british resort workers in the alps .
" people want to live freely in the mountains not be told what to do all the time and if some resorts introduced speed limits people would just go elsewhere . "

people are getting used to speed limit this season grindelwald , in switzerland , has become the first resort to introduce a 30km / h speed limit on one of its runs and other resorts are watching closely .
a random survey of two dozens resorts by bbc news reveals all are looking at the experiment and some may now impose further speed limits in certain areas .
the issue has sharply divided the ski community ; some welcome the safety move as long overdue while others fear it will severely curtail their freedom .
speed kills it follows a growing number of collisions caused by people skiing too fast as the slopes become ever more crowded .
in france last season the number of collisions on the slopes went up 15 % and included several fatalities .
susanne daxelhoffer from the area 's tourist office told the bbc news website said the grindelwald slope had been a great success .
susanne daxelhoffer says it is what skiers want " we did it because that 's what people wanted , " she said .
" the project is based on complaints of people skiing too fast and therefore fulfils a need " .
the slope in question is divided by safety netting and skiers opt to ski down an easy blue run with a 30km / h limit or go for a more difficult red slope without a restriction .
a random selection of people i canvassed on the slope in grindelwald all thought it was a good idea .
" it 's particularly good if you have young children and want them to be able to ski without being hit by out of control skiers going too fast , " british skier and father of three , richard slater , told me .
angry reaction however , not everyone welcomes the move and it has sparked a fierce debate on ski chatrooms on the internet .
the ski club of great britain has more than 30,000 members and though many are broadly supportive others fear it will restrict their freedom .
one person has even threatened to give up skiing altogether if there are further restrictions .
on another internet chatroom , snowheads , feelings have been running just as high with many critical of new rules and regulations .
" although on the surface it seems a good idea people should have the freedom to go as fast as they like as long as they are in control , " says iain martin the director of natives , the organisation representing british resort workers in the alps .
" people want to live freely in the mountains not be told what to do all the time and if some resorts introduced speed limits people would just go elsewhere . "

the immature sperm whale became stuck on mud off kilnsea , on spurn point , east yorkshire , on saturday morning .
local people raised the alarm and lifeboat crews , coastguards and firefighters all tried to help the stricken animal .
as the tide reached its lowest point in the afternoon the whale was virtually clear of the water .
some reports said it had a large gash on its side .
sperm whales the sperm whale is a toothed whale that lives in pods it has a huge brain that weighs about 20 pounds it is the largest brain of any animal the fictional moby dick was a sperm whale adult males grow to be about 50-60 feet long sperm whales are carnivores that mostly eat giant squid a humber coastguard spokeswoman said arrangements were being made for the whale 's carcass to be removed .
the local lifeboat crew and residents said the animal could be seen struggling to free itself before the water levels dropped .
lifeboat coxswain dave steenvorden said the water was too shallow to launch his boat .
one kilnsea resident said : " it just seems to have come up the estuary and got itself stuck .
" mid morning it was moving around - flapping and trying to get itself free .
you could see it clearly , blowing from its air hole .
" everyone came out to have a look but there 's nothing much anyone could do .
it 's quite sad really . "
crowds a crowd of people gathered close to watch the rescue attempts as expert teams travelled to the scene from around the country .
among those assisting was the british divers marine life rescue organisation which was involved in the operation to release the whale stuck in the river thames in central london last month .
the group said on its website that the whale in the humber was female and had not been injured .
it said the whale 's blowhole was about 2ft under the surface of the mud after it had dug itself in while thrashing around .
in 1997 , two sperm whales became trapped in the humber a short distance from saturday 's incident .

the immature sperm whale became stuck on mud off kilnsea , on spurn point , east yorkshire , on saturday morning .
local people raised the alarm and lifeboat crews , coastguards and firefighters all tried to help the stricken animal .
as the tide reached its lowest point in the afternoon the whale was virtually clear of the water .
some reports said it had a large gash on its side .
sperm whales the sperm whale is a toothed whale that lives in pods it has a huge brain that weighs about 20 pounds it is the largest brain of any animal the fictional moby dick was a sperm whale adult males grow to be about 50-60 feet long sperm whales are carnivores that mostly eat giant squid a humber coastguard spokeswoman said arrangements were being made for the whale 's carcass to be removed .
the local lifeboat crew and residents said the animal could be seen struggling to free itself before the water levels dropped .
lifeboat coxswain dave steenvorden said the water was too shallow to launch his boat .
one kilnsea resident said : " it just seems to have come up the estuary and got itself stuck .
" mid morning it was moving around - flapping and trying to get itself free .
you could see it clearly , blowing from its air hole .
" everyone came out to have a look but there 's nothing much anyone could do .
it 's quite sad really . "
crowds a crowd of people gathered close to watch the rescue attempts as expert teams travelled to the scene from around the country .
among those assisting was the british divers marine life rescue organisation which was involved in the operation to release the whale stuck in the river thames in central london last month .
the group said on its website that the whale in the humber was female and had not been injured .
it said the whale 's blowhole was about 2ft under the surface of the mud after it had dug itself in while thrashing around .
in 1997 , two sperm whales became trapped in the humber a short distance from saturday 's incident .

the immature sperm whale became stuck on mud off kilnsea , on spurn point , east yorkshire , on saturday morning .
local people raised the alarm and lifeboat crews , coastguards and firefighters all tried to help the stricken animal .
as the tide reached its lowest point in the afternoon the whale was virtually clear of the water .
some reports said it had a large gash on its side .

the local lifeboat crew and residents said the animal could be seen struggling to free itself before the water levels dropped .
lifeboat coxswain dave steenvorden said the water was too shallow to launch his boat .
one kilnsea resident said : " it just seems to have come up the estuary and got itself stuck .
" mid morning it was moving around - flapping and trying to get itself free .
you could see it clearly , blowing from its air hole .
" everyone came out to have a look but there 's nothing much anyone could do .
it 's quite sad really . "
crowds a crowd of people gathered close to watch the rescue attempts as expert teams travelled to the scene from around the country .

swansea university researchers say the flow rate , or the speed at which the constantly travelling glaciers move , has doubled in two years .
scientists have warned the findings could mean the ice cap is melting even more quickly than previously thought .
a report published by the uk government last week also expressed fears of the impact of climate change .
the swansea-led study , which involved scientists from leeds and sheffield universities , looked at the kangerdlugssuaq glacier in east greenland and the helheim glacier , 186 miles away .
the two glaciers had remained relatively stable throughout the 1990s despite changes in other greenland glaciers .
but both have now begun accelerating at very similar rates .
dr luckman said that greenpeace activists have previously raised concerns at the speed at which the kangerdlugssuaq was moving . "
the time of the disappearance of the greenland ice sheet will be quicker than that suggested " dr adrian luckman but he added : " this is the first time we have proved beyond doubt that it is happening . "
there are two possible reasons for the acceleration , said dr luckman .
either an increase in surface melt-water is lubricating the passage of the glaciers or rising ocean temperatures .
" we have no data on ocean temperatures but we do n't find any correlation between the rate of surface melt and the acceleration , " he said .
in the report , the glaciology group at swansea 's school of the environment and society has said : " the period of continued warming and thinning appears to have primed these glaciers for a step-change in dynamics not included in current models .
' future stability ' " we should expect further greenland outlet glaciers to follow suit . "
dr luckman said that the results indicated that , " the time of the disappearance of the greenland ice sheet will be quicker than that suggested . "
the researchers studied images from satellite radar tracking technology .
group leader , professor tavi murray , added : " results from this and our other work will feed into models that will predict the future stability of the greenland ice sheet and its impacts .
" greenland also has the potential to be a major net contributor to ocean freshening which could impact on ocean circulation and european climate over a relatively short time-scale . "
a report published by the uk government last week expressed fears that the greenland ice sheet is likely to melt , leading sea levels to rise by 7m -lrb- 23ft -rrb- over 1,000 years .
the poorest countries would be most vulnerable to these effects , it added .

many teachers believed the changes have " dumbed down " the exam , an interim report by the qualifications and curriculum authority -lrb- qca -rrb- found .
meanwhile others saw the reduction in content as a " positive move in terms of helping all students to succeed " , the report said .
the qca reformed maths a-level in 2003 after exam entries slumped .
the report stressed that cutting the subject content was the most controversial issue among teachers .
its report also identified a " clever core " of students who were dominating the subject in the sixth-form .
while the number of a-level maths students has fallen by 7,000 in the past five years , the number of a grades has risen by around 3,500 , it found .
content controversy at the time of the reforms , the qca denied it was making the exam easier .
but this report into the state of the subject found large numbers of teachers disagreed .
" there is a split in the opinions of teaching staff about the role of a-level mathematics and also in their reactions to the new specifications , " it said .
" the split does not seem to be easily reconcilable . "
it said one group viewed moves to make the subject " more accessible " as an " unacceptable ' dumbing down ' of a-level mathematics " which made it " something that makes it unattractive to their very able students " .
this group of teachers see it as a subject where " the maintenance of a high level of demand and wide scope of content are paramount " , the report said .
however , other teachers found the reduced content gave them more time to cover material .
the report concluded there is not likely to be a " middle way " between stretching the most academic pupils and attracting less able ones .
but it added it was the less able students who must " most be appealed to " if the a-level is to " significantly " increase its participation and achievement rates .
bad experiences the study also found pupils dropped maths because of bad experience at gcses and because of its daunting reputation at a-level .
boys were more likely to value it as a useful a-level subject and girls to be concerned whether they could cope , researchers said .
the qca insisted the reforms made the subject " more flexible " but not " easier " .
it also pointed out this was an only an interim report and the changes would continued to be looked at over the next 18 months .
a qca spokeswoman added : " we do recognise that post-16 participation in mathematics is a cause for concern and we are looking to understand why that is and what we can do to improve this .
" but we will not do that by dumbing down mathematics . "

bbc news -pipe- uk -pipe- education -pipe- head to head : schools white paper bbc news / education graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- uk contents : england -pipe- northern ireland -pipe- scotland -pipe- wales -pipe- uk politics -pipe- education -pipe- magazine sunday , 5 february 2006 , 10:27 gmt head to head : schools white paper the political to-ing and fro-ing over the merits of the government 's plans for england 's schools continues .
here , the schools minister and an outspoken backbench critic set out their viewpoints .
jacqui smith " given some of the things that have been written and said , you could be forgiven for thinking there is disagreement about the biggest challenge we face in education between those who have doubts about parts of the education white paper and those of us who do not .
there is not .
we all strongly agree that it is breaking the link between poverty and underachievement at school .
it is vital we keep sight of this big picture as the debate unfolds .
let us not reduce the white paper to an overly technical debate about the ins and outs of " trust schools " .
yes , there are details to work out and we will continue to explain and discuss our proposals with colleagues .
but we must remember that despite the real progress schools have made over the last eight years , nearly 75 % of pupils entitled to free school meals -lrb- the poorest children -rrb- still do not get five or more good gcses .
this is something we have to change .
and we will only change this by ensuring that every school is a school that parents are happy to send their children to .
not one where success is determined by intake , but where it is determined purely by the quality of leadership and the quality of teaching and learning .
and where every child gets the support and encouragement they need to succeed in life .
tackling poor standards the bulk of our proposals in the white paper have broad support .
the vast majority of teachers , school leaders and parents believe teachers should have unambiguous rights when it comes to tackling poor behaviour .
it is common sense , too , that if we want to raise standards , teachers need more flexibility to personalise learning according to the needs of their pupils - another key part of our reforms .
but i recognise that there are areas we need to explain better , especially when it comes to trust schools .
i want to make it absolutely clear that our proposals are about tackling poor standards and making sure the most disadvantaged children get to access the best our education system has to offer .
trust schools are not a leap in the dark or a change in direction .
they build on what we have learnt in the last eight years and crucially what we have seen working well , particularly in deprived areas .
by empowering schools to formalise relationships with local partners , trusts will help schools use the energy and talent in their communities - in voluntary groups , charities , universities and in business foundations - to raise standards .
giving teachers the freedoms and support they need to develop high quality teaching and learning approaches that meet the needs of every pupil .
and ensuring schools have the flexibility and active encouragement to deliver learning differently according to the needs of the pupils they serve .
we know this approach will work because our proposals are based on a proven track record .
innovations specialist schools already work with external partners and other schools and the results speak for themselves .
in specialist schools serving our most deprived communities , 46 % of pupils got five good gcses compared to 36 % in non-specialist schools serving similar areas .
similarly , we have seen that schools that federate with weaker schools can have a huge impact on achievement . "
our proposals for trust schools are our commitment to high standards and high expectations for each and every child " jacqui smith two years ago , thomas telford school formed a three year federation with madeley court school , the worst performing school in telford .
after only one year , the number of pupils getting five good gcses rose from 22 % to 55 % .
and academies , working with external partners and developing an individual ethos to meet the needs of their communities , are improving at three times the national average .
it makes sense for more schools to benefit from these innovations .
but i want to make it clear that we are not imposing trusts on schools .
no school will be forced to accept a trust , although where a school is failing , a trust would be one option for the local authority to consider .
our proposals are about giving schools more freedom , not about taking their autonomy away .
similarly , we will not dictate to schools what their trust must look like .
one of the main benefits of trusts will be that they will enable schools to work with a range of partners to develop a distinct ethos that will meet the needs of their local community .
but it is up to schools , working with parents , external partners and the local authority , to determine what this means in practice .
like thorpe bay school in southend , which , under the excellent leadership of head teacher jean alder , has recently emerged from special measures .
along with southend local authority and prospects college -lrb- a leading provider of vocational education -rrb- , the school is currently considering the trust model as the next step to drive up standards .
by working with a local partner such as prospects college , thorpe bay will also be able to offer leading edge vocational provision , as well as more traditional academic studies , broadening choice for pupils and developing an ethos that meets the needs of parents and the local community .
or monkseaton school , which announced last week that it would like to form a trust to consolidate its existing successful partnership with the open university and microsoft .
this will enable the college to support the use of higher education modules in secondary education , not only in monkseaton school , but in other schools across the country .
experience the best our proposals for trust schools are our commitment to high standards and high expectations for each and every child .
if we want to break the link between poverty and underachievement , then excellent results and high expectations must come as standard in every school .
pioneering schools , heads and teachers have shown us over the past eight years how we can make this happen .
the challenge now is to ensure that every pupil gets to experience the best our education system has to offer . "
david chaytor " the education system in england is now widely recognised as a success .
that 's the first sentence of the first chapter of the education white paper .
most of the document then describes ways of building on this success with policies that have been widely welcomed .
however , some sections of the white paper are strong on assertion and weak on evidence .
they go some way beyond the 2005 election manifesto .
they have triggered an exceptional level of opposition amongst labour mps .
it is n't because we 're against innovation .
most of us , as parents and politicians , have welcomed the innovations of the last few years and are keen to see more .
we all support the prime minister 's relentless focus on standards , discipline and equality of opportunity .
we 're just not convinced that the structural changes proposed provide all the answers .
or even that all of the consequences of a system of " independent state schools " have been fully thought through .
having worked so hard to improve so much in the last eight years , teachers , support staff , school governors and lea professionals are now told they ca n't be trusted to carry on improving without being subject to wholesale opting out .
this sounds dangerously ideological .
' sorted and segregated ' the government tends to confuse the quality of management with the structure of ownership .
a good school needs , above all , a first class head teacher with strong support from a range of professionals .
a good school system needs an agreed framework in which all staff work together to spread best practice .
shuffling the shareholders , stimulating yet more competition and changing the nameplate on the front door can not get away from these basic educational facts of life .
the white paper proposes a structure of independent schools , linked with powerful sponsors , subject to an impotent code of practice on school admissions . "
selection by ethos will become the 11-plus of the 21st century " david chaytor mp it does not take a genius to work out that schools , driven entirely by the pressure of league tables , are likely to focus primarily on their own survival .
covert selection will be the order of the day .
our national aptitude for creating hierarchy from diversity will kick in with a vengeance as the specialisms of the school , coupled with the power of the sponsor , will send strong signals to parents as to whether the " ethos " of the school will be suitable for their child .
our 11-year-olds will be sifted , sorted and segregated into a multi-tiered set of secondary schools where ethos is increasingly defined by class , faith and ethnicity .
selection by ethos will become the 11-plus of the 21st century .
a free bus pass can provide an escape route for the few but ca n't guarantee a decent education for the many .
is all this inevitable ?
of course not .
can the white paper be translated into a workable bill ?
i think so .
no level playing field the government should recognise the distinction between a programme of continuous improvement and a policy of permanent revolution .
continuous improvement means you have to carry with you the people on whom you rely .
over the last eight years we have launched a series of bewildering initiatives in quick succession - often without evaluating the success of one before moving on to the next .
the government should look more carefully into the real structural problems .
can we honestly be expected to believe that simply privatising the infrastructure -lrb- railtrack -rrb- or introducing multiple providers -lrb- deregulated buses and directory enquiries -rrb- will automatically improve standards ?
and the government should recognise the limitations of league tables .
whilst poverty is no excuse for under-performance , pretending that all schools function on a level playing field is barking mad .
the distribution of pupils between schools is far more important than the distribution of schools between providers .
does anyone seriously think our 200 " top performing " state schools would deliver the same results if they were packed full of the sons and daughters of the underclass ?
to be blunt , it 's the admissions policy , stupid .
there is , however , an alternative .
it involves clarifying the nature of trust schools , the future powers of local authorities and the concept of fair admissions .
perhaps the word " sponsor " is the root of the problem .
external partners is much better .
but what exactly will be the criteria for the selection of external partners ?
size of cheque book ?
degree of religious fervour ?
or track record in delivering education ?
whatever the virtues of external partners , it is hard to explain why they should be handed billions of pounds of public assets on a plate in perpetuity .
revisit admissions a system of fixed term contracts to improve a number of schools might be more useful .
encouraging more federations to develop education across a whole community would be extremely helpful .
it would make sense to test out the trust concept in areas of particular difficulty before rushing headlong over the cliff edge .
parents , head teachers and school governors would be more open to persuasion if convinced that it had already worked well elsewhere -lrb- and was not only working because of vast dollops of new cash given to a single school -rrb- .
if local authorities did not exist , it would be necessary to reinvent them .
we need to clarify and strengthen the strategic planning powers of local authorities , including their responsibility to coordinate school place planning .
finally , we need to revisit our admissions policy .
we need a policy which recognises that parental choice and institutional selection are incompatible .
either we let the parents choose the school or we allow the schools to choose the children .
we ca n't have it both ways .
how much longer can we tolerate the daily reality of children locked out from the school at the end of their street because they ca n't display the right aptitude , the right degree of ability or because they do n't share the right ethos ?
our secondary school system is contaminated with partial selection , aptitude selection , 11-plus testing , interviewing , structured discussions and all the paraphernalia of social segregation by which generations of children have been taught to know their place by the age of 11 .
david cameron 's abject capitulation on secondary selection provides the perfect moment for a labour government to demonstrate the intellectual confidence needed to dismantle this dysfunctional legacy .
trust schools , local authorities , admissions policies : these are the key areas the government needs to work on to keep its supporters on board .
never before has it been more important for the prime minister to listen carefully to his critical friends . "

here , the schools minister and an outspoken backbench critic set out their viewpoints .
jacqui smith , minister of state for schools and 14 - 19 learners david chaytor , labour mp , long-serving member of the commons education select committee jacqui smith given some of the things that have been written and said , you could be forgiven for thinking there is disagreement about the biggest challenge we face in education between those who have doubts about parts of the education white paper and those of us who do not .
there is not .
we all strongly agree that it is breaking the link between poverty and underachievement at school .
it is vital we keep sight of this big picture as the debate unfolds .
let us not reduce the white paper to an overly technical debate about the ins and outs of " trust schools " .
yes , there are details to work out and we will continue to explain and discuss our proposals with colleagues .
but we must remember that despite the real progress schools have made over the last eight years , nearly 75 % of pupils entitled to free school meals -lrb- the poorest children -rrb- still do not get five or more good gcses .
this is something we have to change .
and we will only change this by ensuring that every school is a school that parents are happy to send their children to .
not one where success is determined by intake , but where it is determined purely by the quality of leadership and the quality of teaching and learning .
and where every child gets the support and encouragement they need to succeed in life .
tackling poor standards the bulk of our proposals in the white paper have broad support .
the vast majority of teachers , school leaders and parents believe teachers should have unambiguous rights when it comes to tackling poor behaviour .
it is common sense , too , that if we want to raise standards , teachers need more flexibility to personalise learning according to the needs of their pupils - another key part of our reforms .
but i recognise that there are areas we need to explain better , especially when it comes to trust schools .
i want to make it absolutely clear that our proposals are about tackling poor standards and making sure the most disadvantaged children get to access the best our education system has to offer .
trust schools are not a leap in the dark or a change in direction .
they build on what we have learnt in the last eight years and crucially what we have seen working well , particularly in deprived areas .
by empowering schools to formalise relationships with local partners , trusts will help schools use the energy and talent in their communities - in voluntary groups , charities , universities and in business foundations - to raise standards .
giving teachers the freedoms and support they need to develop high quality teaching and learning approaches that meet the needs of every pupil .
and ensuring schools have the flexibility and active encouragement to deliver learning differently according to the needs of the pupils they serve .
we know this approach will work because our proposals are based on a proven track record .
innovations specialist schools already work with external partners and other schools and the results speak for themselves .
in specialist schools serving our most deprived communities , 46 % of pupils got five good gcses compared to 36 % in non-specialist schools serving similar areas .
similarly , we have seen that schools that federate with weaker schools can have a huge impact on achievement .
our proposals for trust schools are our commitment to high standards and high expectations for each and every child jacqui smith two years ago , thomas telford school formed a three year federation with madeley court school , the worst performing school in telford .
after only one year , the number of pupils getting five good gcses rose from 22 % to 55 % .
and academies , working with external partners and developing an individual ethos to meet the needs of their communities , are improving at three times the national average .
it makes sense for more schools to benefit from these innovations .
but i want to make it clear that we are not imposing trusts on schools .
no school will be forced to accept a trust , although where a school is failing , a trust would be one option for the local authority to consider .
our proposals are about giving schools more freedom , not about taking their autonomy away .
similarly , we will not dictate to schools what their trust must look like .
one of the main benefits of trusts will be that they will enable schools to work with a range of partners to develop a distinct ethos that will meet the needs of their local community .
but it is up to schools , working with parents , external partners and the local authority , to determine what this means in practice .
like thorpe bay school in southend , which , under the excellent leadership of head teacher jean alder , has recently emerged from special measures .
along with southend local authority and prospects college -lrb- a leading provider of vocational education -rrb- , the school is currently considering the trust model as the next step to drive up standards .
by working with a local partner such as prospects college , thorpe bay will also be able to offer leading edge vocational provision , as well as more traditional academic studies , broadening choice for pupils and developing an ethos that meets the needs of parents and the local community .
or monkseaton school , which announced last week that it would like to form a trust to consolidate its existing successful partnership with the open university and microsoft .
this will enable the college to support the use of higher education modules in secondary education , not only in monkseaton school , but in other schools across the country .
experience the best our proposals for trust schools are our commitment to high standards and high expectations for each and every child .
if we want to break the link between poverty and underachievement , then excellent results and high expectations must come as standard in every school .
pioneering schools , heads and teachers have shown us over the past eight years how we can make this happen .
the challenge now is to ensure that every pupil gets to experience the best our education system has to offer .
david chaytor the education system in england is now widely recognised as a success .
that 's the first sentence of the first chapter of the education white paper .
most of the document then describes ways of building on this success with policies that have been widely welcomed .
however , some sections of the white paper are strong on assertion and weak on evidence .
they go some way beyond the 2005 election manifesto .
they have triggered an exceptional level of opposition amongst labour mps .
it is n't because we 're against innovation .
most of us , as parents and politicians , have welcomed the innovations of the last few years and are keen to see more .
we all support the prime minister 's relentless focus on standards , discipline and equality of opportunity .
we 're just not convinced that the structural changes proposed provide all the answers .
or even that all of the consequences of a system of " independent state schools " have been fully thought through .
having worked so hard to improve so much in the last eight years , teachers , support staff , school governors and lea professionals are now told they ca n't be trusted to carry on improving without being subject to wholesale opting out .
this sounds dangerously ideological .
' sorted and segregated ' the government tends to confuse the quality of management with the structure of ownership .
a good school needs , above all , a first class head teacher with strong support from a range of professionals .
a good school system needs an agreed framework in which all staff work together to spread best practice .
shuffling the shareholders , stimulating yet more competition and changing the nameplate on the front door can not get away from these basic educational facts of life .
the white paper proposes a structure of independent schools , linked with powerful sponsors , subject to an impotent code of practice on school admissions .
selection by ethos will become the 11-plus of the 21st century david chaytor mp it does not take a genius to work out that schools , driven entirely by the pressure of league tables , are likely to focus primarily on their own survival .
covert selection will be the order of the day .
our national aptitude for creating hierarchy from diversity will kick in with a vengeance as the specialisms of the school , coupled with the power of the sponsor , will send strong signals to parents as to whether the " ethos " of the school will be suitable for their child .
our 11-year-olds will be sifted , sorted and segregated into a multi-tiered set of secondary schools where ethos is increasingly defined by class , faith and ethnicity .
selection by ethos will become the 11-plus of the 21st century .
a free bus pass can provide an escape route for the few but ca n't guarantee a decent education for the many .
is all this inevitable ?
of course not .
can the white paper be translated into a workable bill ?
i think so .
no level playing field the government should recognise the distinction between a programme of continuous improvement and a policy of permanent revolution .
continuous improvement means you have to carry with you the people on whom you rely .
over the last eight years we have launched a series of bewildering initiatives in quick succession - often without evaluating the success of one before moving on to the next .
the government should look more carefully into the real structural problems .
can we honestly be expected to believe that simply privatising the infrastructure -lrb- railtrack -rrb- or introducing multiple providers -lrb- deregulated buses and directory enquiries -rrb- will automatically improve standards ?
and the government should recognise the limitations of league tables .
whilst poverty is no excuse for under-performance , pretending that all schools function on a level playing field is barking mad .
the distribution of pupils between schools is far more important than the distribution of schools between providers .
does anyone seriously think our 200 " top performing " state schools would deliver the same results if they were packed full of the sons and daughters of the underclass ?
to be blunt , it 's the admissions policy , stupid .
there is , however , an alternative .
it involves clarifying the nature of trust schools , the future powers of local authorities and the concept of fair admissions .
perhaps the word " sponsor " is the root of the problem .
external partners is much better .
but what exactly will be the criteria for the selection of external partners ?
size of cheque book ?
degree of religious fervour ?
or track record in delivering education ?
whatever the virtues of external partners , it is hard to explain why they should be handed billions of pounds of public assets on a plate in perpetuity .
revisit admissions a system of fixed term contracts to improve a number of schools might be more useful .
encouraging more federations to develop education across a whole community would be extremely helpful .
it would make sense to test out the trust concept in areas of particular difficulty before rushing headlong over the cliff edge .
parents , head teachers and school governors would be more open to persuasion if convinced that it had already worked well elsewhere -lrb- and was not only working because of vast dollops of new cash given to a single school -rrb- .
if local authorities did not exist , it would be necessary to reinvent them .
we need to clarify and strengthen the strategic planning powers of local authorities , including their responsibility to coordinate school place planning .
finally , we need to revisit our admissions policy .
we need a policy which recognises that parental choice and institutional selection are incompatible .
either we let the parents choose the school or we allow the schools to choose the children .
we ca n't have it both ways .
how much longer can we tolerate the daily reality of children locked out from the school at the end of their street because they ca n't display the right aptitude , the right degree of ability or because they do n't share the right ethos ?
our secondary school system is contaminated with partial selection , aptitude selection , 11-plus testing , interviewing , structured discussions and all the paraphernalia of social segregation by which generations of children have been taught to know their place by the age of 11 .
david cameron 's abject capitulation on secondary selection provides the perfect moment for a labour government to demonstrate the intellectual confidence needed to dismantle this dysfunctional legacy .
trust schools , local authorities , admissions policies : these are the key areas the government needs to work on to keep its supporters on board .
never before has it been more important for the prime minister to listen carefully to his critical friends .
