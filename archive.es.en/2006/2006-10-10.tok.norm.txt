" i 'd like to stress that we consider this murder as an abominable crime , " putin said .
" she was without a doubt a journalist who was highly critical of the government , but her killing has damaged russia 's reputation much more than her articles .
all i can say is that we will do everything to bring the perpetrators to justice . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murdered russian journalist anna politkovskaya wrote about widespread human rights abuses in chechnya thousands of mourners - including foreign diplomats and journalists - attended politikovskaya 's funeral in moscow on tuesday . energy matters an undertone of german concern was also perceptible at the talks over the country 's dependency on russian supplies of oil and gas .
memories of disruptions of russian gas supplies to europe still rankled with the german chancellor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german-russian gas pipeline is under construction in the baltic sea merkel , however , said she trusted russia as a reliable business partner . " it is important for me to have realized that we are acting on the same business principles as the russian government in this cooperation , " merkel said . " we are currently working out a joint charter in which these principles will be enshrined .
as a matter of fact , i 'm not reluctant either to accept russia 's increasing importance in the business world which is being reflected in the fact that russian companies are buying themselves into european firms . " russia to double gas exports to germany putin said russia planned to use a gas pipeline currently being built under the baltic sea between russia and germany to ship an additional 50 to 55 million cubic meters of gas to germany annually . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's new deal with putin is likely to anger the polish government russia presently supplies germany with 40 million cubic meters of gas a year - about a third of german needs .
the 1,200-kilometer -lrb- 745-mile -rrb- baltic gas pipeline is due to start operating in 2010 . " this would mean that germany is not only a consumer of natural gas but would make it a big european distributor of russian gas , " putin said .
" this will transform the energy face of germany and strengthen its role in european energy matters . " putin 's words are likely to further anger the polish government which has strongly opposed the baltic sea gas pipeline .
ties between germany and poland have been frosty over the past year due to this and a number of issues relating to world war ii . the north korean threat the series of routine meetings of german and russian leaders is known as the " petersburg dialogues , " named after the russian city where the first meeting was held in 2001 . both leaders denounced the explosion of a nuclear device by north korea as an irresponsible act . they called on the international community to keep a wary eye on developments there .

eads and irkut will set up an equal joint venture to this end , with production scheduled to start in 2010 . eads said in a statement that , in the initial phase , some 30 a320 and a321 aircraft would be converted per year , with both russian and international freight operators seen as potential customers . dw staff / afp , dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " not everything can revolve around gas " dw-radio spoke with russia expert alexander rahr about what to expect from talks between russian president vladimir putin and german chancellor angela merkel on tuesday .

he said that sanctions were officially no longer on the table since germany 's deficit for 2006 should fall well within the 3 percent euro zone limit . the announcement ends germany 's embarrassing five-year struggle with the spending guideline .
throughout the 1990s , as a precondition for the adoption of a single european currency , germany insisted on a cap for state debt to ensure fiscal discipline among member states .
but due to soaring government costs and dwindling state revenues , germany missed that mark in 2002 and has failed to meet it ever since . that will change this year - thanks in part to increased consumer spending within germany and cutbacks in the country 's generous social welfare programs .
almunia 's announcement confirms an unofficial agreement among eu finance members in early september to drop disciplinary proceedings against berlin . almunia also said that greece and france - two other eu " debt sinners " - should also reduce their deficits below 3 percent in 2006 , and that italy was on course to follow suit in 2007 . germany 's improved budget figures come amidst what 's being seen as a slight recovery in the german economy .
but critics warn that hikes in value-added tax planned for 2007 could dampen consumer spending and stifle the incipient economic comeback . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de minister says germany off the hook in eu budget deficit affair german finance minister peer steinbrück has said that germany no longer has to fear sanctions for violating the eu 's stability and growth pact .
-lrb- 09.09.2006 -rrb- minister : germany to meet eu deficit rules in 2007 for the first time in four years , germany 's annual budget is set keep the public deficit under the three percent limit set by the european union 's growth and stability pact , finance minister peer steinbrück said tuesday .
-lrb- 05.09.2006 -rrb- opinion : deficit-sinner germany mending its ways germany may manage this year to keep its deficit down to the level required by the eu stability pact , which underpins the euro .
instead of raising taxes , however , it should reduce spending , says dw 's karl zawadzky .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 10.10.2006 " ban has not developed visions " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ban ki moon is known as a hard worker , but not as a hardliner ban ki moon has been nominated to succeed kofi annan as secretary general of the united nations .
speculations are growing over how the south korean foreign minister will take on the tougher issues . andreas zumach is a geneva-based un correspondent for the german newspaper die tageszeitung . what has ban 's policy been as south korea foreign minster so far on north korea ? the problem is that there is no clear profile on his policy except that he is an efficient manager and mediator but he has never shown any political convictions , other than that he has been very close to whatever the us foreign policy was for the last 25 years . some people say that he is the architect of the so-called sunshine policy with north korea do you think he will adopt a harder line as requested by the us ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zumach thinks ban will follow the line of the us and china i am concerned that under the impact of yesterday 's nuclear test by north koreans and because of the pressure from the bush administration , he will adopt a harder line .
we could see already for the last year that the south korean government has not continued the original approach on the sunshine policy as it has originally adopted it because the bush administration clearly did n't support that . what affect will ban 's nomination have on the current crisis ? in the best case , he might be able to get the six nation talks going again and he might be able to move the bush administration to do the one thing that would be absolutely necessary to come to a diplomatic solution , which is to give pyongyang a nuclear non-aggression guarantee - something the clinton administration did back in 1994 and the bush administration renounced the guarantee in 2003 .
that 's when the problems began . do you think ban 's nomination might have provoked north korea nuclear test ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korean leader kim jong il has provoked the international community by testing nukes there are no indications that the timing of the nuclear test has anything to do with the election of ban ki moon , simply because the north korean government could not have guessed the development of the selection process for the secretary general at the un so for the timing i think it is rather a coincidence . what has made ban so popular with the un security council members ? it has been the smoothest selection process , compared to the former seven secretaries .
this seems to be good for the un , but i disagree , because the main reason for this process has been that ban ki moon is the smallest common denominator between two most powerful members of the security council - the united states and china .
i think this is not enough for the other 190 member countries of the un . i am concerned that he will continue to conduct his policies very closely along the us foreign policy on the one hand , and on the other hand he will avoid anything to criticize china and he will not highlight the importance of human rights as strongly as kofi annan has done , he will most certainly not highlight the important role of non-government organizations for international politics and for the un as kofi annan has done .
i think he will continue to conduct his new job in the way that he has conducted all the other jobs , which is to avoid conflict . so you do n't think he will be able to set his own stamp ? bildunterschrift : a different un with ban ?
only time will tell i am concerned that this will not happen .
i am always prepared to be positively surprised , but so-far the 35 years of his political and diplomatic career do n't give us any indications that besides being a conduit of diplomacy and a strong and hard worker , he has not developed his own political positions , let alone visions . if you look at the necessity to reform the united nations , we still have this broad political reform agenda that kofi annan put on the political agenda last year which still need to be decided on and implemented .
here we would need a secretary general that followed the same line that kofi annan put forward , but i am concerned that ban ki moon will only be concerned with those management reforms that washington is pushing for . do you think he has been nominated because of his experience on the korean peninsula ? ban ki moon has been nominated because , firstly , china prevented the original washington intention to have an eastern european by threatening a hard veto against any non-asian candidate .
secondly , because washington and beijing agreed that it should not be an indian in this position and then if you look at the field of candidates from asia that were left , ban ki moon seems to be the one that fits the interests of washington and beijing most . dw staff -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu : north korean nuclear test is " unacceptable " the european union has strongly condemned north korea 's nuclear test as " unacceptable .

speculations are growing over how the south korean foreign minister will take on the tougher issues . andreas zumach is a geneva-based un correspondent for the german newspaper die tageszeitung . what has ban 's policy been as south korea foreign minster so far on north korea ? the problem is that there is no clear profile on his policy except that he is an efficient manager and mediator but he has never shown any political convictions , other than that he has been very close to whatever the us foreign policy was for the last 25 years . some people say that he is the architect of the so-called sunshine policy with north korea do you think he will adopt a harder line as requested by the us ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zumach thinks ban will follow the line of the us and china i am concerned that under the impact of yesterday 's nuclear test by north koreans and because of the pressure from the bush administration , he will adopt a harder line .
we could see already for the last year that the south korean government has not continued the original approach on the sunshine policy as it has originally adopted it because the bush administration clearly did n't support that . what affect will ban 's nomination have on the current crisis ? in the best case , he might be able to get the six nation talks going again and he might be able to move the bush administration to do the one thing that would be absolutely necessary to come to a diplomatic solution , which is to give pyongyang a nuclear non-aggression guarantee - something the clinton administration did back in 1994 and the bush administration renounced the guarantee in 2003 .
that 's when the problems began . do you think ban 's nomination might have provoked north korea nuclear test ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korean leader kim jong il has provoked the international community by testing nukes there are no indications that the timing of the nuclear test has anything to do with the election of ban ki moon , simply because the north korean government could not have guessed the development of the selection process for the secretary general at the un so for the timing i think it is rather a coincidence . what has made ban so popular with the un security council members ? it has been the smoothest selection process , compared to the former seven secretaries .
this seems to be good for the un , but i disagree , because the main reason for this process has been that ban ki moon is the smallest common denominator between two most powerful members of the security council - the united states and china .
i think this is not enough for the other 190 member countries of the un . i am concerned that he will continue to conduct his policies very closely along the us foreign policy on the one hand , and on the other hand he will avoid anything to criticize china and he will not highlight the importance of human rights as strongly as kofi annan has done , he will most certainly not highlight the important role of non-government organizations for international politics and for the un as kofi annan has done .
i think he will continue to conduct his new job in the way that he has conducted all the other jobs , which is to avoid conflict . so you do n't think he will be able to set his own stamp ? bildunterschrift : a different un with ban ?
only time will tell i am concerned that this will not happen .
i am always prepared to be positively surprised , but so-far the 35 years of his political and diplomatic career do n't give us any indications that besides being a conduit of diplomacy and a strong and hard worker , he has not developed his own political positions , let alone visions . if you look at the necessity to reform the united nations , we still have this broad political reform agenda that kofi annan put on the political agenda last year which still need to be decided on and implemented .
here we would need a secretary general that followed the same line that kofi annan put forward , but i am concerned that ban ki moon will only be concerned with those management reforms that washington is pushing for . do you think he has been nominated because of his experience on the korean peninsula ? ban ki moon has been nominated because , firstly , china prevented the original washington intention to have an eastern european by threatening a hard veto against any non-asian candidate .
secondly , because washington and beijing agreed that it should not be an indian in this position and then if you look at the field of candidates from asia that were left , ban ki moon seems to be the one that fits the interests of washington and beijing most . dw staff -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu : north korean nuclear test is " unacceptable " the european union has strongly condemned north korea 's nuclear test as " unacceptable .

he said that sanctions were officially no longer on the table since germany 's deficit for 2006 should fall well within the 3 percent euro zone limit . the announcement ends germany 's embarrassing five-year struggle with the spending guideline .
throughout the 1990s , as a precondition for the adoption of a single european currency , germany insisted on a cap for state debt to ensure fiscal discipline among member states .
but due to soaring government costs and dwindling state revenues , germany missed that mark in 2002 and has failed to meet it ever since . that will change this year - thanks in part to increased consumer spending within germany and cutbacks in the country 's generous social welfare programs .
almunia 's announcement confirms an unofficial agreement among eu finance members in early september to drop disciplinary proceedings against berlin . almunia also said that greece and france - two other eu " debt sinners " - should also reduce their deficits below 3 percent in 2006 , and that italy was on course to follow suit in 2007 . germany 's improved budget figures come amidst what 's being seen as a slight recovery in the german economy .

he said that sanctions were officially no longer on the table since germany 's deficit for 2006 should fall well within the 3 percent euro zone limit . the announcement ends germany 's embarrassing five-year struggle with the spending guideline .
throughout the 1990s , as a precondition for the adoption of a single european currency , germany insisted on a cap for state debt to ensure fiscal discipline among member states .
but due to soaring government costs and dwindling state revenues , germany missed that mark in 2002 and has failed to meet it ever since . that will change this year - thanks in part to increased consumer spending within germany and cutbacks in the country 's generous social welfare programs .
almunia 's announcement confirms an unofficial agreement among eu finance members in early september to drop disciplinary proceedings against berlin . almunia also said that greece and france - two other eu " debt sinners " - should also reduce their deficits below 3 percent in 2006 , and that italy was on course to follow suit in 2007 . germany 's improved budget figures come amidst what 's being seen as a slight recovery in the german economy .
but critics warn that hikes in value-added tax planned for 2007 could dampen consumer spending and stifle the incipient economic comeback . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de minister says germany off the hook in eu budget deficit affair german finance minister peer steinbrück has said that germany no longer has to fear sanctions for violating the eu 's stability and growth pact .

" it is important for me to have realized that we are acting on the same business principles as the russian government in this cooperation , " merkel said . " we are currently working out a joint charter in which these principles will be enshrined .
as a matter of fact , i 'm not reluctant either to accept russia 's increasing importance in the business world which is being reflected in the fact that russian companies are buying themselves into european firms . " russia to double gas exports to germany putin said russia planned to use a gas pipeline currently being built under the baltic sea between russia and germany to ship an additional 50 to 55 million cubic meters of gas to germany annually . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's new deal with putin is likely to anger the polish government russia presently supplies germany with 40 million cubic meters of gas a year - about a third of german needs .
the 1,200-kilometer -lrb- 745-mile -rrb- baltic gas pipeline is due to start operating in 2010 . " this would mean that germany is not only a consumer of natural gas but would make it a big european distributor of russian gas , " putin said .
" this will transform the energy face of germany and strengthen its role in european energy matters . " putin 's words are likely to further anger the polish government which has strongly opposed the baltic sea gas pipeline .
ties between germany and poland have been frosty over the past year due to this and a number of issues relating to world war ii . the north korean threat the series of routine meetings of german and russian leaders is known as the " petersburg dialogues , " named after the russian city where the first meeting was held in 2001 . both leaders denounced the explosion of a nuclear device by north korea as an irresponsible act . they called on the international community to keep a wary eye on developments there .

eads and irkut will set up an equal joint venture to this end , with production scheduled to start in 2010 . eads said in a statement that , in the initial phase , some 30 a320 and a321 aircraft would be converted per year , with both russian and international freight operators seen as potential customers . dw staff / afp , dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " not everything can revolve around gas " dw-radio spoke with russia expert alexander rahr about what to expect from talks between russian president vladimir putin and german chancellor angela merkel on tuesday .

germany could bear the brunt of any factory organization . a day after taking over as head of airbus , louis gallois announced job cuts and reorganization may be needed to rescue the troubled european aircraft company . gallois - who is also co-chief executive of the parent group eads - replaced christian streiff on monday .
streiff quit after 100 days on the job .
but board members did n't back streiff 's plans for reshaping the company , sources close to the firm said . yet both streiff and gallois agree that europe 's larges aerospace company needs an overhaul . gallois told europe radio 1 on tuesday that his rescue plan will likely include the " elimination of posts , and we will have to pose questions about sites . " full-scale restructuring would take place after several months of study and be marked by " dialogue and balance , " gallois said . airbus has struggled to overcome delays to its flagship a380 super jumbo program as well as problems with a mid-sized and military transport planes .

a dispute over security precautions caused major delays for what some see as a symbol of german-american friendship . a sharp-toothed iron fence atop massive concrete slabs currently separates america 's representatives from the german people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not exactly welcoming : the current us embassy just off berlin 's unter den linden boulevard , the us embassy sits in a street that 's blocked off for traffic .
german police behind rows of concrete cylinders prevent unwanted visitors from getting too close .
" no photography " signs attached to the fence add to the inhospitable atmosphere . all that will change to a certain extent in the spring of 2008 , when american diplomats are expected to move three blocks down the street to the new embassy on pariser platz .
home to berlin 's landmark brandenburg gate , which became the symbol of reunification , the square draws hordes of tourists , becomes party central on new year 's eve and serves as the backdrop for major celebrations such as the 2006 soccer world cup , when millions of fans gathered to cheer their teams . making a statement it 's hardly a dream location when it comes to security : the square can not be completely cordoned off like the nearby street where the british embassy has set up quarters .
but soon after german reunification , us officials decided to make a statement by building their embassy on the very spot where us diplomats had once worked before world war ii . " the decision of the united states to return to this historic site symbolizes america 's support for a unified germany , " former ambassador daniel r. coats said at a groundbreaking ceremony in 2004 . bildunterschrift : the 180-million-euro -lrb- $ 228-million -rrb- embassy , sitting on the right corner , was designed by santa monica-based moore ruble yudell architects , who count the tacoma campus of the university of washington , a courthouse in fresno , an office complex in beijing and several churches among previous projects skylights and security zones almost exactly two years later , the building shell has been completed .
still missing are a glass conference room on top of the roof that is meant to illuminate berlin 's sky at night as well as a " green band of trees , gardens and walkways " along the street fronts .
already in place , however , are dozens of poles made of steel and concrete that are meant to guard the building against terrorist attacks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would neuschwanstein castle have been a better place for the new embassy ?
security concerns were also the main reason for a decade-long delay of the project .
following the 1998 bombings at us embassies in kenya and tanzania , us legislators called for more protection at new diplomatic missions .
confronted with the demands , berlin officials were especially irked by a 30-meter -lrb- 100-feet -rrb- security zone between the building and the street that would have required a complete redesign of the surrounding historic streets . the dispute reached comical proportions when berlin 's mayor reportedly said that americans should instead build a fast-food restaurant at the site , and the us ambassador jokingly suggested moving the embassy to bavaria 's world-famous -lrb- and certainly secure -rrb- neuschwanstein castle , where americans had always been welcome . a very good compromise ? both sides finally agreed to compromise by reducing the safety zone to 25 meters and shifting streets a little . " the overall design has been enriched by extensive critique and collaboration with the urban planning authorities of berlin and a sensitivity to the surrounding historic quarters , " reads a text on the embassy 's web site .
embassy officials were not available for comment monday as the embassy was closed for columbus day . bildunterschrift : the embassy 's shell on the left closes the gap along pariser platz .
only a bank 's building separates it from berlin 's famous brandenburg gate , seen on the right meanwhile , petra rohland , a spokeswoman for berlin 's urban planning department , looked on the bright side . " we found a very good compromise , " she said , adding that it addressed the american security concerns as well as berlin 's desire to keep the surroundings of pariser platz open to the public . closing the gap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these poles are still waiting for their historic coats " it closes the gap , " rohland said , referring to the last bit of wasteland along the square that has now disappeared .
" as good hosts , we 'll now have the embassy in this truly beautiful place . " besides , some of the security precautions will actually return some history to the square , rohland said : the poles will look like ones used as roadblocks in previous times . incidentally , the american need for security will also bring some increased security to the french embassy , which sits diagonally across on the other side of the square .
for reasons of symmetry , preservationists required the same poles to be installed there as well . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us ambassador to berlin says europeans are soft on terror in marking the fifth anniversary of the september 11 attacks , us ambassador to germany , william timken , voiced an unpopular hardline view on europe 's battle against islamic terrorism .

he said that sanctions were officially no longer on the table since germany 's deficit for 2006 should fall well within the 3 percent euro zone limit . the announcement ends germany 's embarrassing five-year struggle with the spending guideline .
throughout the 1990s , as a precondition for the adoption of a single european currency , germany insisted on a cap for state debt to ensure fiscal discipline among member states .
but due to soaring government costs and dwindling state revenues , germany missed that mark in 2002 and has failed to meet it ever since . that will change this year - thanks in part to increased consumer spending within germany and cutbacks in the country 's generous social welfare programs .
almunia 's announcement confirms an unofficial agreement among eu finance members in early september to drop disciplinary proceedings against berlin . almunia also said that greece and france - two other eu " debt sinners " - should also reduce their deficits below 3 percent in 2006 , and that italy was on course to follow suit in 2007 . germany 's improved budget figures come amidst what 's being seen as a slight recovery in the german economy .
but critics warn that hikes in value-added tax planned for 2007 could dampen consumer spending and stifle the incipient economic comeback . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de minister says germany off the hook in eu budget deficit affair german finance minister peer steinbrück has said that germany no longer has to fear sanctions for violating the eu 's stability and growth pact .

security concerns were also the main reason for a decade-long delay of the project .

confronted with the demands , berlin officials were especially irked by a 30-meter -lrb- 100-feet -rrb- security zone between the building and the street that would have required a complete redesign of the surrounding historic streets . the dispute reached comical proportions when berlin 's mayor reportedly said that americans should instead build a fast-food restaurant at the site , and the us ambassador jokingly suggested moving the embassy to bavaria 's world-famous -lrb- and certainly secure -rrb- neuschwanstein castle , where americans had always been welcome . a very good compromise ? both sides finally agreed to compromise by reducing the safety zone to 25 meters and shifting streets a little .

he said that sanctions were officially no longer on the table since germany 's deficit for 2006 should fall well within the 3 percent euro zone limit . the announcement ends germany 's embarrassing five-year struggle with the spending guideline .
throughout the 1990s , as a precondition for the adoption of a single european currency , germany insisted on a cap for state debt to ensure fiscal discipline among member states .
but due to soaring government costs and dwindling state revenues , germany missed that mark in 2002 and has failed to meet it ever since . that will change this year - thanks in part to increased consumer spending within germany and cutbacks in the country 's generous social welfare programs .
almunia 's announcement confirms an unofficial agreement among eu finance members in early september to drop disciplinary proceedings against berlin . almunia also said that greece and france - two other eu " debt sinners " - should also reduce their deficits below 3 percent in 2006 , and that italy was on course to follow suit in 2007 . germany 's improved budget figures come amidst what 's being seen as a slight recovery in the german economy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 10.10.2006 " ban has not developed visions " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ban ki moon is known as a hard worker , but not as a hardliner ban ki moon has been nominated to succeed kofi annan as secretary general of the united nations .
speculations are growing over how the south korean foreign minister will take on the tougher issues . andreas zumach is a geneva-based un correspondent for the german newspaper die tageszeitung . what has ban 's policy been as south korea foreign minster so far on north korea ? the problem is that there is no clear profile on his policy except that he is an efficient manager and mediator but he has never shown any political convictions , other than that he has been very close to whatever the us foreign policy was for the last 25 years . some people say that he is the architect of the so-called sunshine policy with north korea do you think he will adopt a harder line as requested by the us ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zumach thinks ban will follow the line of the us and china i am concerned that under the impact of yesterday 's nuclear test by north koreans and because of the pressure from the bush administration , he will adopt a harder line .
we could see already for the last year that the south korean government has not continued the original approach on the sunshine policy as it has originally adopted it because the bush administration clearly did n't support that . what affect will ban 's nomination have on the current crisis ? in the best case , he might be able to get the six nation talks going again and he might be able to move the bush administration to do the one thing that would be absolutely necessary to come to a diplomatic solution , which is to give pyongyang a nuclear non-aggression guarantee - something the clinton administration did back in 1994 and the bush administration renounced the guarantee in 2003 .
that 's when the problems began . do you think ban 's nomination might have provoked north korea nuclear test ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korean leader kim jong il has provoked the international community by testing nukes there are no indications that the timing of the nuclear test has anything to do with the election of ban ki moon , simply because the north korean government could not have guessed the development of the selection process for the secretary general at the un so for the timing i think it is rather a coincidence . what has made ban so popular with the un security council members ? it has been the smoothest selection process , compared to the former seven secretaries .
this seems to be good for the un , but i disagree , because the main reason for this process has been that ban ki moon is the smallest common denominator between two most powerful members of the security council - the united states and china .
i think this is not enough for the other 190 member countries of the un . i am concerned that he will continue to conduct his policies very closely along the us foreign policy on the one hand , and on the other hand he will avoid anything to criticize china and he will not highlight the importance of human rights as strongly as kofi annan has done , he will most certainly not highlight the important role of non-government organizations for international politics and for the un as kofi annan has done .

" i 'd like to stress that we consider this murder as an abominable crime , " putin said .
" she was without a doubt a journalist who was highly critical of the government , but her killing has damaged russia 's reputation much more than her articles .
all i can say is that we will do everything to bring the perpetrators to justice . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murdered russian journalist anna politkovskaya wrote about widespread human rights abuses in chechnya thousands of mourners - including foreign diplomats and journalists - attended politikovskaya 's funeral in moscow on tuesday . energy matters an undertone of german concern was also perceptible at the talks over the country 's dependency on russian supplies of oil and gas .
memories of disruptions of russian gas supplies to europe still rankled with the german chancellor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german-russian gas pipeline is under construction in the baltic sea merkel , however , said she trusted russia as a reliable business partner . " it is important for me to have realized that we are acting on the same business principles as the russian government in this cooperation , " merkel said . " we are currently working out a joint charter in which these principles will be enshrined .
as a matter of fact , i 'm not reluctant either to accept russia 's increasing importance in the business world which is being reflected in the fact that russian companies are buying themselves into european firms . " russia to double gas exports to germany putin said russia planned to use a gas pipeline currently being built under the baltic sea between russia and germany to ship an additional 50 to 55 million cubic meters of gas to germany annually . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's new deal with putin is likely to anger the polish government russia presently supplies germany with 40 million cubic meters of gas a year - about a third of german needs .
the 1,200-kilometer -lrb- 745-mile -rrb- baltic gas pipeline is due to start operating in 2010 . " this would mean that germany is not only a consumer of natural gas but would make it a big european distributor of russian gas , " putin said .
" this will transform the energy face of germany and strengthen its role in european energy matters . " putin 's words are likely to further anger the polish government which has strongly opposed the baltic sea gas pipeline .
ties between germany and poland have been frosty over the past year due to this and a number of issues relating to world war ii . the north korean threat the series of routine meetings of german and russian leaders is known as the " petersburg dialogues , " named after the russian city where the first meeting was held in 2001 . both leaders denounced the explosion of a nuclear device by north korea as an irresponsible act . they called on the international community to keep a wary eye on developments there .

eads and irkut will set up an equal joint venture to this end , with production scheduled to start in 2010 . eads said in a statement that , in the initial phase , some 30 a320 and a321 aircraft would be converted per year , with both russian and international freight operators seen as potential customers . dw staff / afp , dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " not everything can revolve around gas " dw-radio spoke with russia expert alexander rahr about what to expect from talks between russian president vladimir putin and german chancellor angela merkel on tuesday .

this seems to be good for the un , but i disagree , because the main reason for this process has been that ban ki moon is the smallest common denominator between two most powerful members of the security council - the united states and china .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 10.10.2006 eu rules out fines against germany for deficit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's been taking in enough money to meet eu deficit rules with germany 's federal deficit projected to be 2.6 percent of gdp or lower this year , the european union decided tuesday to officially suspend disciplinary proceedings against berlin . european commissioner for economic and monetary affairs joaquin almunia announced the good news ahead of a meeting of eu finance ministers in luxembourg .
he said that sanctions were officially no longer on the table since germany 's deficit for 2006 should fall well within the 3 percent euro zone limit . the announcement ends germany 's embarrassing five-year struggle with the spending guideline .
throughout the 1990s , as a precondition for the adoption of a single european currency , germany insisted on a cap for state debt to ensure fiscal discipline among member states .
but due to soaring government costs and dwindling state revenues , germany missed that mark in 2002 and has failed to meet it ever since . that will change this year - thanks in part to increased consumer spending within germany and cutbacks in the country 's generous social welfare programs .
almunia 's announcement confirms an unofficial agreement among eu finance members in early september to drop disciplinary proceedings against berlin . almunia also said that greece and france - two other eu " debt sinners " - should also reduce their deficits below 3 percent in 2006 , and that italy was on course to follow suit in 2007 . germany 's improved budget figures come amidst what 's being seen as a slight recovery in the german economy .
but critics warn that hikes in value-added tax planned for 2007 could dampen consumer spending and stifle the incipient economic comeback . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de minister says germany off the hook in eu budget deficit affair german finance minister peer steinbrück has said that germany no longer has to fear sanctions for violating the eu 's stability and growth pact .
-lrb- 09.09.2006 -rrb- minister : germany to meet eu deficit rules in 2007 for the first time in four years , germany 's annual budget is set keep the public deficit under the three percent limit set by the european union 's growth and stability pact , finance minister peer steinbrück said tuesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de architecture -pipe- 10.10.2006 america 's new bastion in berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the embassy 's construction site is already a high-security area us diplomats tuesday will host a topping-off ceremony for their new embassy in central berlin .
a dispute over security precautions caused major delays for what some see as a symbol of german-american friendship . a sharp-toothed iron fence atop massive concrete slabs currently separates america 's representatives from the german people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not exactly welcoming : the current us embassy just off berlin 's unter den linden boulevard , the us embassy sits in a street that 's blocked off for traffic .
german police behind rows of concrete cylinders prevent unwanted visitors from getting too close .
" no photography " signs attached to the fence add to the inhospitable atmosphere . all that will change to a certain extent in the spring of 2008 , when american diplomats are expected to move three blocks down the street to the new embassy on pariser platz .

" i 'd like to stress that we consider this murder as an abominable crime , " putin said .
" she was without a doubt a journalist who was highly critical of the government , but her killing has damaged russia 's reputation much more than her articles .
all i can say is that we will do everything to bring the perpetrators to justice . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murdered russian journalist anna politkovskaya wrote about widespread human rights abuses in chechnya thousands of mourners - including foreign diplomats and journalists - attended politikovskaya 's funeral in moscow on tuesday . energy matters an undertone of german concern was also perceptible at the talks over the country 's dependency on russian supplies of oil and gas .
memories of disruptions of russian gas supplies to europe still rankled with the german chancellor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german-russian gas pipeline is under construction in the baltic sea merkel , however , said she trusted russia as a reliable business partner . " it is important for me to have realized that we are acting on the same business principles as the russian government in this cooperation , " merkel said . " we are currently working out a joint charter in which these principles will be enshrined .
as a matter of fact , i 'm not reluctant either to accept russia 's increasing importance in the business world which is being reflected in the fact that russian companies are buying themselves into european firms . " russia to double gas exports to germany putin said russia planned to use a gas pipeline currently being built under the baltic sea between russia and germany to ship an additional 50 to 55 million cubic meters of gas to germany annually . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's new deal with putin is likely to anger the polish government russia presently supplies germany with 40 million cubic meters of gas a year - about a third of german needs .
the 1,200-kilometer -lrb- 745-mile -rrb- baltic gas pipeline is due to start operating in 2010 . " this would mean that germany is not only a consumer of natural gas but would make it a big european distributor of russian gas , " putin said .
" this will transform the energy face of germany and strengthen its role in european energy matters . " putin 's words are likely to further anger the polish government which has strongly opposed the baltic sea gas pipeline .
ties between germany and poland have been frosty over the past year due to this and a number of issues relating to world war ii . the north korean threat the series of routine meetings of german and russian leaders is known as the " petersburg dialogues , " named after the russian city where the first meeting was held in 2001 . both leaders denounced the explosion of a nuclear device by north korea as an irresponsible act . they called on the international community to keep a wary eye on developments there .
the russian president , however , did not comment on whether his government would support sanctions again north korea . diverse areas of cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sponsoring contract between gazprom and schalke 04 was signed in dresden on the sidelines of their meeting the two leaders oversaw the signing of a raft of deals aimed at strengthening the economic , scientific and cultural cooperation between the two countries . russia 's oil wealth has made companies from the country potent investors also in the german economy . somewhat unusual evidence of that was a 100 million euro -lrb- $ 126.6 million -rrb- soccer sponsorship deal between the german bundesliga club schalke 04 and russian oil giant gazprom that was also signed on tuesday . a new german-russian joint venture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus is diversifying its production in a new deal with russian aircraft manufacturer irkut in another agreement signed on tuesday , the european aeronautics defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- with its aircraft arm airbus and its dresden freighter conversion subsidiary elbe flugzeugwerke -lrb- efw -rrb- agreed with russian aircraft manufacturer irkut to form a joint venture to convert airbus a320 passenger planes into freighters . under the terms of the agreement , airbus , efw and irkut will perform the conversion of single-aisle passenger aircraft into cargo aircraft and market and sell conversion services .
eads and irkut will set up an equal joint venture to this end , with production scheduled to start in 2010 . eads said in a statement that , in the initial phase , some 30 a320 and a321 aircraft would be converted per year , with both russian and international freight operators seen as potential customers . dw staff / afp , dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " not everything can revolve around gas " dw-radio spoke with russia expert alexander rahr about what to expect from talks between russian president vladimir putin and german chancellor angela merkel on tuesday .

german newspapers on tuesday speculated about what the international community should do next . " seldom before has there been such consensus among north korea 's asian-pacific neighbors and pyongyang 's strategic rivals : this state represents a massive threat to regional stability , " wrote the süddeutsche zeitung from munich on tuesday .
" japan perceives itself to be in the greatest military danger , and as a result tokyo will rethink its approach to national security .
one possible consequence is the development of nuclear weapons throughout the entire region .
that can only be prevented if the united states concentrates its arsenal of deterrence on the pacific and offers both south korea and japan explicit assurances of its support in case of a nuclear conflict . " the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung also focused on the us ' possible response to the crisis .
" china and above all the united states have it in their power to bring pyongyang back to the bargaining table , " the paper wrote .
" the north korean regime has often let it be known via its news service kcna that it is primarily interested in direct negotiations with washington .
but the prospects are now worse than they were in 1994 .
north korea has proclaimed itself to be a nuclear power , and it 's going to take some true initiative to keep pyongyang , where the regime likely sees this as a struggle for survival , from engaging in further escalations . " " only a harsh reaction , which will unfortunately also affect north korea 's already suffering population will send the necessary signals to other nuclear aspirants and prevent the nuclear non-proliferation treaty from collapsing entirely , " wrote berlin 's daily der tagesspiegel on tuesday .
" but severity alone wo n't convince north korea 's dictator to change his mind .
the international community and the bush government , which has been indecisive on this issue , will have to offer rewards in return for a verifiable abandonment of the nuclear option . and the hamburger abendblatt commented in its tuesday edition : " strongly worded declarations and even threats of sanctions wo n't deter a country like north korea , which is already largely isolated as the poorhouse of southeast asia .
conversely , offers of rewards , in which north korea has nothing to lose and everything to gain , presuppose that ruling elites are capable of a certain degree of rationalism .
what remains is the unsettling prospect that north korea 's ' dr. strangelove ' now only lacks mid-range missiles .
a danger is growing , whose implications for world peace can not at present be predicted : that there will be a ratcheting up of the arms race in southeast asia .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian gas money will soon be flowing toward gelsenkirchen experts estimate that the agreement will give schalke 60-66 million euros by the time it expires .
if the club wins titles or regularly plays in the champions league it could see up to 100 million euros filling its tills .
victoria , which has supported schalke with 7.5 million euros per year , will remain a sponsor until 2012 . a " new dimension " the deal is the largest sponsoring agreement ever in german first division , eclipsing the 20 million euros annually that bayern munich receive from deutsche telekom and giving schalke fans a new reason to buy replica jerseys with the gazprom logo .
players will don their new tops for the first time for the jan .
28 , 2007 match against eintracht frankfurt . a huge infusion of cash is welcome news for the gelsenkirchen-based club whose estimated debts total as much as 120 million euros , and whose on-field fortunes have been up and down of late . " we 're advancing into a new dimension , " said clemens tönnies , chairman of schalke 's board of directors , after the deal was made public . club maintains autonomy the deal was evidence of " the respect that our club earned especially on the international stage in past years , " schalke board member gerhard rehberg commented .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder is known to be a dortmund fan he stressed that schalke would remain independent and that gazprom would have " no influence whatsoever on the operative business or sports decisions . " there have been no reports about precisely who brought the two sides together , but many observers have noted that former german chancellor gerhard schröder works as an advisor for gazprom .
it would be ironic if schröder did have a hand in the deal , since he was always known as a fan of dortmund , schalke 's archrivals . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundesliga stays close , top teams remain disappointed a draw was enough for berlin to take over on top of the table sunday , but they should n't feel too comfortable since goal difference is the only thing separating the german league 's top five teams .

a dispute over security precautions caused major delays for what some see as a symbol of german-american friendship . a sharp-toothed iron fence atop massive concrete slabs currently separates america 's representatives from the german people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not exactly welcoming : the current us embassy just off berlin 's unter den linden boulevard , the us embassy sits in a street that 's blocked off for traffic .
german police behind rows of concrete cylinders prevent unwanted visitors from getting too close .
" no photography " signs attached to the fence add to the inhospitable atmosphere . all that will change to a certain extent in the spring of 2008 , when american diplomats are expected to move three blocks down the street to the new embassy on pariser platz .
home to berlin 's landmark brandenburg gate , which became the symbol of reunification , the square draws hordes of tourists , becomes party central on new year 's eve and serves as the backdrop for major celebrations such as the 2006 soccer world cup , when millions of fans gathered to cheer their teams . making a statement it 's hardly a dream location when it comes to security : the square can not be completely cordoned off like the nearby street where the british embassy has set up quarters .
but soon after german reunification , us officials decided to make a statement by building their embassy on the very spot where us diplomats had once worked before world war ii . " the decision of the united states to return to this historic site symbolizes america 's support for a unified germany , " former ambassador daniel r. coats said at a groundbreaking ceremony in 2004 . bildunterschrift : the 180-million-euro -lrb- $ 228-million -rrb- embassy , sitting on the right corner , was designed by santa monica-based moore ruble yudell architects , who count the tacoma campus of the university of washington , a courthouse in fresno , an office complex in beijing and several churches among previous projects skylights and security zones almost exactly two years later , the building shell has been completed .
still missing are a glass conference room on top of the roof that is meant to illuminate berlin 's sky at night as well as a " green band of trees , gardens and walkways " along the street fronts .
already in place , however , are dozens of poles made of steel and concrete that are meant to guard the building against terrorist attacks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would neuschwanstein castle have been a better place for the new embassy ?
security concerns were also the main reason for a decade-long delay of the project .
following the 1998 bombings at us embassies in kenya and tanzania , us legislators called for more protection at new diplomatic missions .
confronted with the demands , berlin officials were especially irked by a 30-meter -lrb- 100-feet -rrb- security zone between the building and the street that would have required a complete redesign of the surrounding historic streets . the dispute reached comical proportions when berlin 's mayor reportedly said that americans should instead build a fast-food restaurant at the site , and the us ambassador jokingly suggested moving the embassy to bavaria 's world-famous -lrb- and certainly secure -rrb- neuschwanstein castle , where americans had always been welcome . a very good compromise ? both sides finally agreed to compromise by reducing the safety zone to 25 meters and shifting streets a little . " the overall design has been enriched by extensive critique and collaboration with the urban planning authorities of berlin and a sensitivity to the surrounding historic quarters , " reads a text on the embassy 's web site .
embassy officials were not available for comment monday as the embassy was closed for columbus day . bildunterschrift : the embassy 's shell on the left closes the gap along pariser platz .
only a bank 's building separates it from berlin 's famous brandenburg gate , seen on the right meanwhile , petra rohland , a spokeswoman for berlin 's urban planning department , looked on the bright side . " we found a very good compromise , " she said , adding that it addressed the american security concerns as well as berlin 's desire to keep the surroundings of pariser platz open to the public . closing the gap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these poles are still waiting for their historic coats " it closes the gap , " rohland said , referring to the last bit of wasteland along the square that has now disappeared .
" as good hosts , we 'll now have the embassy in this truly beautiful place . " besides , some of the security precautions will actually return some history to the square , rohland said : the poles will look like ones used as roadblocks in previous times . incidentally , the american need for security will also bring some increased security to the french embassy , which sits diagonally across on the other side of the square .
for reasons of symmetry , preservationists required the same poles to be installed there as well . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us ambassador to berlin says europeans are soft on terror in marking the fifth anniversary of the september 11 attacks , us ambassador to germany , william timken , voiced an unpopular hardline view on europe 's battle against islamic terrorism .

he said that sanctions were officially no longer on the table since germany 's deficit for 2006 should fall well within the 3 percent euro zone limit . the announcement ends germany 's embarrassing five-year struggle with the spending guideline .
throughout the 1990s , as a precondition for the adoption of a single european currency , germany insisted on a cap for state debt to ensure fiscal discipline among member states .
but due to soaring government costs and dwindling state revenues , germany missed that mark in 2002 and has failed to meet it ever since . that will change this year - thanks in part to increased consumer spending within germany and cutbacks in the country 's generous social welfare programs .
almunia 's announcement confirms an unofficial agreement among eu finance members in early september to drop disciplinary proceedings against berlin . almunia also said that greece and france - two other eu " debt sinners " - should also reduce their deficits below 3 percent in 2006 , and that italy was on course to follow suit in 2007 . germany 's improved budget figures come amidst what 's being seen as a slight recovery in the german economy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 10.10.2006 " ban has not developed visions " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ban ki moon is known as a hard worker , but not as a hardliner ban ki moon has been nominated to succeed kofi annan as secretary general of the united nations .
speculations are growing over how the south korean foreign minister will take on the tougher issues . andreas zumach is a geneva-based un correspondent for the german newspaper die tageszeitung . what has ban 's policy been as south korea foreign minster so far on north korea ? the problem is that there is no clear profile on his policy except that he is an efficient manager and mediator but he has never shown any political convictions , other than that he has been very close to whatever the us foreign policy was for the last 25 years . some people say that he is the architect of the so-called sunshine policy with north korea do you think he will adopt a harder line as requested by the us ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zumach thinks ban will follow the line of the us and china i am concerned that under the impact of yesterday 's nuclear test by north koreans and because of the pressure from the bush administration , he will adopt a harder line .
we could see already for the last year that the south korean government has not continued the original approach on the sunshine policy as it has originally adopted it because the bush administration clearly did n't support that . what affect will ban 's nomination have on the current crisis ? in the best case , he might be able to get the six nation talks going again and he might be able to move the bush administration to do the one thing that would be absolutely necessary to come to a diplomatic solution , which is to give pyongyang a nuclear non-aggression guarantee - something the clinton administration did back in 1994 and the bush administration renounced the guarantee in 2003 .

this seems to be good for the un , but i disagree , because the main reason for this process has been that ban ki moon is the smallest common denominator between two most powerful members of the security council - the united states and china .
i think this is not enough for the other 190 member countries of the un . i am concerned that he will continue to conduct his policies very closely along the us foreign policy on the one hand , and on the other hand he will avoid anything to criticize china and he will not highlight the importance of human rights as strongly as kofi annan has done , he will most certainly not highlight the important role of non-government organizations for international politics and for the un as kofi annan has done .
i think he will continue to conduct his new job in the way that he has conducted all the other jobs , which is to avoid conflict . so you do n't think he will be able to set his own stamp ? bildunterschrift : a different un with ban ?
only time will tell i am concerned that this will not happen .
i am always prepared to be positively surprised , but so-far the 35 years of his political and diplomatic career do n't give us any indications that besides being a conduit of diplomacy and a strong and hard worker , he has not developed his own political positions , let alone visions . if you look at the necessity to reform the united nations , we still have this broad political reform agenda that kofi annan put on the political agenda last year which still need to be decided on and implemented .
here we would need a secretary general that followed the same line that kofi annan put forward , but i am concerned that ban ki moon will only be concerned with those management reforms that washington is pushing for . do you think he has been nominated because of his experience on the korean peninsula ? ban ki moon has been nominated because , firstly , china prevented the original washington intention to have an eastern european by threatening a hard veto against any non-asian candidate .
secondly , because washington and beijing agreed that it should not be an indian in this position and then if you look at the field of candidates from asia that were left , ban ki moon seems to be the one that fits the interests of washington and beijing most . dw staff -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu : north korean nuclear test is " unacceptable " the european union has strongly condemned north korea 's nuclear test as " unacceptable .

speculations are growing over how the south korean foreign minister will take on the tougher issues . andreas zumach is a geneva-based un correspondent for the german newspaper die tageszeitung . what has ban 's policy been as south korea foreign minster so far on north korea ? the problem is that there is no clear profile on his policy except that he is an efficient manager and mediator but he has never shown any political convictions , other than that he has been very close to whatever the us foreign policy was for the last 25 years . some people say that he is the architect of the so-called sunshine policy with north korea do you think he will adopt a harder line as requested by the us ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zumach thinks ban will follow the line of the us and china i am concerned that under the impact of yesterday 's nuclear test by north koreans and because of the pressure from the bush administration , he will adopt a harder line .
we could see already for the last year that the south korean government has not continued the original approach on the sunshine policy as it has originally adopted it because the bush administration clearly did n't support that . what affect will ban 's nomination have on the current crisis ? in the best case , he might be able to get the six nation talks going again and he might be able to move the bush administration to do the one thing that would be absolutely necessary to come to a diplomatic solution , which is to give pyongyang a nuclear non-aggression guarantee - something the clinton administration did back in 1994 and the bush administration renounced the guarantee in 2003 .
that 's when the problems began . do you think ban 's nomination might have provoked north korea nuclear test ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korean leader kim jong il has provoked the international community by testing nukes there are no indications that the timing of the nuclear test has anything to do with the election of ban ki moon , simply because the north korean government could not have guessed the development of the selection process for the secretary general at the un so for the timing i think it is rather a coincidence . what has made ban so popular with the un security council members ? it has been the smoothest selection process , compared to the former seven secretaries .
this seems to be good for the un , but i disagree , because the main reason for this process has been that ban ki moon is the smallest common denominator between two most powerful members of the security council - the united states and china .
i think this is not enough for the other 190 member countries of the un . i am concerned that he will continue to conduct his policies very closely along the us foreign policy on the one hand , and on the other hand he will avoid anything to criticize china and he will not highlight the importance of human rights as strongly as kofi annan has done , he will most certainly not highlight the important role of non-government organizations for international politics and for the un as kofi annan has done .
i think he will continue to conduct his new job in the way that he has conducted all the other jobs , which is to avoid conflict . so you do n't think he will be able to set his own stamp ? bildunterschrift : a different un with ban ?
only time will tell i am concerned that this will not happen .
i am always prepared to be positively surprised , but so-far the 35 years of his political and diplomatic career do n't give us any indications that besides being a conduit of diplomacy and a strong and hard worker , he has not developed his own political positions , let alone visions . if you look at the necessity to reform the united nations , we still have this broad political reform agenda that kofi annan put on the political agenda last year which still need to be decided on and implemented .
here we would need a secretary general that followed the same line that kofi annan put forward , but i am concerned that ban ki moon will only be concerned with those management reforms that washington is pushing for . do you think he has been nominated because of his experience on the korean peninsula ? ban ki moon has been nominated because , firstly , china prevented the original washington intention to have an eastern european by threatening a hard veto against any non-asian candidate .
secondly , because washington and beijing agreed that it should not be an indian in this position and then if you look at the field of candidates from asia that were left , ban ki moon seems to be the one that fits the interests of washington and beijing most . dw staff -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu : north korean nuclear test is " unacceptable " the european union has strongly condemned north korea 's nuclear test as " unacceptable .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de architecture -pipe- 10.10.2006 america 's new bastion in berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the embassy 's construction site is already a high-security area us diplomats tuesday will host a topping-off ceremony for their new embassy in central berlin .
a dispute over security precautions caused major delays for what some see as a symbol of german-american friendship . a sharp-toothed iron fence atop massive concrete slabs currently separates america 's representatives from the german people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not exactly welcoming : the current us embassy just off berlin 's unter den linden boulevard , the us embassy sits in a street that 's blocked off for traffic .
german police behind rows of concrete cylinders prevent unwanted visitors from getting too close .
" no photography " signs attached to the fence add to the inhospitable atmosphere . all that will change to a certain extent in the spring of 2008 , when american diplomats are expected to move three blocks down the street to the new embassy on pariser platz .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.10.2006 press review : a massive threat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world must now decide how to deal with north korean leader kim jong il the announcement by north korea on monday that it had successfully tested a nuclear weapon caused alarm around the world .
german newspapers on tuesday speculated about what the international community should do next . " seldom before has there been such consensus among north korea 's asian-pacific neighbors and pyongyang 's strategic rivals : this state represents a massive threat to regional stability , " wrote the süddeutsche zeitung from munich on tuesday .
" japan perceives itself to be in the greatest military danger , and as a result tokyo will rethink its approach to national security .
one possible consequence is the development of nuclear weapons throughout the entire region .
that can only be prevented if the united states concentrates its arsenal of deterrence on the pacific and offers both south korea and japan explicit assurances of its support in case of a nuclear conflict . " the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung also focused on the us ' possible response to the crisis .
" china and above all the united states have it in their power to bring pyongyang back to the bargaining table , " the paper wrote .
" the north korean regime has often let it be known via its news service kcna that it is primarily interested in direct negotiations with washington .
but the prospects are now worse than they were in 1994 .
north korea has proclaimed itself to be a nuclear power , and it 's going to take some true initiative to keep pyongyang , where the regime likely sees this as a struggle for survival , from engaging in further escalations . " " only a harsh reaction , which will unfortunately also affect north korea 's already suffering population will send the necessary signals to other nuclear aspirants and prevent the nuclear non-proliferation treaty from collapsing entirely , " wrote berlin 's daily der tagesspiegel on tuesday .
" but severity alone wo n't convince north korea 's dictator to change his mind .
the international community and the bush government , which has been indecisive on this issue , will have to offer rewards in return for a verifiable abandonment of the nuclear option . and the hamburger abendblatt commented in its tuesday edition : " strongly worded declarations and even threats of sanctions wo n't deter a country like north korea , which is already largely isolated as the poorhouse of southeast asia .
conversely , offers of rewards , in which north korea has nothing to lose and everything to gain , presuppose that ruling elites are capable of a certain degree of rationalism .
what remains is the unsettling prospect that north korea 's ' dr. strangelove ' now only lacks mid-range missiles .
a danger is growing , whose implications for world peace can not at present be predicted : that there will be a ratcheting up of the arms race in southeast asia . " dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu : north korean nuclear test is " unacceptable " the european union has strongly condemned north korea 's nuclear test as " unacceptable . "
germany , the united states and china have slammed the test as a provocation and demanded a tough united nations response .

a dispute over security precautions caused major delays for what some see as a symbol of german-american friendship . a sharp-toothed iron fence atop massive concrete slabs currently separates america 's representatives from the german people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not exactly welcoming : the current us embassy just off berlin 's unter den linden boulevard , the us embassy sits in a street that 's blocked off for traffic .
german police behind rows of concrete cylinders prevent unwanted visitors from getting too close .
" no photography " signs attached to the fence add to the inhospitable atmosphere . all that will change to a certain extent in the spring of 2008 , when american diplomats are expected to move three blocks down the street to the new embassy on pariser platz .
home to berlin 's landmark brandenburg gate , which became the symbol of reunification , the square draws hordes of tourists , becomes party central on new year 's eve and serves as the backdrop for major celebrations such as the 2006 soccer world cup , when millions of fans gathered to cheer their teams . making a statement it 's hardly a dream location when it comes to security : the square can not be completely cordoned off like the nearby street where the british embassy has set up quarters .
but soon after german reunification , us officials decided to make a statement by building their embassy on the very spot where us diplomats had once worked before world war ii . " the decision of the united states to return to this historic site symbolizes america 's support for a unified germany , " former ambassador daniel r. coats said at a groundbreaking ceremony in 2004 . bildunterschrift : the 180-million-euro -lrb- $ 228-million -rrb- embassy , sitting on the right corner , was designed by santa monica-based moore ruble yudell architects , who count the tacoma campus of the university of washington , a courthouse in fresno , an office complex in beijing and several churches among previous projects skylights and security zones almost exactly two years later , the building shell has been completed .
still missing are a glass conference room on top of the roof that is meant to illuminate berlin 's sky at night as well as a " green band of trees , gardens and walkways " along the street fronts .
already in place , however , are dozens of poles made of steel and concrete that are meant to guard the building against terrorist attacks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would neuschwanstein castle have been a better place for the new embassy ?
security concerns were also the main reason for a decade-long delay of the project .
following the 1998 bombings at us embassies in kenya and tanzania , us legislators called for more protection at new diplomatic missions .
confronted with the demands , berlin officials were especially irked by a 30-meter -lrb- 100-feet -rrb- security zone between the building and the street that would have required a complete redesign of the surrounding historic streets . the dispute reached comical proportions when berlin 's mayor reportedly said that americans should instead build a fast-food restaurant at the site , and the us ambassador jokingly suggested moving the embassy to bavaria 's world-famous -lrb- and certainly secure -rrb- neuschwanstein castle , where americans had always been welcome . a very good compromise ? both sides finally agreed to compromise by reducing the safety zone to 25 meters and shifting streets a little . " the overall design has been enriched by extensive critique and collaboration with the urban planning authorities of berlin and a sensitivity to the surrounding historic quarters , " reads a text on the embassy 's web site .
embassy officials were not available for comment monday as the embassy was closed for columbus day . bildunterschrift : the embassy 's shell on the left closes the gap along pariser platz .
only a bank 's building separates it from berlin 's famous brandenburg gate , seen on the right meanwhile , petra rohland , a spokeswoman for berlin 's urban planning department , looked on the bright side . " we found a very good compromise , " she said , adding that it addressed the american security concerns as well as berlin 's desire to keep the surroundings of pariser platz open to the public . closing the gap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these poles are still waiting for their historic coats " it closes the gap , " rohland said , referring to the last bit of wasteland along the square that has now disappeared .
" as good hosts , we 'll now have the embassy in this truly beautiful place . " besides , some of the security precautions will actually return some history to the square , rohland said : the poles will look like ones used as roadblocks in previous times . incidentally , the american need for security will also bring some increased security to the french embassy , which sits diagonally across on the other side of the square .
for reasons of symmetry , preservationists required the same poles to be installed there as well . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us ambassador to berlin says europeans are soft on terror in marking the fifth anniversary of the september 11 attacks , us ambassador to germany , william timken , voiced an unpopular hardline view on europe 's battle against islamic terrorism .

german newspapers on tuesday speculated about what the international community should do next . " seldom before has there been such consensus among north korea 's asian-pacific neighbors and pyongyang 's strategic rivals : this state represents a massive threat to regional stability , " wrote the süddeutsche zeitung from munich on tuesday .
" japan perceives itself to be in the greatest military danger , and as a result tokyo will rethink its approach to national security .
one possible consequence is the development of nuclear weapons throughout the entire region .
that can only be prevented if the united states concentrates its arsenal of deterrence on the pacific and offers both south korea and japan explicit assurances of its support in case of a nuclear conflict . " the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung also focused on the us ' possible response to the crisis .
" china and above all the united states have it in their power to bring pyongyang back to the bargaining table , " the paper wrote .
" the north korean regime has often let it be known via its news service kcna that it is primarily interested in direct negotiations with washington .
but the prospects are now worse than they were in 1994 .
north korea has proclaimed itself to be a nuclear power , and it 's going to take some true initiative to keep pyongyang , where the regime likely sees this as a struggle for survival , from engaging in further escalations . " " only a harsh reaction , which will unfortunately also affect north korea 's already suffering population will send the necessary signals to other nuclear aspirants and prevent the nuclear non-proliferation treaty from collapsing entirely , " wrote berlin 's daily der tagesspiegel on tuesday .
" but severity alone wo n't convince north korea 's dictator to change his mind .
the international community and the bush government , which has been indecisive on this issue , will have to offer rewards in return for a verifiable abandonment of the nuclear option . and the hamburger abendblatt commented in its tuesday edition : " strongly worded declarations and even threats of sanctions wo n't deter a country like north korea , which is already largely isolated as the poorhouse of southeast asia .
conversely , offers of rewards , in which north korea has nothing to lose and everything to gain , presuppose that ruling elites are capable of a certain degree of rationalism .
what remains is the unsettling prospect that north korea 's ' dr. strangelove ' now only lacks mid-range missiles .
a danger is growing , whose implications for world peace can not at present be predicted : that there will be a ratcheting up of the arms race in southeast asia .

he said that sanctions were officially no longer on the table since germany 's deficit for 2006 should fall well within the 3 percent euro zone limit . the announcement ends germany 's embarrassing five-year struggle with the spending guideline .
throughout the 1990s , as a precondition for the adoption of a single european currency , germany insisted on a cap for state debt to ensure fiscal discipline among member states .
but due to soaring government costs and dwindling state revenues , germany missed that mark in 2002 and has failed to meet it ever since . that will change this year - thanks in part to increased consumer spending within germany and cutbacks in the country 's generous social welfare programs .
almunia 's announcement confirms an unofficial agreement among eu finance members in early september to drop disciplinary proceedings against berlin . almunia also said that greece and france - two other eu " debt sinners " - should also reduce their deficits below 3 percent in 2006 , and that italy was on course to follow suit in 2007 . germany 's improved budget figures come amidst what 's being seen as a slight recovery in the german economy .
but critics warn that hikes in value-added tax planned for 2007 could dampen consumer spending and stifle the incipient economic comeback . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de minister says germany off the hook in eu budget deficit affair german finance minister peer steinbrück has said that germany no longer has to fear sanctions for violating the eu 's stability and growth pact .

instead of raising taxes , however , it should reduce spending , says dw 's karl zawadzky .

a dispute over security precautions caused major delays for what some see as a symbol of german-american friendship . a sharp-toothed iron fence atop massive concrete slabs currently separates america 's representatives from the german people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not exactly welcoming : the current us embassy just off berlin 's unter den linden boulevard , the us embassy sits in a street that 's blocked off for traffic .
german police behind rows of concrete cylinders prevent unwanted visitors from getting too close .
" no photography " signs attached to the fence add to the inhospitable atmosphere . all that will change to a certain extent in the spring of 2008 , when american diplomats are expected to move three blocks down the street to the new embassy on pariser platz .
home to berlin 's landmark brandenburg gate , which became the symbol of reunification , the square draws hordes of tourists , becomes party central on new year 's eve and serves as the backdrop for major celebrations such as the 2006 soccer world cup , when millions of fans gathered to cheer their teams . making a statement it 's hardly a dream location when it comes to security : the square can not be completely cordoned off like the nearby street where the british embassy has set up quarters .
but soon after german reunification , us officials decided to make a statement by building their embassy on the very spot where us diplomats had once worked before world war ii . " the decision of the united states to return to this historic site symbolizes america 's support for a unified germany , " former ambassador daniel r. coats said at a groundbreaking ceremony in 2004 . bildunterschrift : the 180-million-euro -lrb- $ 228-million -rrb- embassy , sitting on the right corner , was designed by santa monica-based moore ruble yudell architects , who count the tacoma campus of the university of washington , a courthouse in fresno , an office complex in beijing and several churches among previous projects skylights and security zones almost exactly two years later , the building shell has been completed .
still missing are a glass conference room on top of the roof that is meant to illuminate berlin 's sky at night as well as a " green band of trees , gardens and walkways " along the street fronts .
already in place , however , are dozens of poles made of steel and concrete that are meant to guard the building against terrorist attacks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would neuschwanstein castle have been a better place for the new embassy ?
security concerns were also the main reason for a decade-long delay of the project .
following the 1998 bombings at us embassies in kenya and tanzania , us legislators called for more protection at new diplomatic missions .
confronted with the demands , berlin officials were especially irked by a 30-meter -lrb- 100-feet -rrb- security zone between the building and the street that would have required a complete redesign of the surrounding historic streets . the dispute reached comical proportions when berlin 's mayor reportedly said that americans should instead build a fast-food restaurant at the site , and the us ambassador jokingly suggested moving the embassy to bavaria 's world-famous -lrb- and certainly secure -rrb- neuschwanstein castle , where americans had always been welcome . a very good compromise ? both sides finally agreed to compromise by reducing the safety zone to 25 meters and shifting streets a little . " the overall design has been enriched by extensive critique and collaboration with the urban planning authorities of berlin and a sensitivity to the surrounding historic quarters , " reads a text on the embassy 's web site .
embassy officials were not available for comment monday as the embassy was closed for columbus day . bildunterschrift : the embassy 's shell on the left closes the gap along pariser platz .
only a bank 's building separates it from berlin 's famous brandenburg gate , seen on the right meanwhile , petra rohland , a spokeswoman for berlin 's urban planning department , looked on the bright side . " we found a very good compromise , " she said , adding that it addressed the american security concerns as well as berlin 's desire to keep the surroundings of pariser platz open to the public . closing the gap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these poles are still waiting for their historic coats " it closes the gap , " rohland said , referring to the last bit of wasteland along the square that has now disappeared .
" as good hosts , we 'll now have the embassy in this truly beautiful place . " besides , some of the security precautions will actually return some history to the square , rohland said : the poles will look like ones used as roadblocks in previous times . incidentally , the american need for security will also bring some increased security to the french embassy , which sits diagonally across on the other side of the square .

he said that sanctions were officially no longer on the table since germany 's deficit for 2006 should fall well within the 3 percent euro zone limit . the announcement ends germany 's embarrassing five-year struggle with the spending guideline .
throughout the 1990s , as a precondition for the adoption of a single european currency , germany insisted on a cap for state debt to ensure fiscal discipline among member states .
but due to soaring government costs and dwindling state revenues , germany missed that mark in 2002 and has failed to meet it ever since . that will change this year - thanks in part to increased consumer spending within germany and cutbacks in the country 's generous social welfare programs .
almunia 's announcement confirms an unofficial agreement among eu finance members in early september to drop disciplinary proceedings against berlin . almunia also said that greece and france - two other eu " debt sinners " - should also reduce their deficits below 3 percent in 2006 , and that italy was on course to follow suit in 2007 . germany 's improved budget figures come amidst what 's being seen as a slight recovery in the german economy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de architecture -pipe- 10.10.2006 america 's new bastion in berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the embassy 's construction site is already a high-security area us diplomats tuesday will host a topping-off ceremony for their new embassy in central berlin .
a dispute over security precautions caused major delays for what some see as a symbol of german-american friendship . a sharp-toothed iron fence atop massive concrete slabs currently separates america 's representatives from the german people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not exactly welcoming : the current us embassy just off berlin 's unter den linden boulevard , the us embassy sits in a street that 's blocked off for traffic .
german police behind rows of concrete cylinders prevent unwanted visitors from getting too close .
" no photography " signs attached to the fence add to the inhospitable atmosphere . all that will change to a certain extent in the spring of 2008 , when american diplomats are expected to move three blocks down the street to the new embassy on pariser platz .
home to berlin 's landmark brandenburg gate , which became the symbol of reunification , the square draws hordes of tourists , becomes party central on new year 's eve and serves as the backdrop for major celebrations such as the 2006 soccer world cup , when millions of fans gathered to cheer their teams . making a statement it 's hardly a dream location when it comes to security : the square can not be completely cordoned off like the nearby street where the british embassy has set up quarters .
but soon after german reunification , us officials decided to make a statement by building their embassy on the very spot where us diplomats had once worked before world war ii . " the decision of the united states to return to this historic site symbolizes america 's support for a unified germany , " former ambassador daniel r. coats said at a groundbreaking ceremony in 2004 . bildunterschrift : the 180-million-euro -lrb- $ 228-million -rrb- embassy , sitting on the right corner , was designed by santa monica-based moore ruble yudell architects , who count the tacoma campus of the university of washington , a courthouse in fresno , an office complex in beijing and several churches among previous projects skylights and security zones almost exactly two years later , the building shell has been completed .
still missing are a glass conference room on top of the roof that is meant to illuminate berlin 's sky at night as well as a " green band of trees , gardens and walkways " along the street fronts .
already in place , however , are dozens of poles made of steel and concrete that are meant to guard the building against terrorist attacks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would neuschwanstein castle have been a better place for the new embassy ?
security concerns were also the main reason for a decade-long delay of the project .
following the 1998 bombings at us embassies in kenya and tanzania , us legislators called for more protection at new diplomatic missions .
confronted with the demands , berlin officials were especially irked by a 30-meter -lrb- 100-feet -rrb- security zone between the building and the street that would have required a complete redesign of the surrounding historic streets . the dispute reached comical proportions when berlin 's mayor reportedly said that americans should instead build a fast-food restaurant at the site , and the us ambassador jokingly suggested moving the embassy to bavaria 's world-famous -lrb- and certainly secure -rrb- neuschwanstein castle , where americans had always been welcome . a very good compromise ? both sides finally agreed to compromise by reducing the safety zone to 25 meters and shifting streets a little . " the overall design has been enriched by extensive critique and collaboration with the urban planning authorities of berlin and a sensitivity to the surrounding historic quarters , " reads a text on the embassy 's web site .
embassy officials were not available for comment monday as the embassy was closed for columbus day . bildunterschrift : the embassy 's shell on the left closes the gap along pariser platz .
only a bank 's building separates it from berlin 's famous brandenburg gate , seen on the right meanwhile , petra rohland , a spokeswoman for berlin 's urban planning department , looked on the bright side . " we found a very good compromise , " she said , adding that it addressed the american security concerns as well as berlin 's desire to keep the surroundings of pariser platz open to the public . closing the gap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these poles are still waiting for their historic coats " it closes the gap , " rohland said , referring to the last bit of wasteland along the square that has now disappeared .
" as good hosts , we 'll now have the embassy in this truly beautiful place . " besides , some of the security precautions will actually return some history to the square , rohland said : the poles will look like ones used as roadblocks in previous times . incidentally , the american need for security will also bring some increased security to the french embassy , which sits diagonally across on the other side of the square .
for reasons of symmetry , preservationists required the same poles to be installed there as well . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us ambassador to berlin says europeans are soft on terror in marking the fifth anniversary of the september 11 attacks , us ambassador to germany , william timken , voiced an unpopular hardline view on europe 's battle against islamic terrorism .

german newspapers on tuesday speculated about what the international community should do next . " seldom before has there been such consensus among north korea 's asian-pacific neighbors and pyongyang 's strategic rivals : this state represents a massive threat to regional stability , " wrote the süddeutsche zeitung from munich on tuesday .
" japan perceives itself to be in the greatest military danger , and as a result tokyo will rethink its approach to national security .
one possible consequence is the development of nuclear weapons throughout the entire region .
that can only be prevented if the united states concentrates its arsenal of deterrence on the pacific and offers both south korea and japan explicit assurances of its support in case of a nuclear conflict . " the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung also focused on the us ' possible response to the crisis .
" china and above all the united states have it in their power to bring pyongyang back to the bargaining table , " the paper wrote .
" the north korean regime has often let it be known via its news service kcna that it is primarily interested in direct negotiations with washington .
but the prospects are now worse than they were in 1994 .
north korea has proclaimed itself to be a nuclear power , and it 's going to take some true initiative to keep pyongyang , where the regime likely sees this as a struggle for survival , from engaging in further escalations . " " only a harsh reaction , which will unfortunately also affect north korea 's already suffering population will send the necessary signals to other nuclear aspirants and prevent the nuclear non-proliferation treaty from collapsing entirely , " wrote berlin 's daily der tagesspiegel on tuesday .
" but severity alone wo n't convince north korea 's dictator to change his mind .
the international community and the bush government , which has been indecisive on this issue , will have to offer rewards in return for a verifiable abandonment of the nuclear option . and the hamburger abendblatt commented in its tuesday edition : " strongly worded declarations and even threats of sanctions wo n't deter a country like north korea , which is already largely isolated as the poorhouse of southeast asia .
conversely , offers of rewards , in which north korea has nothing to lose and everything to gain , presuppose that ruling elites are capable of a certain degree of rationalism .
what remains is the unsettling prospect that north korea 's ' dr. strangelove ' now only lacks mid-range missiles .
a danger is growing , whose implications for world peace can not at present be predicted : that there will be a ratcheting up of the arms race in southeast asia .

german newspapers on tuesday speculated about what the international community should do next . " seldom before has there been such consensus among north korea 's asian-pacific neighbors and pyongyang 's strategic rivals : this state represents a massive threat to regional stability , " wrote the süddeutsche zeitung from munich on tuesday .
" japan perceives itself to be in the greatest military danger , and as a result tokyo will rethink its approach to national security .
one possible consequence is the development of nuclear weapons throughout the entire region .
that can only be prevented if the united states concentrates its arsenal of deterrence on the pacific and offers both south korea and japan explicit assurances of its support in case of a nuclear conflict . " the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung also focused on the us ' possible response to the crisis .

a dispute over security precautions caused major delays for what some see as a symbol of german-american friendship . a sharp-toothed iron fence atop massive concrete slabs currently separates america 's representatives from the german people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not exactly welcoming : the current us embassy just off berlin 's unter den linden boulevard , the us embassy sits in a street that 's blocked off for traffic .
german police behind rows of concrete cylinders prevent unwanted visitors from getting too close .
" no photography " signs attached to the fence add to the inhospitable atmosphere . all that will change to a certain extent in the spring of 2008 , when american diplomats are expected to move three blocks down the street to the new embassy on pariser platz .
home to berlin 's landmark brandenburg gate , which became the symbol of reunification , the square draws hordes of tourists , becomes party central on new year 's eve and serves as the backdrop for major celebrations such as the 2006 soccer world cup , when millions of fans gathered to cheer their teams . making a statement it 's hardly a dream location when it comes to security : the square can not be completely cordoned off like the nearby street where the british embassy has set up quarters .
but soon after german reunification , us officials decided to make a statement by building their embassy on the very spot where us diplomats had once worked before world war ii . " the decision of the united states to return to this historic site symbolizes america 's support for a unified germany , " former ambassador daniel r. coats said at a groundbreaking ceremony in 2004 . bildunterschrift : the 180-million-euro -lrb- $ 228-million -rrb- embassy , sitting on the right corner , was designed by santa monica-based moore ruble yudell architects , who count the tacoma campus of the university of washington , a courthouse in fresno , an office complex in beijing and several churches among previous projects skylights and security zones almost exactly two years later , the building shell has been completed .
still missing are a glass conference room on top of the roof that is meant to illuminate berlin 's sky at night as well as a " green band of trees , gardens and walkways " along the street fronts .

security concerns were also the main reason for a decade-long delay of the project .
following the 1998 bombings at us embassies in kenya and tanzania , us legislators called for more protection at new diplomatic missions .
confronted with the demands , berlin officials were especially irked by a 30-meter -lrb- 100-feet -rrb- security zone between the building and the street that would have required a complete redesign of the surrounding historic streets . the dispute reached comical proportions when berlin 's mayor reportedly said that americans should instead build a fast-food restaurant at the site , and the us ambassador jokingly suggested moving the embassy to bavaria 's world-famous -lrb- and certainly secure -rrb- neuschwanstein castle , where americans had always been welcome . a very good compromise ? both sides finally agreed to compromise by reducing the safety zone to 25 meters and shifting streets a little . " the overall design has been enriched by extensive critique and collaboration with the urban planning authorities of berlin and a sensitivity to the surrounding historic quarters , " reads a text on the embassy 's web site .
embassy officials were not available for comment monday as the embassy was closed for columbus day . bildunterschrift : the embassy 's shell on the left closes the gap along pariser platz .
only a bank 's building separates it from berlin 's famous brandenburg gate , seen on the right meanwhile , petra rohland , a spokeswoman for berlin 's urban planning department , looked on the bright side . " we found a very good compromise , " she said , adding that it addressed the american security concerns as well as berlin 's desire to keep the surroundings of pariser platz open to the public . closing the gap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these poles are still waiting for their historic coats " it closes the gap , " rohland said , referring to the last bit of wasteland along the square that has now disappeared .
" as good hosts , we 'll now have the embassy in this truly beautiful place . " besides , some of the security precautions will actually return some history to the square , rohland said : the poles will look like ones used as roadblocks in previous times . incidentally , the american need for security will also bring some increased security to the french embassy , which sits diagonally across on the other side of the square .

a dispute over security precautions caused major delays for what some see as a symbol of german-american friendship . a sharp-toothed iron fence atop massive concrete slabs currently separates america 's representatives from the german people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not exactly welcoming : the current us embassy just off berlin 's unter den linden boulevard , the us embassy sits in a street that 's blocked off for traffic .
german police behind rows of concrete cylinders prevent unwanted visitors from getting too close .
" no photography " signs attached to the fence add to the inhospitable atmosphere . all that will change to a certain extent in the spring of 2008 , when american diplomats are expected to move three blocks down the street to the new embassy on pariser platz .
home to berlin 's landmark brandenburg gate , which became the symbol of reunification , the square draws hordes of tourists , becomes party central on new year 's eve and serves as the backdrop for major celebrations such as the 2006 soccer world cup , when millions of fans gathered to cheer their teams . making a statement it 's hardly a dream location when it comes to security : the square can not be completely cordoned off like the nearby street where the british embassy has set up quarters .
but soon after german reunification , us officials decided to make a statement by building their embassy on the very spot where us diplomats had once worked before world war ii . " the decision of the united states to return to this historic site symbolizes america 's support for a unified germany , " former ambassador daniel r. coats said at a groundbreaking ceremony in 2004 . bildunterschrift : the 180-million-euro -lrb- $ 228-million -rrb- embassy , sitting on the right corner , was designed by santa monica-based moore ruble yudell architects , who count the tacoma campus of the university of washington , a courthouse in fresno , an office complex in beijing and several churches among previous projects skylights and security zones almost exactly two years later , the building shell has been completed .
still missing are a glass conference room on top of the roof that is meant to illuminate berlin 's sky at night as well as a " green band of trees , gardens and walkways " along the street fronts .
already in place , however , are dozens of poles made of steel and concrete that are meant to guard the building against terrorist attacks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would neuschwanstein castle have been a better place for the new embassy ?
security concerns were also the main reason for a decade-long delay of the project .
following the 1998 bombings at us embassies in kenya and tanzania , us legislators called for more protection at new diplomatic missions .
confronted with the demands , berlin officials were especially irked by a 30-meter -lrb- 100-feet -rrb- security zone between the building and the street that would have required a complete redesign of the surrounding historic streets . the dispute reached comical proportions when berlin 's mayor reportedly said that americans should instead build a fast-food restaurant at the site , and the us ambassador jokingly suggested moving the embassy to bavaria 's world-famous -lrb- and certainly secure -rrb- neuschwanstein castle , where americans had always been welcome . a very good compromise ? both sides finally agreed to compromise by reducing the safety zone to 25 meters and shifting streets a little . " the overall design has been enriched by extensive critique and collaboration with the urban planning authorities of berlin and a sensitivity to the surrounding historic quarters , " reads a text on the embassy 's web site .
embassy officials were not available for comment monday as the embassy was closed for columbus day . bildunterschrift : the embassy 's shell on the left closes the gap along pariser platz .
only a bank 's building separates it from berlin 's famous brandenburg gate , seen on the right meanwhile , petra rohland , a spokeswoman for berlin 's urban planning department , looked on the bright side . " we found a very good compromise , " she said , adding that it addressed the american security concerns as well as berlin 's desire to keep the surroundings of pariser platz open to the public . closing the gap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these poles are still waiting for their historic coats " it closes the gap , " rohland said , referring to the last bit of wasteland along the square that has now disappeared .
" as good hosts , we 'll now have the embassy in this truly beautiful place . " besides , some of the security precautions will actually return some history to the square , rohland said : the poles will look like ones used as roadblocks in previous times . incidentally , the american need for security will also bring some increased security to the french embassy , which sits diagonally across on the other side of the square .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de architecture -pipe- 10.10.2006 america 's new bastion in berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the embassy 's construction site is already a high-security area us diplomats tuesday will host a topping-off ceremony for their new embassy in central berlin .
a dispute over security precautions caused major delays for what some see as a symbol of german-american friendship . a sharp-toothed iron fence atop massive concrete slabs currently separates america 's representatives from the german people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not exactly welcoming : the current us embassy just off berlin 's unter den linden boulevard , the us embassy sits in a street that 's blocked off for traffic .
german police behind rows of concrete cylinders prevent unwanted visitors from getting too close .
" no photography " signs attached to the fence add to the inhospitable atmosphere . all that will change to a certain extent in the spring of 2008 , when american diplomats are expected to move three blocks down the street to the new embassy on pariser platz .
home to berlin 's landmark brandenburg gate , which became the symbol of reunification , the square draws hordes of tourists , becomes party central on new year 's eve and serves as the backdrop for major celebrations such as the 2006 soccer world cup , when millions of fans gathered to cheer their teams . making a statement it 's hardly a dream location when it comes to security : the square can not be completely cordoned off like the nearby street where the british embassy has set up quarters .
but soon after german reunification , us officials decided to make a statement by building their embassy on the very spot where us diplomats had once worked before world war ii . " the decision of the united states to return to this historic site symbolizes america 's support for a unified germany , " former ambassador daniel r. coats said at a groundbreaking ceremony in 2004 . bildunterschrift : the 180-million-euro -lrb- $ 228-million -rrb- embassy , sitting on the right corner , was designed by santa monica-based moore ruble yudell architects , who count the tacoma campus of the university of washington , a courthouse in fresno , an office complex in beijing and several churches among previous projects skylights and security zones almost exactly two years later , the building shell has been completed .
still missing are a glass conference room on top of the roof that is meant to illuminate berlin 's sky at night as well as a " green band of trees , gardens and walkways " along the street fronts .

security concerns were also the main reason for a decade-long delay of the project .
following the 1998 bombings at us embassies in kenya and tanzania , us legislators called for more protection at new diplomatic missions .
confronted with the demands , berlin officials were especially irked by a 30-meter -lrb- 100-feet -rrb- security zone between the building and the street that would have required a complete redesign of the surrounding historic streets . the dispute reached comical proportions when berlin 's mayor reportedly said that americans should instead build a fast-food restaurant at the site , and the us ambassador jokingly suggested moving the embassy to bavaria 's world-famous -lrb- and certainly secure -rrb- neuschwanstein castle , where americans had always been welcome . a very good compromise ? both sides finally agreed to compromise by reducing the safety zone to 25 meters and shifting streets a little . " the overall design has been enriched by extensive critique and collaboration with the urban planning authorities of berlin and a sensitivity to the surrounding historic quarters , " reads a text on the embassy 's web site .
embassy officials were not available for comment monday as the embassy was closed for columbus day . bildunterschrift : the embassy 's shell on the left closes the gap along pariser platz .
only a bank 's building separates it from berlin 's famous brandenburg gate , seen on the right meanwhile , petra rohland , a spokeswoman for berlin 's urban planning department , looked on the bright side . " we found a very good compromise , " she said , adding that it addressed the american security concerns as well as berlin 's desire to keep the surroundings of pariser platz open to the public . closing the gap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these poles are still waiting for their historic coats " it closes the gap , " rohland said , referring to the last bit of wasteland along the square that has now disappeared .
" as good hosts , we 'll now have the embassy in this truly beautiful place . " besides , some of the security precautions will actually return some history to the square , rohland said : the poles will look like ones used as roadblocks in previous times . incidentally , the american need for security will also bring some increased security to the french embassy , which sits diagonally across on the other side of the square .
for reasons of symmetry , preservationists required the same poles to be installed there as well . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us ambassador to berlin says europeans are soft on terror in marking the fifth anniversary of the september 11 attacks , us ambassador to germany , william timken , voiced an unpopular hardline view on europe 's battle against islamic terrorism .

he said that sanctions were officially no longer on the table since germany 's deficit for 2006 should fall well within the 3 percent euro zone limit . the announcement ends germany 's embarrassing five-year struggle with the spending guideline .
throughout the 1990s , as a precondition for the adoption of a single european currency , germany insisted on a cap for state debt to ensure fiscal discipline among member states .
but due to soaring government costs and dwindling state revenues , germany missed that mark in 2002 and has failed to meet it ever since . that will change this year - thanks in part to increased consumer spending within germany and cutbacks in the country 's generous social welfare programs .
almunia 's announcement confirms an unofficial agreement among eu finance members in early september to drop disciplinary proceedings against berlin . almunia also said that greece and france - two other eu " debt sinners " - should also reduce their deficits below 3 percent in 2006 , and that italy was on course to follow suit in 2007 . germany 's improved budget figures come amidst what 's being seen as a slight recovery in the german economy .

speculations are growing over how the south korean foreign minister will take on the tougher issues . andreas zumach is a geneva-based un correspondent for the german newspaper die tageszeitung . what has ban 's policy been as south korea foreign minster so far on north korea ? the problem is that there is no clear profile on his policy except that he is an efficient manager and mediator but he has never shown any political convictions , other than that he has been very close to whatever the us foreign policy was for the last 25 years . some people say that he is the architect of the so-called sunshine policy with north korea do you think he will adopt a harder line as requested by the us ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zumach thinks ban will follow the line of the us and china i am concerned that under the impact of yesterday 's nuclear test by north koreans and because of the pressure from the bush administration , he will adopt a harder line .
we could see already for the last year that the south korean government has not continued the original approach on the sunshine policy as it has originally adopted it because the bush administration clearly did n't support that . what affect will ban 's nomination have on the current crisis ? in the best case , he might be able to get the six nation talks going again and he might be able to move the bush administration to do the one thing that would be absolutely necessary to come to a diplomatic solution , which is to give pyongyang a nuclear non-aggression guarantee - something the clinton administration did back in 1994 and the bush administration renounced the guarantee in 2003 .
that 's when the problems began . do you think ban 's nomination might have provoked north korea nuclear test ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korean leader kim jong il has provoked the international community by testing nukes there are no indications that the timing of the nuclear test has anything to do with the election of ban ki moon , simply because the north korean government could not have guessed the development of the selection process for the secretary general at the un so for the timing i think it is rather a coincidence . what has made ban so popular with the un security council members ? it has been the smoothest selection process , compared to the former seven secretaries .
this seems to be good for the un , but i disagree , because the main reason for this process has been that ban ki moon is the smallest common denominator between two most powerful members of the security council - the united states and china .
i think this is not enough for the other 190 member countries of the un . i am concerned that he will continue to conduct his policies very closely along the us foreign policy on the one hand , and on the other hand he will avoid anything to criticize china and he will not highlight the importance of human rights as strongly as kofi annan has done , he will most certainly not highlight the important role of non-government organizations for international politics and for the un as kofi annan has done .
i think he will continue to conduct his new job in the way that he has conducted all the other jobs , which is to avoid conflict . so you do n't think he will be able to set his own stamp ? bildunterschrift : a different un with ban ?
only time will tell i am concerned that this will not happen .
i am always prepared to be positively surprised , but so-far the 35 years of his political and diplomatic career do n't give us any indications that besides being a conduit of diplomacy and a strong and hard worker , he has not developed his own political positions , let alone visions . if you look at the necessity to reform the united nations , we still have this broad political reform agenda that kofi annan put on the political agenda last year which still need to be decided on and implemented .
here we would need a secretary general that followed the same line that kofi annan put forward , but i am concerned that ban ki moon will only be concerned with those management reforms that washington is pushing for . do you think he has been nominated because of his experience on the korean peninsula ? ban ki moon has been nominated because , firstly , china prevented the original washington intention to have an eastern european by threatening a hard veto against any non-asian candidate .
secondly , because washington and beijing agreed that it should not be an indian in this position and then if you look at the field of candidates from asia that were left , ban ki moon seems to be the one that fits the interests of washington and beijing most . dw staff -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu : north korean nuclear test is " unacceptable " the european union has strongly condemned north korea 's nuclear test as " unacceptable .

speculations are growing over how the south korean foreign minister will take on the tougher issues . andreas zumach is a geneva-based un correspondent for the german newspaper die tageszeitung . what has ban 's policy been as south korea foreign minster so far on north korea ? the problem is that there is no clear profile on his policy except that he is an efficient manager and mediator but he has never shown any political convictions , other than that he has been very close to whatever the us foreign policy was for the last 25 years . some people say that he is the architect of the so-called sunshine policy with north korea do you think he will adopt a harder line as requested by the us ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zumach thinks ban will follow the line of the us and china i am concerned that under the impact of yesterday 's nuclear test by north koreans and because of the pressure from the bush administration , he will adopt a harder line .
we could see already for the last year that the south korean government has not continued the original approach on the sunshine policy as it has originally adopted it because the bush administration clearly did n't support that . what affect will ban 's nomination have on the current crisis ? in the best case , he might be able to get the six nation talks going again and he might be able to move the bush administration to do the one thing that would be absolutely necessary to come to a diplomatic solution , which is to give pyongyang a nuclear non-aggression guarantee - something the clinton administration did back in 1994 and the bush administration renounced the guarantee in 2003 .
that 's when the problems began . do you think ban 's nomination might have provoked north korea nuclear test ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korean leader kim jong il has provoked the international community by testing nukes there are no indications that the timing of the nuclear test has anything to do with the election of ban ki moon , simply because the north korean government could not have guessed the development of the selection process for the secretary general at the un so for the timing i think it is rather a coincidence . what has made ban so popular with the un security council members ? it has been the smoothest selection process , compared to the former seven secretaries .
this seems to be good for the un , but i disagree , because the main reason for this process has been that ban ki moon is the smallest common denominator between two most powerful members of the security council - the united states and china .
i think this is not enough for the other 190 member countries of the un . i am concerned that he will continue to conduct his policies very closely along the us foreign policy on the one hand , and on the other hand he will avoid anything to criticize china and he will not highlight the importance of human rights as strongly as kofi annan has done , he will most certainly not highlight the important role of non-government organizations for international politics and for the un as kofi annan has done .
i think he will continue to conduct his new job in the way that he has conducted all the other jobs , which is to avoid conflict . so you do n't think he will be able to set his own stamp ? bildunterschrift : a different un with ban ?
only time will tell i am concerned that this will not happen .
i am always prepared to be positively surprised , but so-far the 35 years of his political and diplomatic career do n't give us any indications that besides being a conduit of diplomacy and a strong and hard worker , he has not developed his own political positions , let alone visions . if you look at the necessity to reform the united nations , we still have this broad political reform agenda that kofi annan put on the political agenda last year which still need to be decided on and implemented .
here we would need a secretary general that followed the same line that kofi annan put forward , but i am concerned that ban ki moon will only be concerned with those management reforms that washington is pushing for . do you think he has been nominated because of his experience on the korean peninsula ? ban ki moon has been nominated because , firstly , china prevented the original washington intention to have an eastern european by threatening a hard veto against any non-asian candidate .
secondly , because washington and beijing agreed that it should not be an indian in this position and then if you look at the field of candidates from asia that were left , ban ki moon seems to be the one that fits the interests of washington and beijing most . dw staff -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu : north korean nuclear test is " unacceptable " the european union has strongly condemned north korea 's nuclear test as " unacceptable .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.10.2006 press review : a massive threat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world must now decide how to deal with north korean leader kim jong il the announcement by north korea on monday that it had successfully tested a nuclear weapon caused alarm around the world .
german newspapers on tuesday speculated about what the international community should do next . " seldom before has there been such consensus among north korea 's asian-pacific neighbors and pyongyang 's strategic rivals : this state represents a massive threat to regional stability , " wrote the süddeutsche zeitung from munich on tuesday .
" japan perceives itself to be in the greatest military danger , and as a result tokyo will rethink its approach to national security .
one possible consequence is the development of nuclear weapons throughout the entire region .
that can only be prevented if the united states concentrates its arsenal of deterrence on the pacific and offers both south korea and japan explicit assurances of its support in case of a nuclear conflict . " the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung also focused on the us ' possible response to the crisis .
" china and above all the united states have it in their power to bring pyongyang back to the bargaining table , " the paper wrote .
" the north korean regime has often let it be known via its news service kcna that it is primarily interested in direct negotiations with washington .
but the prospects are now worse than they were in 1994 .
north korea has proclaimed itself to be a nuclear power , and it 's going to take some true initiative to keep pyongyang , where the regime likely sees this as a struggle for survival , from engaging in further escalations . " " only a harsh reaction , which will unfortunately also affect north korea 's already suffering population will send the necessary signals to other nuclear aspirants and prevent the nuclear non-proliferation treaty from collapsing entirely , " wrote berlin 's daily der tagesspiegel on tuesday .
" but severity alone wo n't convince north korea 's dictator to change his mind .
the international community and the bush government , which has been indecisive on this issue , will have to offer rewards in return for a verifiable abandonment of the nuclear option . and the hamburger abendblatt commented in its tuesday edition : " strongly worded declarations and even threats of sanctions wo n't deter a country like north korea , which is already largely isolated as the poorhouse of southeast asia .
conversely , offers of rewards , in which north korea has nothing to lose and everything to gain , presuppose that ruling elites are capable of a certain degree of rationalism .
what remains is the unsettling prospect that north korea 's ' dr. strangelove ' now only lacks mid-range missiles .
a danger is growing , whose implications for world peace can not at present be predicted : that there will be a ratcheting up of the arms race in southeast asia . " dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu : north korean nuclear test is " unacceptable " the european union has strongly condemned north korea 's nuclear test as " unacceptable . "
germany , the united states and china have slammed the test as a provocation and demanded a tough united nations response .
-lrb- 09.10.2006 -rrb- korea reminds germans of cold war divide during his visit to the demilitarized zone in south korea , german foreign minister steinmeier was reminded of the painful divide his own country ended just 15 years ago .

german newspapers on tuesday speculated about what the international community should do next . " seldom before has there been such consensus among north korea 's asian-pacific neighbors and pyongyang 's strategic rivals : this state represents a massive threat to regional stability , " wrote the süddeutsche zeitung from munich on tuesday .
" japan perceives itself to be in the greatest military danger , and as a result tokyo will rethink its approach to national security .
one possible consequence is the development of nuclear weapons throughout the entire region .
that can only be prevented if the united states concentrates its arsenal of deterrence on the pacific and offers both south korea and japan explicit assurances of its support in case of a nuclear conflict . " the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung also focused on the us ' possible response to the crisis .
" china and above all the united states have it in their power to bring pyongyang back to the bargaining table , " the paper wrote .
" the north korean regime has often let it be known via its news service kcna that it is primarily interested in direct negotiations with washington .
but the prospects are now worse than they were in 1994 .
north korea has proclaimed itself to be a nuclear power , and it 's going to take some true initiative to keep pyongyang , where the regime likely sees this as a struggle for survival , from engaging in further escalations . " " only a harsh reaction , which will unfortunately also affect north korea 's already suffering population will send the necessary signals to other nuclear aspirants and prevent the nuclear non-proliferation treaty from collapsing entirely , " wrote berlin 's daily der tagesspiegel on tuesday .
" but severity alone wo n't convince north korea 's dictator to change his mind .
the international community and the bush government , which has been indecisive on this issue , will have to offer rewards in return for a verifiable abandonment of the nuclear option . and the hamburger abendblatt commented in its tuesday edition : " strongly worded declarations and even threats of sanctions wo n't deter a country like north korea , which is already largely isolated as the poorhouse of southeast asia .
conversely , offers of rewards , in which north korea has nothing to lose and everything to gain , presuppose that ruling elites are capable of a certain degree of rationalism .
what remains is the unsettling prospect that north korea 's ' dr. strangelove ' now only lacks mid-range missiles .
a danger is growing , whose implications for world peace can not at present be predicted : that there will be a ratcheting up of the arms race in southeast asia . " dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu : north korean nuclear test is " unacceptable " the european union has strongly condemned north korea 's nuclear test as " unacceptable . "
germany , the united states and china have slammed the test as a provocation and demanded a tough united nations response .
-lrb- 09.10.2006 -rrb- korea reminds germans of cold war divide during his visit to the demilitarized zone in south korea , german foreign minister steinmeier was reminded of the painful divide his own country ended just 15 years ago .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian gas money will soon be flowing toward gelsenkirchen experts estimate that the agreement will give schalke 60-66 million euros by the time it expires .

a dispute over security precautions caused major delays for what some see as a symbol of german-american friendship . a sharp-toothed iron fence atop massive concrete slabs currently separates america 's representatives from the german people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not exactly welcoming : the current us embassy just off berlin 's unter den linden boulevard , the us embassy sits in a street that 's blocked off for traffic .
german police behind rows of concrete cylinders prevent unwanted visitors from getting too close .
" no photography " signs attached to the fence add to the inhospitable atmosphere . all that will change to a certain extent in the spring of 2008 , when american diplomats are expected to move three blocks down the street to the new embassy on pariser platz .
home to berlin 's landmark brandenburg gate , which became the symbol of reunification , the square draws hordes of tourists , becomes party central on new year 's eve and serves as the backdrop for major celebrations such as the 2006 soccer world cup , when millions of fans gathered to cheer their teams . making a statement it 's hardly a dream location when it comes to security : the square can not be completely cordoned off like the nearby street where the british embassy has set up quarters .
but soon after german reunification , us officials decided to make a statement by building their embassy on the very spot where us diplomats had once worked before world war ii . " the decision of the united states to return to this historic site symbolizes america 's support for a unified germany , " former ambassador daniel r. coats said at a groundbreaking ceremony in 2004 . bildunterschrift : the 180-million-euro -lrb- $ 228-million -rrb- embassy , sitting on the right corner , was designed by santa monica-based moore ruble yudell architects , who count the tacoma campus of the university of washington , a courthouse in fresno , an office complex in beijing and several churches among previous projects skylights and security zones almost exactly two years later , the building shell has been completed .
still missing are a glass conference room on top of the roof that is meant to illuminate berlin 's sky at night as well as a " green band of trees , gardens and walkways " along the street fronts .
already in place , however , are dozens of poles made of steel and concrete that are meant to guard the building against terrorist attacks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would neuschwanstein castle have been a better place for the new embassy ?
security concerns were also the main reason for a decade-long delay of the project .
following the 1998 bombings at us embassies in kenya and tanzania , us legislators called for more protection at new diplomatic missions .
confronted with the demands , berlin officials were especially irked by a 30-meter -lrb- 100-feet -rrb- security zone between the building and the street that would have required a complete redesign of the surrounding historic streets . the dispute reached comical proportions when berlin 's mayor reportedly said that americans should instead build a fast-food restaurant at the site , and the us ambassador jokingly suggested moving the embassy to bavaria 's world-famous -lrb- and certainly secure -rrb- neuschwanstein castle , where americans had always been welcome . a very good compromise ? both sides finally agreed to compromise by reducing the safety zone to 25 meters and shifting streets a little . " the overall design has been enriched by extensive critique and collaboration with the urban planning authorities of berlin and a sensitivity to the surrounding historic quarters , " reads a text on the embassy 's web site .
embassy officials were not available for comment monday as the embassy was closed for columbus day . bildunterschrift : the embassy 's shell on the left closes the gap along pariser platz .
only a bank 's building separates it from berlin 's famous brandenburg gate , seen on the right meanwhile , petra rohland , a spokeswoman for berlin 's urban planning department , looked on the bright side . " we found a very good compromise , " she said , adding that it addressed the american security concerns as well as berlin 's desire to keep the surroundings of pariser platz open to the public . closing the gap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these poles are still waiting for their historic coats " it closes the gap , " rohland said , referring to the last bit of wasteland along the square that has now disappeared .
" as good hosts , we 'll now have the embassy in this truly beautiful place . " besides , some of the security precautions will actually return some history to the square , rohland said : the poles will look like ones used as roadblocks in previous times . incidentally , the american need for security will also bring some increased security to the french embassy , which sits diagonally across on the other side of the square .
for reasons of symmetry , preservationists required the same poles to be installed there as well . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us ambassador to berlin says europeans are soft on terror in marking the fifth anniversary of the september 11 attacks , us ambassador to germany , william timken , voiced an unpopular hardline view on europe 's battle against islamic terrorism .

if the club wins titles or regularly plays in the champions league it could see up to 100 million euros filling its tills .
victoria , which has supported schalke with 7.5 million euros per year , will remain a sponsor until 2012 . a " new dimension " the deal is the largest sponsoring agreement ever in german first division , eclipsing the 20 million euros annually that bayern munich receive from deutsche telekom and giving schalke fans a new reason to buy replica jerseys with the gazprom logo .

" there have been no reports about precisely who brought the two sides together , but many observers have noted that former german chancellor gerhard schröder works as an advisor for gazprom .

a dispute over security precautions caused major delays for what some see as a symbol of german-american friendship . a sharp-toothed iron fence atop massive concrete slabs currently separates america 's representatives from the german people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not exactly welcoming : the current us embassy just off berlin 's unter den linden boulevard , the us embassy sits in a street that 's blocked off for traffic .
german police behind rows of concrete cylinders prevent unwanted visitors from getting too close .
" no photography " signs attached to the fence add to the inhospitable atmosphere . all that will change to a certain extent in the spring of 2008 , when american diplomats are expected to move three blocks down the street to the new embassy on pariser platz .
home to berlin 's landmark brandenburg gate , which became the symbol of reunification , the square draws hordes of tourists , becomes party central on new year 's eve and serves as the backdrop for major celebrations such as the 2006 soccer world cup , when millions of fans gathered to cheer their teams . making a statement it 's hardly a dream location when it comes to security : the square can not be completely cordoned off like the nearby street where the british embassy has set up quarters .
but soon after german reunification , us officials decided to make a statement by building their embassy on the very spot where us diplomats had once worked before world war ii . " the decision of the united states to return to this historic site symbolizes america 's support for a unified germany , " former ambassador daniel r. coats said at a groundbreaking ceremony in 2004 . bildunterschrift : the 180-million-euro -lrb- $ 228-million -rrb- embassy , sitting on the right corner , was designed by santa monica-based moore ruble yudell architects , who count the tacoma campus of the university of washington , a courthouse in fresno , an office complex in beijing and several churches among previous projects skylights and security zones almost exactly two years later , the building shell has been completed .
still missing are a glass conference room on top of the roof that is meant to illuminate berlin 's sky at night as well as a " green band of trees , gardens and walkways " along the street fronts .
already in place , however , are dozens of poles made of steel and concrete that are meant to guard the building against terrorist attacks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would neuschwanstein castle have been a better place for the new embassy ?
security concerns were also the main reason for a decade-long delay of the project .
following the 1998 bombings at us embassies in kenya and tanzania , us legislators called for more protection at new diplomatic missions .
confronted with the demands , berlin officials were especially irked by a 30-meter -lrb- 100-feet -rrb- security zone between the building and the street that would have required a complete redesign of the surrounding historic streets . the dispute reached comical proportions when berlin 's mayor reportedly said that americans should instead build a fast-food restaurant at the site , and the us ambassador jokingly suggested moving the embassy to bavaria 's world-famous -lrb- and certainly secure -rrb- neuschwanstein castle , where americans had always been welcome . a very good compromise ? both sides finally agreed to compromise by reducing the safety zone to 25 meters and shifting streets a little . " the overall design has been enriched by extensive critique and collaboration with the urban planning authorities of berlin and a sensitivity to the surrounding historic quarters , " reads a text on the embassy 's web site .
embassy officials were not available for comment monday as the embassy was closed for columbus day . bildunterschrift : the embassy 's shell on the left closes the gap along pariser platz .
only a bank 's building separates it from berlin 's famous brandenburg gate , seen on the right meanwhile , petra rohland , a spokeswoman for berlin 's urban planning department , looked on the bright side . " we found a very good compromise , " she said , adding that it addressed the american security concerns as well as berlin 's desire to keep the surroundings of pariser platz open to the public . closing the gap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these poles are still waiting for their historic coats " it closes the gap , " rohland said , referring to the last bit of wasteland along the square that has now disappeared .
" as good hosts , we 'll now have the embassy in this truly beautiful place . " besides , some of the security precautions will actually return some history to the square , rohland said : the poles will look like ones used as roadblocks in previous times . incidentally , the american need for security will also bring some increased security to the french embassy , which sits diagonally across on the other side of the square .
for reasons of symmetry , preservationists required the same poles to be installed there as well . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us ambassador to berlin says europeans are soft on terror in marking the fifth anniversary of the september 11 attacks , us ambassador to germany , william timken , voiced an unpopular hardline view on europe 's battle against islamic terrorism .

speculations are growing over how the south korean foreign minister will take on the tougher issues . andreas zumach is a geneva-based un correspondent for the german newspaper die tageszeitung . what has ban 's policy been as south korea foreign minster so far on north korea ? the problem is that there is no clear profile on his policy except that he is an efficient manager and mediator but he has never shown any political convictions , other than that he has been very close to whatever the us foreign policy was for the last 25 years . some people say that he is the architect of the so-called sunshine policy with north korea do you think he will adopt a harder line as requested by the us ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zumach thinks ban will follow the line of the us and china i am concerned that under the impact of yesterday 's nuclear test by north koreans and because of the pressure from the bush administration , he will adopt a harder line .
we could see already for the last year that the south korean government has not continued the original approach on the sunshine policy as it has originally adopted it because the bush administration clearly did n't support that . what affect will ban 's nomination have on the current crisis ? in the best case , he might be able to get the six nation talks going again and he might be able to move the bush administration to do the one thing that would be absolutely necessary to come to a diplomatic solution , which is to give pyongyang a nuclear non-aggression guarantee - something the clinton administration did back in 1994 and the bush administration renounced the guarantee in 2003 .
that 's when the problems began . do you think ban 's nomination might have provoked north korea nuclear test ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korean leader kim jong il has provoked the international community by testing nukes there are no indications that the timing of the nuclear test has anything to do with the election of ban ki moon , simply because the north korean government could not have guessed the development of the selection process for the secretary general at the un so for the timing i think it is rather a coincidence . what has made ban so popular with the un security council members ? it has been the smoothest selection process , compared to the former seven secretaries .
this seems to be good for the un , but i disagree , because the main reason for this process has been that ban ki moon is the smallest common denominator between two most powerful members of the security council - the united states and china .
i think this is not enough for the other 190 member countries of the un . i am concerned that he will continue to conduct his policies very closely along the us foreign policy on the one hand , and on the other hand he will avoid anything to criticize china and he will not highlight the importance of human rights as strongly as kofi annan has done , he will most certainly not highlight the important role of non-government organizations for international politics and for the un as kofi annan has done .
i think he will continue to conduct his new job in the way that he has conducted all the other jobs , which is to avoid conflict . so you do n't think he will be able to set his own stamp ? bildunterschrift : a different un with ban ?
only time will tell i am concerned that this will not happen .
i am always prepared to be positively surprised , but so-far the 35 years of his political and diplomatic career do n't give us any indications that besides being a conduit of diplomacy and a strong and hard worker , he has not developed his own political positions , let alone visions . if you look at the necessity to reform the united nations , we still have this broad political reform agenda that kofi annan put on the political agenda last year which still need to be decided on and implemented .
here we would need a secretary general that followed the same line that kofi annan put forward , but i am concerned that ban ki moon will only be concerned with those management reforms that washington is pushing for . do you think he has been nominated because of his experience on the korean peninsula ? ban ki moon has been nominated because , firstly , china prevented the original washington intention to have an eastern european by threatening a hard veto against any non-asian candidate .
secondly , because washington and beijing agreed that it should not be an indian in this position and then if you look at the field of candidates from asia that were left , ban ki moon seems to be the one that fits the interests of washington and beijing most . dw staff -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu : north korean nuclear test is " unacceptable " the european union has strongly condemned north korea 's nuclear test as " unacceptable .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 10.10.2006 " ban has not developed visions " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ban ki moon is known as a hard worker , but not as a hardliner ban ki moon has been nominated to succeed kofi annan as secretary general of the united nations .
speculations are growing over how the south korean foreign minister will take on the tougher issues . andreas zumach is a geneva-based un correspondent for the german newspaper die tageszeitung . what has ban 's policy been as south korea foreign minster so far on north korea ? the problem is that there is no clear profile on his policy except that he is an efficient manager and mediator but he has never shown any political convictions , other than that he has been very close to whatever the us foreign policy was for the last 25 years . some people say that he is the architect of the so-called sunshine policy with north korea do you think he will adopt a harder line as requested by the us ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zumach thinks ban will follow the line of the us and china i am concerned that under the impact of yesterday 's nuclear test by north koreans and because of the pressure from the bush administration , he will adopt a harder line .
we could see already for the last year that the south korean government has not continued the original approach on the sunshine policy as it has originally adopted it because the bush administration clearly did n't support that . what affect will ban 's nomination have on the current crisis ? in the best case , he might be able to get the six nation talks going again and he might be able to move the bush administration to do the one thing that would be absolutely necessary to come to a diplomatic solution , which is to give pyongyang a nuclear non-aggression guarantee - something the clinton administration did back in 1994 and the bush administration renounced the guarantee in 2003 .
that 's when the problems began . do you think ban 's nomination might have provoked north korea nuclear test ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korean leader kim jong il has provoked the international community by testing nukes there are no indications that the timing of the nuclear test has anything to do with the election of ban ki moon , simply because the north korean government could not have guessed the development of the selection process for the secretary general at the un so for the timing i think it is rather a coincidence . what has made ban so popular with the un security council members ? it has been the smoothest selection process , compared to the former seven secretaries .
this seems to be good for the un , but i disagree , because the main reason for this process has been that ban ki moon is the smallest common denominator between two most powerful members of the security council - the united states and china .
i think this is not enough for the other 190 member countries of the un . i am concerned that he will continue to conduct his policies very closely along the us foreign policy on the one hand , and on the other hand he will avoid anything to criticize china and he will not highlight the importance of human rights as strongly as kofi annan has done , he will most certainly not highlight the important role of non-government organizations for international politics and for the un as kofi annan has done .
i think he will continue to conduct his new job in the way that he has conducted all the other jobs , which is to avoid conflict . so you do n't think he will be able to set his own stamp ? bildunterschrift : a different un with ban ?
only time will tell i am concerned that this will not happen .
i am always prepared to be positively surprised , but so-far the 35 years of his political and diplomatic career do n't give us any indications that besides being a conduit of diplomacy and a strong and hard worker , he has not developed his own political positions , let alone visions . if you look at the necessity to reform the united nations , we still have this broad political reform agenda that kofi annan put on the political agenda last year which still need to be decided on and implemented .
here we would need a secretary general that followed the same line that kofi annan put forward , but i am concerned that ban ki moon will only be concerned with those management reforms that washington is pushing for . do you think he has been nominated because of his experience on the korean peninsula ? ban ki moon has been nominated because , firstly , china prevented the original washington intention to have an eastern european by threatening a hard veto against any non-asian candidate .
secondly , because washington and beijing agreed that it should not be an indian in this position and then if you look at the field of candidates from asia that were left , ban ki moon seems to be the one that fits the interests of washington and beijing most . dw staff -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu : north korean nuclear test is " unacceptable " the european union has strongly condemned north korea 's nuclear test as " unacceptable .

he said that sanctions were officially no longer on the table since germany 's deficit for 2006 should fall well within the 3 percent euro zone limit . the announcement ends germany 's embarrassing five-year struggle with the spending guideline .
throughout the 1990s , as a precondition for the adoption of a single european currency , germany insisted on a cap for state debt to ensure fiscal discipline among member states .
but due to soaring government costs and dwindling state revenues , germany missed that mark in 2002 and has failed to meet it ever since . that will change this year - thanks in part to increased consumer spending within germany and cutbacks in the country 's generous social welfare programs .
almunia 's announcement confirms an unofficial agreement among eu finance members in early september to drop disciplinary proceedings against berlin . almunia also said that greece and france - two other eu " debt sinners " - should also reduce their deficits below 3 percent in 2006 , and that italy was on course to follow suit in 2007 . germany 's improved budget figures come amidst what 's being seen as a slight recovery in the german economy .
but critics warn that hikes in value-added tax planned for 2007 could dampen consumer spending and stifle the incipient economic comeback . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de minister says germany off the hook in eu budget deficit affair german finance minister peer steinbrück has said that germany no longer has to fear sanctions for violating the eu 's stability and growth pact .

he said that sanctions were officially no longer on the table since germany 's deficit for 2006 should fall well within the 3 percent euro zone limit . the announcement ends germany 's embarrassing five-year struggle with the spending guideline .
throughout the 1990s , as a precondition for the adoption of a single european currency , germany insisted on a cap for state debt to ensure fiscal discipline among member states .
but due to soaring government costs and dwindling state revenues , germany missed that mark in 2002 and has failed to meet it ever since . that will change this year - thanks in part to increased consumer spending within germany and cutbacks in the country 's generous social welfare programs .
almunia 's announcement confirms an unofficial agreement among eu finance members in early september to drop disciplinary proceedings against berlin . almunia also said that greece and france - two other eu " debt sinners " - should also reduce their deficits below 3 percent in 2006 , and that italy was on course to follow suit in 2007 . germany 's improved budget figures come amidst what 's being seen as a slight recovery in the german economy .
but critics warn that hikes in value-added tax planned for 2007 could dampen consumer spending and stifle the incipient economic comeback . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de minister says germany off the hook in eu budget deficit affair german finance minister peer steinbrück has said that germany no longer has to fear sanctions for violating the eu 's stability and growth pact .
-lrb- 09.09.2006 -rrb- minister : germany to meet eu deficit rules in 2007 for the first time in four years , germany 's annual budget is set keep the public deficit under the three percent limit set by the european union 's growth and stability pact , finance minister peer steinbrück said tuesday .

instead of raising taxes , however , it should reduce spending , says dw 's karl zawadzky .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.10.2006 press review : a massive threat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world must now decide how to deal with north korean leader kim jong il the announcement by north korea on monday that it had successfully tested a nuclear weapon caused alarm around the world .
german newspapers on tuesday speculated about what the international community should do next . " seldom before has there been such consensus among north korea 's asian-pacific neighbors and pyongyang 's strategic rivals : this state represents a massive threat to regional stability , " wrote the süddeutsche zeitung from munich on tuesday .
" japan perceives itself to be in the greatest military danger , and as a result tokyo will rethink its approach to national security .
one possible consequence is the development of nuclear weapons throughout the entire region .
that can only be prevented if the united states concentrates its arsenal of deterrence on the pacific and offers both south korea and japan explicit assurances of its support in case of a nuclear conflict . " the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung also focused on the us ' possible response to the crisis .
" china and above all the united states have it in their power to bring pyongyang back to the bargaining table , " the paper wrote .
" the north korean regime has often let it be known via its news service kcna that it is primarily interested in direct negotiations with washington .
but the prospects are now worse than they were in 1994 .
north korea has proclaimed itself to be a nuclear power , and it 's going to take some true initiative to keep pyongyang , where the regime likely sees this as a struggle for survival , from engaging in further escalations . " " only a harsh reaction , which will unfortunately also affect north korea 's already suffering population will send the necessary signals to other nuclear aspirants and prevent the nuclear non-proliferation treaty from collapsing entirely , " wrote berlin 's daily der tagesspiegel on tuesday .
" but severity alone wo n't convince north korea 's dictator to change his mind .
the international community and the bush government , which has been indecisive on this issue , will have to offer rewards in return for a verifiable abandonment of the nuclear option . and the hamburger abendblatt commented in its tuesday edition : " strongly worded declarations and even threats of sanctions wo n't deter a country like north korea , which is already largely isolated as the poorhouse of southeast asia .
conversely , offers of rewards , in which north korea has nothing to lose and everything to gain , presuppose that ruling elites are capable of a certain degree of rationalism .
what remains is the unsettling prospect that north korea 's ' dr. strangelove ' now only lacks mid-range missiles .
a danger is growing , whose implications for world peace can not at present be predicted : that there will be a ratcheting up of the arms race in southeast asia . " dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu : north korean nuclear test is " unacceptable " the european union has strongly condemned north korea 's nuclear test as " unacceptable . "

a dispute over security precautions caused major delays for what some see as a symbol of german-american friendship . a sharp-toothed iron fence atop massive concrete slabs currently separates america 's representatives from the german people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not exactly welcoming : the current us embassy just off berlin 's unter den linden boulevard , the us embassy sits in a street that 's blocked off for traffic .
german police behind rows of concrete cylinders prevent unwanted visitors from getting too close .
" no photography " signs attached to the fence add to the inhospitable atmosphere . all that will change to a certain extent in the spring of 2008 , when american diplomats are expected to move three blocks down the street to the new embassy on pariser platz .
home to berlin 's landmark brandenburg gate , which became the symbol of reunification , the square draws hordes of tourists , becomes party central on new year 's eve and serves as the backdrop for major celebrations such as the 2006 soccer world cup , when millions of fans gathered to cheer their teams . making a statement it 's hardly a dream location when it comes to security : the square can not be completely cordoned off like the nearby street where the british embassy has set up quarters .
but soon after german reunification , us officials decided to make a statement by building their embassy on the very spot where us diplomats had once worked before world war ii . " the decision of the united states to return to this historic site symbolizes america 's support for a unified germany , " former ambassador daniel r. coats said at a groundbreaking ceremony in 2004 . bildunterschrift : the 180-million-euro -lrb- $ 228-million -rrb- embassy , sitting on the right corner , was designed by santa monica-based moore ruble yudell architects , who count the tacoma campus of the university of washington , a courthouse in fresno , an office complex in beijing and several churches among previous projects skylights and security zones almost exactly two years later , the building shell has been completed .

already in place , however , are dozens of poles made of steel and concrete that are meant to guard the building against terrorist attacks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would neuschwanstein castle have been a better place for the new embassy ?
security concerns were also the main reason for a decade-long delay of the project .
following the 1998 bombings at us embassies in kenya and tanzania , us legislators called for more protection at new diplomatic missions .
confronted with the demands , berlin officials were especially irked by a 30-meter -lrb- 100-feet -rrb- security zone between the building and the street that would have required a complete redesign of the surrounding historic streets . the dispute reached comical proportions when berlin 's mayor reportedly said that americans should instead build a fast-food restaurant at the site , and the us ambassador jokingly suggested moving the embassy to bavaria 's world-famous -lrb- and certainly secure -rrb- neuschwanstein castle , where americans had always been welcome . a very good compromise ? both sides finally agreed to compromise by reducing the safety zone to 25 meters and shifting streets a little . " the overall design has been enriched by extensive critique and collaboration with the urban planning authorities of berlin and a sensitivity to the surrounding historic quarters , " reads a text on the embassy 's web site .
embassy officials were not available for comment monday as the embassy was closed for columbus day . bildunterschrift : the embassy 's shell on the left closes the gap along pariser platz .
only a bank 's building separates it from berlin 's famous brandenburg gate , seen on the right meanwhile , petra rohland , a spokeswoman for berlin 's urban planning department , looked on the bright side .

" as good hosts , we 'll now have the embassy in this truly beautiful place . " besides , some of the security precautions will actually return some history to the square , rohland said : the poles will look like ones used as roadblocks in previous times . incidentally , the american need for security will also bring some increased security to the french embassy , which sits diagonally across on the other side of the square .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian gas money will soon be flowing toward gelsenkirchen experts estimate that the agreement will give schalke 60-66 million euros by the time it expires .
if the club wins titles or regularly plays in the champions league it could see up to 100 million euros filling its tills .
victoria , which has supported schalke with 7.5 million euros per year , will remain a sponsor until 2012 . a " new dimension " the deal is the largest sponsoring agreement ever in german first division , eclipsing the 20 million euros annually that bayern munich receive from deutsche telekom and giving schalke fans a new reason to buy replica jerseys with the gazprom logo .
players will don their new tops for the first time for the jan .

" we 're advancing into a new dimension , " said clemens tönnies , chairman of schalke 's board of directors , after the deal was made public . club maintains autonomy the deal was evidence of " the respect that our club earned especially on the international stage in past years , " schalke board member gerhard rehberg commented .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder is known to be a dortmund fan he stressed that schalke would remain independent and that gazprom would have " no influence whatsoever on the operative business or sports decisions . " there have been no reports about precisely who brought the two sides together , but many observers have noted that former german chancellor gerhard schröder works as an advisor for gazprom .
it would be ironic if schröder did have a hand in the deal , since he was always known as a fan of dortmund , schalke 's archrivals . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundesliga stays close , top teams remain disappointed a draw was enough for berlin to take over on top of the table sunday , but they should n't feel too comfortable since goal difference is the only thing separating the german league 's top five teams .

memories of disruptions of russian gas supplies to europe still rankled with the german chancellor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german-russian gas pipeline is under construction in the baltic sea merkel , however , said she trusted russia as a reliable business partner . " it is important for me to have realized that we are acting on the same business principles as the russian government in this cooperation , " merkel said . " we are currently working out a joint charter in which these principles will be enshrined .
as a matter of fact , i 'm not reluctant either to accept russia 's increasing importance in the business world which is being reflected in the fact that russian companies are buying themselves into european firms . " russia to double gas exports to germany putin said russia planned to use a gas pipeline currently being built under the baltic sea between russia and germany to ship an additional 50 to 55 million cubic meters of gas to germany annually . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's new deal with putin is likely to anger the polish government russia presently supplies germany with 40 million cubic meters of gas a year - about a third of german needs .
the 1,200-kilometer -lrb- 745-mile -rrb- baltic gas pipeline is due to start operating in 2010 . " this would mean that germany is not only a consumer of natural gas but would make it a big european distributor of russian gas , " putin said .
" this will transform the energy face of germany and strengthen its role in european energy matters . " putin 's words are likely to further anger the polish government which has strongly opposed the baltic sea gas pipeline .
ties between germany and poland have been frosty over the past year due to this and a number of issues relating to world war ii . the north korean threat the series of routine meetings of german and russian leaders is known as the " petersburg dialogues , " named after the russian city where the first meeting was held in 2001 . both leaders denounced the explosion of a nuclear device by north korea as an irresponsible act . they called on the international community to keep a wary eye on developments there .
the russian president , however , did not comment on whether his government would support sanctions again north korea . diverse areas of cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sponsoring contract between gazprom and schalke 04 was signed in dresden on the sidelines of their meeting the two leaders oversaw the signing of a raft of deals aimed at strengthening the economic , scientific and cultural cooperation between the two countries . russia 's oil wealth has made companies from the country potent investors also in the german economy . somewhat unusual evidence of that was a 100 million euro -lrb- $ 126.6 million -rrb- soccer sponsorship deal between the german bundesliga club schalke 04 and russian oil giant gazprom that was also signed on tuesday . a new german-russian joint venture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus is diversifying its production in a new deal with russian aircraft manufacturer irkut in another agreement signed on tuesday , the european aeronautics defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- with its aircraft arm airbus and its dresden freighter conversion subsidiary elbe flugzeugwerke -lrb- efw -rrb- agreed with russian aircraft manufacturer irkut to form a joint venture to convert airbus a320 passenger planes into freighters . under the terms of the agreement , airbus , efw and irkut will perform the conversion of single-aisle passenger aircraft into cargo aircraft and market and sell conversion services .
eads and irkut will set up an equal joint venture to this end , with production scheduled to start in 2010 . eads said in a statement that , in the initial phase , some 30 a320 and a321 aircraft would be converted per year , with both russian and international freight operators seen as potential customers . dw staff / afp , dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " not everything can revolve around gas " dw-radio spoke with russia expert alexander rahr about what to expect from talks between russian president vladimir putin and german chancellor angela merkel on tuesday .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian gas money will soon be flowing toward gelsenkirchen experts estimate that the agreement will give schalke 60-66 million euros by the time it expires .
if the club wins titles or regularly plays in the champions league it could see up to 100 million euros filling its tills .
victoria , which has supported schalke with 7.5 million euros per year , will remain a sponsor until 2012 . a " new dimension " the deal is the largest sponsoring agreement ever in german first division , eclipsing the 20 million euros annually that bayern munich receive from deutsche telekom and giving schalke fans a new reason to buy replica jerseys with the gazprom logo .
players will don their new tops for the first time for the jan .

" we 're advancing into a new dimension , " said clemens tönnies , chairman of schalke 's board of directors , after the deal was made public . club maintains autonomy the deal was evidence of " the respect that our club earned especially on the international stage in past years , " schalke board member gerhard rehberg commented .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder is known to be a dortmund fan he stressed that schalke would remain independent and that gazprom would have " no influence whatsoever on the operative business or sports decisions . " there have been no reports about precisely who brought the two sides together , but many observers have noted that former german chancellor gerhard schröder works as an advisor for gazprom .
it would be ironic if schröder did have a hand in the deal , since he was always known as a fan of dortmund , schalke 's archrivals . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundesliga stays close , top teams remain disappointed a draw was enough for berlin to take over on top of the table sunday , but they should n't feel too comfortable since goal difference is the only thing separating the german league 's top five teams .

a dispute over security precautions caused major delays for what some see as a symbol of german-american friendship . a sharp-toothed iron fence atop massive concrete slabs currently separates america 's representatives from the german people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not exactly welcoming : the current us embassy just off berlin 's unter den linden boulevard , the us embassy sits in a street that 's blocked off for traffic .
german police behind rows of concrete cylinders prevent unwanted visitors from getting too close .
" no photography " signs attached to the fence add to the inhospitable atmosphere . all that will change to a certain extent in the spring of 2008 , when american diplomats are expected to move three blocks down the street to the new embassy on pariser platz .
home to berlin 's landmark brandenburg gate , which became the symbol of reunification , the square draws hordes of tourists , becomes party central on new year 's eve and serves as the backdrop for major celebrations such as the 2006 soccer world cup , when millions of fans gathered to cheer their teams . making a statement it 's hardly a dream location when it comes to security : the square can not be completely cordoned off like the nearby street where the british embassy has set up quarters .
but soon after german reunification , us officials decided to make a statement by building their embassy on the very spot where us diplomats had once worked before world war ii . " the decision of the united states to return to this historic site symbolizes america 's support for a unified germany , " former ambassador daniel r. coats said at a groundbreaking ceremony in 2004 . bildunterschrift : the 180-million-euro -lrb- $ 228-million -rrb- embassy , sitting on the right corner , was designed by santa monica-based moore ruble yudell architects , who count the tacoma campus of the university of washington , a courthouse in fresno , an office complex in beijing and several churches among previous projects skylights and security zones almost exactly two years later , the building shell has been completed .
still missing are a glass conference room on top of the roof that is meant to illuminate berlin 's sky at night as well as a " green band of trees , gardens and walkways " along the street fronts .
already in place , however , are dozens of poles made of steel and concrete that are meant to guard the building against terrorist attacks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would neuschwanstein castle have been a better place for the new embassy ?
security concerns were also the main reason for a decade-long delay of the project .
following the 1998 bombings at us embassies in kenya and tanzania , us legislators called for more protection at new diplomatic missions .
confronted with the demands , berlin officials were especially irked by a 30-meter -lrb- 100-feet -rrb- security zone between the building and the street that would have required a complete redesign of the surrounding historic streets . the dispute reached comical proportions when berlin 's mayor reportedly said that americans should instead build a fast-food restaurant at the site , and the us ambassador jokingly suggested moving the embassy to bavaria 's world-famous -lrb- and certainly secure -rrb- neuschwanstein castle , where americans had always been welcome . a very good compromise ? both sides finally agreed to compromise by reducing the safety zone to 25 meters and shifting streets a little . " the overall design has been enriched by extensive critique and collaboration with the urban planning authorities of berlin and a sensitivity to the surrounding historic quarters , " reads a text on the embassy 's web site .
embassy officials were not available for comment monday as the embassy was closed for columbus day . bildunterschrift : the embassy 's shell on the left closes the gap along pariser platz .
only a bank 's building separates it from berlin 's famous brandenburg gate , seen on the right meanwhile , petra rohland , a spokeswoman for berlin 's urban planning department , looked on the bright side . " we found a very good compromise , " she said , adding that it addressed the american security concerns as well as berlin 's desire to keep the surroundings of pariser platz open to the public . closing the gap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these poles are still waiting for their historic coats " it closes the gap , " rohland said , referring to the last bit of wasteland along the square that has now disappeared .
" as good hosts , we 'll now have the embassy in this truly beautiful place . " besides , some of the security precautions will actually return some history to the square , rohland said : the poles will look like ones used as roadblocks in previous times . incidentally , the american need for security will also bring some increased security to the french embassy , which sits diagonally across on the other side of the square .
for reasons of symmetry , preservationists required the same poles to be installed there as well . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us ambassador to berlin says europeans are soft on terror in marking the fifth anniversary of the september 11 attacks , us ambassador to germany , william timken , voiced an unpopular hardline view on europe 's battle against islamic terrorism .

confronted with the demands , berlin officials were especially irked by a 30-meter -lrb- 100-feet -rrb- security zone between the building and the street that would have required a complete redesign of the surrounding historic streets . the dispute reached comical proportions when berlin 's mayor reportedly said that americans should instead build a fast-food restaurant at the site , and the us ambassador jokingly suggested moving the embassy to bavaria 's world-famous -lrb- and certainly secure -rrb- neuschwanstein castle , where americans had always been welcome . a very good compromise ? both sides finally agreed to compromise by reducing the safety zone to 25 meters and shifting streets a little .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 10.10.2006 gazprom to pump millions into schalke großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's managers were all smiles tuesday german soccer team schalke 04 stand to gain as much as 100 million euros -lrb- $ 127 million -rrb- over the course of five-and-a-half years from an association with gazprom , the world 's largest natural gas company . gazprom and schalke confirmed the deal at a press conference in dresden on tuesday - the same day that russian president vladimir putin arrived for an official state visit in the eastern german city . gazprom , which accounts for almost a quarter of the world 's gas production and had some 64 billion euros -lrb- $ 81 billion -rrb- in sales in 2004 , will take over the main sponsorship of the club from victoria insurance from january until june 30 , 2012 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian gas money will soon be flowing toward gelsenkirchen experts estimate that the agreement will give schalke 60-66 million euros by the time it expires .
if the club wins titles or regularly plays in the champions league it could see up to 100 million euros filling its tills .
victoria , which has supported schalke with 7.5 million euros per year , will remain a sponsor until 2012 . a " new dimension " the deal is the largest sponsoring agreement ever in german first division , eclipsing the 20 million euros annually that bayern munich receive from deutsche telekom and giving schalke fans a new reason to buy replica jerseys with the gazprom logo .
players will don their new tops for the first time for the jan .
28 , 2007 match against eintracht frankfurt . a huge infusion of cash is welcome news for the gelsenkirchen-based club whose estimated debts total as much as 120 million euros , and whose on-field fortunes have been up and down of late . " we 're advancing into a new dimension , " said clemens tönnies , chairman of schalke 's board of directors , after the deal was made public . club maintains autonomy the deal was evidence of " the respect that our club earned especially on the international stage in past years , " schalke board member gerhard rehberg commented .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder is known to be a dortmund fan he stressed that schalke would remain independent and that gazprom would have " no influence whatsoever on the operative business or sports decisions . " there have been no reports about precisely who brought the two sides together , but many observers have noted that former german chancellor gerhard schröder works as an advisor for gazprom .
it would be ironic if schröder did have a hand in the deal , since he was always known as a fan of dortmund , schalke 's archrivals . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundesliga stays close , top teams remain disappointed a draw was enough for berlin to take over on top of the table sunday , but they should n't feel too comfortable since goal difference is the only thing separating the german league 's top five teams .
-lrb- 02.10.2006 -rrb- germany faces eu probe over controversial gas pipeline loan germany will have to answer to the eu commission about a massive loan guarantee it offered russian energy giant gazprom to build a controversial 5 billion euro gas pipeline linking russia and germany .

" we are currently working out a joint charter in which these principles will be enshrined .
as a matter of fact , i 'm not reluctant either to accept russia 's increasing importance in the business world which is being reflected in the fact that russian companies are buying themselves into european firms . " russia to double gas exports to germany putin said russia planned to use a gas pipeline currently being built under the baltic sea between russia and germany to ship an additional 50 to 55 million cubic meters of gas to germany annually . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's new deal with putin is likely to anger the polish government russia presently supplies germany with 40 million cubic meters of gas a year - about a third of german needs .

" this will transform the energy face of germany and strengthen its role in european energy matters . " putin 's words are likely to further anger the polish government which has strongly opposed the baltic sea gas pipeline .

german newspapers on tuesday speculated about what the international community should do next . " seldom before has there been such consensus among north korea 's asian-pacific neighbors and pyongyang 's strategic rivals : this state represents a massive threat to regional stability , " wrote the süddeutsche zeitung from munich on tuesday .
" japan perceives itself to be in the greatest military danger , and as a result tokyo will rethink its approach to national security .
one possible consequence is the development of nuclear weapons throughout the entire region .
that can only be prevented if the united states concentrates its arsenal of deterrence on the pacific and offers both south korea and japan explicit assurances of its support in case of a nuclear conflict . " the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung also focused on the us ' possible response to the crisis .
" china and above all the united states have it in their power to bring pyongyang back to the bargaining table , " the paper wrote .
" the north korean regime has often let it be known via its news service kcna that it is primarily interested in direct negotiations with washington .
but the prospects are now worse than they were in 1994 .
north korea has proclaimed itself to be a nuclear power , and it 's going to take some true initiative to keep pyongyang , where the regime likely sees this as a struggle for survival , from engaging in further escalations . " " only a harsh reaction , which will unfortunately also affect north korea 's already suffering population will send the necessary signals to other nuclear aspirants and prevent the nuclear non-proliferation treaty from collapsing entirely , " wrote berlin 's daily der tagesspiegel on tuesday .
" but severity alone wo n't convince north korea 's dictator to change his mind .
the international community and the bush government , which has been indecisive on this issue , will have to offer rewards in return for a verifiable abandonment of the nuclear option . and the hamburger abendblatt commented in its tuesday edition : " strongly worded declarations and even threats of sanctions wo n't deter a country like north korea , which is already largely isolated as the poorhouse of southeast asia .
conversely , offers of rewards , in which north korea has nothing to lose and everything to gain , presuppose that ruling elites are capable of a certain degree of rationalism .
what remains is the unsettling prospect that north korea 's ' dr. strangelove ' now only lacks mid-range missiles .
a danger is growing , whose implications for world peace can not at present be predicted : that there will be a ratcheting up of the arms race in southeast asia .

speculations are growing over how the south korean foreign minister will take on the tougher issues . andreas zumach is a geneva-based un correspondent for the german newspaper die tageszeitung . what has ban 's policy been as south korea foreign minster so far on north korea ? the problem is that there is no clear profile on his policy except that he is an efficient manager and mediator but he has never shown any political convictions , other than that he has been very close to whatever the us foreign policy was for the last 25 years . some people say that he is the architect of the so-called sunshine policy with north korea do you think he will adopt a harder line as requested by the us ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zumach thinks ban will follow the line of the us and china i am concerned that under the impact of yesterday 's nuclear test by north koreans and because of the pressure from the bush administration , he will adopt a harder line .
we could see already for the last year that the south korean government has not continued the original approach on the sunshine policy as it has originally adopted it because the bush administration clearly did n't support that . what affect will ban 's nomination have on the current crisis ? in the best case , he might be able to get the six nation talks going again and he might be able to move the bush administration to do the one thing that would be absolutely necessary to come to a diplomatic solution , which is to give pyongyang a nuclear non-aggression guarantee - something the clinton administration did back in 1994 and the bush administration renounced the guarantee in 2003 .
that 's when the problems began . do you think ban 's nomination might have provoked north korea nuclear test ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korean leader kim jong il has provoked the international community by testing nukes there are no indications that the timing of the nuclear test has anything to do with the election of ban ki moon , simply because the north korean government could not have guessed the development of the selection process for the secretary general at the un so for the timing i think it is rather a coincidence . what has made ban so popular with the un security council members ? it has been the smoothest selection process , compared to the former seven secretaries .
this seems to be good for the un , but i disagree , because the main reason for this process has been that ban ki moon is the smallest common denominator between two most powerful members of the security council - the united states and china .
i think this is not enough for the other 190 member countries of the un . i am concerned that he will continue to conduct his policies very closely along the us foreign policy on the one hand , and on the other hand he will avoid anything to criticize china and he will not highlight the importance of human rights as strongly as kofi annan has done , he will most certainly not highlight the important role of non-government organizations for international politics and for the un as kofi annan has done .
i think he will continue to conduct his new job in the way that he has conducted all the other jobs , which is to avoid conflict . so you do n't think he will be able to set his own stamp ? bildunterschrift : a different un with ban ?
only time will tell i am concerned that this will not happen .
i am always prepared to be positively surprised , but so-far the 35 years of his political and diplomatic career do n't give us any indications that besides being a conduit of diplomacy and a strong and hard worker , he has not developed his own political positions , let alone visions . if you look at the necessity to reform the united nations , we still have this broad political reform agenda that kofi annan put on the political agenda last year which still need to be decided on and implemented .
here we would need a secretary general that followed the same line that kofi annan put forward , but i am concerned that ban ki moon will only be concerned with those management reforms that washington is pushing for . do you think he has been nominated because of his experience on the korean peninsula ? ban ki moon has been nominated because , firstly , china prevented the original washington intention to have an eastern european by threatening a hard veto against any non-asian candidate .
secondly , because washington and beijing agreed that it should not be an indian in this position and then if you look at the field of candidates from asia that were left , ban ki moon seems to be the one that fits the interests of washington and beijing most . dw staff -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu : north korean nuclear test is " unacceptable " the european union has strongly condemned north korea 's nuclear test as " unacceptable .

speculations are growing over how the south korean foreign minister will take on the tougher issues . andreas zumach is a geneva-based un correspondent for the german newspaper die tageszeitung . what has ban 's policy been as south korea foreign minster so far on north korea ? the problem is that there is no clear profile on his policy except that he is an efficient manager and mediator but he has never shown any political convictions , other than that he has been very close to whatever the us foreign policy was for the last 25 years . some people say that he is the architect of the so-called sunshine policy with north korea do you think he will adopt a harder line as requested by the us ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zumach thinks ban will follow the line of the us and china i am concerned that under the impact of yesterday 's nuclear test by north koreans and because of the pressure from the bush administration , he will adopt a harder line .
we could see already for the last year that the south korean government has not continued the original approach on the sunshine policy as it has originally adopted it because the bush administration clearly did n't support that . what affect will ban 's nomination have on the current crisis ? in the best case , he might be able to get the six nation talks going again and he might be able to move the bush administration to do the one thing that would be absolutely necessary to come to a diplomatic solution , which is to give pyongyang a nuclear non-aggression guarantee - something the clinton administration did back in 1994 and the bush administration renounced the guarantee in 2003 .
that 's when the problems began . do you think ban 's nomination might have provoked north korea nuclear test ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korean leader kim jong il has provoked the international community by testing nukes there are no indications that the timing of the nuclear test has anything to do with the election of ban ki moon , simply because the north korean government could not have guessed the development of the selection process for the secretary general at the un so for the timing i think it is rather a coincidence . what has made ban so popular with the un security council members ? it has been the smoothest selection process , compared to the former seven secretaries .
this seems to be good for the un , but i disagree , because the main reason for this process has been that ban ki moon is the smallest common denominator between two most powerful members of the security council - the united states and china .
i think this is not enough for the other 190 member countries of the un . i am concerned that he will continue to conduct his policies very closely along the us foreign policy on the one hand , and on the other hand he will avoid anything to criticize china and he will not highlight the importance of human rights as strongly as kofi annan has done , he will most certainly not highlight the important role of non-government organizations for international politics and for the un as kofi annan has done .
i think he will continue to conduct his new job in the way that he has conducted all the other jobs , which is to avoid conflict . so you do n't think he will be able to set his own stamp ? bildunterschrift : a different un with ban ?
only time will tell i am concerned that this will not happen .
i am always prepared to be positively surprised , but so-far the 35 years of his political and diplomatic career do n't give us any indications that besides being a conduit of diplomacy and a strong and hard worker , he has not developed his own political positions , let alone visions . if you look at the necessity to reform the united nations , we still have this broad political reform agenda that kofi annan put on the political agenda last year which still need to be decided on and implemented .
here we would need a secretary general that followed the same line that kofi annan put forward , but i am concerned that ban ki moon will only be concerned with those management reforms that washington is pushing for . do you think he has been nominated because of his experience on the korean peninsula ? ban ki moon has been nominated because , firstly , china prevented the original washington intention to have an eastern european by threatening a hard veto against any non-asian candidate .
secondly , because washington and beijing agreed that it should not be an indian in this position and then if you look at the field of candidates from asia that were left , ban ki moon seems to be the one that fits the interests of washington and beijing most . dw staff -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu : north korean nuclear test is " unacceptable " the european union has strongly condemned north korea 's nuclear test as " unacceptable .

he said that sanctions were officially no longer on the table since germany 's deficit for 2006 should fall well within the 3 percent euro zone limit . the announcement ends germany 's embarrassing five-year struggle with the spending guideline .
throughout the 1990s , as a precondition for the adoption of a single european currency , germany insisted on a cap for state debt to ensure fiscal discipline among member states .
but due to soaring government costs and dwindling state revenues , germany missed that mark in 2002 and has failed to meet it ever since . that will change this year - thanks in part to increased consumer spending within germany and cutbacks in the country 's generous social welfare programs .
almunia 's announcement confirms an unofficial agreement among eu finance members in early september to drop disciplinary proceedings against berlin . almunia also said that greece and france - two other eu " debt sinners " - should also reduce their deficits below 3 percent in 2006 , and that italy was on course to follow suit in 2007 . germany 's improved budget figures come amidst what 's being seen as a slight recovery in the german economy .

a dispute over security precautions caused major delays for what some see as a symbol of german-american friendship . a sharp-toothed iron fence atop massive concrete slabs currently separates america 's representatives from the german people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not exactly welcoming : the current us embassy just off berlin 's unter den linden boulevard , the us embassy sits in a street that 's blocked off for traffic .
german police behind rows of concrete cylinders prevent unwanted visitors from getting too close .
" no photography " signs attached to the fence add to the inhospitable atmosphere . all that will change to a certain extent in the spring of 2008 , when american diplomats are expected to move three blocks down the street to the new embassy on pariser platz .
home to berlin 's landmark brandenburg gate , which became the symbol of reunification , the square draws hordes of tourists , becomes party central on new year 's eve and serves as the backdrop for major celebrations such as the 2006 soccer world cup , when millions of fans gathered to cheer their teams . making a statement it 's hardly a dream location when it comes to security : the square can not be completely cordoned off like the nearby street where the british embassy has set up quarters .
but soon after german reunification , us officials decided to make a statement by building their embassy on the very spot where us diplomats had once worked before world war ii . " the decision of the united states to return to this historic site symbolizes america 's support for a unified germany , " former ambassador daniel r. coats said at a groundbreaking ceremony in 2004 . bildunterschrift : the 180-million-euro -lrb- $ 228-million -rrb- embassy , sitting on the right corner , was designed by santa monica-based moore ruble yudell architects , who count the tacoma campus of the university of washington , a courthouse in fresno , an office complex in beijing and several churches among previous projects skylights and security zones almost exactly two years later , the building shell has been completed .
still missing are a glass conference room on top of the roof that is meant to illuminate berlin 's sky at night as well as a " green band of trees , gardens and walkways " along the street fronts .
already in place , however , are dozens of poles made of steel and concrete that are meant to guard the building against terrorist attacks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would neuschwanstein castle have been a better place for the new embassy ?
security concerns were also the main reason for a decade-long delay of the project .
following the 1998 bombings at us embassies in kenya and tanzania , us legislators called for more protection at new diplomatic missions .
confronted with the demands , berlin officials were especially irked by a 30-meter -lrb- 100-feet -rrb- security zone between the building and the street that would have required a complete redesign of the surrounding historic streets . the dispute reached comical proportions when berlin 's mayor reportedly said that americans should instead build a fast-food restaurant at the site , and the us ambassador jokingly suggested moving the embassy to bavaria 's world-famous -lrb- and certainly secure -rrb- neuschwanstein castle , where americans had always been welcome . a very good compromise ? both sides finally agreed to compromise by reducing the safety zone to 25 meters and shifting streets a little . " the overall design has been enriched by extensive critique and collaboration with the urban planning authorities of berlin and a sensitivity to the surrounding historic quarters , " reads a text on the embassy 's web site .
embassy officials were not available for comment monday as the embassy was closed for columbus day . bildunterschrift : the embassy 's shell on the left closes the gap along pariser platz .
only a bank 's building separates it from berlin 's famous brandenburg gate , seen on the right meanwhile , petra rohland , a spokeswoman for berlin 's urban planning department , looked on the bright side . " we found a very good compromise , " she said , adding that it addressed the american security concerns as well as berlin 's desire to keep the surroundings of pariser platz open to the public . closing the gap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these poles are still waiting for their historic coats " it closes the gap , " rohland said , referring to the last bit of wasteland along the square that has now disappeared .
" as good hosts , we 'll now have the embassy in this truly beautiful place . " besides , some of the security precautions will actually return some history to the square , rohland said : the poles will look like ones used as roadblocks in previous times . incidentally , the american need for security will also bring some increased security to the french embassy , which sits diagonally across on the other side of the square .
for reasons of symmetry , preservationists required the same poles to be installed there as well . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us ambassador to berlin says europeans are soft on terror in marking the fifth anniversary of the september 11 attacks , us ambassador to germany , william timken , voiced an unpopular hardline view on europe 's battle against islamic terrorism .

it also prevents children from working in teashops , restaurants , spas , hotels , resorts and other recreational centres .
pm manmohan singh has urged indians to support his government 's efforts to end child labour .
people found breaking the law could face two years in prison .
india has more than 12.6 million child workers , many of whom are employed in the food and hospitality sector .
' firm action ' in his appeal , on the eve of the law coming into force on tuesday , mr singh said : " our nation has solemnly pledged that children in our country are not engaged in any form of work at the cost of their right to education .
" as a major step in this direction , i call upon each one of you to stop employing children as workers and actively encourage children to join schools . "
the prime minister warned that " the government will take firm action against those violating the law " .
officials say the ban on employing children in homes and roadside food stalls will affect 255,000 children .
but activists say these numbers could be as high as 20 million .
a senior official in the labour ministry , sk srivastava , said : " the technical advisory committee on child labour regularly surveys the risk factors involved in any industry and depending on our findings we have taken this decision . "
the committee , while recommending the ban , warned that children under 14 were vulnerable to physical , mental and even sexual abuse .
laws ' ineffective ' mr srivastava said that anyone found violating the ban would be penalised under the child labour prohibition and regulation act of 1986 .
punishment could range from a jail term of three months to two years and / or a fine of 10,000 to 20,000 rupees -lrb- $ 225 to $ 450 -rrb- .
but child rights activists are sceptical about the effectiveness of the ban .
they point out that although india bans the use of young workers in hazardous industries , thousands of children continue to work in firecracker and matchstick factories or are involved in carpet-weaving , embroidery or stitching footballs .
they say the laws have remained ineffective in curbing child labour .
many parents say crippling poverty forces them to send their children , sometimes as young as five or six , to work in other people 's homes or in factories .
most of these children are made to work in unhealthy conditions for long hours and paid poorly .

the crowds wore red t-shirts to symbolise public anger over corruption scandals surrounding the president 's aides and family .
about 5,000 police were on duty but the protests were largely peaceful .
huge crowds gathered at four main points around the presidential office and called out their demands for the president 's resignation .
the crowds gave a thumbs down sign , showing their disapproval of his leadership .
barbed wire barricades kept the crowds several streets away from the area where government officials were gathered .
chaos and turmoil in his speech , president chen said he had always stood firm against corruption and that no-one was above the law , including himself and his family .
he admitted that since taking office six years ago , ending five decades of rule by the nationalist party , taiwan had faced political chaos and turmoil .
he said taiwan 's predicament was similar to the growing pains of other emerging democracies and he said partisan differences should not be allowed to undermine the island 's democracy , peace and prosperity .
but as he spoke , opposition legislators and critics in the presidential square began chanting calls for him to step down and some small scuffles broke out .
it was clearly an embarrassing moment for president chen , who was addressing foreign delegates and government officials .

it is rare that you would willingly let vandals and burglars into your home but a controlled environment like a honeypot computer lets you do the technological equivalent in relative safety .
the idea of letting the pc get infected was to see exactly what nasty programs hit our machine and how easy it was to recover from infection .
firstly , we visited a few of the websites mentioned in the many fake security warnings that pop-up unprompted thanks to loopholes in windows messenger .
much of the software available via these bogus warnings turned out to be a nuisance rather than downright malicious .
how the trap was sprung the programs offered a free scan of the honeypot machine looking for spyware and adware .
every one we installed found a huge amount of spyware lurking on the computer .
this was a surprise : the honeypot machine had only been used to visit the websites from which the bogus software had been downloaded .
checking the results with a bona fide spyware spotter revealed that most of the spyware identified by the fake software was benign .
if this was not bad enough , all the fake security programs demanded money before they handed over the full results of the scan or tried to fix problems that were not there .
spyware storm one of the websites sending out fake security spam looked particularly interesting as it was listed on several " block lists " net service firms use to spot junk mail .
a visit to this website prompted an immediate re-direct to another site which popped up a box asking if we wanted to download the bogus security program .
staying safe online use anti-spyware and anti-virus programs on at least a weekly basis update anti-virus and spyware products install a firewall and make sure it is switched on make sure updates to your operating system are installed take time to educate yourself and family about the risks monitor your computer and stay alert to threats hi-tech crime : a glossary sneakily this was an image rather than a windows dialogue box so clicking anywhere on it , even the " cancel " button , got the download going .
the download installed automatically and kicked off a tsunami of background downloading .
the forensic software we had installed on the honeypot saw it connect to three or four other sites and start downloading from them - one was from a thai hospital that was doubtless acting as an unwitting host .
the software was so sneaky that it tried to stop this traffic being seen by injecting it into the processes usually used by the internet explorer .
we knew this was the case because ie 's homepage had been set to be blank - ie when it was running there would be no net traffic .
the result of the installation was new toolbars on the ie browser , a whole list of new unwanted favourites , all web searches were hijacked and redirected plus pop-up adverts populated the desktop .
hi-tech crime plans the bbc news website is running a series of features throughout the week wednesday : anatomy of a spam e-mail and hackers face to face thursday : how to spot a phishing scam and interviews with security evangelists the machine was becoming unusable because it was so busy so we were forced to cut the net connection .
the bogus download went into overdrive trying to get back online .
the meter clocking processor usage zoomed to 100 % as it desperately tried to drag more stuff into the pc .
the machine became hard to shut down and we could only shut it off by pulling the virtual plug .
the end result of that single download was a pc that was unusable as it was so clogged with adware and spyware .
a quick scan of the machine revealed that seven viruses , mostly trojans , had been installed during the orgy of downloading .
we reverted back to the original configuration of the honeypot machine to get rid of the problems but this particular chunk of spyware was not done yet .
on the honeypot a usb drive was being used to take backups of the attack logs .
this had been plugged in to the machine while the fake security program installed itself .
the usb drive had gained a new passenger - the core program of the fake spyware .
if we had let this continue , doubtless it would have fired off next time the drive was plugged in to any other machine .
it was a close escape .
cleaning up the pc proved impossible .
it was lucky we could just revert to an earlier configuration .
if the honeypot had been a home pc almost everything stored on it , pictures , e-mails , might have been lost .

and it is something foreign minister kim howells should take to heart after an embarrassing clash with his tory opposite number , keith simpson , during a debate on the middle east crisis .
mr simpson had asked a detailed question about israel 's tactics in the current conflict when mr howells attempted a putdown .
" i am not a military strategist and i am not aware that he is . " he started to say before being swamped by a chorus of shouts of " yes he is " and , jokingly , " he 's a general " , from the tory benches .
much laughter at mr howells ' blunder followed as the minister offered his apology , stating : " he 's a general is he ?
i just thought he was a good bloke " .
just for the record , mr simpson is a military historian and has been director of cranfield security studies institute , cranfield university , a senior lecturer in war studies and international affairs at the royal military academy , sandhurst , and has written five books on military history or , put more simply , he knows what he is talking about .
1230 gmt , monday 24 july one sure sign that it is the last full day of business before the commons rises for its long summer break - there are 44 written ministerial statements being published instead of the usual two or three .
there is , we are always assured , absolutely nothing suspicious about the timing .
it is just that ministers and their departments are so overburdened there is always a backlog that has to be rushed out at the last moment .
still , it gives political hacks something to do on the last day of term as they attempt to dig out the nuggets from the dross .
the most eagerly awaited statement was the list of ministerial gifts valued over £ 140 handed out by foreign governments , politicians and so on .
this is the document that includes john prescott 's cowboy outfit .
had it not been for the row over the deputy prime minister 's links with us dome owner philip anschutz , this would probably have been the first time the gift would have come to light .
as the world and its dog now knows , " clint " prescott was given a stetson , boots , spurs , belt , buckle and leather bound notebook by the billionaire business so he could ride around his ranch carrying out his ministerial duties .
he chose not to buy the gifts , which he is able to do , but handed them over to his department .
-lrb- does he ever sneak into his office at night to try them on again ? -rrb- .
mr prescott declared no other gifts and most other ministers declared nothing at all .
unsurprisingly , the prime minister received the largest number -lrb- 17 -rrb- , including four separate gifts of wine from president chirac .
he did n't buy any of it but did chose to purchase a lead crystal vase worth £ 150 from the italian government , a set of five russian commemorative coins worth £ 200 from the russian government , and a contemporary print of london worth £ 300 from london 2012 .
chancellor gordon brown just could not resist the ferrari .
ok it was a pedal car worth £ 190 which was presented to him by the italian finance minister and will come in handy for his ever-growing family .
1230 gmt , thursday 20 july tory frontbencher boris johnson appears to have developed an uncanny knack of bumping into the right people at just the right time - and then causing maximum mischief by reporting their remarks .
first it was tony blair 's chief of staff , jonathan powell , who was supposed to have ridiculed gordon brown 's prime ministerial hopes .
now it is alastair campbell who is claimed to have revealed the prime minister will not quit for " a year and a bit " .
last june , bicycling boris had a traffic lights encounter with mr powell who was also cycling through london .
according to boris , powell told him gordon brown 's ambitions were a " shakespearian tragedy " .
" he is like the guy who thinks he 's going to be king but never gets it .
he 's never going to be prime minister , " reported boris in the spectator magazine , which he then edited .
the prime minister 's official spokesman said : " jonathan did not say it " .
now , just as speculation is rife that tony blair will quit or announce his quitting plans at this year 's labour conference , boris has bumped into ali c at a coffee stall at lord 's cricket ground .
boris allegedly asked the obvious question about when the pm would resign and was startled to be given the answer " a year and a bit " , according , once again , to the spectator .
now make what you will of that - and the brownies in westminster will undoubtedly make mountains out of it .
but is it just a coincidence that it came after the prime minister himself appeared to reveal he was planning still to be pm in a year 's time , at least ?
and is n't it funny that more than one labour loyalist has told me privately that the prime minister will go at the 2007 party conference ?
do we smell a concerted campaign and , if so , what does it all mean ?
is gordon being warned of something , is there an attempt to wrong foot everybody , is the prime minister trying to silence his critics by having a specific date entered into the labour 's hive mind .
or do politicians , pundits and hacks in westminster simply need to take a holiday .
0930 gmt , wednesday 19 july for those who fear politicians believe they are above the law , here are a couple of cases where the law 's view that all men are equal -lrb- i.e either criminals or potential criminals -rrb- has held firm .
prime minister tony blair , who is already apparently preparing for a chat with the met on other matters , fell foul of an eagle eyed officer as he was planning a photocall with racing driver damon hill and a formula 1 car in downing street to mark the return of the motor show to london .
the vehicle arrived in sections and was assembled in the ministry of defence car park opposite downing street .
but as technicians attempted to wheel it the short distance across whitehall to downing street they were informed by the officer that , as the car had no mot , tax or insurance it could not take to a public road .
so blair , hill and entourage had to walk across the road for the picture opportunity before returning to no 10 for a reception to mark the event .
and no , bernie ecclestone was nowhere in sight .
meanwhile , former liberal democrat leader charles kennedy discovered those colourful custodians of the tower of london , the beefeaters , are more than just tourist attractions .
mr kennedy was giving a tv interview near the tower when he was approached by one of the yeoman warders , to give them their real title , and told he was causing an obstruction and should " move along please " .
1200 gmt , tuesday 18 july oh dear , president bush appears to have started a trend with his " yo blair " remark .
the prime minister 's official spokesman opened this morning 's daily lobby briefing in his normal way with a cheery -lrb- ish -rrb- " good morning " before adding to much hilarity , " or as we now say , yo " .
it is , of course , these overheard remarks not intended for public consumption that so often end up attaching themselves forever to politicians .
remember john major and the " bastards " in his cabinet who he promised to " crucify " .
it was taken to suggest a lack of authority .
the question now is how his successor as prime minister finds his overheard conversation with the us president interpreted .
1200 gmt , monday 17 july after giving tory leader david cameron a cuddly new image as a bike riding chameleon , labour appears to have done it again .
click onto the official labour party website and the first thing that greets you is a large picture of the tory leader with , helpfully , his name in capital letters against a bright blue background .
only after a short downwards scroll do you come to the bit that adds : " breaks his epp promise " .
i 'm told conservative central office is far from furious at this " attack " suspecting that many voters will have no idea what the epp is .
" just another bit of free advertising for our man , " said one .
1200 gmt , thursday 13 july the once-infamous annie 's bar may have been shut down by the commons accountants , but the spirit lives on in the shape of the annie .
this is the coveted trophy handed to the winner of the annual annie 's bar pool tournament , which has become one of the highlights of westminster 's social and sporting calendar .
the contest is still going ahead this year , with the support of mps across all parties and including sports minister himself , dick caborn .
but where will the contestants play the early stages of the contest before the grand final on the commons terrace bar in january ?
well , the pool table has been left in annie 's while the authorities work out what to do with the room they were so eager to get their hands on so mps and other contestants will have to play the early games in the old bar which has been stripped of all ornamentation and where they will no longer be able to get a drink .
that should concentrate their minds on the game .
1100 gmt , wednesday 12 july publicist max clifford has been involved in some of the juiciest scandals to have hit politics over recent years .
so when he addressed a lunch with political journalists we were eager to hear what he might have to say about current affairs .
there was plenty he would like to tell us in private , he said .
but , as his comments were on the record , he had to be more circumspect , he declared .
the tease .
however , he did whet appetites by saying : " who knows what might be happening in the not too distant future . "
i suspect he knows , for one .
0930 gmt , tuesday 11 july it looks like the world cup is going to be remembered for two specific events - a kick in the shorts and a butt in the chest .
and the way the entire contest unfolded has clearly brought labour 's glasgow mp david marshall to the end of the tether .
he has tabled a commons motion praising germany for the way it ran the games , but he then lets rip .
he says the competition will be remembered for " the cheating , complaining to referees , cynical professional fouls , diving , elbowing , feigning injury , lack of sportsmanship , shirt pulling , simulation and time wasting by too many grossly overpaid so-called superstar players who behaved more like spoilt brats and set a disgraceful example to millions of young fans " .
there 's more , he points out that " a record number of red and yellow cards were dished out by referees , some of whom appeared to be incompetent and short-sighted " .
and , turning on the football authorities , he adds " the discredited leadership of the president of fifa did not help " .
blimey .
perhaps i should have watched some of it after all .
1630 gmt , thursday 6 july this is what counts as wit in the house of commons .
when labour mp greg pope was chairing the commons committee debating a church of england measure , tory wag sir patrick cormack brought the house down , apparently , by declaring : " this is a most historic day for the church of england because we are being presided over by a pope . "
and yes , mr pope is a catholic .
if you have recovered from that belter , here 's a better one concerning the same mp .
mr pope was the subject of a genuinely funny practical joke when he first entered parliament in 1997 and was allocated his named cloakroom peg .
his tag - pope , gregory - was removed , had the number 1 added to it and was replaced next to the that of democratic unionist , the rev ian paisley .
how they laughed .
1530 gmt , wednesday 5 july tory mp peter atkinson may not have endeared himself to some animal rightists with his campaign to save the red squirrel .
but i now fear he has also invoked the wrath of vegetarians .
speaking during a debate on the future of northumberland 's red squirrels , he confessed that the last time he did so his office had been flooded with around 500 letters from people condemning him as " a cruel and evil man who wanted to exterminate grey squirrels " .
but worse was to come , he went on to reveal he has now developed a bit of a taste for grey squirrels .
literally .
" at the risk of a further 500 letters , i have to say that i have actually tasted grey squirrel - they eat it in america .
" although there is not a lot of meat on it , to say the least .
it tastes rather like chicken and is quite palatable . " 1530 gmt , tuesday 4 july policemen at the palace of westminster are notorious for their mischievous sense of humour when it comes to dealing with tourists .
for example , they once nominated a camera-shy constable as the " official " pc to be photographed by visitors eager to be snapped with a british bobby .
but the latest wheeze takes the biscuit .
apparently when tourists ask why big ben has been silenced for work on the famous bell , they are told : " because it 's going digital . "

mr simpson had the last laugh and it is something foreign minister kim howells should take to heart after an embarrassing clash with his tory opposite number , keith simpson , during a debate on the middle east crisis .
mr simpson had asked a detailed question about israel 's tactics in the current conflict when mr howells attempted a putdown .
" i am not a military strategist and i am not aware that he is . " he started to say before being swamped by a chorus of shouts of " yes he is " and , jokingly , " he 's a general " , from the tory benches .
much laughter at mr howells ' blunder followed as the minister offered his apology , stating : " he 's a general is he ?
i just thought he was a good bloke " .
just for the record , mr simpson is a military historian and has been director of cranfield security studies institute , cranfield university , a senior lecturer in war studies and international affairs at the royal military academy , sandhurst , and has written five books on military history or , put more simply , he knows what he is talking about .
1230 gmt , monday 24 july one sure sign that it is the last full day of business before the commons rises for its long summer break - there are 44 written ministerial statements being published instead of the usual two or three .
a present for the chancellor 's kids ?
there is , we are always assured , absolutely nothing suspicious about the timing .
it is just that ministers and their departments are so overburdened there is always a backlog that has to be rushed out at the last moment .
still , it gives political hacks something to do on the last day of term as they attempt to dig out the nuggets from the dross .
the most eagerly awaited statement was the list of ministerial gifts valued over £ 140 handed out by foreign governments , politicians and so on .
this is the document that includes john prescott 's cowboy outfit .
had it not been for the row over the deputy prime minister 's links with us dome owner philip anschutz , this would probably have been the first time the gift would have come to light .
as the world and its dog now knows , " clint " prescott was given a stetson , boots , spurs , belt , buckle and leather bound notebook by the billionaire business so he could ride around his ranch carrying out his ministerial duties .
he chose not to buy the gifts , which he is able to do , but handed them over to his department .
-lrb- does he ever sneak into his office at night to try them on again ? -rrb- .
mr prescott declared no other gifts and most other ministers declared nothing at all .
unsurprisingly , the prime minister received the largest number -lrb- 17 -rrb- , including four separate gifts of wine from president chirac .
he did n't buy any of it but did chose to purchase a lead crystal vase worth £ 150 from the italian government , a set of five russian commemorative coins worth £ 200 from the russian government , and a contemporary print of london worth £ 300 from london 2012 .
chancellor gordon brown just could not resist the ferrari .
ok it was a pedal car worth £ 190 which was presented to him by the italian finance minister and will come in handy for his ever-growing family .
1230 gmt , thursday 20 july tory frontbencher boris johnson appears to have developed an uncanny knack of bumping into the right people at just the right time - and then causing maximum mischief by reporting their remarks .
boris has scoop on blair 's retirement date first it was tony blair 's chief of staff , jonathan powell , who was supposed to have ridiculed gordon brown 's prime ministerial hopes .
now it is alastair campbell who is claimed to have revealed the prime minister will not quit for " a year and a bit " .
last june , bicycling boris had a traffic lights encounter with mr powell who was also cycling through london .
according to boris , powell told him gordon brown 's ambitions were a " shakespearian tragedy " .
" he is like the guy who thinks he 's going to be king but never gets it .
he 's never going to be prime minister , " reported boris in the spectator magazine , which he then edited .
the prime minister 's official spokesman said : " jonathan did not say it " .
now , just as speculation is rife that tony blair will quit or announce his quitting plans at this year 's labour conference , boris has bumped into ali c at a coffee stall at lord 's cricket ground .
boris allegedly asked the obvious question about when the pm would resign and was startled to be given the answer " a year and a bit " , according , once again , to the spectator .
now make what you will of that - and the brownies in westminster will undoubtedly make mountains out of it .
but is it just a coincidence that it came after the prime minister himself appeared to reveal he was planning still to be pm in a year 's time , at least ?
and is n't it funny that more than one labour loyalist has told me privately that the prime minister will go at the 2007 party conference ?
do we smell a concerted campaign and , if so , what does it all mean ?
is gordon being warned of something , is there an attempt to wrong foot everybody , is the prime minister trying to silence his critics by having a specific date entered into the labour 's hive mind .
or do politicians , pundits and hacks in westminster simply need to take a holiday .

a bit more free advertising click onto the official labour party website and the first thing that greets you is a large picture of the tory leader with , helpfully , his name in capital letters against a bright blue background .
only after a short downwards scroll do you come to the bit that adds : " breaks his epp promise " .
i 'm told conservative central office is far from furious at this " attack " suspecting that many voters will have no idea what the epp is .
" just another bit of free advertising for our man , " said one .
1200 gmt , thursday 13 july the once-infamous annie 's bar may have been shut down by the commons accountants , but the spirit lives on in the shape of the annie .
the annual westminster pool contest goes on this is the coveted trophy handed to the winner of the annual annie 's bar pool tournament , which has become one of the highlights of westminster 's social and sporting calendar .
the contest is still going ahead this year , with the support of mps across all parties and including sports minister himself , dick caborn .
but where will the contestants play the early stages of the contest before the grand final on the commons terrace bar in january ?
well , the pool table has been left in annie 's while the authorities work out what to do with the room they were so eager to get their hands on so mps and other contestants will have to play the early games in the old bar which has been stripped of all ornamentation and where they will no longer be able to get a drink .
that should concentrate their minds on the game .
1100 gmt , wednesday 12 july publicist max clifford has been involved in some of the juiciest scandals to have hit politics over recent years .
clifford teased an audience of journalists so when he addressed a lunch with political journalists we were eager to hear what he might have to say about current affairs .
there was plenty he would like to tell us in private , he said .
but , as his comments were on the record , he had to be more circumspect , he declared .
the tease .
however , he did whet appetites by saying : " who knows what might be happening in the not too distant future . "
i suspect he knows , for one .
0930 gmt , tuesday 11 july it looks like the world cup is going to be remembered for two specific events - a kick in the shorts and a butt in the chest .
the kick that marred the world cup and the way the entire contest unfolded has clearly brought labour 's glasgow mp david marshall to the end of the tether .
he has tabled a commons motion praising germany for the way it ran the games , but he then lets rip .
he says the competition will be remembered for " the cheating , complaining to referees , cynical professional fouls , diving , elbowing , feigning injury , lack of sportsmanship , shirt pulling , simulation and time wasting by too many grossly overpaid so-called superstar players who behaved more like spoilt brats and set a disgraceful example to millions of young fans " .
there 's more , he points out that " a record number of red and yellow cards were dished out by referees , some of whom appeared to be incompetent and short-sighted " .
and , turning on the football authorities , he adds " the discredited leadership of the president of fifa did not help " .
blimey .
perhaps i should have watched some of it after all .
1630 gmt , thursday 6 july this is what counts as wit in the house of commons .
what fun they had with pope 's name when labour mp greg pope was chairing the commons committee debating a church of england measure , tory wag sir patrick cormack brought the house down , apparently , by declaring : " this is a most historic day for the church of england because we are being presided over by a pope . "
and yes , mr pope is a catholic .
if you have recovered from that belter , here 's a better one concerning the same mp .
mr pope was the subject of a genuinely funny practical joke when he first entered parliament in 1997 and was allocated his named cloakroom peg .
his tag - pope , gregory - was removed , had the number 1 added to it and was replaced next to the that of democratic unionist , the rev ian paisley .
how they laughed .
1530 gmt , wednesday 5 july tory mp peter atkinson may not have endeared himself to some animal rightists with his campaign to save the red squirrel .
grey squirrel said to be tasty but i now fear he has also invoked the wrath of vegetarians .
speaking during a debate on the future of northumberland 's red squirrels , he confessed that the last time he did so his office had been flooded with around 500 letters from people condemning him as " a cruel and evil man who wanted to exterminate grey squirrels " .
but worse was to come , he went on to reveal he has now developed a bit of a taste for grey squirrels .
literally .
" at the risk of a further 500 letters , i have to say that i have actually tasted grey squirrel - they eat it in america .
" although there is not a lot of meat on it , to say the least .
it tastes rather like chicken and is quite palatable . " 1530 gmt , tuesday 4 july policemen at the palace of westminster are notorious for their mischievous sense of humour when it comes to dealing with tourists .
big ben 's chimes have been silenced for example , they once nominated a camera-shy constable as the " official " pc to be photographed by visitors eager to be snapped with a british bobby .
but the latest wheeze takes the biscuit .
apparently when tourists ask why big ben has been silenced for work on the famous bell , they are told : " because it 's going digital . "

mr simpson had the last laugh and it is something foreign minister kim howells should take to heart after an embarrassing clash with his tory opposite number , keith simpson , during a debate on the middle east crisis .
mr simpson had asked a detailed question about israel 's tactics in the current conflict when mr howells attempted a putdown .
" i am not a military strategist and i am not aware that he is . " he started to say before being swamped by a chorus of shouts of " yes he is " and , jokingly , " he 's a general " , from the tory benches .
much laughter at mr howells ' blunder followed as the minister offered his apology , stating : " he 's a general is he ?
i just thought he was a good bloke " .
just for the record , mr simpson is a military historian and has been director of cranfield security studies institute , cranfield university , a senior lecturer in war studies and international affairs at the royal military academy , sandhurst , and has written five books on military history or , put more simply , he knows what he is talking about .
1230 gmt , monday 24 july one sure sign that it is the last full day of business before the commons rises for its long summer break - there are 44 written ministerial statements being published instead of the usual two or three .
a present for the chancellor 's kids ?
there is , we are always assured , absolutely nothing suspicious about the timing .
it is just that ministers and their departments are so overburdened there is always a backlog that has to be rushed out at the last moment .
still , it gives political hacks something to do on the last day of term as they attempt to dig out the nuggets from the dross .
the most eagerly awaited statement was the list of ministerial gifts valued over £ 140 handed out by foreign governments , politicians and so on .
this is the document that includes john prescott 's cowboy outfit .
had it not been for the row over the deputy prime minister 's links with us dome owner philip anschutz , this would probably have been the first time the gift would have come to light .
as the world and its dog now knows , " clint " prescott was given a stetson , boots , spurs , belt , buckle and leather bound notebook by the billionaire business so he could ride around his ranch carrying out his ministerial duties .
he chose not to buy the gifts , which he is able to do , but handed them over to his department .
-lrb- does he ever sneak into his office at night to try them on again ? -rrb- .
mr prescott declared no other gifts and most other ministers declared nothing at all .
unsurprisingly , the prime minister received the largest number -lrb- 17 -rrb- , including four separate gifts of wine from president chirac .
he did n't buy any of it but did chose to purchase a lead crystal vase worth £ 150 from the italian government , a set of five russian commemorative coins worth £ 200 from the russian government , and a contemporary print of london worth £ 300 from london 2012 .
chancellor gordon brown just could not resist the ferrari .
ok it was a pedal car worth £ 190 which was presented to him by the italian finance minister and will come in handy for his ever-growing family .
1230 gmt , thursday 20 july tory frontbencher boris johnson appears to have developed an uncanny knack of bumping into the right people at just the right time - and then causing maximum mischief by reporting their remarks .
boris has scoop on blair 's retirement date first it was tony blair 's chief of staff , jonathan powell , who was supposed to have ridiculed gordon brown 's prime ministerial hopes .
now it is alastair campbell who is claimed to have revealed the prime minister will not quit for " a year and a bit " .
last june , bicycling boris had a traffic lights encounter with mr powell who was also cycling through london .
according to boris , powell told him gordon brown 's ambitions were a " shakespearian tragedy " .
" he is like the guy who thinks he 's going to be king but never gets it .
he 's never going to be prime minister , " reported boris in the spectator magazine , which he then edited .
the prime minister 's official spokesman said : " jonathan did not say it " .
now , just as speculation is rife that tony blair will quit or announce his quitting plans at this year 's labour conference , boris has bumped into ali c at a coffee stall at lord 's cricket ground .
boris allegedly asked the obvious question about when the pm would resign and was startled to be given the answer " a year and a bit " , according , once again , to the spectator .
now make what you will of that - and the brownies in westminster will undoubtedly make mountains out of it .
but is it just a coincidence that it came after the prime minister himself appeared to reveal he was planning still to be pm in a year 's time , at least ?
and is n't it funny that more than one labour loyalist has told me privately that the prime minister will go at the 2007 party conference ?
do we smell a concerted campaign and , if so , what does it all mean ?
is gordon being warned of something , is there an attempt to wrong foot everybody , is the prime minister trying to silence his critics by having a specific date entered into the labour 's hive mind .
or do politicians , pundits and hacks in westminster simply need to take a holiday .
0930 gmt , wednesday 19 july for those who fear politicians believe they are above the law , here are a couple of cases where the law 's view that all men are equal -lrb- i.e either criminals or potential criminals -rrb- has held firm .
hill and blair were banned from the roads prime minister tony blair , who is already apparently preparing for a chat with the met on other matters , fell foul of an eagle eyed officer as he was planning a photocall with racing driver damon hill and a formula 1 car in downing street to mark the return of the motor show to london .
the vehicle arrived in sections and was assembled in the ministry of defence car park opposite downing street .
but as technicians attempted to wheel it the short distance across whitehall to downing street they were informed by the officer that , as the car had no mot , tax or insurance it could not take to a public road .
so blair , hill and entourage had to walk across the road for the picture opportunity before returning to no 10 for a reception to mark the event .
and no , bernie ecclestone was nowhere in sight .
meanwhile , former liberal democrat leader charles kennedy discovered those colourful custodians of the tower of london , the beefeaters , are more than just tourist attractions .
mr kennedy was giving a tv interview near the tower when he was approached by one of the yeoman warders , to give them their real title , and told he was causing an obstruction and should " move along please " .
1200 gmt , tuesday 18 july oh dear , president bush appears to have started a trend with his " yo blair " remark .
check the microphone is off next time george the prime minister 's official spokesman opened this morning 's daily lobby briefing in his normal way with a cheery -lrb- ish -rrb- " good morning " before adding to much hilarity , " or as we now say , yo " .
it is , of course , these overheard remarks not intended for public consumption that so often end up attaching themselves forever to politicians .
remember john major and the " bastards " in his cabinet who he promised to " crucify " .
it was taken to suggest a lack of authority .
the question now is how his successor as prime minister finds his overheard conversation with the us president interpreted .

mr simpson had the last laugh and it is something foreign minister kim howells should take to heart after an embarrassing clash with his tory opposite number , keith simpson , during a debate on the middle east crisis .
mr simpson had asked a detailed question about israel 's tactics in the current conflict when mr howells attempted a putdown .
" i am not a military strategist and i am not aware that he is . " he started to say before being swamped by a chorus of shouts of " yes he is " and , jokingly , " he 's a general " , from the tory benches .
much laughter at mr howells ' blunder followed as the minister offered his apology , stating : " he 's a general is he ?
i just thought he was a good bloke " .
just for the record , mr simpson is a military historian and has been director of cranfield security studies institute , cranfield university , a senior lecturer in war studies and international affairs at the royal military academy , sandhurst , and has written five books on military history or , put more simply , he knows what he is talking about .
1230 gmt , monday 24 july one sure sign that it is the last full day of business before the commons rises for its long summer break - there are 44 written ministerial statements being published instead of the usual two or three .
a present for the chancellor 's kids ?
there is , we are always assured , absolutely nothing suspicious about the timing .
it is just that ministers and their departments are so overburdened there is always a backlog that has to be rushed out at the last moment .
still , it gives political hacks something to do on the last day of term as they attempt to dig out the nuggets from the dross .
the most eagerly awaited statement was the list of ministerial gifts valued over £ 140 handed out by foreign governments , politicians and so on .
this is the document that includes john prescott 's cowboy outfit .
had it not been for the row over the deputy prime minister 's links with us dome owner philip anschutz , this would probably have been the first time the gift would have come to light .
as the world and its dog now knows , " clint " prescott was given a stetson , boots , spurs , belt , buckle and leather bound notebook by the billionaire business so he could ride around his ranch carrying out his ministerial duties .
he chose not to buy the gifts , which he is able to do , but handed them over to his department .
-lrb- does he ever sneak into his office at night to try them on again ? -rrb- .
mr prescott declared no other gifts and most other ministers declared nothing at all .
unsurprisingly , the prime minister received the largest number -lrb- 17 -rrb- , including four separate gifts of wine from president chirac .
he did n't buy any of it but did chose to purchase a lead crystal vase worth £ 150 from the italian government , a set of five russian commemorative coins worth £ 200 from the russian government , and a contemporary print of london worth £ 300 from london 2012 .
chancellor gordon brown just could not resist the ferrari .
ok it was a pedal car worth £ 190 which was presented to him by the italian finance minister and will come in handy for his ever-growing family .
1230 gmt , thursday 20 july tory frontbencher boris johnson appears to have developed an uncanny knack of bumping into the right people at just the right time - and then causing maximum mischief by reporting their remarks .
boris has scoop on blair 's retirement date first it was tony blair 's chief of staff , jonathan powell , who was supposed to have ridiculed gordon brown 's prime ministerial hopes .
now it is alastair campbell who is claimed to have revealed the prime minister will not quit for " a year and a bit " .
last june , bicycling boris had a traffic lights encounter with mr powell who was also cycling through london .
according to boris , powell told him gordon brown 's ambitions were a " shakespearian tragedy " .
" he is like the guy who thinks he 's going to be king but never gets it .
he 's never going to be prime minister , " reported boris in the spectator magazine , which he then edited .
the prime minister 's official spokesman said : " jonathan did not say it " .
now , just as speculation is rife that tony blair will quit or announce his quitting plans at this year 's labour conference , boris has bumped into ali c at a coffee stall at lord 's cricket ground .
boris allegedly asked the obvious question about when the pm would resign and was startled to be given the answer " a year and a bit " , according , once again , to the spectator .
now make what you will of that - and the brownies in westminster will undoubtedly make mountains out of it .
but is it just a coincidence that it came after the prime minister himself appeared to reveal he was planning still to be pm in a year 's time , at least ?
and is n't it funny that more than one labour loyalist has told me privately that the prime minister will go at the 2007 party conference ?
do we smell a concerted campaign and , if so , what does it all mean ?
is gordon being warned of something , is there an attempt to wrong foot everybody , is the prime minister trying to silence his critics by having a specific date entered into the labour 's hive mind .
or do politicians , pundits and hacks in westminster simply need to take a holiday .
0930 gmt , wednesday 19 july for those who fear politicians believe they are above the law , here are a couple of cases where the law 's view that all men are equal -lrb- i.e either criminals or potential criminals -rrb- has held firm .
hill and blair were banned from the roads prime minister tony blair , who is already apparently preparing for a chat with the met on other matters , fell foul of an eagle eyed officer as he was planning a photocall with racing driver damon hill and a formula 1 car in downing street to mark the return of the motor show to london .
the vehicle arrived in sections and was assembled in the ministry of defence car park opposite downing street .
but as technicians attempted to wheel it the short distance across whitehall to downing street they were informed by the officer that , as the car had no mot , tax or insurance it could not take to a public road .
so blair , hill and entourage had to walk across the road for the picture opportunity before returning to no 10 for a reception to mark the event .
and no , bernie ecclestone was nowhere in sight .
meanwhile , former liberal democrat leader charles kennedy discovered those colourful custodians of the tower of london , the beefeaters , are more than just tourist attractions .
mr kennedy was giving a tv interview near the tower when he was approached by one of the yeoman warders , to give them their real title , and told he was causing an obstruction and should " move along please " .
1200 gmt , tuesday 18 july oh dear , president bush appears to have started a trend with his " yo blair " remark .
check the microphone is off next time george the prime minister 's official spokesman opened this morning 's daily lobby briefing in his normal way with a cheery -lrb- ish -rrb- " good morning " before adding to much hilarity , " or as we now say , yo " .
it is , of course , these overheard remarks not intended for public consumption that so often end up attaching themselves forever to politicians .
remember john major and the " bastards " in his cabinet who he promised to " crucify " .
it was taken to suggest a lack of authority .
the question now is how his successor as prime minister finds his overheard conversation with the us president interpreted .
1200 gmt , monday 17 july after giving tory leader david cameron a cuddly new image as a bike riding chameleon , labour appears to have done it again .
a bit more free advertising click onto the official labour party website and the first thing that greets you is a large picture of the tory leader with , helpfully , his name in capital letters against a bright blue background .
only after a short downwards scroll do you come to the bit that adds : " breaks his epp promise " .
i 'm told conservative central office is far from furious at this " attack " suspecting that many voters will have no idea what the epp is .
" just another bit of free advertising for our man , " said one .
1200 gmt , thursday 13 july the once-infamous annie 's bar may have been shut down by the commons accountants , but the spirit lives on in the shape of the annie .
the annual westminster pool contest goes on this is the coveted trophy handed to the winner of the annual annie 's bar pool tournament , which has become one of the highlights of westminster 's social and sporting calendar .
the contest is still going ahead this year , with the support of mps across all parties and including sports minister himself , dick caborn .
but where will the contestants play the early stages of the contest before the grand final on the commons terrace bar in january ?
well , the pool table has been left in annie 's while the authorities work out what to do with the room they were so eager to get their hands on so mps and other contestants will have to play the early games in the old bar which has been stripped of all ornamentation and where they will no longer be able to get a drink .
that should concentrate their minds on the game .
1100 gmt , wednesday 12 july publicist max clifford has been involved in some of the juiciest scandals to have hit politics over recent years .
clifford teased an audience of journalists so when he addressed a lunch with political journalists we were eager to hear what he might have to say about current affairs .
there was plenty he would like to tell us in private , he said .
but , as his comments were on the record , he had to be more circumspect , he declared .
the tease .
however , he did whet appetites by saying : " who knows what might be happening in the not too distant future . "

mr simpson had the last laugh and it is something foreign minister kim howells should take to heart after an embarrassing clash with his tory opposite number , keith simpson , during a debate on the middle east crisis .
mr simpson had asked a detailed question about israel 's tactics in the current conflict when mr howells attempted a putdown .
" i am not a military strategist and i am not aware that he is . " he started to say before being swamped by a chorus of shouts of " yes he is " and , jokingly , " he 's a general " , from the tory benches .
much laughter at mr howells ' blunder followed as the minister offered his apology , stating : " he 's a general is he ?
i just thought he was a good bloke " .
just for the record , mr simpson is a military historian and has been director of cranfield security studies institute , cranfield university , a senior lecturer in war studies and international affairs at the royal military academy , sandhurst , and has written five books on military history or , put more simply , he knows what he is talking about .
1230 gmt , monday 24 july one sure sign that it is the last full day of business before the commons rises for its long summer break - there are 44 written ministerial statements being published instead of the usual two or three .
a present for the chancellor 's kids ?
there is , we are always assured , absolutely nothing suspicious about the timing .
it is just that ministers and their departments are so overburdened there is always a backlog that has to be rushed out at the last moment .
still , it gives political hacks something to do on the last day of term as they attempt to dig out the nuggets from the dross .
the most eagerly awaited statement was the list of ministerial gifts valued over £ 140 handed out by foreign governments , politicians and so on .
this is the document that includes john prescott 's cowboy outfit .
had it not been for the row over the deputy prime minister 's links with us dome owner philip anschutz , this would probably have been the first time the gift would have come to light .
as the world and its dog now knows , " clint " prescott was given a stetson , boots , spurs , belt , buckle and leather bound notebook by the billionaire business so he could ride around his ranch carrying out his ministerial duties .
he chose not to buy the gifts , which he is able to do , but handed them over to his department .
-lrb- does he ever sneak into his office at night to try them on again ? -rrb- .
mr prescott declared no other gifts and most other ministers declared nothing at all .
unsurprisingly , the prime minister received the largest number -lrb- 17 -rrb- , including four separate gifts of wine from president chirac .
he did n't buy any of it but did chose to purchase a lead crystal vase worth £ 150 from the italian government , a set of five russian commemorative coins worth £ 200 from the russian government , and a contemporary print of london worth £ 300 from london 2012 .
chancellor gordon brown just could not resist the ferrari .
ok it was a pedal car worth £ 190 which was presented to him by the italian finance minister and will come in handy for his ever-growing family .
1230 gmt , thursday 20 july tory frontbencher boris johnson appears to have developed an uncanny knack of bumping into the right people at just the right time - and then causing maximum mischief by reporting their remarks .
boris has scoop on blair 's retirement date first it was tony blair 's chief of staff , jonathan powell , who was supposed to have ridiculed gordon brown 's prime ministerial hopes .
now it is alastair campbell who is claimed to have revealed the prime minister will not quit for " a year and a bit " .
last june , bicycling boris had a traffic lights encounter with mr powell who was also cycling through london .
according to boris , powell told him gordon brown 's ambitions were a " shakespearian tragedy " .
" he is like the guy who thinks he 's going to be king but never gets it .
he 's never going to be prime minister , " reported boris in the spectator magazine , which he then edited .
the prime minister 's official spokesman said : " jonathan did not say it " .
now , just as speculation is rife that tony blair will quit or announce his quitting plans at this year 's labour conference , boris has bumped into ali c at a coffee stall at lord 's cricket ground .
boris allegedly asked the obvious question about when the pm would resign and was startled to be given the answer " a year and a bit " , according , once again , to the spectator .
now make what you will of that - and the brownies in westminster will undoubtedly make mountains out of it .
but is it just a coincidence that it came after the prime minister himself appeared to reveal he was planning still to be pm in a year 's time , at least ?
and is n't it funny that more than one labour loyalist has told me privately that the prime minister will go at the 2007 party conference ?
do we smell a concerted campaign and , if so , what does it all mean ?
is gordon being warned of something , is there an attempt to wrong foot everybody , is the prime minister trying to silence his critics by having a specific date entered into the labour 's hive mind .
or do politicians , pundits and hacks in westminster simply need to take a holiday .
0930 gmt , wednesday 19 july for those who fear politicians believe they are above the law , here are a couple of cases where the law 's view that all men are equal -lrb- i.e either criminals or potential criminals -rrb- has held firm .
hill and blair were banned from the roads prime minister tony blair , who is already apparently preparing for a chat with the met on other matters , fell foul of an eagle eyed officer as he was planning a photocall with racing driver damon hill and a formula 1 car in downing street to mark the return of the motor show to london .
the vehicle arrived in sections and was assembled in the ministry of defence car park opposite downing street .
but as technicians attempted to wheel it the short distance across whitehall to downing street they were informed by the officer that , as the car had no mot , tax or insurance it could not take to a public road .
so blair , hill and entourage had to walk across the road for the picture opportunity before returning to no 10 for a reception to mark the event .
and no , bernie ecclestone was nowhere in sight .
meanwhile , former liberal democrat leader charles kennedy discovered those colourful custodians of the tower of london , the beefeaters , are more than just tourist attractions .
mr kennedy was giving a tv interview near the tower when he was approached by one of the yeoman warders , to give them their real title , and told he was causing an obstruction and should " move along please " .
1200 gmt , tuesday 18 july oh dear , president bush appears to have started a trend with his " yo blair " remark .
check the microphone is off next time george the prime minister 's official spokesman opened this morning 's daily lobby briefing in his normal way with a cheery -lrb- ish -rrb- " good morning " before adding to much hilarity , " or as we now say , yo " .
it is , of course , these overheard remarks not intended for public consumption that so often end up attaching themselves forever to politicians .
remember john major and the " bastards " in his cabinet who he promised to " crucify " .
it was taken to suggest a lack of authority .
the question now is how his successor as prime minister finds his overheard conversation with the us president interpreted .
1200 gmt , monday 17 july after giving tory leader david cameron a cuddly new image as a bike riding chameleon , labour appears to have done it again .
a bit more free advertising click onto the official labour party website and the first thing that greets you is a large picture of the tory leader with , helpfully , his name in capital letters against a bright blue background .
only after a short downwards scroll do you come to the bit that adds : " breaks his epp promise " .
i 'm told conservative central office is far from furious at this " attack " suspecting that many voters will have no idea what the epp is .
" just another bit of free advertising for our man , " said one .
1200 gmt , thursday 13 july the once-infamous annie 's bar may have been shut down by the commons accountants , but the spirit lives on in the shape of the annie .
the annual westminster pool contest goes on this is the coveted trophy handed to the winner of the annual annie 's bar pool tournament , which has become one of the highlights of westminster 's social and sporting calendar .
the contest is still going ahead this year , with the support of mps across all parties and including sports minister himself , dick caborn .
but where will the contestants play the early stages of the contest before the grand final on the commons terrace bar in january ?
well , the pool table has been left in annie 's while the authorities work out what to do with the room they were so eager to get their hands on so mps and other contestants will have to play the early games in the old bar which has been stripped of all ornamentation and where they will no longer be able to get a drink .
that should concentrate their minds on the game .
1100 gmt , wednesday 12 july publicist max clifford has been involved in some of the juiciest scandals to have hit politics over recent years .
clifford teased an audience of journalists so when he addressed a lunch with political journalists we were eager to hear what he might have to say about current affairs .
there was plenty he would like to tell us in private , he said .
but , as his comments were on the record , he had to be more circumspect , he declared .
the tease .
however , he did whet appetites by saying : " who knows what might be happening in the not too distant future . "
i suspect he knows , for one .
0930 gmt , tuesday 11 july it looks like the world cup is going to be remembered for two specific events - a kick in the shorts and a butt in the chest .
the kick that marred the world cup and the way the entire contest unfolded has clearly brought labour 's glasgow mp david marshall to the end of the tether .
he has tabled a commons motion praising germany for the way it ran the games , but he then lets rip .
he says the competition will be remembered for " the cheating , complaining to referees , cynical professional fouls , diving , elbowing , feigning injury , lack of sportsmanship , shirt pulling , simulation and time wasting by too many grossly overpaid so-called superstar players who behaved more like spoilt brats and set a disgraceful example to millions of young fans " .
there 's more , he points out that " a record number of red and yellow cards were dished out by referees , some of whom appeared to be incompetent and short-sighted " .
and , turning on the football authorities , he adds " the discredited leadership of the president of fifa did not help " .
blimey .
perhaps i should have watched some of it after all .
1630 gmt , thursday 6 july this is what counts as wit in the house of commons .
what fun they had with pope 's name when labour mp greg pope was chairing the commons committee debating a church of england measure , tory wag sir patrick cormack brought the house down , apparently , by declaring : " this is a most historic day for the church of england because we are being presided over by a pope . "
and yes , mr pope is a catholic .
if you have recovered from that belter , here 's a better one concerning the same mp .
mr pope was the subject of a genuinely funny practical joke when he first entered parliament in 1997 and was allocated his named cloakroom peg .
his tag - pope , gregory - was removed , had the number 1 added to it and was replaced next to the that of democratic unionist , the rev ian paisley .

postal regulator postcomm has reported that some post boxes in buxton are being emptied as early as 9am .
royal mail said it collected the post early in some locations so it could meet its targets for next day delivery from more remote places .
mail posted mid-morning sometimes stays in the post box until the next day , postwatch north 's hilary putnam said .
" it makes it difficult for businesses or anybody who needs to deal with their mail urgently , " mrs putnam said . "
none of our rivals provide collections and deliveries nationwide to the uk 's 27m addresses or have the capability to do so " royal mail " in some places the last delivery time is getting later - so in some cases the last collection is before the last delivery . "
a royal mail statement said : " where we have to do an early collection from a particular box , we always aim to ensure that there 's a later collection made at a nearby box or post office branch .
" none of our rivals provide collections and deliveries nationwide to the uk 's 27m addresses or have the capability to do so . "
helena stubbs from derbyshire 's rural community council , said : " it is quite incredible .
people living in isolated areas should not be disadvantaged because they are living in remote parts of the countryside . "
the postcomm research is part of a consultation to see whether royal mail is collecting and delivering letters and parcels at times that suit customers .
under royal mail 's " universal service obligation " , letters and parcels must be collected at least once a day from every post box and delivered once a day to every home and business .
