retirement will be staggered for those born in the 10 years in between .
an exception to retirement at 67 will also be made for anyone who paid into the security system for 45 years or more . meanwhile , the social security court in kassel ruled to raise pensioners ' long-term care insurance contributions , with both measures triggering claims from the vdk social organization that senior citizens are becoming impoverished . " the barest of insurance " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those born before 1954 fall under the old rules " the government has pushed the retirement age up to 67 as another way of cutting pensions , said vdk president walter hirrlinger . " the pension is being reduced to the barest of insurance , " he said , stressing that the move would have negative repercussions for the younger generation in years to come . in fact , according to the federal statistics office , pensioners are better off than ever with only 2.7 percent of social welfare recipients older than 65 . but hirrlinger also pointed out that raising the retirement age is pointless when over 50 percent of employers will not hire workers over 50 . " politicians are getting ahead of themselves , " he said .
" what they need to do first is make sure that the elderly who can and do work are actually allowed to continue to do so until the age of 65 .
once this has been established , they can start thinking about raising the retirement age . " age discrimination bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's pension system is coming unstuck as it happens , the government has already begun addressing the problem of age discrimination . wednesday also saw labor minister franz müntefering unveil his " initiative 50 + . " the scheme is designed to boost employment options for the elderly and includes the introduction of state subsidies for further training and financial rewards for anyone who takes a job paid less than the would receive in unemployment benefits .
employers , meanwhile , will receive a bonus for hiring staff over 50 for at least one year . " intelligent , far-sighted companies have already realized that a cross-section of generations is a recipe for successful , " müntefering said at the project 's launch , pointing out that business needs the expertise of the elder generation , especially given the current shortage of qualified workers apparent in certain sectors . the minister said he hoped the initiative would result in jobs for 100,000 people . " only 45 percent of over-55s are still working , " he said .

the leaders broached sensitive topics such as kosovo and war criminals currently still at large . chancellor angela merkel met friday with serbian president boris tadic as part of a series of discussions with foreign leaders ahead of germany 's eu presidency starting in january . merkel said before the start of the meeting that she planned to raise the issue of kosovo , a province in southern serbia which has been under united nations administration since 1999 . a decision is due next year on whether the predominantly albanian-populated province should be given some form of independence - a step which serbia strongly opposes .
kosovo albanians , who make up 90 percent of the small province 's population , are demanding independence while serbia is only prepared to grant them autonomy . merkel told tadic that germany was interested in having close relations with serbia and was prepared to help bring it more in line with mainstream europe . war criminal prosecutions required bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the search for war criminals goes on a condition for this was that belgrade " cooperated well " with the international criminal tribunal for former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- in the hague that was prosecuting war crimes in the former yugoslavia , she said . tadic , a member of the pro-western opposition democratic party , said germany was " the key partner " for serbia in europe .
germany is a member of the contact group of foreign powers that has been overseeing peace in the breakaway serbian province of kosovo since the 1998-1999 conflict . the president also thanked merkel for her support at this week 's nato summit in latvia , which offered serbia and its western balkan neighbors bosnia and montenegro a " partnership for peace " -lrb- pfp -rrb- agreement with the alliance . delayed decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian voters backed the new constitution in a referendum tadic 's visit to germany comes at a particularly sensitive moment for his country . the un 's kosovo mediator martti ahtisaari recently decided not to announce his plans for the future of the southern serbian province until after the elections , which tadic had called for jan .
21 . the province has been run by a un mission since 1999 , when a nato bombing campaign ended a crackdown by belgrade on ethnic albanians in kosovo . the serbian parliament recently passed a new constitution - backed by voters in a referendum - that defined the province as an " integral " part of serbia .
but a final un proposal is widely expected to grant kosovo sovereignty . a small step towards the eu membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian president tadic was happy with nato responding to the " partnership for peace " agreement , which nato leaders , grouped at a summit in the latvian capital riga , offered to serbia on wednesday , the serbian president said in a statement that long reforms had paid off . " it is excellent news for our citizens , the army and state , " tadic said . tadic admitted that serbia still must arrest fugitive war crime suspects and bring them to justice at the icty . serbia 's failure to arrest the suspects , most of all the bosnian serb general ratko mladic , prompted brussels in may to suspend talks aimed at bringing belgrade closer to eu membership . icty head prosecutor carla del ponte , who has been pressing the west to isolate serbia over war crime fugitives , was disappointed with the decision in riga , her spokesman said in the hague . dw staff / afp , dpa -lrb- tt / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de serbia : getting the media on the right track since 2000 , the eu has poured millions of euros into various media projects in serbia .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 30.11.2006 " jihadism is a greater problem today than it was in 2001 " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police foiled a planned attack on trains in august islamic studies scholar guido steinberg spoke to dw-world.de about the likelihood of a terrorist attack in germany and the need to separate the issue of integration from the fight against terrorism . guido steinberg is an islamic studies scholar and a researcher at the german institute for international and security affairs , in berlin . dw-world.de : several terror attacks were prevented in germany in 2006 .
is germany becoming a greater target for islamist terrorism ? guido steinberg : german security officials are convinced that germany is continually becoming a greater target for islamist terrorists .
and there are indeed indications that that 's the case .
the most important one was the failed attack on two regional trains in north rhine-westphalia in summer 2006 .
it failed because the two bombs packed in suitcases did n't detonate . unfortunately little more is known about the background than that two lebanese men from tripoli and its surrounding were responsible for the deed .
above all , it is unclear to what extent a larger terror organization was behind the two men .
without this information , it 's very difficult to judge to what extent germany is becoming a target .
however , it appears we have to reckon with increased terrorist activities here . what effects could that have on the debate over the responsibility of muslims in germany toward the greater society ?
bildunterschrift : guido steinberg the news of attack plans has already had an effect on the debate about the role of muslims here .
more and more germans view the presence of muslims in germany as a security risk .
thus the debate about the integration of immigrants is in danger of being laden with aspects of fighting terrorism .
this could lead to a stronger polarization , which would damage the long-term aim of the integration of foreigners .
in my opinion , the integration debate and the discussion about fighting terrorism should be strictly separated . the fact that terrorist attacks were prevented in the initial planning stages is a huge success for german security officials .
can terrorism be fought with police resources alone ? the plans for an attack on an airplane were discovered in such an early stage that i believe it 's not even certain the suspects were actually in the planning stage .
in this respect , i 'm not sure whether it actually is a case of success for security officials .
however , this example shows once more that the security officials are closely monitoring at least parts of the militant scene . on the other hand , the case of the suitcase bombers shows that attacks often ca n't be prevented no matter how effectively security officials work .
of course , the resources police and intelligence officials have are inadequate .
fighting terrorism is also - if not primarily - a political task .
one must win over the sympathizers of terrorist groups through political measures .
only in such a way can one prevent terrorist groups from continually recruiting members , financing themselves and operating under the protection of their supporters . many experts hold the ambiguous " jihad " responsible for terrorism .
what 's your assessment of jihad as a mobilizing force ? there is no actual " jihad " but rather various interpretations of it .
jihadists are characterized by having chosen a jihadist concept that centers on armed battle against " non-believers . "
they view everyone who rejects their ideology as non-believers , whether they 're muslims , christians or jews .
muslims are indeed much more often their victims than non-muslims .
this ideology 's ability to mobilize is very strong as has repeatedly been shown by the throngs joining jihadist organizations in recent years , not least here in europe .
jihadism is a greater problem today than it was in 2001 . are the potential terrorists the usual jihadists ?
how would you describe them ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dialog could help to ease tensions there is no such thing as a generic profile of an islamic terrorist .
students and petty criminals are among them , new immigrants and people born here in europe .
in many cases , however , a certain characteristic can be detected , namely " blocked upward mobility . "
young men reach limitations at some point in their history .
for example , they go to university , but still do n't get the job they want .
they immigrate to europe , but are forced to make their way as petty criminals .
individual failure then frequently turns into an aggressive , radical attitude toward society .
then the young men are receptive to militant ideologies . the dialog with muslims is lauded by many but criticized as well .
can a competent dialog serve to prevent islamist terrorism ? a dialog between muslims and greater society can certainly put tensions to rest .
in a process of dialog the government could make clear what it expects of muslims .
muslims , on the other hand , could express their complaints .
my opinion is that germany can certainly take decisive steps against terrorists if it tries at the same time to take measures against the partly accurate impressions of many muslims of being discriminated against here .
to put it shortly : no tolerance in security issues , more openness in religious , cultural areas .
general bans on head scarves or the ban on ritual slaughtering -lrb- of animals -rrb- , for example , could be revoked to make it clear that it is not the west battling islam , but that it is rather exclusively a fight against violent islamists .
such measures could be agreed on in a dialog . aladdin sarhan interviewed guido steinberg -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de terrorists planned plane bombing in germany german prosecutors have launched an investigation into a group that is thought to have started planning a terrorist attack on a german passenger plane last summer .

but she warned that measures such as video surveillance were n't enough .

is grinch planning to steal christmas again ? it 's started again : the annual euphoria which converts parts of the german capital into a teutonic version of a us shopping mall .
customers are beginning to be lured into a commercial winter paradise in which countless mugs of despair-dampening mulled wine , consumed against the headache-guaranteeing cacophony of jingle bells and white christmas , can easily drive many a parent to the brink of insanity .
at least , it comes only once a year . berlin 's newly built central train station has erected a 20-meter -lrb- 65-foot -rrb- monster tree with more than 28,000 branches and around 40,000 christmas crystal ornaments , the most expensive tree berlin has ever seen .
but something is rotten in christmas land .
berlin 's santa clauses are , apparently , getting lazy . " heinzelmännchen " -lrb- santa 's little helpers -rrb- - a berlin-based student organization that specializes in finding employment for santa clauses and christmas angels - said that one month before christmas , they have only received 100 father christmas applications . " i 'm worried because we need young talent , " said project manager rene heydeck .
" we need 300 applicants more to cover some 4,500 jobs that we 're likely to have this year . " but what kind of angels ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's new popstar angels perhaps , germany is looking for a different kind of magic this winter .
the wildly popular german singing contest popstars , which over the past few years has produced one successful group -lrb- " no angels " -rrb- and a most diverse series of flops , was running this year under the motto " the country needs new angels . " and by angels , the producers certainly did n't have christmas in mind .
and if they did , then it 's because they , too , wanted to take advantage of the lucrative christmas market .
senna , bahar and mandy - the three girls who recently made it to the band called monrose - will have their first single released on dec .
1 . as it turns out , the christmas labor market is no less flourishing in the headquarters of berlin 's santa clause central . " last year , i had 70 santa clauses working for me , " said berlin 's senior father christmas , frank knorre , whose business card proudly declares that he has been a santa since 1980 .
" now i have assembled only one half of them .
i 'm taking candidates ranging from school kids to pensioners , if they fit . " what do santas really want ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one more mug , and i 'll be fine is it possible that santa clauses are getting tired of the whole holiday hullabaloo ?
do they really prefer to do what most germans do - eat more than they should and realize , at some point , that they have mulled wine coming out of their ears ? or are they hoping for something particularly wild this year - getting busted by the police for running around wearing nothing but christmas lights ?
or taking mrs. clause , for once , to the long-promised , topless caribbean vacation ? whatever it is , we can only hope that santa clauses will come to their senses , suppress their personal desires , forget about their secret fantasies , and remember that they 're there for children 's sake . not to mention that they can still make a buck or two .
renting a santa clause for a 20-minute visit to a family of up to children in berlin costs between 27 and 29 euros -lrb- $ 35 - $ 38 -rrb- . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " germany is certainly facing serious problems , but it 's also important not to forget to laugh once in a while .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 30.11.2006 " jihadism is a greater problem today than it was in 2001 " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police foiled a planned attack on trains in august islamic studies scholar guido steinberg spoke to dw-world.de about the likelihood of a terrorist attack in germany and the need to separate the issue of integration from the fight against terrorism . guido steinberg is an islamic studies scholar and a researcher at the german institute for international and security affairs , in berlin . dw-world.de : several terror attacks were prevented in germany in 2006 .
is germany becoming a greater target for islamist terrorism ? guido steinberg : german security officials are convinced that germany is continually becoming a greater target for islamist terrorists .
and there are indeed indications that that 's the case .
the most important one was the failed attack on two regional trains in north rhine-westphalia in summer 2006 .
it failed because the two bombs packed in suitcases did n't detonate . unfortunately little more is known about the background than that two lebanese men from tripoli and its surrounding were responsible for the deed .
above all , it is unclear to what extent a larger terror organization was behind the two men .
without this information , it 's very difficult to judge to what extent germany is becoming a target .
however , it appears we have to reckon with increased terrorist activities here . what effects could that have on the debate over the responsibility of muslims in germany toward the greater society ?
bildunterschrift : guido steinberg the news of attack plans has already had an effect on the debate about the role of muslims here .
more and more germans view the presence of muslims in germany as a security risk .
thus the debate about the integration of immigrants is in danger of being laden with aspects of fighting terrorism .
this could lead to a stronger polarization , which would damage the long-term aim of the integration of foreigners .
in my opinion , the integration debate and the discussion about fighting terrorism should be strictly separated . the fact that terrorist attacks were prevented in the initial planning stages is a huge success for german security officials .
can terrorism be fought with police resources alone ? the plans for an attack on an airplane were discovered in such an early stage that i believe it 's not even certain the suspects were actually in the planning stage .
in this respect , i 'm not sure whether it actually is a case of success for security officials .
however , this example shows once more that the security officials are closely monitoring at least parts of the militant scene . on the other hand , the case of the suitcase bombers shows that attacks often ca n't be prevented no matter how effectively security officials work .
of course , the resources police and intelligence officials have are inadequate .
fighting terrorism is also - if not primarily - a political task .
one must win over the sympathizers of terrorist groups through political measures .
only in such a way can one prevent terrorist groups from continually recruiting members , financing themselves and operating under the protection of their supporters . many experts hold the ambiguous " jihad " responsible for terrorism .
what 's your assessment of jihad as a mobilizing force ? there is no actual " jihad " but rather various interpretations of it .
jihadists are characterized by having chosen a jihadist concept that centers on armed battle against " non-believers . "
they view everyone who rejects their ideology as non-believers , whether they 're muslims , christians or jews .
muslims are indeed much more often their victims than non-muslims .
this ideology 's ability to mobilize is very strong as has repeatedly been shown by the throngs joining jihadist organizations in recent years , not least here in europe .
jihadism is a greater problem today than it was in 2001 . are the potential terrorists the usual jihadists ?
how would you describe them ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dialog could help to ease tensions there is no such thing as a generic profile of an islamic terrorist .
students and petty criminals are among them , new immigrants and people born here in europe .
in many cases , however , a certain characteristic can be detected , namely " blocked upward mobility . "
young men reach limitations at some point in their history .
for example , they go to university , but still do n't get the job they want .
they immigrate to europe , but are forced to make their way as petty criminals .
individual failure then frequently turns into an aggressive , radical attitude toward society .
then the young men are receptive to militant ideologies . the dialog with muslims is lauded by many but criticized as well .
can a competent dialog serve to prevent islamist terrorism ? a dialog between muslims and greater society can certainly put tensions to rest .
in a process of dialog the government could make clear what it expects of muslims .
muslims , on the other hand , could express their complaints .
my opinion is that germany can certainly take decisive steps against terrorists if it tries at the same time to take measures against the partly accurate impressions of many muslims of being discriminated against here .
to put it shortly : no tolerance in security issues , more openness in religious , cultural areas .
general bans on head scarves or the ban on ritual slaughtering -lrb- of animals -rrb- , for example , could be revoked to make it clear that it is not the west battling islam , but that it is rather exclusively a fight against violent islamists .
such measures could be agreed on in a dialog . aladdin sarhan interviewed guido steinberg -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de terrorists planned plane bombing in germany german prosecutors have launched an investigation into a group that is thought to have started planning a terrorist attack on a german passenger plane last summer .

if the negotiations between hamas and fatah could restart and the power struggle be resolved then this would be a great asset to bring to the table in discussions with israel , steinmeier added . palestinian president mahmud abbas said on thursday that talks between the warring factions had reached an impasse .
steinmeier was due to meet with abbas later on friday . steinmeier also reiterated the need for syria to be involved in any middle east peace discussions , noting that while damascus seemed reticent on the subject , it was obvious to all involved that stability in the region depended in no small part to syria 's involvement .

" and i believe that we need syria if we are going to create a lasting solution . " steinmeier ready to talk with syria steinmeier plans to visit the syrian capital on monday but has no official appointment at this time .

" our goal remains to convince syria to play a constructive role in the middle east , both in terms of the conflict between israelis and palestinians and in particular lebanon , " he said . " i would like to stress in this context that syria must know that our support for an independent and sovereign lebanon is a key component of our middle east policy . " germany reiterates support for lebanese government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german fm will meet with the lebanese pm while in jordan , steinmeier also took the opportunity himself to reiterate germany 's support for the lebanese government of prime minister fuad siniora at a time when pro-syrian forces and hezbollah activists are allegedly stirring up unrest in a bid to destabilize the current administration . steinmeier will meet siniora and parliamentary speaker nabih berri on saturday and will also pay a visit to german troops leading the naval component of the un force in lebanon .

experts fear germany could face a shortage of qualified university graduates if the trend continues . according to the latest figures from the federal statistics office , the number of new students enrolling at university has dropped for the third year running , despite the rise in the number of school leavers graduating with a high school diploma . german universities registered 343,700 new students this year , 3.5 percent fewer than last year . as german research and education minister annette schavan pointed out in response to the survey , the development is particularly worrying given germany 's need for academics and the overall brain drain of recent years . the biggest declines come in the fields of engineering , technology and computer studies .
over all , the number of school-leavers opting for further education at universities and colleges in 2006 fell to 35.5 percent - short of the german government 's target of 40 percent . what 's behind the drop ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : too many courses are hard to get into the report cites several reasons for the decline .
one sticking point is that german states have tightened up entry requirements , and another is that many courses are available to a limited number of students .
first and foremost , however , is the fact that new students are being deterred by the introduction of higher education fees . " this is a slap in the face for the government , " achim meyer auf der heyde of the german students association told berlin 's daily taz , adding that education politicians should ask themselves whether the introduction of university fees and reduced students grants has sent the " wrong signals . " across the country , many students are simply refusing to pay up .
the action group against student fees hopes to have recruited some 400,000 students over the next 12 months , and many have the support of the universities themselves . but schavan told the handelsblatt newspaper on thursday that the introduction of fees was not behind the overall drop in students choosing to attend university as increasing numbers of students are enrolling in bavaria and hamburg 's universities despite students fee in place there . regional differences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students protested against the introduction of tuition fees the federal statistics office also pointed out that differences in enrollment numbers vary according from state to state .
saxony has 13 percent fewer new students , while baden württemberg and north rhine westphalia saw a drop of 10 percent . in eastern germany , many fear the current development is just the thin end of the wedge and that students are dying breed . " universities in eastern germany need to become better-known and more attractive , " said dieter dohmen , director of the berlin research institute for education and social economics .
" they especially need to attract more women . " women make up 49 percent of students in this part of the country compared to almost 60 percent in western germany , he said . optimism among graduates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students said they feel good about the future another study published this month revealed that german students are optimistic about the future , with 60 percent saying they are confident they will get a job . published by the center of human resources information systems , it questioned over 11,000 people about their employment prospects and established that graduates , especially those with degrees in economics and engineering , feel more upbeat about their professional lives than others . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german education an export hit in the arab world while germans continue to bemoan their educational system , german higher education is being successfully exported to the arab world .

experts fear germany could face a shortage of qualified university graduates if the trend continues . according to the latest figures from the federal statistics office , the number of new students enrolling at university has dropped for the third year running , despite the rise in the number of school leavers graduating with a high school diploma . german universities registered 343,700 new students this year , 3.5 percent fewer than last year . as german research and education minister annette schavan pointed out in response to the survey , the development is particularly worrying given germany 's need for academics and the overall brain drain of recent years . the biggest declines come in the fields of engineering , technology and computer studies .
over all , the number of school-leavers opting for further education at universities and colleges in 2006 fell to 35.5 percent - short of the german government 's target of 40 percent . what 's behind the drop ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : too many courses are hard to get into the report cites several reasons for the decline .
one sticking point is that german states have tightened up entry requirements , and another is that many courses are available to a limited number of students .
first and foremost , however , is the fact that new students are being deterred by the introduction of higher education fees . " this is a slap in the face for the government , " achim meyer auf der heyde of the german students association told berlin 's daily taz , adding that education politicians should ask themselves whether the introduction of university fees and reduced students grants has sent the " wrong signals . " across the country , many students are simply refusing to pay up .

" in the face of this reality , we are called , together with all other christian communities , to renew europe 's awareness of its christian roots , traditions and values , giving them new vitality , " he said . his statement came just two days after he reportedly told turkey 's islamist-turned-conservative prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , in what was widely seen as a spectacular u-turn , that he supported turkey 's membership in the european union . turkey in the eu , he had said while still joseph cardinal ratzinger , would be " a grave error ... against the tide of history . " religious freedom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope attended the divine liturgy at istanbul 's st. george 's church in a later joint declaration with bartholomew i , at the risk of once again rubbing up his hosts the wrong way , the pontiff said respect for religious freedom must be a criterion for membership in the eu , which must ensure that its members respect the rights of their religious minorities . it was near-overt backing for the patriarchate 's complaints of restrictions imposed on it by turkey , including the closure of a theological seminary and the confiscation of a number of properties from christian foundations . another bone of contention is turkey 's refusal to recognize bartholomew i as the ecumenical , or universal , leader of about 150 million orthodox faithful around the world . turkey repeated on thursday it has no intention of budging on this issue . " we see the patriarchate as a turkish institution and this is how our laws , too , see it , " said foreign ministry spokesman namik tan .
" other definitions are in no way binding for us .
we have proclaimed to the world that we do not recognize the title ' ecumenical . " ' overcoming the schism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi -lrb- left -rrb- called divisions among christians a " scandal to the world " benedict xvi and bartholomew i have both put reconciliation of the catholic and orthodox churches high on their agendas , and the pope described the schism , which dates back to 1054 , as a " scandal to the world . " but he remained steadfast on a key point of contention between the two rites - papal authority - by referring in his speech to the catholic leader 's " universal responsibility . " gestures of reconciliation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : originally a church , then a mosque , now a museum : hagia sophia in istanbul on thursday evening , benedict xvi became the second pope in history to set foot in a mosque - after john paul ii in damascus in 2001 - when he visited istanbul 's famed blue mosque , coming from the nearby 6th century basilica-museum of hagia sophia . the hagia sophia visit has angered muslim hardliners , who perceive the visit as proof of an effort to reclaim the building - a mosque under ottoman rule before becoming a museum under the republic - as a church . but during his visit to the blue mosque , the pope turned towards mecca in a gesture of muslim prayer , his hands crossed over his stomach , at the suggestion of the muslim cleric accompanying him .

the leaders broached sensitive topics such as kosovo and war criminals currently still at large . chancellor angela merkel met friday with serbian president boris tadic as part of a series of discussions with foreign leaders ahead of germany 's eu presidency starting in january . merkel said before the start of the meeting that she planned to raise the issue of kosovo , a province in southern serbia which has been under united nations administration since 1999 . a decision is due next year on whether the predominantly albanian-populated province should be given some form of independence - a step which serbia strongly opposes .
kosovo albanians , who make up 90 percent of the small province 's population , are demanding independence while serbia is only prepared to grant them autonomy . merkel told tadic that germany was interested in having close relations with serbia and was prepared to help bring it more in line with mainstream europe . war criminal prosecutions required bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the search for war criminals goes on a condition for this was that belgrade " cooperated well " with the international criminal tribunal for former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- in the hague that was prosecuting war crimes in the former yugoslavia , she said . tadic , a member of the pro-western opposition democratic party , said germany was " the key partner " for serbia in europe .
germany is a member of the contact group of foreign powers that has been overseeing peace in the breakaway serbian province of kosovo since the 1998-1999 conflict . the president also thanked merkel for her support at this week 's nato summit in latvia , which offered serbia and its western balkan neighbors bosnia and montenegro a " partnership for peace " -lrb- pfp -rrb- agreement with the alliance . delayed decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian voters backed the new constitution in a referendum tadic 's visit to germany comes at a particularly sensitive moment for his country . the un 's kosovo mediator martti ahtisaari recently decided not to announce his plans for the future of the southern serbian province until after the elections , which tadic had called for jan .
21 . the province has been run by a un mission since 1999 , when a nato bombing campaign ended a crackdown by belgrade on ethnic albanians in kosovo . the serbian parliament recently passed a new constitution - backed by voters in a referendum - that defined the province as an " integral " part of serbia .
but a final un proposal is widely expected to grant kosovo sovereignty . a small step towards the eu membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian president tadic was happy with nato responding to the " partnership for peace " agreement , which nato leaders , grouped at a summit in the latvian capital riga , offered to serbia on wednesday , the serbian president said in a statement that long reforms had paid off . " it is excellent news for our citizens , the army and state , " tadic said . tadic admitted that serbia still must arrest fugitive war crime suspects and bring them to justice at the icty . serbia 's failure to arrest the suspects , most of all the bosnian serb general ratko mladic , prompted brussels in may to suspend talks aimed at bringing belgrade closer to eu membership . icty head prosecutor carla del ponte , who has been pressing the west to isolate serbia over war crime fugitives , was disappointed with the decision in riga , her spokesman said in the hague . dw staff / afp , dpa -lrb- tt / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de serbia : getting the media on the right track since 2000 , the eu has poured millions of euros into various media projects in serbia .

dw 's stefanie duckstein says it ended too soon . mission completed , mission successful ?
defense minister franz josef jung gives the impression that he 'd like to quickly put the whole operation behind him .
like a mantra - unmistakably and repeatedly - he has asserted that extending the mandate is out of the question . the punctual pullout recalls the tough route to deciding on the mission in the first place .
as the election date in the democratic republic of congo drew ever closer , all germany 's leading politicians were in agreement that a peaceful dr congo could be a stabilizing factor for the entire region .
but sending a bundeswehr deployment to safeguard elections in the framework of the european union ?
then the tenor of the discussion became more restrained . it took many more months of debate before the german government finally did agree : 780 german soldiers were sent to dr congo and gabun .
germany 's condition for participation was that its soldiers would only be deployed in the capital , kinshasa .
pacification of the country 's restive eastern provinces was incumbent upon the united nations mission monuc .
and a large portion of the soldiers deployed were stationed outside dr congo , in gabun . was the bundeswehr 's participation in the mission of a purely symbolic nature ?
certainly not .
the congolese have lauded the german troops ' sober-mindedness and diplomacy .
violent unrest in kinshasa that left 23 dead was quickly allayed due above all to two factors : diplomatic pressure and intervention on the part of eu and un soldiers . but the momentary calm in dr congo is specious .
challenger jean-pierre bemba contested his electoral defeat and lost in court .
previously there had been gun battles between supporters of the opposing camps in kinshasa .
and in eastern dr congo on monday , un soldiers had used helicopters to block a rebel advance .
thousands of people fled from the violence , which bundeswehr representatives described as an incidental flare-up . in the meantime , bemba has accepted his defeat and resigned himself to a role in the opposition .
a powerful rebel group in the country 's restive east has just announced they would lay down their weapons .
and the fact that the elections proceeded relatively peacefully and fairly is also a positive signal . still , it does n't ensure dr congo a peaceful , democratic future .
the people are still the same .
surely , they must be able to keep their country running - especially politicians who should serve as a good example for everyone . it would have been good for dr congo if the eu soldiers ' mission had had a somewhat longer wind .
eufor has formally fulfilled its job .
but dr congo 's government will only be formed in mid-december .
it would have been important to accompany the inauguration of the new president in africa 's third-largest state .
but the mandate was not meant for that , according to the bundeswehr 's spokesman .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . i hope pope benedict 's visit turns out to be safe and satisfying for both sides in terms of the messages given for improved dialogue , understanding and support .
i expect that such a visit should set an example in bringing these cultures closer together , increasing mutual familiarity , decreasing fear and distrust .
both the western world , especially the us and the eu , and the eastern world , especially the extremist islamist groups , should closely follow this example and consider more moderation in their policies . - ege yildirim , turkish student in new york i think that -lrb- the pope -rrb- will move the roman catholic church closer to the orthodox church .
he is tactful , respectful , humble , and knowledgeable , and that is appreciated .
as for the muslims , no one can mend fences if there is no willingness for dialogue .
i feel that if the press judges the pope based on what he will accomplish in that matter , he will be misjudged .
everything one can do in some situations is to defend the truth . - elisabeth heptner , usa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's pm erdogan met briefly with the pope , though the visit was supposedly not political the pontiff 's visit has extreme ramifications for all organized religions around the world .
there needs to be more dialog , compassion , and understanding if religion is to survive .
the common thread between all the devotions is the communication and ability of the religious forces to help keep peace in the world .
it is within this universal compromise that all religious thought is correct and there is no one way to believe in the power of the universe , however you define it .
this attempt by the pope is noble and important .
i believe many feel this way , but there are those who do not .
we pray for them and perhaps they will see the light . - j. greenspan i am a german and a muslim .
the utterances of the pope did not disturb me , as he cited history .
the catholic church is anti-everything -lrb- except for their wrongdoings against choir-boys -rrb- .
on the other hand we muslims have to respect that we are all children of the same yahweh / god / allah and that includes the jews , who are by heritance the direct brothers of the arabs . - harm g. frey the raging crowds in turkey are angry and it 's their own fault .
they are the hateful ones and the intolerant ones .
there can be no dialogue until the angry crowds cool off and realize that they are wrong , not the pope . - f rank garlo by their very actions turkish muslims confirm that the papal quotes from a 14th century figure apply just as much to their culture today .
hopefully relations with orthodox christians will continue to improve .
i can see no animosity between orthodox and catholic christians at an individual level .
that happy state of affairs needs to be " ratified " by the religious institutions concerned .
i think we should all pray for the pope 's safety . - george j. berkowski bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dialog with the orthodox christians was a major reason for the trip when turks and turkish media meet this man they will begin to listen - not like the last time , when they went off crackers because they did not understand the nature of exploratory theological reminiscences .
their reaction was extremely disappointing and fed the voracious western media , whose take then bled into those within the muslim world who still see no option but to be hostile to any christian initiative .
the closed muslim mind is almost a greater threat to a world coalition of culture , religious values and - ultimately - economic interests .
the west awaits a muslim renaissance , which will take nothing from its integrity but merely express its participation in the human story .
perceived threats of a world dominated by us financial interests will be allayed with a joint financial venture between the enormous wealth of the oil-rich middle east and the west . in my country , australia , we have a noble history of reconciliation with the turkish people whose land our heroic military forces invaded at gallipoli in 1915 .
ataturk himself said in effect that the mothers of the australian dead need not mourn because the turkish people would honour the australian soldiers who lay on their land : they would harbour them .

pope benedict xvi on thursday put the brakes on his charm offensive in eu-hopeful , muslim majority turkey , stressing europe 's " christian roots " and taking a strong stand on religious freedoms and minority rights . flanked by ecumenical patriarch bartholomew i after mass at the patriarchal church of st. george , the pontiff complained in a speech that " the process of secularization has weakened the hold of ...
-lrb- christian -rrb- tradition " in europe . " in the face of this reality , we are called , together with all other christian communities , to renew europe 's awareness of its christian roots , traditions and values , giving them new vitality , " he said . his statement came just two days after he reportedly told turkey 's islamist-turned-conservative prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , in what was widely seen as a spectacular u-turn , that he supported turkey 's membership in the european union . turkey in the eu , he had said while still joseph cardinal ratzinger , would be " a grave error ... against the tide of history . " religious freedom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope attended the divine liturgy at istanbul 's st. george 's church in a later joint declaration with bartholomew i , at the risk of once again rubbing up his hosts the wrong way , the pontiff said respect for religious freedom must be a criterion for membership in the eu , which must ensure that its members respect the rights of their religious minorities . it was near-overt backing for the patriarchate 's complaints of restrictions imposed on it by turkey , including the closure of a theological seminary and the confiscation of a number of properties from christian foundations . another bone of contention is turkey 's refusal to recognize bartholomew i as the ecumenical , or universal , leader of about 150 million orthodox faithful around the world . turkey repeated on thursday it has no intention of budging on this issue . " we see the patriarchate as a turkish institution and this is how our laws , too , see it , " said foreign ministry spokesman namik tan .
" other definitions are in no way binding for us .
we have proclaimed to the world that we do not recognize the title ' ecumenical . " ' overcoming the schism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi -lrb- left -rrb- called divisions among christians a " scandal to the world " benedict xvi and bartholomew i have both put reconciliation of the catholic and orthodox churches high on their agendas , and the pope described the schism , which dates back to 1054 , as a " scandal to the world . " but he remained steadfast on a key point of contention between the two rites - papal authority - by referring in his speech to the catholic leader 's " universal responsibility . " gestures of reconciliation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : originally a church , then a mosque , now a museum : hagia sophia in istanbul on thursday evening , benedict xvi became the second pope in history to set foot in a mosque - after john paul ii in damascus in 2001 - when he visited istanbul 's famed blue mosque , coming from the nearby 6th century basilica-museum of hagia sophia . the hagia sophia visit has angered muslim hardliners , who perceive the visit as proof of an effort to reclaim the building - a mosque under ottoman rule before becoming a museum under the republic - as a church . but during his visit to the blue mosque , the pope turned towards mecca in a gesture of muslim prayer , his hands crossed over his stomach , at the suggestion of the muslim cleric accompanying him .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : christmas in germany americans taking bigger bite of german christmas fare berliners celebrate new shopping hours saint nicholas : the bearded legend germany 's christmas markets : all that is filling and festive from the fringe -pipe- 30.11.2006 berlin begging for more santas großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scenes like this one are something the german capital can only dream of this year germany 's unemployment rates are falling , but the german capital is experiencing a serious shortage of santa clauses this year .
is grinch planning to steal christmas again ? it 's started again : the annual euphoria which converts parts of the german capital into a teutonic version of a us shopping mall .
customers are beginning to be lured into a commercial winter paradise in which countless mugs of despair-dampening mulled wine , consumed against the headache-guaranteeing cacophony of jingle bells and white christmas , can easily drive many a parent to the brink of insanity .
at least , it comes only once a year . berlin 's newly built central train station has erected a 20-meter -lrb- 65-foot -rrb- monster tree with more than 28,000 branches and around 40,000 christmas crystal ornaments , the most expensive tree berlin has ever seen .
but something is rotten in christmas land .
berlin 's santa clauses are , apparently , getting lazy . " heinzelmännchen " -lrb- santa 's little helpers -rrb- - a berlin-based student organization that specializes in finding employment for santa clauses and christmas angels - said that one month before christmas , they have only received 100 father christmas applications . " i 'm worried because we need young talent , " said project manager rene heydeck .
" we need 300 applicants more to cover some 4,500 jobs that we 're likely to have this year . " but what kind of angels ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's new popstar angels perhaps , germany is looking for a different kind of magic this winter .
the wildly popular german singing contest popstars , which over the past few years has produced one successful group -lrb- " no angels " -rrb- and a most diverse series of flops , was running this year under the motto " the country needs new angels . " and by angels , the producers certainly did n't have christmas in mind .
and if they did , then it 's because they , too , wanted to take advantage of the lucrative christmas market .
senna , bahar and mandy - the three girls who recently made it to the band called monrose - will have their first single released on dec .
1 . as it turns out , the christmas labor market is no less flourishing in the headquarters of berlin 's santa clause central . " last year , i had 70 santa clauses working for me , " said berlin 's senior father christmas , frank knorre , whose business card proudly declares that he has been a santa since 1980 .
" now i have assembled only one half of them .
i 'm taking candidates ranging from school kids to pensioners , if they fit . " what do santas really want ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one more mug , and i 'll be fine is it possible that santa clauses are getting tired of the whole holiday hullabaloo ?

retirement will be staggered for those born in the 10 years in between .
an exception to retirement at 67 will also be made for anyone who paid into the security system for 45 years or more . meanwhile , the social security court in kassel ruled to raise pensioners ' long-term care insurance contributions , with both measures triggering claims from the vdk social organization that senior citizens are becoming impoverished . " the barest of insurance " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those born before 1954 fall under the old rules " the government has pushed the retirement age up to 67 as another way of cutting pensions , said vdk president walter hirrlinger . " the pension is being reduced to the barest of insurance , " he said , stressing that the move would have negative repercussions for the younger generation in years to come . in fact , according to the federal statistics office , pensioners are better off than ever with only 2.7 percent of social welfare recipients older than 65 . but hirrlinger also pointed out that raising the retirement age is pointless when over 50 percent of employers will not hire workers over 50 . " politicians are getting ahead of themselves , " he said .
" what they need to do first is make sure that the elderly who can and do work are actually allowed to continue to do so until the age of 65 .
once this has been established , they can start thinking about raising the retirement age . " age discrimination bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's pension system is coming unstuck as it happens , the government has already begun addressing the problem of age discrimination . wednesday also saw labor minister franz müntefering unveil his " initiative 50 + . " the scheme is designed to boost employment options for the elderly and includes the introduction of state subsidies for further training and financial rewards for anyone who takes a job paid less than the would receive in unemployment benefits .
employers , meanwhile , will receive a bonus for hiring staff over 50 for at least one year . " intelligent , far-sighted companies have already realized that a cross-section of generations is a recipe for successful , " müntefering said at the project 's launch , pointing out that business needs the expertise of the elder generation , especially given the current shortage of qualified workers apparent in certain sectors . the minister said he hoped the initiative would result in jobs for 100,000 people . " only 45 percent of over-55s are still working , " he said .

the leaders broached sensitive topics such as kosovo and war criminals currently still at large . chancellor angela merkel met friday with serbian president boris tadic as part of a series of discussions with foreign leaders ahead of germany 's eu presidency starting in january . merkel said before the start of the meeting that she planned to raise the issue of kosovo , a province in southern serbia which has been under united nations administration since 1999 . a decision is due next year on whether the predominantly albanian-populated province should be given some form of independence - a step which serbia strongly opposes .
kosovo albanians , who make up 90 percent of the small province 's population , are demanding independence while serbia is only prepared to grant them autonomy . merkel told tadic that germany was interested in having close relations with serbia and was prepared to help bring it more in line with mainstream europe . war criminal prosecutions required bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the search for war criminals goes on a condition for this was that belgrade " cooperated well " with the international criminal tribunal for former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- in the hague that was prosecuting war crimes in the former yugoslavia , she said . tadic , a member of the pro-western opposition democratic party , said germany was " the key partner " for serbia in europe .
germany is a member of the contact group of foreign powers that has been overseeing peace in the breakaway serbian province of kosovo since the 1998-1999 conflict . the president also thanked merkel for her support at this week 's nato summit in latvia , which offered serbia and its western balkan neighbors bosnia and montenegro a " partnership for peace " -lrb- pfp -rrb- agreement with the alliance . delayed decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian voters backed the new constitution in a referendum tadic 's visit to germany comes at a particularly sensitive moment for his country . the un 's kosovo mediator martti ahtisaari recently decided not to announce his plans for the future of the southern serbian province until after the elections , which tadic had called for jan .

retirement will be staggered for those born in the 10 years in between .
an exception to retirement at 67 will also be made for anyone who paid into the security system for 45 years or more . meanwhile , the social security court in kassel ruled to raise pensioners ' long-term care insurance contributions , with both measures triggering claims from the vdk social organization that senior citizens are becoming impoverished . " the barest of insurance " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those born before 1954 fall under the old rules " the government has pushed the retirement age up to 67 as another way of cutting pensions , said vdk president walter hirrlinger . " the pension is being reduced to the barest of insurance , " he said , stressing that the move would have negative repercussions for the younger generation in years to come . in fact , according to the federal statistics office , pensioners are better off than ever with only 2.7 percent of social welfare recipients older than 65 . but hirrlinger also pointed out that raising the retirement age is pointless when over 50 percent of employers will not hire workers over 50 . " politicians are getting ahead of themselves , " he said .
" what they need to do first is make sure that the elderly who can and do work are actually allowed to continue to do so until the age of 65 .
once this has been established , they can start thinking about raising the retirement age . " age discrimination bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's pension system is coming unstuck as it happens , the government has already begun addressing the problem of age discrimination . wednesday also saw labor minister franz müntefering unveil his " initiative 50 + . " the scheme is designed to boost employment options for the elderly and includes the introduction of state subsidies for further training and financial rewards for anyone who takes a job paid less than the would receive in unemployment benefits .
employers , meanwhile , will receive a bonus for hiring staff over 50 for at least one year . " intelligent , far-sighted companies have already realized that a cross-section of generations is a recipe for successful , " müntefering said at the project 's launch , pointing out that business needs the expertise of the elder generation , especially given the current shortage of qualified workers apparent in certain sectors . the minister said he hoped the initiative would result in jobs for 100,000 people . " only 45 percent of over-55s are still working , " he said .

is germany becoming a greater target for islamist terrorism ? guido steinberg : german security officials are convinced that germany is continually becoming a greater target for islamist terrorists .
and there are indeed indications that that 's the case .
the most important one was the failed attack on two regional trains in north rhine-westphalia in summer 2006 .
it failed because the two bombs packed in suitcases did n't detonate . unfortunately little more is known about the background than that two lebanese men from tripoli and its surrounding were responsible for the deed .
above all , it is unclear to what extent a larger terror organization was behind the two men .
without this information , it 's very difficult to judge to what extent germany is becoming a target .
however , it appears we have to reckon with increased terrorist activities here . what effects could that have on the debate over the responsibility of muslims in germany toward the greater society ?
bildunterschrift : guido steinberg the news of attack plans has already had an effect on the debate about the role of muslims here .
more and more germans view the presence of muslims in germany as a security risk .
thus the debate about the integration of immigrants is in danger of being laden with aspects of fighting terrorism .
this could lead to a stronger polarization , which would damage the long-term aim of the integration of foreigners .
in my opinion , the integration debate and the discussion about fighting terrorism should be strictly separated . the fact that terrorist attacks were prevented in the initial planning stages is a huge success for german security officials .
can terrorism be fought with police resources alone ? the plans for an attack on an airplane were discovered in such an early stage that i believe it 's not even certain the suspects were actually in the planning stage .
in this respect , i 'm not sure whether it actually is a case of success for security officials .
however , this example shows once more that the security officials are closely monitoring at least parts of the militant scene . on the other hand , the case of the suitcase bombers shows that attacks often ca n't be prevented no matter how effectively security officials work .
of course , the resources police and intelligence officials have are inadequate .
fighting terrorism is also - if not primarily - a political task .
one must win over the sympathizers of terrorist groups through political measures .
only in such a way can one prevent terrorist groups from continually recruiting members , financing themselves and operating under the protection of their supporters . many experts hold the ambiguous " jihad " responsible for terrorism .
what 's your assessment of jihad as a mobilizing force ? there is no actual " jihad " but rather various interpretations of it .
jihadists are characterized by having chosen a jihadist concept that centers on armed battle against " non-believers . "
they view everyone who rejects their ideology as non-believers , whether they 're muslims , christians or jews .
muslims are indeed much more often their victims than non-muslims .
this ideology 's ability to mobilize is very strong as has repeatedly been shown by the throngs joining jihadist organizations in recent years , not least here in europe .
jihadism is a greater problem today than it was in 2001 . are the potential terrorists the usual jihadists ?
how would you describe them ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dialog could help to ease tensions there is no such thing as a generic profile of an islamic terrorist .
students and petty criminals are among them , new immigrants and people born here in europe .
in many cases , however , a certain characteristic can be detected , namely " blocked upward mobility . "
young men reach limitations at some point in their history .
for example , they go to university , but still do n't get the job they want .
they immigrate to europe , but are forced to make their way as petty criminals .
individual failure then frequently turns into an aggressive , radical attitude toward society .
then the young men are receptive to militant ideologies . the dialog with muslims is lauded by many but criticized as well .
can a competent dialog serve to prevent islamist terrorism ? a dialog between muslims and greater society can certainly put tensions to rest .
in a process of dialog the government could make clear what it expects of muslims .
muslims , on the other hand , could express their complaints .
my opinion is that germany can certainly take decisive steps against terrorists if it tries at the same time to take measures against the partly accurate impressions of many muslims of being discriminated against here .
to put it shortly : no tolerance in security issues , more openness in religious , cultural areas .
general bans on head scarves or the ban on ritual slaughtering -lrb- of animals -rrb- , for example , could be revoked to make it clear that it is not the west battling islam , but that it is rather exclusively a fight against violent islamists .
such measures could be agreed on in a dialog . aladdin sarhan interviewed guido steinberg -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de terrorists planned plane bombing in germany german prosecutors have launched an investigation into a group that is thought to have started planning a terrorist attack on a german passenger plane last summer .

passengers on 221 european flights have been asked to contact their doctors . british airways -lrb- ba -rrb- said " very low traces of a radioactive substance " had been found on two of its three aircraft , which were taken out of service to " enable forensic examination to be carried out . " the third plane under investigation was given the all-clear late on thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uk authorities asked visitors who ate at london 's itsu sushi bar on nov .
1 to contact them ba published on its web site a list of the boeing 767 flights concerned , covering incoming and outgoing flights throughout november from london heathrow to düsseldorf , frankfurt , athens , barcelona , istanbul , larnaca , madrid , moscow , stockholm and vienna . greece , turkey and spain have asked ba to provide information on the flights which passed through their airports .
the airline estimated that 221 flights involving the three aircraft were affected , involving 33,000 passengers .
passengers on those planes were asked to contact their doctors .
it wrote that it was contacting passengers on the affected flights and had set up a telephone hotline for concerned customers . ba said it had been advised that the risk to public health was low and this was corroborated by british home secretary , john reid . in germany , the concerns of some worried parents were allayed by scientists at the gsf research institute near munich . " in our opinion , the health risks for the passengers are almost nil , " herwig paretzke , the head of the radiation protection department , told the süddeutsche zeitung : traces at sushi bar large quantities of the radioactive substance polonium 210 were found in the urine of former russian spy alexander litvinenko , who died on nov .
23 .
from his sick bed , he had accused russian president vladimir putin of ordering his killing .
russia has rejected the allegations . traces of polonium 210 have also been discovered at a central london sushi bar where he met with the italian academic mario scaramella and a central london hotel where the ex-secret serviceman met two russian contacts on nov .
1 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : litvinenko had been a kgb spy and was a critic of putin scaramella has reportedly been given the all-clear from possible radiation contamination . the substance has also been found at litvinenko 's north london home , at the office of exiled russian billionaire boris berezovsky - an acquaintance of litvinenko - and a security company .
two other locations are being searched . britain 's domestic press association news agency said it understood a number of litvinenko 's friends and family had also been tested , including berezovsky , but they are said to be in " perfect health . " the british daily telegraph newspaper reported that the polonium 210 that killed litvinenko had been dropped on the floor of a london hotel room , according to a senior government official . the paper also claimed that british scientists were believed to have identified the nuclear plant where the substance had been produced . the fact that 47 of the ba flights were between moscow and london reinforced " the theory that the origin of this material that killed alexander in moscow , " said litvinenko 's friend alex goldfarb in london . anti-terrorist investigators believe the substance was brought to london from moscow in the week before litvinenko 's death .
hospital staff tested public health officials have so far sent eight people for precautionary tests at a special clinic .
forty-nine staff at the two hospitals where litvinenko was treated have also had to provide urine for testing , with results expected next week .
none has been referred to the clinic and there was no risk of contamination at the hospitals , according to the health protection agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the investigation is ongoing elsewhere , speculation that poisoning could also be behind a mystery illness suffered by former russian prime minister yegor gaidar who was recuperating in a moscow hospital was confirmed by his spokesman valery natarov . " this was an unnatural poisoning , " natarov said .
" the doctors ca n't say what the substance is yet .
we are expecting an official diagnosis at the beginning of next week . " police in ireland , where gaidar fell ill last friday , have started an investigation into the cause of his illness . the academic , who is currently recovering in a moscow hospital , heads an economic think-tank in moscow that frequently criticizes putin 's policy of increasing state control over the economy . the confirmation of the unnatural nature of gaidar 's illness has fuelled fears that his case might be connected with the death of alexander litvinenko and murdered russian journalist anna politkovskaya . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans want council of europe involved in litvinenko inquiry the council of europe , not only british authorities , should be investigating the mysterious death of former russian spy alexander litvinenko , according to some german politicians .

is germany becoming a greater target for islamist terrorism ? guido steinberg : german security officials are convinced that germany is continually becoming a greater target for islamist terrorists .
and there are indeed indications that that 's the case .
the most important one was the failed attack on two regional trains in north rhine-westphalia in summer 2006 .
it failed because the two bombs packed in suitcases did n't detonate . unfortunately little more is known about the background than that two lebanese men from tripoli and its surrounding were responsible for the deed .
above all , it is unclear to what extent a larger terror organization was behind the two men .
without this information , it 's very difficult to judge to what extent germany is becoming a target .
however , it appears we have to reckon with increased terrorist activities here . what effects could that have on the debate over the responsibility of muslims in germany toward the greater society ?
bildunterschrift : guido steinberg the news of attack plans has already had an effect on the debate about the role of muslims here .
more and more germans view the presence of muslims in germany as a security risk .
thus the debate about the integration of immigrants is in danger of being laden with aspects of fighting terrorism .
this could lead to a stronger polarization , which would damage the long-term aim of the integration of foreigners .
in my opinion , the integration debate and the discussion about fighting terrorism should be strictly separated . the fact that terrorist attacks were prevented in the initial planning stages is a huge success for german security officials .
can terrorism be fought with police resources alone ? the plans for an attack on an airplane were discovered in such an early stage that i believe it 's not even certain the suspects were actually in the planning stage .
in this respect , i 'm not sure whether it actually is a case of success for security officials .
however , this example shows once more that the security officials are closely monitoring at least parts of the militant scene . on the other hand , the case of the suitcase bombers shows that attacks often ca n't be prevented no matter how effectively security officials work .
of course , the resources police and intelligence officials have are inadequate .
fighting terrorism is also - if not primarily - a political task .
one must win over the sympathizers of terrorist groups through political measures .
only in such a way can one prevent terrorist groups from continually recruiting members , financing themselves and operating under the protection of their supporters . many experts hold the ambiguous " jihad " responsible for terrorism .
what 's your assessment of jihad as a mobilizing force ? there is no actual " jihad " but rather various interpretations of it .
jihadists are characterized by having chosen a jihadist concept that centers on armed battle against " non-believers . "
they view everyone who rejects their ideology as non-believers , whether they 're muslims , christians or jews .
muslims are indeed much more often their victims than non-muslims .
this ideology 's ability to mobilize is very strong as has repeatedly been shown by the throngs joining jihadist organizations in recent years , not least here in europe .
jihadism is a greater problem today than it was in 2001 . are the potential terrorists the usual jihadists ?
how would you describe them ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dialog could help to ease tensions there is no such thing as a generic profile of an islamic terrorist .
students and petty criminals are among them , new immigrants and people born here in europe .
in many cases , however , a certain characteristic can be detected , namely " blocked upward mobility . "
young men reach limitations at some point in their history .
for example , they go to university , but still do n't get the job they want .
they immigrate to europe , but are forced to make their way as petty criminals .
individual failure then frequently turns into an aggressive , radical attitude toward society .
then the young men are receptive to militant ideologies . the dialog with muslims is lauded by many but criticized as well .
can a competent dialog serve to prevent islamist terrorism ? a dialog between muslims and greater society can certainly put tensions to rest .
in a process of dialog the government could make clear what it expects of muslims .
muslims , on the other hand , could express their complaints .
my opinion is that germany can certainly take decisive steps against terrorists if it tries at the same time to take measures against the partly accurate impressions of many muslims of being discriminated against here .
to put it shortly : no tolerance in security issues , more openness in religious , cultural areas .
general bans on head scarves or the ban on ritual slaughtering -lrb- of animals -rrb- , for example , could be revoked to make it clear that it is not the west battling islam , but that it is rather exclusively a fight against violent islamists .
such measures could be agreed on in a dialog . aladdin sarhan interviewed guido steinberg -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de terrorists planned plane bombing in germany german prosecutors have launched an investigation into a group that is thought to have started planning a terrorist attack on a german passenger plane last summer .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . i hope pope benedict 's visit turns out to be safe and satisfying for both sides in terms of the messages given for improved dialogue , understanding and support .
i expect that such a visit should set an example in bringing these cultures closer together , increasing mutual familiarity , decreasing fear and distrust .
both the western world , especially the us and the eu , and the eastern world , especially the extremist islamist groups , should closely follow this example and consider more moderation in their policies . - ege yildirim , turkish student in new york i think that -lrb- the pope -rrb- will move the roman catholic church closer to the orthodox church .
he is tactful , respectful , humble , and knowledgeable , and that is appreciated .
as for the muslims , no one can mend fences if there is no willingness for dialogue .
i feel that if the press judges the pope based on what he will accomplish in that matter , he will be misjudged .
everything one can do in some situations is to defend the truth . - elisabeth heptner , usa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's pm erdogan met briefly with the pope , though the visit was supposedly not political the pontiff 's visit has extreme ramifications for all organized religions around the world .
there needs to be more dialog , compassion , and understanding if religion is to survive .
the common thread between all the devotions is the communication and ability of the religious forces to help keep peace in the world .
it is within this universal compromise that all religious thought is correct and there is no one way to believe in the power of the universe , however you define it .
this attempt by the pope is noble and important .
i believe many feel this way , but there are those who do not .
we pray for them and perhaps they will see the light . - j. greenspan i am a german and a muslim .
the utterances of the pope did not disturb me , as he cited history .
the catholic church is anti-everything -lrb- except for their wrongdoings against choir-boys -rrb- .
on the other hand we muslims have to respect that we are all children of the same yahweh / god / allah and that includes the jews , who are by heritance the direct brothers of the arabs . - harm g. frey the raging crowds in turkey are angry and it 's their own fault .
they are the hateful ones and the intolerant ones .
there can be no dialogue until the angry crowds cool off and realize that they are wrong , not the pope . - f rank garlo by their very actions turkish muslims confirm that the papal quotes from a 14th century figure apply just as much to their culture today .
hopefully relations with orthodox christians will continue to improve .
i can see no animosity between orthodox and catholic christians at an individual level .
that happy state of affairs needs to be " ratified " by the religious institutions concerned .
i think we should all pray for the pope 's safety . - george j. berkowski bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dialog with the orthodox christians was a major reason for the trip when turks and turkish media meet this man they will begin to listen - not like the last time , when they went off crackers because they did not understand the nature of exploratory theological reminiscences .
their reaction was extremely disappointing and fed the voracious western media , whose take then bled into those within the muslim world who still see no option but to be hostile to any christian initiative .
the closed muslim mind is almost a greater threat to a world coalition of culture , religious values and - ultimately - economic interests .
the west awaits a muslim renaissance , which will take nothing from its integrity but merely express its participation in the human story .
perceived threats of a world dominated by us financial interests will be allayed with a joint financial venture between the enormous wealth of the oil-rich middle east and the west . in my country , australia , we have a noble history of reconciliation with the turkish people whose land our heroic military forces invaded at gallipoli in 1915 .
ataturk himself said in effect that the mothers of the australian dead need not mourn because the turkish people would honour the australian soldiers who lay on their land : they would harbour them .
and over the last twenty years my city of melbourne has received tens of thousands of turkish immigrants who build mosques and businesses and even sent one daughter to the rather expensive roman catholic school where i teach .
christianity has no borders .
we are brought up -lrb- most of us -rrb- in the belief that samaritans are the first instructors to us of who is a human being and thus worthy of honour and protection . - herbie , melbourne , australia compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope 's trip to turkey starts on conciliatory note pope benedict xvi began a delicate mission to turkey , trading conciliatory gestures with prime minister recep tayyip erdogan as both sought to calm the storm unleashed when the pontiff appeared to link islam to violence .
-lrb- 28.11.2006 -rrb- pope 's visit overshadowed by confrontation with islam pope benedict xvi 's visit to turkey to heal a rift with the eastern orthodox church , has been overshadowed by muslim anger over remarks about islam .
muslim turks seek dialogue , but will be monitoring his every word .
-lrb- 27.11.2006 -rrb- opinion : turkey 's unwelcome guest whether the pope likes it or not , his trip to turkey , which starts tuesday , has turned into a confrontation between islam and christianity , dw-tv 's religious correspondent john berwick writes .

is germany becoming a greater target for islamist terrorism ? guido steinberg : german security officials are convinced that germany is continually becoming a greater target for islamist terrorists .
and there are indeed indications that that 's the case .
the most important one was the failed attack on two regional trains in north rhine-westphalia in summer 2006 .
it failed because the two bombs packed in suitcases did n't detonate . unfortunately little more is known about the background than that two lebanese men from tripoli and its surrounding were responsible for the deed .
above all , it is unclear to what extent a larger terror organization was behind the two men .
without this information , it 's very difficult to judge to what extent germany is becoming a target .
however , it appears we have to reckon with increased terrorist activities here . what effects could that have on the debate over the responsibility of muslims in germany toward the greater society ?
bildunterschrift : guido steinberg the news of attack plans has already had an effect on the debate about the role of muslims here .
more and more germans view the presence of muslims in germany as a security risk .
thus the debate about the integration of immigrants is in danger of being laden with aspects of fighting terrorism .
this could lead to a stronger polarization , which would damage the long-term aim of the integration of foreigners .
in my opinion , the integration debate and the discussion about fighting terrorism should be strictly separated . the fact that terrorist attacks were prevented in the initial planning stages is a huge success for german security officials .
can terrorism be fought with police resources alone ? the plans for an attack on an airplane were discovered in such an early stage that i believe it 's not even certain the suspects were actually in the planning stage .
in this respect , i 'm not sure whether it actually is a case of success for security officials .
however , this example shows once more that the security officials are closely monitoring at least parts of the militant scene . on the other hand , the case of the suitcase bombers shows that attacks often ca n't be prevented no matter how effectively security officials work .
of course , the resources police and intelligence officials have are inadequate .
fighting terrorism is also - if not primarily - a political task .
one must win over the sympathizers of terrorist groups through political measures .
only in such a way can one prevent terrorist groups from continually recruiting members , financing themselves and operating under the protection of their supporters . many experts hold the ambiguous " jihad " responsible for terrorism .
what 's your assessment of jihad as a mobilizing force ? there is no actual " jihad " but rather various interpretations of it .
jihadists are characterized by having chosen a jihadist concept that centers on armed battle against " non-believers . "
they view everyone who rejects their ideology as non-believers , whether they 're muslims , christians or jews .
muslims are indeed much more often their victims than non-muslims .
this ideology 's ability to mobilize is very strong as has repeatedly been shown by the throngs joining jihadist organizations in recent years , not least here in europe .
jihadism is a greater problem today than it was in 2001 . are the potential terrorists the usual jihadists ?
how would you describe them ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dialog could help to ease tensions there is no such thing as a generic profile of an islamic terrorist .
students and petty criminals are among them , new immigrants and people born here in europe .
in many cases , however , a certain characteristic can be detected , namely " blocked upward mobility . "
young men reach limitations at some point in their history .
for example , they go to university , but still do n't get the job they want .
they immigrate to europe , but are forced to make their way as petty criminals .
individual failure then frequently turns into an aggressive , radical attitude toward society .
then the young men are receptive to militant ideologies . the dialog with muslims is lauded by many but criticized as well .
can a competent dialog serve to prevent islamist terrorism ? a dialog between muslims and greater society can certainly put tensions to rest .
in a process of dialog the government could make clear what it expects of muslims .
muslims , on the other hand , could express their complaints .
my opinion is that germany can certainly take decisive steps against terrorists if it tries at the same time to take measures against the partly accurate impressions of many muslims of being discriminated against here .
to put it shortly : no tolerance in security issues , more openness in religious , cultural areas .
general bans on head scarves or the ban on ritual slaughtering -lrb- of animals -rrb- , for example , could be revoked to make it clear that it is not the west battling islam , but that it is rather exclusively a fight against violent islamists .
such measures could be agreed on in a dialog . aladdin sarhan interviewed guido steinberg -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de terrorists planned plane bombing in germany german prosecutors have launched an investigation into a group that is thought to have started planning a terrorist attack on a german passenger plane last summer .

experts fear germany could face a shortage of qualified university graduates if the trend continues . according to the latest figures from the federal statistics office , the number of new students enrolling at university has dropped for the third year running , despite the rise in the number of school leavers graduating with a high school diploma . german universities registered 343,700 new students this year , 3.5 percent fewer than last year . as german research and education minister annette schavan pointed out in response to the survey , the development is particularly worrying given germany 's need for academics and the overall brain drain of recent years . the biggest declines come in the fields of engineering , technology and computer studies .
over all , the number of school-leavers opting for further education at universities and colleges in 2006 fell to 35.5 percent - short of the german government 's target of 40 percent . what 's behind the drop ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : too many courses are hard to get into the report cites several reasons for the decline .
one sticking point is that german states have tightened up entry requirements , and another is that many courses are available to a limited number of students .
first and foremost , however , is the fact that new students are being deterred by the introduction of higher education fees . " this is a slap in the face for the government , " achim meyer auf der heyde of the german students association told berlin 's daily taz , adding that education politicians should ask themselves whether the introduction of university fees and reduced students grants has sent the " wrong signals . " across the country , many students are simply refusing to pay up .
the action group against student fees hopes to have recruited some 400,000 students over the next 12 months , and many have the support of the universities themselves . but schavan told the handelsblatt newspaper on thursday that the introduction of fees was not behind the overall drop in students choosing to attend university as increasing numbers of students are enrolling in bavaria and hamburg 's universities despite students fee in place there . regional differences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students protested against the introduction of tuition fees the federal statistics office also pointed out that differences in enrollment numbers vary according from state to state .
saxony has 13 percent fewer new students , while baden württemberg and north rhine westphalia saw a drop of 10 percent . in eastern germany , many fear the current development is just the thin end of the wedge and that students are dying breed . " universities in eastern germany need to become better-known and more attractive , " said dieter dohmen , director of the berlin research institute for education and social economics .

experts fear germany could face a shortage of qualified university graduates if the trend continues . according to the latest figures from the federal statistics office , the number of new students enrolling at university has dropped for the third year running , despite the rise in the number of school leavers graduating with a high school diploma . german universities registered 343,700 new students this year , 3.5 percent fewer than last year . as german research and education minister annette schavan pointed out in response to the survey , the development is particularly worrying given germany 's need for academics and the overall brain drain of recent years . the biggest declines come in the fields of engineering , technology and computer studies .
over all , the number of school-leavers opting for further education at universities and colleges in 2006 fell to 35.5 percent - short of the german government 's target of 40 percent . what 's behind the drop ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : too many courses are hard to get into the report cites several reasons for the decline .
one sticking point is that german states have tightened up entry requirements , and another is that many courses are available to a limited number of students .
first and foremost , however , is the fact that new students are being deterred by the introduction of higher education fees . " this is a slap in the face for the government , " achim meyer auf der heyde of the german students association told berlin 's daily taz , adding that education politicians should ask themselves whether the introduction of university fees and reduced students grants has sent the " wrong signals . " across the country , many students are simply refusing to pay up .
the action group against student fees hopes to have recruited some 400,000 students over the next 12 months , and many have the support of the universities themselves . but schavan told the handelsblatt newspaper on thursday that the introduction of fees was not behind the overall drop in students choosing to attend university as increasing numbers of students are enrolling in bavaria and hamburg 's universities despite students fee in place there . regional differences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students protested against the introduction of tuition fees the federal statistics office also pointed out that differences in enrollment numbers vary according from state to state .
saxony has 13 percent fewer new students , while baden württemberg and north rhine westphalia saw a drop of 10 percent . in eastern germany , many fear the current development is just the thin end of the wedge and that students are dying breed . " universities in eastern germany need to become better-known and more attractive , " said dieter dohmen , director of the berlin research institute for education and social economics .
" they especially need to attract more women .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 30.11.2006 reader response : " both east and west can learn from pope " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope celebrated mass in ephesus , turkey , during his four-day visit pope benedict xvi visited turkey this week and dw-world.de 's readers wrote in with their thoughts on the pontiff , the reactions from the host country and the need for increased inter-religious dialog . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . i hope pope benedict 's visit turns out to be safe and satisfying for both sides in terms of the messages given for improved dialogue , understanding and support .
i expect that such a visit should set an example in bringing these cultures closer together , increasing mutual familiarity , decreasing fear and distrust .
both the western world , especially the us and the eu , and the eastern world , especially the extremist islamist groups , should closely follow this example and consider more moderation in their policies . - ege yildirim , turkish student in new york i think that -lrb- the pope -rrb- will move the roman catholic church closer to the orthodox church .
he is tactful , respectful , humble , and knowledgeable , and that is appreciated .
as for the muslims , no one can mend fences if there is no willingness for dialogue .
i feel that if the press judges the pope based on what he will accomplish in that matter , he will be misjudged .
everything one can do in some situations is to defend the truth . - elisabeth heptner , usa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's pm erdogan met briefly with the pope , though the visit was supposedly not political the pontiff 's visit has extreme ramifications for all organized religions around the world .
there needs to be more dialog , compassion , and understanding if religion is to survive .
the common thread between all the devotions is the communication and ability of the religious forces to help keep peace in the world .
it is within this universal compromise that all religious thought is correct and there is no one way to believe in the power of the universe , however you define it .
this attempt by the pope is noble and important .
i believe many feel this way , but there are those who do not .
we pray for them and perhaps they will see the light . - j. greenspan i am a german and a muslim .
the utterances of the pope did not disturb me , as he cited history .
the catholic church is anti-everything -lrb- except for their wrongdoings against choir-boys -rrb- .
on the other hand we muslims have to respect that we are all children of the same yahweh / god / allah and that includes the jews , who are by heritance the direct brothers of the arabs . - harm g. frey the raging crowds in turkey are angry and it 's their own fault .
they are the hateful ones and the intolerant ones .
there can be no dialogue until the angry crowds cool off and realize that they are wrong , not the pope . - f rank garlo by their very actions turkish muslims confirm that the papal quotes from a 14th century figure apply just as much to their culture today .
hopefully relations with orthodox christians will continue to improve .
i can see no animosity between orthodox and catholic christians at an individual level .
that happy state of affairs needs to be " ratified " by the religious institutions concerned .
i think we should all pray for the pope 's safety . - george j. berkowski bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dialog with the orthodox christians was a major reason for the trip when turks and turkish media meet this man they will begin to listen - not like the last time , when they went off crackers because they did not understand the nature of exploratory theological reminiscences .
their reaction was extremely disappointing and fed the voracious western media , whose take then bled into those within the muslim world who still see no option but to be hostile to any christian initiative .
the closed muslim mind is almost a greater threat to a world coalition of culture , religious values and - ultimately - economic interests .
the west awaits a muslim renaissance , which will take nothing from its integrity but merely express its participation in the human story .
perceived threats of a world dominated by us financial interests will be allayed with a joint financial venture between the enormous wealth of the oil-rich middle east and the west . in my country , australia , we have a noble history of reconciliation with the turkish people whose land our heroic military forces invaded at gallipoli in 1915 .
ataturk himself said in effect that the mothers of the australian dead need not mourn because the turkish people would honour the australian soldiers who lay on their land : they would harbour them .
and over the last twenty years my city of melbourne has received tens of thousands of turkish immigrants who build mosques and businesses and even sent one daughter to the rather expensive roman catholic school where i teach .
christianity has no borders .
we are brought up -lrb- most of us -rrb- in the belief that samaritans are the first instructors to us of who is a human being and thus worthy of honour and protection . - herbie , melbourne , australia compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope 's trip to turkey starts on conciliatory note pope benedict xvi began a delicate mission to turkey , trading conciliatory gestures with prime minister recep tayyip erdogan as both sought to calm the storm unleashed when the pontiff appeared to link islam to violence .
-lrb- 28.11.2006 -rrb- pope 's visit overshadowed by confrontation with islam pope benedict xvi 's visit to turkey to heal a rift with the eastern orthodox church , has been overshadowed by muslim anger over remarks about islam .
muslim turks seek dialogue , but will be monitoring his every word .
-lrb- 27.11.2006 -rrb- opinion : turkey 's unwelcome guest whether the pope likes it or not , his trip to turkey , which starts tuesday , has turned into a confrontation between islam and christianity , dw-tv 's religious correspondent john berwick writes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : christmas in germany americans taking bigger bite of german christmas fare berliners celebrate new shopping hours saint nicholas : the bearded legend germany 's christmas markets : all that is filling and festive from the fringe -pipe- 30.11.2006 berlin begging for more santas großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scenes like this one are something the german capital can only dream of this year germany 's unemployment rates are falling , but the german capital is experiencing a serious shortage of santa clauses this year .
is grinch planning to steal christmas again ? it 's started again : the annual euphoria which converts parts of the german capital into a teutonic version of a us shopping mall .
customers are beginning to be lured into a commercial winter paradise in which countless mugs of despair-dampening mulled wine , consumed against the headache-guaranteeing cacophony of jingle bells and white christmas , can easily drive many a parent to the brink of insanity .
at least , it comes only once a year . berlin 's newly built central train station has erected a 20-meter -lrb- 65-foot -rrb- monster tree with more than 28,000 branches and around 40,000 christmas crystal ornaments , the most expensive tree berlin has ever seen .
but something is rotten in christmas land .
berlin 's santa clauses are , apparently , getting lazy .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . i hope pope benedict 's visit turns out to be safe and satisfying for both sides in terms of the messages given for improved dialogue , understanding and support .
i expect that such a visit should set an example in bringing these cultures closer together , increasing mutual familiarity , decreasing fear and distrust .
both the western world , especially the us and the eu , and the eastern world , especially the extremist islamist groups , should closely follow this example and consider more moderation in their policies . - ege yildirim , turkish student in new york i think that -lrb- the pope -rrb- will move the roman catholic church closer to the orthodox church .
he is tactful , respectful , humble , and knowledgeable , and that is appreciated .
as for the muslims , no one can mend fences if there is no willingness for dialogue .
i feel that if the press judges the pope based on what he will accomplish in that matter , he will be misjudged .
everything one can do in some situations is to defend the truth . - elisabeth heptner , usa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's pm erdogan met briefly with the pope , though the visit was supposedly not political the pontiff 's visit has extreme ramifications for all organized religions around the world .
there needs to be more dialog , compassion , and understanding if religion is to survive .
the common thread between all the devotions is the communication and ability of the religious forces to help keep peace in the world .
it is within this universal compromise that all religious thought is correct and there is no one way to believe in the power of the universe , however you define it .
this attempt by the pope is noble and important .
i believe many feel this way , but there are those who do not .
we pray for them and perhaps they will see the light . - j. greenspan i am a german and a muslim .
the utterances of the pope did not disturb me , as he cited history .
the catholic church is anti-everything -lrb- except for their wrongdoings against choir-boys -rrb- .
on the other hand we muslims have to respect that we are all children of the same yahweh / god / allah and that includes the jews , who are by heritance the direct brothers of the arabs . - harm g. frey the raging crowds in turkey are angry and it 's their own fault .
they are the hateful ones and the intolerant ones .
there can be no dialogue until the angry crowds cool off and realize that they are wrong , not the pope . - f rank garlo by their very actions turkish muslims confirm that the papal quotes from a 14th century figure apply just as much to their culture today .
hopefully relations with orthodox christians will continue to improve .
i can see no animosity between orthodox and catholic christians at an individual level .
that happy state of affairs needs to be " ratified " by the religious institutions concerned .
i think we should all pray for the pope 's safety . - george j. berkowski bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dialog with the orthodox christians was a major reason for the trip when turks and turkish media meet this man they will begin to listen - not like the last time , when they went off crackers because they did not understand the nature of exploratory theological reminiscences .
their reaction was extremely disappointing and fed the voracious western media , whose take then bled into those within the muslim world who still see no option but to be hostile to any christian initiative .
the closed muslim mind is almost a greater threat to a world coalition of culture , religious values and - ultimately - economic interests .
the west awaits a muslim renaissance , which will take nothing from its integrity but merely express its participation in the human story .
perceived threats of a world dominated by us financial interests will be allayed with a joint financial venture between the enormous wealth of the oil-rich middle east and the west . in my country , australia , we have a noble history of reconciliation with the turkish people whose land our heroic military forces invaded at gallipoli in 1915 .
ataturk himself said in effect that the mothers of the australian dead need not mourn because the turkish people would honour the australian soldiers who lay on their land : they would harbour them .
and over the last twenty years my city of melbourne has received tens of thousands of turkish immigrants who build mosques and businesses and even sent one daughter to the rather expensive roman catholic school where i teach .
christianity has no borders .
we are brought up -lrb- most of us -rrb- in the belief that samaritans are the first instructors to us of who is a human being and thus worthy of honour and protection . - herbie , melbourne , australia compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope 's trip to turkey starts on conciliatory note pope benedict xvi began a delicate mission to turkey , trading conciliatory gestures with prime minister recep tayyip erdogan as both sought to calm the storm unleashed when the pontiff appeared to link islam to violence .
-lrb- 28.11.2006 -rrb- pope 's visit overshadowed by confrontation with islam pope benedict xvi 's visit to turkey to heal a rift with the eastern orthodox church , has been overshadowed by muslim anger over remarks about islam .
muslim turks seek dialogue , but will be monitoring his every word .
-lrb- 27.11.2006 -rrb- opinion : turkey 's unwelcome guest whether the pope likes it or not , his trip to turkey , which starts tuesday , has turned into a confrontation between islam and christianity , dw-tv 's religious correspondent john berwick writes .

passengers on 221 european flights have been asked to contact their doctors . british airways -lrb- ba -rrb- said " very low traces of a radioactive substance " had been found on two of its three aircraft , which were taken out of service to " enable forensic examination to be carried out . " the third plane under investigation was given the all-clear late on thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uk authorities asked visitors who ate at london 's itsu sushi bar on nov .
1 to contact them ba published on its web site a list of the boeing 767 flights concerned , covering incoming and outgoing flights throughout november from london heathrow to düsseldorf , frankfurt , athens , barcelona , istanbul , larnaca , madrid , moscow , stockholm and vienna . greece , turkey and spain have asked ba to provide information on the flights which passed through their airports .
the airline estimated that 221 flights involving the three aircraft were affected , involving 33,000 passengers .
passengers on those planes were asked to contact their doctors .
it wrote that it was contacting passengers on the affected flights and had set up a telephone hotline for concerned customers . ba said it had been advised that the risk to public health was low and this was corroborated by british home secretary , john reid . in germany , the concerns of some worried parents were allayed by scientists at the gsf research institute near munich . " in our opinion , the health risks for the passengers are almost nil , " herwig paretzke , the head of the radiation protection department , told the süddeutsche zeitung : traces at sushi bar large quantities of the radioactive substance polonium 210 were found in the urine of former russian spy alexander litvinenko , who died on nov .
23 .
from his sick bed , he had accused russian president vladimir putin of ordering his killing .
russia has rejected the allegations . traces of polonium 210 have also been discovered at a central london sushi bar where he met with the italian academic mario scaramella and a central london hotel where the ex-secret serviceman met two russian contacts on nov .
1 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : litvinenko had been a kgb spy and was a critic of putin scaramella has reportedly been given the all-clear from possible radiation contamination . the substance has also been found at litvinenko 's north london home , at the office of exiled russian billionaire boris berezovsky - an acquaintance of litvinenko - and a security company .
two other locations are being searched . britain 's domestic press association news agency said it understood a number of litvinenko 's friends and family had also been tested , including berezovsky , but they are said to be in " perfect health . " the british daily telegraph newspaper reported that the polonium 210 that killed litvinenko had been dropped on the floor of a london hotel room , according to a senior government official . the paper also claimed that british scientists were believed to have identified the nuclear plant where the substance had been produced . the fact that 47 of the ba flights were between moscow and london reinforced " the theory that the origin of this material that killed alexander in moscow , " said litvinenko 's friend alex goldfarb in london . anti-terrorist investigators believe the substance was brought to london from moscow in the week before litvinenko 's death .
hospital staff tested public health officials have so far sent eight people for precautionary tests at a special clinic .
forty-nine staff at the two hospitals where litvinenko was treated have also had to provide urine for testing , with results expected next week .
none has been referred to the clinic and there was no risk of contamination at the hospitals , according to the health protection agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the investigation is ongoing elsewhere , speculation that poisoning could also be behind a mystery illness suffered by former russian prime minister yegor gaidar who was recuperating in a moscow hospital was confirmed by his spokesman valery natarov . " this was an unnatural poisoning , " natarov said .
" the doctors ca n't say what the substance is yet .
we are expecting an official diagnosis at the beginning of next week . " police in ireland , where gaidar fell ill last friday , have started an investigation into the cause of his illness . the academic , who is currently recovering in a moscow hospital , heads an economic think-tank in moscow that frequently criticizes putin 's policy of increasing state control over the economy . the confirmation of the unnatural nature of gaidar 's illness has fuelled fears that his case might be connected with the death of alexander litvinenko and murdered russian journalist anna politkovskaya . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans want council of europe involved in litvinenko inquiry the council of europe , not only british authorities , should be investigating the mysterious death of former russian spy alexander litvinenko , according to some german politicians .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . i hope pope benedict 's visit turns out to be safe and satisfying for both sides in terms of the messages given for improved dialogue , understanding and support .
i expect that such a visit should set an example in bringing these cultures closer together , increasing mutual familiarity , decreasing fear and distrust .
both the western world , especially the us and the eu , and the eastern world , especially the extremist islamist groups , should closely follow this example and consider more moderation in their policies . - ege yildirim , turkish student in new york i think that -lrb- the pope -rrb- will move the roman catholic church closer to the orthodox church .
he is tactful , respectful , humble , and knowledgeable , and that is appreciated .
as for the muslims , no one can mend fences if there is no willingness for dialogue .
i feel that if the press judges the pope based on what he will accomplish in that matter , he will be misjudged .
everything one can do in some situations is to defend the truth . - elisabeth heptner , usa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's pm erdogan met briefly with the pope , though the visit was supposedly not political the pontiff 's visit has extreme ramifications for all organized religions around the world .
there needs to be more dialog , compassion , and understanding if religion is to survive .
the common thread between all the devotions is the communication and ability of the religious forces to help keep peace in the world .
it is within this universal compromise that all religious thought is correct and there is no one way to believe in the power of the universe , however you define it .
this attempt by the pope is noble and important .
i believe many feel this way , but there are those who do not .
we pray for them and perhaps they will see the light . - j. greenspan i am a german and a muslim .
the utterances of the pope did not disturb me , as he cited history .
the catholic church is anti-everything -lrb- except for their wrongdoings against choir-boys -rrb- .
on the other hand we muslims have to respect that we are all children of the same yahweh / god / allah and that includes the jews , who are by heritance the direct brothers of the arabs . - harm g. frey the raging crowds in turkey are angry and it 's their own fault .
they are the hateful ones and the intolerant ones .
there can be no dialogue until the angry crowds cool off and realize that they are wrong , not the pope . - f rank garlo by their very actions turkish muslims confirm that the papal quotes from a 14th century figure apply just as much to their culture today .
hopefully relations with orthodox christians will continue to improve .
i can see no animosity between orthodox and catholic christians at an individual level .
that happy state of affairs needs to be " ratified " by the religious institutions concerned .
i think we should all pray for the pope 's safety . - george j. berkowski bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dialog with the orthodox christians was a major reason for the trip when turks and turkish media meet this man they will begin to listen - not like the last time , when they went off crackers because they did not understand the nature of exploratory theological reminiscences .
their reaction was extremely disappointing and fed the voracious western media , whose take then bled into those within the muslim world who still see no option but to be hostile to any christian initiative .
the closed muslim mind is almost a greater threat to a world coalition of culture , religious values and - ultimately - economic interests .
the west awaits a muslim renaissance , which will take nothing from its integrity but merely express its participation in the human story .
perceived threats of a world dominated by us financial interests will be allayed with a joint financial venture between the enormous wealth of the oil-rich middle east and the west . in my country , australia , we have a noble history of reconciliation with the turkish people whose land our heroic military forces invaded at gallipoli in 1915 .
ataturk himself said in effect that the mothers of the australian dead need not mourn because the turkish people would honour the australian soldiers who lay on their land : they would harbour them .
and over the last twenty years my city of melbourne has received tens of thousands of turkish immigrants who build mosques and businesses and even sent one daughter to the rather expensive roman catholic school where i teach .
christianity has no borders .
we are brought up -lrb- most of us -rrb- in the belief that samaritans are the first instructors to us of who is a human being and thus worthy of honour and protection . - herbie , melbourne , australia compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope 's trip to turkey starts on conciliatory note pope benedict xvi began a delicate mission to turkey , trading conciliatory gestures with prime minister recep tayyip erdogan as both sought to calm the storm unleashed when the pontiff appeared to link islam to violence .
-lrb- 28.11.2006 -rrb- pope 's visit overshadowed by confrontation with islam pope benedict xvi 's visit to turkey to heal a rift with the eastern orthodox church , has been overshadowed by muslim anger over remarks about islam .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . i hope pope benedict 's visit turns out to be safe and satisfying for both sides in terms of the messages given for improved dialogue , understanding and support .
i expect that such a visit should set an example in bringing these cultures closer together , increasing mutual familiarity , decreasing fear and distrust .
both the western world , especially the us and the eu , and the eastern world , especially the extremist islamist groups , should closely follow this example and consider more moderation in their policies . - ege yildirim , turkish student in new york i think that -lrb- the pope -rrb- will move the roman catholic church closer to the orthodox church .
he is tactful , respectful , humble , and knowledgeable , and that is appreciated .
as for the muslims , no one can mend fences if there is no willingness for dialogue .
i feel that if the press judges the pope based on what he will accomplish in that matter , he will be misjudged .
everything one can do in some situations is to defend the truth . - elisabeth heptner , usa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's pm erdogan met briefly with the pope , though the visit was supposedly not political the pontiff 's visit has extreme ramifications for all organized religions around the world .
there needs to be more dialog , compassion , and understanding if religion is to survive .
the common thread between all the devotions is the communication and ability of the religious forces to help keep peace in the world .
it is within this universal compromise that all religious thought is correct and there is no one way to believe in the power of the universe , however you define it .
this attempt by the pope is noble and important .
i believe many feel this way , but there are those who do not .
we pray for them and perhaps they will see the light . - j. greenspan i am a german and a muslim .
the utterances of the pope did not disturb me , as he cited history .
the catholic church is anti-everything -lrb- except for their wrongdoings against choir-boys -rrb- .
on the other hand we muslims have to respect that we are all children of the same yahweh / god / allah and that includes the jews , who are by heritance the direct brothers of the arabs . - harm g. frey the raging crowds in turkey are angry and it 's their own fault .
they are the hateful ones and the intolerant ones .
there can be no dialogue until the angry crowds cool off and realize that they are wrong , not the pope . - f rank garlo by their very actions turkish muslims confirm that the papal quotes from a 14th century figure apply just as much to their culture today .
hopefully relations with orthodox christians will continue to improve .
i can see no animosity between orthodox and catholic christians at an individual level .
that happy state of affairs needs to be " ratified " by the religious institutions concerned .
i think we should all pray for the pope 's safety . - george j. berkowski bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dialog with the orthodox christians was a major reason for the trip when turks and turkish media meet this man they will begin to listen - not like the last time , when they went off crackers because they did not understand the nature of exploratory theological reminiscences .

dw 's stefanie duckstein says it ended too soon . mission completed , mission successful ?
defense minister franz josef jung gives the impression that he 'd like to quickly put the whole operation behind him .
like a mantra - unmistakably and repeatedly - he has asserted that extending the mandate is out of the question . the punctual pullout recalls the tough route to deciding on the mission in the first place .
as the election date in the democratic republic of congo drew ever closer , all germany 's leading politicians were in agreement that a peaceful dr congo could be a stabilizing factor for the entire region .
but sending a bundeswehr deployment to safeguard elections in the framework of the european union ?
then the tenor of the discussion became more restrained . it took many more months of debate before the german government finally did agree : 780 german soldiers were sent to dr congo and gabun .
germany 's condition for participation was that its soldiers would only be deployed in the capital , kinshasa .
pacification of the country 's restive eastern provinces was incumbent upon the united nations mission monuc .
and a large portion of the soldiers deployed were stationed outside dr congo , in gabun . was the bundeswehr 's participation in the mission of a purely symbolic nature ?
certainly not .
the congolese have lauded the german troops ' sober-mindedness and diplomacy .
violent unrest in kinshasa that left 23 dead was quickly allayed due above all to two factors : diplomatic pressure and intervention on the part of eu and un soldiers . but the momentary calm in dr congo is specious .
challenger jean-pierre bemba contested his electoral defeat and lost in court .
previously there had been gun battles between supporters of the opposing camps in kinshasa .
and in eastern dr congo on monday , un soldiers had used helicopters to block a rebel advance .
thousands of people fled from the violence , which bundeswehr representatives described as an incidental flare-up . in the meantime , bemba has accepted his defeat and resigned himself to a role in the opposition .
a powerful rebel group in the country 's restive east has just announced they would lay down their weapons .
and the fact that the elections proceeded relatively peacefully and fairly is also a positive signal . still , it does n't ensure dr congo a peaceful , democratic future .
the people are still the same .
surely , they must be able to keep their country running - especially politicians who should serve as a good example for everyone . it would have been good for dr congo if the eu soldiers ' mission had had a somewhat longer wind .
eufor has formally fulfilled its job .
but dr congo 's government will only be formed in mid-december .
it would have been important to accompany the inauguration of the new president in africa 's third-largest state .
but the mandate was not meant for that , according to the bundeswehr 's spokesman .
the mission served to safeguard the presidential and parliamentary elections and they were concluded peacefully , he said .
the mandate was valid for exactly four months and not a day longer . stefanie duckstein is an editor for deutsche welle 's africa service -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german minister not in favor of extending eu congo mandate german troops in congo could be heading home at the end of the year after defense minister franz josef jung said monday that the eu 's mandate for the drc should not be extended past its nov .

as the election date in the democratic republic of congo drew ever closer , all germany 's leading politicians were in agreement that a peaceful dr congo could be a stabilizing factor for the entire region .
but sending a bundeswehr deployment to safeguard elections in the framework of the european union ?
then the tenor of the discussion became more restrained . it took many more months of debate before the german government finally did agree : 780 german soldiers were sent to dr congo and gabun .
germany 's condition for participation was that its soldiers would only be deployed in the capital , kinshasa .
pacification of the country 's restive eastern provinces was incumbent upon the united nations mission monuc .
and a large portion of the soldiers deployed were stationed outside dr congo , in gabun . was the bundeswehr 's participation in the mission of a purely symbolic nature ?
certainly not .
the congolese have lauded the german troops ' sober-mindedness and diplomacy .
violent unrest in kinshasa that left 23 dead was quickly allayed due above all to two factors : diplomatic pressure and intervention on the part of eu and un soldiers . but the momentary calm in dr congo is specious .
challenger jean-pierre bemba contested his electoral defeat and lost in court .
previously there had been gun battles between supporters of the opposing camps in kinshasa .
and in eastern dr congo on monday , un soldiers had used helicopters to block a rebel advance .
thousands of people fled from the violence , which bundeswehr representatives described as an incidental flare-up . in the meantime , bemba has accepted his defeat and resigned himself to a role in the opposition .
a powerful rebel group in the country 's restive east has just announced they would lay down their weapons .
and the fact that the elections proceeded relatively peacefully and fairly is also a positive signal . still , it does n't ensure dr congo a peaceful , democratic future .
the people are still the same .
surely , they must be able to keep their country running - especially politicians who should serve as a good example for everyone . it would have been good for dr congo if the eu soldiers ' mission had had a somewhat longer wind .
eufor has formally fulfilled its job .
but dr congo 's government will only be formed in mid-december .
it would have been important to accompany the inauguration of the new president in africa 's third-largest state .
but the mandate was not meant for that , according to the bundeswehr 's spokesman .
the mission served to safeguard the presidential and parliamentary elections and they were concluded peacefully , he said .
the mandate was valid for exactly four months and not a day longer . stefanie duckstein is an editor for deutsche welle 's africa service -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german minister not in favor of extending eu congo mandate german troops in congo could be heading home at the end of the year after defense minister franz josef jung said monday that the eu 's mandate for the drc should not be extended past its nov .
30 deadline .
-lrb- 26.09.2006 -rrb- eu peacekeepers intervene for first time in dr congo skirmishes between president kabila 's troops and rebel fighters began sunday when election results were announced .
eu and un troops stepped in when the fighting escalated and foreign diplomats were caught under fire .
-lrb- 22.08.2006 -rrb- experts say eu mission in dr congo is merely symbolic some 2,000 european troops , including 780 germans , will help safeguard the elections in dr congo .
government officials see the deployment as an important peacekeeping effort , but most experts call it a symbolic gesture .

" the british daily telegraph newspaper reported that the polonium 210 that killed litvinenko had been dropped on the floor of a london hotel room , according to a senior government official . the paper also claimed that british scientists were believed to have identified the nuclear plant where the substance had been produced . the fact that 47 of the ba flights were between moscow and london reinforced " the theory that the origin of this material that killed alexander in moscow , " said litvinenko 's friend alex goldfarb in london . anti-terrorist investigators believe the substance was brought to london from moscow in the week before litvinenko 's death .
hospital staff tested public health officials have so far sent eight people for precautionary tests at a special clinic .
forty-nine staff at the two hospitals where litvinenko was treated have also had to provide urine for testing , with results expected next week .
none has been referred to the clinic and there was no risk of contamination at the hospitals , according to the health protection agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the investigation is ongoing elsewhere , speculation that poisoning could also be behind a mystery illness suffered by former russian prime minister yegor gaidar who was recuperating in a moscow hospital was confirmed by his spokesman valery natarov . " this was an unnatural poisoning , " natarov said .
" the doctors ca n't say what the substance is yet .
we are expecting an official diagnosis at the beginning of next week . " police in ireland , where gaidar fell ill last friday , have started an investigation into the cause of his illness . the academic , who is currently recovering in a moscow hospital , heads an economic think-tank in moscow that frequently criticizes putin 's policy of increasing state control over the economy . the confirmation of the unnatural nature of gaidar 's illness has fuelled fears that his case might be connected with the death of alexander litvinenko and murdered russian journalist anna politkovskaya . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans want council of europe involved in litvinenko inquiry the council of europe , not only british authorities , should be investigating the mysterious death of former russian spy alexander litvinenko , according to some german politicians .

pope benedict xvi on thursday put the brakes on his charm offensive in eu-hopeful , muslim majority turkey , stressing europe 's " christian roots " and taking a strong stand on religious freedoms and minority rights . flanked by ecumenical patriarch bartholomew i after mass at the patriarchal church of st. george , the pontiff complained in a speech that " the process of secularization has weakened the hold of ...
-lrb- christian -rrb- tradition " in europe . " in the face of this reality , we are called , together with all other christian communities , to renew europe 's awareness of its christian roots , traditions and values , giving them new vitality , " he said . his statement came just two days after he reportedly told turkey 's islamist-turned-conservative prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , in what was widely seen as a spectacular u-turn , that he supported turkey 's membership in the european union . turkey in the eu , he had said while still joseph cardinal ratzinger , would be " a grave error ... against the tide of history . " religious freedom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope attended the divine liturgy at istanbul 's st. george 's church in a later joint declaration with bartholomew i , at the risk of once again rubbing up his hosts the wrong way , the pontiff said respect for religious freedom must be a criterion for membership in the eu , which must ensure that its members respect the rights of their religious minorities . it was near-overt backing for the patriarchate 's complaints of restrictions imposed on it by turkey , including the closure of a theological seminary and the confiscation of a number of properties from christian foundations . another bone of contention is turkey 's refusal to recognize bartholomew i as the ecumenical , or universal , leader of about 150 million orthodox faithful around the world . turkey repeated on thursday it has no intention of budging on this issue . " we see the patriarchate as a turkish institution and this is how our laws , too , see it , " said foreign ministry spokesman namik tan .
" other definitions are in no way binding for us .
we have proclaimed to the world that we do not recognize the title ' ecumenical . " ' overcoming the schism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi -lrb- left -rrb- called divisions among christians a " scandal to the world " benedict xvi and bartholomew i have both put reconciliation of the catholic and orthodox churches high on their agendas , and the pope described the schism , which dates back to 1054 , as a " scandal to the world . " but he remained steadfast on a key point of contention between the two rites - papal authority - by referring in his speech to the catholic leader 's " universal responsibility . " gestures of reconciliation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : originally a church , then a mosque , now a museum : hagia sophia in istanbul on thursday evening , benedict xvi became the second pope in history to set foot in a mosque - after john paul ii in damascus in 2001 - when he visited istanbul 's famed blue mosque , coming from the nearby 6th century basilica-museum of hagia sophia . the hagia sophia visit has angered muslim hardliners , who perceive the visit as proof of an effort to reclaim the building - a mosque under ottoman rule before becoming a museum under the republic - as a church . but during his visit to the blue mosque , the pope turned towards mecca in a gesture of muslim prayer , his hands crossed over his stomach , at the suggestion of the muslim cleric accompanying him .
he remained for several seconds with his eyes closed . the pope returns to rome on friday . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reader response : " both east and west can learn from pope " pope benedict xvi visited turkey this week and dw-world.de 's readers wrote in with their thoughts on the pontiff , the reactions from the host country and the need for increased inter-religious dialog .

defense minister franz josef jung gives the impression that he 'd like to quickly put the whole operation behind him .

as the election date in the democratic republic of congo drew ever closer , all germany 's leading politicians were in agreement that a peaceful dr congo could be a stabilizing factor for the entire region .
but sending a bundeswehr deployment to safeguard elections in the framework of the european union ?
then the tenor of the discussion became more restrained . it took many more months of debate before the german government finally did agree : 780 german soldiers were sent to dr congo and gabun .
germany 's condition for participation was that its soldiers would only be deployed in the capital , kinshasa .
pacification of the country 's restive eastern provinces was incumbent upon the united nations mission monuc .
and a large portion of the soldiers deployed were stationed outside dr congo , in gabun . was the bundeswehr 's participation in the mission of a purely symbolic nature ?
certainly not .
the congolese have lauded the german troops ' sober-mindedness and diplomacy .
violent unrest in kinshasa that left 23 dead was quickly allayed due above all to two factors : diplomatic pressure and intervention on the part of eu and un soldiers . but the momentary calm in dr congo is specious .

and in eastern dr congo on monday , un soldiers had used helicopters to block a rebel advance .
thousands of people fled from the violence , which bundeswehr representatives described as an incidental flare-up . in the meantime , bemba has accepted his defeat and resigned himself to a role in the opposition .
a powerful rebel group in the country 's restive east has just announced they would lay down their weapons .
and the fact that the elections proceeded relatively peacefully and fairly is also a positive signal . still , it does n't ensure dr congo a peaceful , democratic future .

but dr congo 's government will only be formed in mid-december .
it would have been important to accompany the inauguration of the new president in africa 's third-largest state .
but the mandate was not meant for that , according to the bundeswehr 's spokesman .
the mission served to safeguard the presidential and parliamentary elections and they were concluded peacefully , he said .

the leaders broached sensitive topics such as kosovo and war criminals currently still at large . chancellor angela merkel met friday with serbian president boris tadic as part of a series of discussions with foreign leaders ahead of germany 's eu presidency starting in january . merkel said before the start of the meeting that she planned to raise the issue of kosovo , a province in southern serbia which has been under united nations administration since 1999 . a decision is due next year on whether the predominantly albanian-populated province should be given some form of independence - a step which serbia strongly opposes .
kosovo albanians , who make up 90 percent of the small province 's population , are demanding independence while serbia is only prepared to grant them autonomy . merkel told tadic that germany was interested in having close relations with serbia and was prepared to help bring it more in line with mainstream europe . war criminal prosecutions required bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the search for war criminals goes on a condition for this was that belgrade " cooperated well " with the international criminal tribunal for former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- in the hague that was prosecuting war crimes in the former yugoslavia , she said . tadic , a member of the pro-western opposition democratic party , said germany was " the key partner " for serbia in europe .
germany is a member of the contact group of foreign powers that has been overseeing peace in the breakaway serbian province of kosovo since the 1998-1999 conflict . the president also thanked merkel for her support at this week 's nato summit in latvia , which offered serbia and its western balkan neighbors bosnia and montenegro a " partnership for peace " -lrb- pfp -rrb- agreement with the alliance . delayed decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian voters backed the new constitution in a referendum tadic 's visit to germany comes at a particularly sensitive moment for his country . the un 's kosovo mediator martti ahtisaari recently decided not to announce his plans for the future of the southern serbian province until after the elections , which tadic had called for jan .

the leaders broached sensitive topics such as kosovo and war criminals currently still at large . chancellor angela merkel met friday with serbian president boris tadic as part of a series of discussions with foreign leaders ahead of germany 's eu presidency starting in january . merkel said before the start of the meeting that she planned to raise the issue of kosovo , a province in southern serbia which has been under united nations administration since 1999 . a decision is due next year on whether the predominantly albanian-populated province should be given some form of independence - a step which serbia strongly opposes .
kosovo albanians , who make up 90 percent of the small province 's population , are demanding independence while serbia is only prepared to grant them autonomy . merkel told tadic that germany was interested in having close relations with serbia and was prepared to help bring it more in line with mainstream europe . war criminal prosecutions required bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the search for war criminals goes on a condition for this was that belgrade " cooperated well " with the international criminal tribunal for former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- in the hague that was prosecuting war crimes in the former yugoslavia , she said . tadic , a member of the pro-western opposition democratic party , said germany was " the key partner " for serbia in europe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 30.11.2006 " jihadism is a greater problem today than it was in 2001 " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police foiled a planned attack on trains in august islamic studies scholar guido steinberg spoke to dw-world.de about the likelihood of a terrorist attack in germany and the need to separate the issue of integration from the fight against terrorism . guido steinberg is an islamic studies scholar and a researcher at the german institute for international and security affairs , in berlin . dw-world.de : several terror attacks were prevented in germany in 2006 .
is germany becoming a greater target for islamist terrorism ? guido steinberg : german security officials are convinced that germany is continually becoming a greater target for islamist terrorists .
and there are indeed indications that that 's the case .
the most important one was the failed attack on two regional trains in north rhine-westphalia in summer 2006 .
it failed because the two bombs packed in suitcases did n't detonate . unfortunately little more is known about the background than that two lebanese men from tripoli and its surrounding were responsible for the deed .
above all , it is unclear to what extent a larger terror organization was behind the two men .
without this information , it 's very difficult to judge to what extent germany is becoming a target .
however , it appears we have to reckon with increased terrorist activities here . what effects could that have on the debate over the responsibility of muslims in germany toward the greater society ?
bildunterschrift : guido steinberg the news of attack plans has already had an effect on the debate about the role of muslims here .
more and more germans view the presence of muslims in germany as a security risk .
thus the debate about the integration of immigrants is in danger of being laden with aspects of fighting terrorism .
this could lead to a stronger polarization , which would damage the long-term aim of the integration of foreigners .
in my opinion , the integration debate and the discussion about fighting terrorism should be strictly separated . the fact that terrorist attacks were prevented in the initial planning stages is a huge success for german security officials .
can terrorism be fought with police resources alone ? the plans for an attack on an airplane were discovered in such an early stage that i believe it 's not even certain the suspects were actually in the planning stage .
in this respect , i 'm not sure whether it actually is a case of success for security officials .
however , this example shows once more that the security officials are closely monitoring at least parts of the militant scene . on the other hand , the case of the suitcase bombers shows that attacks often ca n't be prevented no matter how effectively security officials work .
of course , the resources police and intelligence officials have are inadequate .
fighting terrorism is also - if not primarily - a political task .
one must win over the sympathizers of terrorist groups through political measures .
only in such a way can one prevent terrorist groups from continually recruiting members , financing themselves and operating under the protection of their supporters . many experts hold the ambiguous " jihad " responsible for terrorism .
what 's your assessment of jihad as a mobilizing force ? there is no actual " jihad " but rather various interpretations of it .
jihadists are characterized by having chosen a jihadist concept that centers on armed battle against " non-believers . "
they view everyone who rejects their ideology as non-believers , whether they 're muslims , christians or jews .
muslims are indeed much more often their victims than non-muslims .
this ideology 's ability to mobilize is very strong as has repeatedly been shown by the throngs joining jihadist organizations in recent years , not least here in europe .
jihadism is a greater problem today than it was in 2001 . are the potential terrorists the usual jihadists ?
how would you describe them ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dialog could help to ease tensions there is no such thing as a generic profile of an islamic terrorist .
students and petty criminals are among them , new immigrants and people born here in europe .
in many cases , however , a certain characteristic can be detected , namely " blocked upward mobility . "
young men reach limitations at some point in their history .
for example , they go to university , but still do n't get the job they want .
they immigrate to europe , but are forced to make their way as petty criminals .
individual failure then frequently turns into an aggressive , radical attitude toward society .
then the young men are receptive to militant ideologies . the dialog with muslims is lauded by many but criticized as well .
can a competent dialog serve to prevent islamist terrorism ? a dialog between muslims and greater society can certainly put tensions to rest .
in a process of dialog the government could make clear what it expects of muslims .
muslims , on the other hand , could express their complaints .
my opinion is that germany can certainly take decisive steps against terrorists if it tries at the same time to take measures against the partly accurate impressions of many muslims of being discriminated against here .
to put it shortly : no tolerance in security issues , more openness in religious , cultural areas .
general bans on head scarves or the ban on ritual slaughtering -lrb- of animals -rrb- , for example , could be revoked to make it clear that it is not the west battling islam , but that it is rather exclusively a fight against violent islamists .
such measures could be agreed on in a dialog . aladdin sarhan interviewed guido steinberg -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de terrorists planned plane bombing in germany german prosecutors have launched an investigation into a group that is thought to have started planning a terrorist attack on a german passenger plane last summer .

this could lead to a stronger polarization , which would damage the long-term aim of the integration of foreigners .
in my opinion , the integration debate and the discussion about fighting terrorism should be strictly separated . the fact that terrorist attacks were prevented in the initial planning stages is a huge success for german security officials .
can terrorism be fought with police resources alone ? the plans for an attack on an airplane were discovered in such an early stage that i believe it 's not even certain the suspects were actually in the planning stage .
in this respect , i 'm not sure whether it actually is a case of success for security officials .
however , this example shows once more that the security officials are closely monitoring at least parts of the militant scene . on the other hand , the case of the suitcase bombers shows that attacks often ca n't be prevented no matter how effectively security officials work .
of course , the resources police and intelligence officials have are inadequate .
fighting terrorism is also - if not primarily - a political task .
one must win over the sympathizers of terrorist groups through political measures .
only in such a way can one prevent terrorist groups from continually recruiting members , financing themselves and operating under the protection of their supporters . many experts hold the ambiguous " jihad " responsible for terrorism .

jihadists are characterized by having chosen a jihadist concept that centers on armed battle against " non-believers . "

is germany becoming a greater target for islamist terrorism ? guido steinberg : german security officials are convinced that germany is continually becoming a greater target for islamist terrorists .
and there are indeed indications that that 's the case .
the most important one was the failed attack on two regional trains in north rhine-westphalia in summer 2006 .
it failed because the two bombs packed in suitcases did n't detonate . unfortunately little more is known about the background than that two lebanese men from tripoli and its surrounding were responsible for the deed .

the leaders broached sensitive topics such as kosovo and war criminals currently still at large . chancellor angela merkel met friday with serbian president boris tadic as part of a series of discussions with foreign leaders ahead of germany 's eu presidency starting in january . merkel said before the start of the meeting that she planned to raise the issue of kosovo , a province in southern serbia which has been under united nations administration since 1999 . a decision is due next year on whether the predominantly albanian-populated province should be given some form of independence - a step which serbia strongly opposes .
kosovo albanians , who make up 90 percent of the small province 's population , are demanding independence while serbia is only prepared to grant them autonomy . merkel told tadic that germany was interested in having close relations with serbia and was prepared to help bring it more in line with mainstream europe . war criminal prosecutions required bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the search for war criminals goes on a condition for this was that belgrade " cooperated well " with the international criminal tribunal for former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- in the hague that was prosecuting war crimes in the former yugoslavia , she said . tadic , a member of the pro-western opposition democratic party , said germany was " the key partner " for serbia in europe .
germany is a member of the contact group of foreign powers that has been overseeing peace in the breakaway serbian province of kosovo since the 1998-1999 conflict . the president also thanked merkel for her support at this week 's nato summit in latvia , which offered serbia and its western balkan neighbors bosnia and montenegro a " partnership for peace " -lrb- pfp -rrb- agreement with the alliance . delayed decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian voters backed the new constitution in a referendum tadic 's visit to germany comes at a particularly sensitive moment for his country . the un 's kosovo mediator martti ahtisaari recently decided not to announce his plans for the future of the southern serbian province until after the elections , which tadic had called for jan .

" it is excellent news for our citizens , the army and state , " tadic said . tadic admitted that serbia still must arrest fugitive war crime suspects and bring them to justice at the icty . serbia 's failure to arrest the suspects , most of all the bosnian serb general ratko mladic , prompted brussels in may to suspend talks aimed at bringing belgrade closer to eu membership . icty head prosecutor carla del ponte , who has been pressing the west to isolate serbia over war crime fugitives , was disappointed with the decision in riga , her spokesman said in the hague . dw staff / afp , dpa -lrb- tt / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de serbia : getting the media on the right track since 2000 , the eu has poured millions of euros into various media projects in serbia .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 30.11.2006 " jihadism is a greater problem today than it was in 2001 " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police foiled a planned attack on trains in august islamic studies scholar guido steinberg spoke to dw-world.de about the likelihood of a terrorist attack in germany and the need to separate the issue of integration from the fight against terrorism . guido steinberg is an islamic studies scholar and a researcher at the german institute for international and security affairs , in berlin . dw-world.de : several terror attacks were prevented in germany in 2006 .
is germany becoming a greater target for islamist terrorism ? guido steinberg : german security officials are convinced that germany is continually becoming a greater target for islamist terrorists .
and there are indeed indications that that 's the case .
the most important one was the failed attack on two regional trains in north rhine-westphalia in summer 2006 .
it failed because the two bombs packed in suitcases did n't detonate . unfortunately little more is known about the background than that two lebanese men from tripoli and its surrounding were responsible for the deed .
above all , it is unclear to what extent a larger terror organization was behind the two men .
without this information , it 's very difficult to judge to what extent germany is becoming a target .
however , it appears we have to reckon with increased terrorist activities here . what effects could that have on the debate over the responsibility of muslims in germany toward the greater society ?
bildunterschrift : guido steinberg the news of attack plans has already had an effect on the debate about the role of muslims here .
more and more germans view the presence of muslims in germany as a security risk .
thus the debate about the integration of immigrants is in danger of being laden with aspects of fighting terrorism .
this could lead to a stronger polarization , which would damage the long-term aim of the integration of foreigners .
in my opinion , the integration debate and the discussion about fighting terrorism should be strictly separated . the fact that terrorist attacks were prevented in the initial planning stages is a huge success for german security officials .
can terrorism be fought with police resources alone ? the plans for an attack on an airplane were discovered in such an early stage that i believe it 's not even certain the suspects were actually in the planning stage .
in this respect , i 'm not sure whether it actually is a case of success for security officials .
however , this example shows once more that the security officials are closely monitoring at least parts of the militant scene . on the other hand , the case of the suitcase bombers shows that attacks often ca n't be prevented no matter how effectively security officials work .
of course , the resources police and intelligence officials have are inadequate .
fighting terrorism is also - if not primarily - a political task .
one must win over the sympathizers of terrorist groups through political measures .
only in such a way can one prevent terrorist groups from continually recruiting members , financing themselves and operating under the protection of their supporters . many experts hold the ambiguous " jihad " responsible for terrorism .
what 's your assessment of jihad as a mobilizing force ? there is no actual " jihad " but rather various interpretations of it .
jihadists are characterized by having chosen a jihadist concept that centers on armed battle against " non-believers . "
they view everyone who rejects their ideology as non-believers , whether they 're muslims , christians or jews .
muslims are indeed much more often their victims than non-muslims .
this ideology 's ability to mobilize is very strong as has repeatedly been shown by the throngs joining jihadist organizations in recent years , not least here in europe .
jihadism is a greater problem today than it was in 2001 . are the potential terrorists the usual jihadists ?
how would you describe them ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dialog could help to ease tensions there is no such thing as a generic profile of an islamic terrorist .
students and petty criminals are among them , new immigrants and people born here in europe .
in many cases , however , a certain characteristic can be detected , namely " blocked upward mobility . "
young men reach limitations at some point in their history .
for example , they go to university , but still do n't get the job they want .
they immigrate to europe , but are forced to make their way as petty criminals .
individual failure then frequently turns into an aggressive , radical attitude toward society .
then the young men are receptive to militant ideologies . the dialog with muslims is lauded by many but criticized as well .
can a competent dialog serve to prevent islamist terrorism ? a dialog between muslims and greater society can certainly put tensions to rest .
in a process of dialog the government could make clear what it expects of muslims .
muslims , on the other hand , could express their complaints .
my opinion is that germany can certainly take decisive steps against terrorists if it tries at the same time to take measures against the partly accurate impressions of many muslims of being discriminated against here .
to put it shortly : no tolerance in security issues , more openness in religious , cultural areas .
general bans on head scarves or the ban on ritual slaughtering -lrb- of animals -rrb- , for example , could be revoked to make it clear that it is not the west battling islam , but that it is rather exclusively a fight against violent islamists .
such measures could be agreed on in a dialog . aladdin sarhan interviewed guido steinberg -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de terrorists planned plane bombing in germany german prosecutors have launched an investigation into a group that is thought to have started planning a terrorist attack on a german passenger plane last summer .

but she warned that measures such as video surveillance were n't enough .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 30.11.2006 reader response : " both east and west can learn from pope " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope celebrated mass in ephesus , turkey , during his four-day visit pope benedict xvi visited turkey this week and dw-world.de 's readers wrote in with their thoughts on the pontiff , the reactions from the host country and the need for increased inter-religious dialog . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . i hope pope benedict 's visit turns out to be safe and satisfying for both sides in terms of the messages given for improved dialogue , understanding and support .
i expect that such a visit should set an example in bringing these cultures closer together , increasing mutual familiarity , decreasing fear and distrust .
both the western world , especially the us and the eu , and the eastern world , especially the extremist islamist groups , should closely follow this example and consider more moderation in their policies . - ege yildirim , turkish student in new york i think that -lrb- the pope -rrb- will move the roman catholic church closer to the orthodox church .
he is tactful , respectful , humble , and knowledgeable , and that is appreciated .
as for the muslims , no one can mend fences if there is no willingness for dialogue .
i feel that if the press judges the pope based on what he will accomplish in that matter , he will be misjudged .
everything one can do in some situations is to defend the truth . - elisabeth heptner , usa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's pm erdogan met briefly with the pope , though the visit was supposedly not political the pontiff 's visit has extreme ramifications for all organized religions around the world .
there needs to be more dialog , compassion , and understanding if religion is to survive .
the common thread between all the devotions is the communication and ability of the religious forces to help keep peace in the world .
it is within this universal compromise that all religious thought is correct and there is no one way to believe in the power of the universe , however you define it .
this attempt by the pope is noble and important .
i believe many feel this way , but there are those who do not .
we pray for them and perhaps they will see the light . - j. greenspan i am a german and a muslim .
the utterances of the pope did not disturb me , as he cited history .
the catholic church is anti-everything -lrb- except for their wrongdoings against choir-boys -rrb- .
on the other hand we muslims have to respect that we are all children of the same yahweh / god / allah and that includes the jews , who are by heritance the direct brothers of the arabs . - harm g. frey the raging crowds in turkey are angry and it 's their own fault .
they are the hateful ones and the intolerant ones .
there can be no dialogue until the angry crowds cool off and realize that they are wrong , not the pope . - f rank garlo by their very actions turkish muslims confirm that the papal quotes from a 14th century figure apply just as much to their culture today .
hopefully relations with orthodox christians will continue to improve .
i can see no animosity between orthodox and catholic christians at an individual level .
that happy state of affairs needs to be " ratified " by the religious institutions concerned .
i think we should all pray for the pope 's safety . - george j. berkowski bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dialog with the orthodox christians was a major reason for the trip when turks and turkish media meet this man they will begin to listen - not like the last time , when they went off crackers because they did not understand the nature of exploratory theological reminiscences .
their reaction was extremely disappointing and fed the voracious western media , whose take then bled into those within the muslim world who still see no option but to be hostile to any christian initiative .
the closed muslim mind is almost a greater threat to a world coalition of culture , religious values and - ultimately - economic interests .
the west awaits a muslim renaissance , which will take nothing from its integrity but merely express its participation in the human story .
perceived threats of a world dominated by us financial interests will be allayed with a joint financial venture between the enormous wealth of the oil-rich middle east and the west . in my country , australia , we have a noble history of reconciliation with the turkish people whose land our heroic military forces invaded at gallipoli in 1915 .
ataturk himself said in effect that the mothers of the australian dead need not mourn because the turkish people would honour the australian soldiers who lay on their land : they would harbour them .
and over the last twenty years my city of melbourne has received tens of thousands of turkish immigrants who build mosques and businesses and even sent one daughter to the rather expensive roman catholic school where i teach .
christianity has no borders .
we are brought up -lrb- most of us -rrb- in the belief that samaritans are the first instructors to us of who is a human being and thus worthy of honour and protection . - herbie , melbourne , australia compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope 's trip to turkey starts on conciliatory note pope benedict xvi began a delicate mission to turkey , trading conciliatory gestures with prime minister recep tayyip erdogan as both sought to calm the storm unleashed when the pontiff appeared to link islam to violence .
-lrb- 28.11.2006 -rrb- pope 's visit overshadowed by confrontation with islam pope benedict xvi 's visit to turkey to heal a rift with the eastern orthodox church , has been overshadowed by muslim anger over remarks about islam .
muslim turks seek dialogue , but will be monitoring his every word .
-lrb- 27.11.2006 -rrb- opinion : turkey 's unwelcome guest whether the pope likes it or not , his trip to turkey , which starts tuesday , has turned into a confrontation between islam and christianity , dw-tv 's religious correspondent john berwick writes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de peacekeeping -pipe- 30.11.2006 opinion : on time in dr congo , but still out too early großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu peacekeeping mission in dr congo came to an end on thursday .
dw 's stefanie duckstein says it ended too soon . mission completed , mission successful ?
defense minister franz josef jung gives the impression that he 'd like to quickly put the whole operation behind him .
like a mantra - unmistakably and repeatedly - he has asserted that extending the mandate is out of the question . the punctual pullout recalls the tough route to deciding on the mission in the first place .
as the election date in the democratic republic of congo drew ever closer , all germany 's leading politicians were in agreement that a peaceful dr congo could be a stabilizing factor for the entire region .
but sending a bundeswehr deployment to safeguard elections in the framework of the european union ?
then the tenor of the discussion became more restrained . it took many more months of debate before the german government finally did agree : 780 german soldiers were sent to dr congo and gabun .
germany 's condition for participation was that its soldiers would only be deployed in the capital , kinshasa .
pacification of the country 's restive eastern provinces was incumbent upon the united nations mission monuc .
and a large portion of the soldiers deployed were stationed outside dr congo , in gabun . was the bundeswehr 's participation in the mission of a purely symbolic nature ?
certainly not .
the congolese have lauded the german troops ' sober-mindedness and diplomacy .
violent unrest in kinshasa that left 23 dead was quickly allayed due above all to two factors : diplomatic pressure and intervention on the part of eu and un soldiers . but the momentary calm in dr congo is specious .
challenger jean-pierre bemba contested his electoral defeat and lost in court .
previously there had been gun battles between supporters of the opposing camps in kinshasa .
and in eastern dr congo on monday , un soldiers had used helicopters to block a rebel advance .
thousands of people fled from the violence , which bundeswehr representatives described as an incidental flare-up . in the meantime , bemba has accepted his defeat and resigned himself to a role in the opposition .
a powerful rebel group in the country 's restive east has just announced they would lay down their weapons .
and the fact that the elections proceeded relatively peacefully and fairly is also a positive signal . still , it does n't ensure dr congo a peaceful , democratic future .
the people are still the same .
surely , they must be able to keep their country running - especially politicians who should serve as a good example for everyone . it would have been good for dr congo if the eu soldiers ' mission had had a somewhat longer wind .
eufor has formally fulfilled its job .
but dr congo 's government will only be formed in mid-december .
it would have been important to accompany the inauguration of the new president in africa 's third-largest state .
but the mandate was not meant for that , according to the bundeswehr 's spokesman .
the mission served to safeguard the presidential and parliamentary elections and they were concluded peacefully , he said .

retirement will be staggered for those born in the 10 years in between .
an exception to retirement at 67 will also be made for anyone who paid into the security system for 45 years or more . meanwhile , the social security court in kassel ruled to raise pensioners ' long-term care insurance contributions , with both measures triggering claims from the vdk social organization that senior citizens are becoming impoverished . " the barest of insurance " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those born before 1954 fall under the old rules " the government has pushed the retirement age up to 67 as another way of cutting pensions , said vdk president walter hirrlinger . " the pension is being reduced to the barest of insurance , " he said , stressing that the move would have negative repercussions for the younger generation in years to come . in fact , according to the federal statistics office , pensioners are better off than ever with only 2.7 percent of social welfare recipients older than 65 . but hirrlinger also pointed out that raising the retirement age is pointless when over 50 percent of employers will not hire workers over 50 . " politicians are getting ahead of themselves , " he said .
" what they need to do first is make sure that the elderly who can and do work are actually allowed to continue to do so until the age of 65 .
once this has been established , they can start thinking about raising the retirement age . " age discrimination bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's pension system is coming unstuck as it happens , the government has already begun addressing the problem of age discrimination . wednesday also saw labor minister franz müntefering unveil his " initiative 50 + . " the scheme is designed to boost employment options for the elderly and includes the introduction of state subsidies for further training and financial rewards for anyone who takes a job paid less than the would receive in unemployment benefits .
employers , meanwhile , will receive a bonus for hiring staff over 50 for at least one year . " intelligent , far-sighted companies have already realized that a cross-section of generations is a recipe for successful , " müntefering said at the project 's launch , pointing out that business needs the expertise of the elder generation , especially given the current shortage of qualified workers apparent in certain sectors . the minister said he hoped the initiative would result in jobs for 100,000 people . " only 45 percent of over-55s are still working , " he said .

dw 's stefanie duckstein says it ended too soon . mission completed , mission successful ?
defense minister franz josef jung gives the impression that he 'd like to quickly put the whole operation behind him .
like a mantra - unmistakably and repeatedly - he has asserted that extending the mandate is out of the question . the punctual pullout recalls the tough route to deciding on the mission in the first place .
as the election date in the democratic republic of congo drew ever closer , all germany 's leading politicians were in agreement that a peaceful dr congo could be a stabilizing factor for the entire region .
but sending a bundeswehr deployment to safeguard elections in the framework of the european union ?
then the tenor of the discussion became more restrained . it took many more months of debate before the german government finally did agree : 780 german soldiers were sent to dr congo and gabun .
germany 's condition for participation was that its soldiers would only be deployed in the capital , kinshasa .
pacification of the country 's restive eastern provinces was incumbent upon the united nations mission monuc .
and a large portion of the soldiers deployed were stationed outside dr congo , in gabun . was the bundeswehr 's participation in the mission of a purely symbolic nature ?
certainly not .
the congolese have lauded the german troops ' sober-mindedness and diplomacy .
violent unrest in kinshasa that left 23 dead was quickly allayed due above all to two factors : diplomatic pressure and intervention on the part of eu and un soldiers . but the momentary calm in dr congo is specious .
challenger jean-pierre bemba contested his electoral defeat and lost in court .
previously there had been gun battles between supporters of the opposing camps in kinshasa .
and in eastern dr congo on monday , un soldiers had used helicopters to block a rebel advance .
thousands of people fled from the violence , which bundeswehr representatives described as an incidental flare-up . in the meantime , bemba has accepted his defeat and resigned himself to a role in the opposition .
a powerful rebel group in the country 's restive east has just announced they would lay down their weapons .
and the fact that the elections proceeded relatively peacefully and fairly is also a positive signal . still , it does n't ensure dr congo a peaceful , democratic future .
the people are still the same .
surely , they must be able to keep their country running - especially politicians who should serve as a good example for everyone . it would have been good for dr congo if the eu soldiers ' mission had had a somewhat longer wind .
eufor has formally fulfilled its job .
but dr congo 's government will only be formed in mid-december .
it would have been important to accompany the inauguration of the new president in africa 's third-largest state .
but the mandate was not meant for that , according to the bundeswehr 's spokesman .
the mission served to safeguard the presidential and parliamentary elections and they were concluded peacefully , he said .
the mandate was valid for exactly four months and not a day longer . stefanie duckstein is an editor for deutsche welle 's africa service -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german minister not in favor of extending eu congo mandate german troops in congo could be heading home at the end of the year after defense minister franz josef jung said monday that the eu 's mandate for the drc should not be extended past its nov .

pope benedict xvi on thursday put the brakes on his charm offensive in eu-hopeful , muslim majority turkey , stressing europe 's " christian roots " and taking a strong stand on religious freedoms and minority rights . flanked by ecumenical patriarch bartholomew i after mass at the patriarchal church of st. george , the pontiff complained in a speech that " the process of secularization has weakened the hold of ...
-lrb- christian -rrb- tradition " in europe . " in the face of this reality , we are called , together with all other christian communities , to renew europe 's awareness of its christian roots , traditions and values , giving them new vitality , " he said . his statement came just two days after he reportedly told turkey 's islamist-turned-conservative prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , in what was widely seen as a spectacular u-turn , that he supported turkey 's membership in the european union . turkey in the eu , he had said while still joseph cardinal ratzinger , would be " a grave error ... against the tide of history . " religious freedom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope attended the divine liturgy at istanbul 's st. george 's church in a later joint declaration with bartholomew i , at the risk of once again rubbing up his hosts the wrong way , the pontiff said respect for religious freedom must be a criterion for membership in the eu , which must ensure that its members respect the rights of their religious minorities . it was near-overt backing for the patriarchate 's complaints of restrictions imposed on it by turkey , including the closure of a theological seminary and the confiscation of a number of properties from christian foundations . another bone of contention is turkey 's refusal to recognize bartholomew i as the ecumenical , or universal , leader of about 150 million orthodox faithful around the world . turkey repeated on thursday it has no intention of budging on this issue . " we see the patriarchate as a turkish institution and this is how our laws , too , see it , " said foreign ministry spokesman namik tan .
" other definitions are in no way binding for us .

the leaders broached sensitive topics such as kosovo and war criminals currently still at large . chancellor angela merkel met friday with serbian president boris tadic as part of a series of discussions with foreign leaders ahead of germany 's eu presidency starting in january . merkel said before the start of the meeting that she planned to raise the issue of kosovo , a province in southern serbia which has been under united nations administration since 1999 . a decision is due next year on whether the predominantly albanian-populated province should be given some form of independence - a step which serbia strongly opposes .
kosovo albanians , who make up 90 percent of the small province 's population , are demanding independence while serbia is only prepared to grant them autonomy . merkel told tadic that germany was interested in having close relations with serbia and was prepared to help bring it more in line with mainstream europe . war criminal prosecutions required bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the search for war criminals goes on a condition for this was that belgrade " cooperated well " with the international criminal tribunal for former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- in the hague that was prosecuting war crimes in the former yugoslavia , she said . tadic , a member of the pro-western opposition democratic party , said germany was " the key partner " for serbia in europe .
germany is a member of the contact group of foreign powers that has been overseeing peace in the breakaway serbian province of kosovo since the 1998-1999 conflict . the president also thanked merkel for her support at this week 's nato summit in latvia , which offered serbia and its western balkan neighbors bosnia and montenegro a " partnership for peace " -lrb- pfp -rrb- agreement with the alliance . delayed decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian voters backed the new constitution in a referendum tadic 's visit to germany comes at a particularly sensitive moment for his country . the un 's kosovo mediator martti ahtisaari recently decided not to announce his plans for the future of the southern serbian province until after the elections , which tadic had called for jan .
21 . the province has been run by a un mission since 1999 , when a nato bombing campaign ended a crackdown by belgrade on ethnic albanians in kosovo . the serbian parliament recently passed a new constitution - backed by voters in a referendum - that defined the province as an " integral " part of serbia .
but a final un proposal is widely expected to grant kosovo sovereignty . a small step towards the eu membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian president tadic was happy with nato responding to the " partnership for peace " agreement , which nato leaders , grouped at a summit in the latvian capital riga , offered to serbia on wednesday , the serbian president said in a statement that long reforms had paid off . " it is excellent news for our citizens , the army and state , " tadic said . tadic admitted that serbia still must arrest fugitive war crime suspects and bring them to justice at the icty . serbia 's failure to arrest the suspects , most of all the bosnian serb general ratko mladic , prompted brussels in may to suspend talks aimed at bringing belgrade closer to eu membership . icty head prosecutor carla del ponte , who has been pressing the west to isolate serbia over war crime fugitives , was disappointed with the decision in riga , her spokesman said in the hague . dw staff / afp , dpa -lrb- tt / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de serbia : getting the media on the right track since 2000 , the eu has poured millions of euros into various media projects in serbia .

" intelligent , far-sighted companies have already realized that a cross-section of generations is a recipe for successful , " müntefering said at the project 's launch , pointing out that business needs the expertise of the elder generation , especially given the current shortage of qualified workers apparent in certain sectors . the minister said he hoped the initiative would result in jobs for 100,000 people .

" politicians are getting ahead of themselves , " he said .

is germany becoming a greater target for islamist terrorism ? guido steinberg : german security officials are convinced that germany is continually becoming a greater target for islamist terrorists .
and there are indeed indications that that 's the case .
the most important one was the failed attack on two regional trains in north rhine-westphalia in summer 2006 .
it failed because the two bombs packed in suitcases did n't detonate . unfortunately little more is known about the background than that two lebanese men from tripoli and its surrounding were responsible for the deed .
above all , it is unclear to what extent a larger terror organization was behind the two men .
without this information , it 's very difficult to judge to what extent germany is becoming a target .
however , it appears we have to reckon with increased terrorist activities here . what effects could that have on the debate over the responsibility of muslims in germany toward the greater society ?
bildunterschrift : guido steinberg the news of attack plans has already had an effect on the debate about the role of muslims here .
more and more germans view the presence of muslims in germany as a security risk .
thus the debate about the integration of immigrants is in danger of being laden with aspects of fighting terrorism .
this could lead to a stronger polarization , which would damage the long-term aim of the integration of foreigners .
in my opinion , the integration debate and the discussion about fighting terrorism should be strictly separated . the fact that terrorist attacks were prevented in the initial planning stages is a huge success for german security officials .
can terrorism be fought with police resources alone ? the plans for an attack on an airplane were discovered in such an early stage that i believe it 's not even certain the suspects were actually in the planning stage .
in this respect , i 'm not sure whether it actually is a case of success for security officials .
however , this example shows once more that the security officials are closely monitoring at least parts of the militant scene . on the other hand , the case of the suitcase bombers shows that attacks often ca n't be prevented no matter how effectively security officials work .
of course , the resources police and intelligence officials have are inadequate .
fighting terrorism is also - if not primarily - a political task .
one must win over the sympathizers of terrorist groups through political measures .
only in such a way can one prevent terrorist groups from continually recruiting members , financing themselves and operating under the protection of their supporters . many experts hold the ambiguous " jihad " responsible for terrorism .
what 's your assessment of jihad as a mobilizing force ? there is no actual " jihad " but rather various interpretations of it .
jihadists are characterized by having chosen a jihadist concept that centers on armed battle against " non-believers . "
they view everyone who rejects their ideology as non-believers , whether they 're muslims , christians or jews .
muslims are indeed much more often their victims than non-muslims .
this ideology 's ability to mobilize is very strong as has repeatedly been shown by the throngs joining jihadist organizations in recent years , not least here in europe .
jihadism is a greater problem today than it was in 2001 . are the potential terrorists the usual jihadists ?
how would you describe them ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dialog could help to ease tensions there is no such thing as a generic profile of an islamic terrorist .
students and petty criminals are among them , new immigrants and people born here in europe .

they immigrate to europe , but are forced to make their way as petty criminals .
individual failure then frequently turns into an aggressive , radical attitude toward society .
then the young men are receptive to militant ideologies . the dialog with muslims is lauded by many but criticized as well .
can a competent dialog serve to prevent islamist terrorism ? a dialog between muslims and greater society can certainly put tensions to rest .
in a process of dialog the government could make clear what it expects of muslims .
muslims , on the other hand , could express their complaints .
my opinion is that germany can certainly take decisive steps against terrorists if it tries at the same time to take measures against the partly accurate impressions of many muslims of being discriminated against here .
to put it shortly : no tolerance in security issues , more openness in religious , cultural areas .
general bans on head scarves or the ban on ritual slaughtering -lrb- of animals -rrb- , for example , could be revoked to make it clear that it is not the west battling islam , but that it is rather exclusively a fight against violent islamists .

retirement will be staggered for those born in the 10 years in between .
an exception to retirement at 67 will also be made for anyone who paid into the security system for 45 years or more . meanwhile , the social security court in kassel ruled to raise pensioners ' long-term care insurance contributions , with both measures triggering claims from the vdk social organization that senior citizens are becoming impoverished . " the barest of insurance " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those born before 1954 fall under the old rules " the government has pushed the retirement age up to 67 as another way of cutting pensions , said vdk president walter hirrlinger . " the pension is being reduced to the barest of insurance , " he said , stressing that the move would have negative repercussions for the younger generation in years to come . in fact , according to the federal statistics office , pensioners are better off than ever with only 2.7 percent of social welfare recipients older than 65 . but hirrlinger also pointed out that raising the retirement age is pointless when over 50 percent of employers will not hire workers over 50 . " politicians are getting ahead of themselves , " he said .
" what they need to do first is make sure that the elderly who can and do work are actually allowed to continue to do so until the age of 65 .
once this has been established , they can start thinking about raising the retirement age . " age discrimination bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's pension system is coming unstuck as it happens , the government has already begun addressing the problem of age discrimination . wednesday also saw labor minister franz müntefering unveil his " initiative 50 + . " the scheme is designed to boost employment options for the elderly and includes the introduction of state subsidies for further training and financial rewards for anyone who takes a job paid less than the would receive in unemployment benefits .
employers , meanwhile , will receive a bonus for hiring staff over 50 for at least one year . " intelligent , far-sighted companies have already realized that a cross-section of generations is a recipe for successful , " müntefering said at the project 's launch , pointing out that business needs the expertise of the elder generation , especially given the current shortage of qualified workers apparent in certain sectors . the minister said he hoped the initiative would result in jobs for 100,000 people . " only 45 percent of over-55s are still working , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 30.11.2006 " jihadism is a greater problem today than it was in 2001 " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police foiled a planned attack on trains in august islamic studies scholar guido steinberg spoke to dw-world.de about the likelihood of a terrorist attack in germany and the need to separate the issue of integration from the fight against terrorism . guido steinberg is an islamic studies scholar and a researcher at the german institute for international and security affairs , in berlin . dw-world.de : several terror attacks were prevented in germany in 2006 .
is germany becoming a greater target for islamist terrorism ? guido steinberg : german security officials are convinced that germany is continually becoming a greater target for islamist terrorists .
and there are indeed indications that that 's the case .
the most important one was the failed attack on two regional trains in north rhine-westphalia in summer 2006 .
it failed because the two bombs packed in suitcases did n't detonate . unfortunately little more is known about the background than that two lebanese men from tripoli and its surrounding were responsible for the deed .
above all , it is unclear to what extent a larger terror organization was behind the two men .
without this information , it 's very difficult to judge to what extent germany is becoming a target .
however , it appears we have to reckon with increased terrorist activities here . what effects could that have on the debate over the responsibility of muslims in germany toward the greater society ?
bildunterschrift : guido steinberg the news of attack plans has already had an effect on the debate about the role of muslims here .
more and more germans view the presence of muslims in germany as a security risk .
thus the debate about the integration of immigrants is in danger of being laden with aspects of fighting terrorism .
this could lead to a stronger polarization , which would damage the long-term aim of the integration of foreigners .
in my opinion , the integration debate and the discussion about fighting terrorism should be strictly separated . the fact that terrorist attacks were prevented in the initial planning stages is a huge success for german security officials .
can terrorism be fought with police resources alone ? the plans for an attack on an airplane were discovered in such an early stage that i believe it 's not even certain the suspects were actually in the planning stage .
in this respect , i 'm not sure whether it actually is a case of success for security officials .
however , this example shows once more that the security officials are closely monitoring at least parts of the militant scene . on the other hand , the case of the suitcase bombers shows that attacks often ca n't be prevented no matter how effectively security officials work .
of course , the resources police and intelligence officials have are inadequate .
fighting terrorism is also - if not primarily - a political task .
one must win over the sympathizers of terrorist groups through political measures .
only in such a way can one prevent terrorist groups from continually recruiting members , financing themselves and operating under the protection of their supporters . many experts hold the ambiguous " jihad " responsible for terrorism .
what 's your assessment of jihad as a mobilizing force ? there is no actual " jihad " but rather various interpretations of it .
jihadists are characterized by having chosen a jihadist concept that centers on armed battle against " non-believers . "
they view everyone who rejects their ideology as non-believers , whether they 're muslims , christians or jews .
muslims are indeed much more often their victims than non-muslims .
this ideology 's ability to mobilize is very strong as has repeatedly been shown by the throngs joining jihadist organizations in recent years , not least here in europe .
jihadism is a greater problem today than it was in 2001 . are the potential terrorists the usual jihadists ?
how would you describe them ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dialog could help to ease tensions there is no such thing as a generic profile of an islamic terrorist .
students and petty criminals are among them , new immigrants and people born here in europe .
in many cases , however , a certain characteristic can be detected , namely " blocked upward mobility . "
young men reach limitations at some point in their history .
for example , they go to university , but still do n't get the job they want .
they immigrate to europe , but are forced to make their way as petty criminals .
individual failure then frequently turns into an aggressive , radical attitude toward society .
then the young men are receptive to militant ideologies . the dialog with muslims is lauded by many but criticized as well .
can a competent dialog serve to prevent islamist terrorism ? a dialog between muslims and greater society can certainly put tensions to rest .
in a process of dialog the government could make clear what it expects of muslims .
muslims , on the other hand , could express their complaints .
my opinion is that germany can certainly take decisive steps against terrorists if it tries at the same time to take measures against the partly accurate impressions of many muslims of being discriminated against here .
to put it shortly : no tolerance in security issues , more openness in religious , cultural areas .
general bans on head scarves or the ban on ritual slaughtering -lrb- of animals -rrb- , for example , could be revoked to make it clear that it is not the west battling islam , but that it is rather exclusively a fight against violent islamists .
such measures could be agreed on in a dialog . aladdin sarhan interviewed guido steinberg -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de terrorists planned plane bombing in germany german prosecutors have launched an investigation into a group that is thought to have started planning a terrorist attack on a german passenger plane last summer .

dw 's stefanie duckstein says it ended too soon . mission completed , mission successful ?
defense minister franz josef jung gives the impression that he 'd like to quickly put the whole operation behind him .
like a mantra - unmistakably and repeatedly - he has asserted that extending the mandate is out of the question . the punctual pullout recalls the tough route to deciding on the mission in the first place .
as the election date in the democratic republic of congo drew ever closer , all germany 's leading politicians were in agreement that a peaceful dr congo could be a stabilizing factor for the entire region .
but sending a bundeswehr deployment to safeguard elections in the framework of the european union ?
then the tenor of the discussion became more restrained . it took many more months of debate before the german government finally did agree : 780 german soldiers were sent to dr congo and gabun .
germany 's condition for participation was that its soldiers would only be deployed in the capital , kinshasa .
pacification of the country 's restive eastern provinces was incumbent upon the united nations mission monuc .
and a large portion of the soldiers deployed were stationed outside dr congo , in gabun . was the bundeswehr 's participation in the mission of a purely symbolic nature ?
certainly not .
the congolese have lauded the german troops ' sober-mindedness and diplomacy .
violent unrest in kinshasa that left 23 dead was quickly allayed due above all to two factors : diplomatic pressure and intervention on the part of eu and un soldiers . but the momentary calm in dr congo is specious .
challenger jean-pierre bemba contested his electoral defeat and lost in court .
previously there had been gun battles between supporters of the opposing camps in kinshasa .
and in eastern dr congo on monday , un soldiers had used helicopters to block a rebel advance .
thousands of people fled from the violence , which bundeswehr representatives described as an incidental flare-up . in the meantime , bemba has accepted his defeat and resigned himself to a role in the opposition .
a powerful rebel group in the country 's restive east has just announced they would lay down their weapons .
and the fact that the elections proceeded relatively peacefully and fairly is also a positive signal . still , it does n't ensure dr congo a peaceful , democratic future .
the people are still the same .
surely , they must be able to keep their country running - especially politicians who should serve as a good example for everyone . it would have been good for dr congo if the eu soldiers ' mission had had a somewhat longer wind .
eufor has formally fulfilled its job .
but dr congo 's government will only be formed in mid-december .
it would have been important to accompany the inauguration of the new president in africa 's third-largest state .
but the mandate was not meant for that , according to the bundeswehr 's spokesman .
the mission served to safeguard the presidential and parliamentary elections and they were concluded peacefully , he said .
the mandate was valid for exactly four months and not a day longer . stefanie duckstein is an editor for deutsche welle 's africa service -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german minister not in favor of extending eu congo mandate german troops in congo could be heading home at the end of the year after defense minister franz josef jung said monday that the eu 's mandate for the drc should not be extended past its nov .

as the election date in the democratic republic of congo drew ever closer , all germany 's leading politicians were in agreement that a peaceful dr congo could be a stabilizing factor for the entire region .
but sending a bundeswehr deployment to safeguard elections in the framework of the european union ?
then the tenor of the discussion became more restrained . it took many more months of debate before the german government finally did agree : 780 german soldiers were sent to dr congo and gabun .
germany 's condition for participation was that its soldiers would only be deployed in the capital , kinshasa .
pacification of the country 's restive eastern provinces was incumbent upon the united nations mission monuc .
and a large portion of the soldiers deployed were stationed outside dr congo , in gabun . was the bundeswehr 's participation in the mission of a purely symbolic nature ?
certainly not .
the congolese have lauded the german troops ' sober-mindedness and diplomacy .
violent unrest in kinshasa that left 23 dead was quickly allayed due above all to two factors : diplomatic pressure and intervention on the part of eu and un soldiers . but the momentary calm in dr congo is specious .
challenger jean-pierre bemba contested his electoral defeat and lost in court .
previously there had been gun battles between supporters of the opposing camps in kinshasa .
and in eastern dr congo on monday , un soldiers had used helicopters to block a rebel advance .
thousands of people fled from the violence , which bundeswehr representatives described as an incidental flare-up . in the meantime , bemba has accepted his defeat and resigned himself to a role in the opposition .
a powerful rebel group in the country 's restive east has just announced they would lay down their weapons .
and the fact that the elections proceeded relatively peacefully and fairly is also a positive signal . still , it does n't ensure dr congo a peaceful , democratic future .
the people are still the same .
surely , they must be able to keep their country running - especially politicians who should serve as a good example for everyone . it would have been good for dr congo if the eu soldiers ' mission had had a somewhat longer wind .
eufor has formally fulfilled its job .
but dr congo 's government will only be formed in mid-december .
it would have been important to accompany the inauguration of the new president in africa 's third-largest state .
but the mandate was not meant for that , according to the bundeswehr 's spokesman .
the mission served to safeguard the presidential and parliamentary elections and they were concluded peacefully , he said .
the mandate was valid for exactly four months and not a day longer . stefanie duckstein is an editor for deutsche welle 's africa service -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german minister not in favor of extending eu congo mandate german troops in congo could be heading home at the end of the year after defense minister franz josef jung said monday that the eu 's mandate for the drc should not be extended past its nov .
30 deadline .
-lrb- 26.09.2006 -rrb- eu peacekeepers intervene for first time in dr congo skirmishes between president kabila 's troops and rebel fighters began sunday when election results were announced .
eu and un troops stepped in when the fighting escalated and foreign diplomats were caught under fire .
-lrb- 22.08.2006 -rrb- experts say eu mission in dr congo is merely symbolic some 2,000 european troops , including 780 germans , will help safeguard the elections in dr congo .
government officials see the deployment as an important peacekeeping effort , but most experts call it a symbolic gesture .

pope benedict xvi on thursday put the brakes on his charm offensive in eu-hopeful , muslim majority turkey , stressing europe 's " christian roots " and taking a strong stand on religious freedoms and minority rights . flanked by ecumenical patriarch bartholomew i after mass at the patriarchal church of st. george , the pontiff complained in a speech that " the process of secularization has weakened the hold of ...
-lrb- christian -rrb- tradition " in europe . " in the face of this reality , we are called , together with all other christian communities , to renew europe 's awareness of its christian roots , traditions and values , giving them new vitality , " he said . his statement came just two days after he reportedly told turkey 's islamist-turned-conservative prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , in what was widely seen as a spectacular u-turn , that he supported turkey 's membership in the european union . turkey in the eu , he had said while still joseph cardinal ratzinger , would be " a grave error ... against the tide of history . " religious freedom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope attended the divine liturgy at istanbul 's st. george 's church in a later joint declaration with bartholomew i , at the risk of once again rubbing up his hosts the wrong way , the pontiff said respect for religious freedom must be a criterion for membership in the eu , which must ensure that its members respect the rights of their religious minorities . it was near-overt backing for the patriarchate 's complaints of restrictions imposed on it by turkey , including the closure of a theological seminary and the confiscation of a number of properties from christian foundations . another bone of contention is turkey 's refusal to recognize bartholomew i as the ecumenical , or universal , leader of about 150 million orthodox faithful around the world . turkey repeated on thursday it has no intention of budging on this issue . " we see the patriarchate as a turkish institution and this is how our laws , too , see it , " said foreign ministry spokesman namik tan .
" other definitions are in no way binding for us .
we have proclaimed to the world that we do not recognize the title ' ecumenical . " ' overcoming the schism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi -lrb- left -rrb- called divisions among christians a " scandal to the world " benedict xvi and bartholomew i have both put reconciliation of the catholic and orthodox churches high on their agendas , and the pope described the schism , which dates back to 1054 , as a " scandal to the world . " but he remained steadfast on a key point of contention between the two rites - papal authority - by referring in his speech to the catholic leader 's " universal responsibility . " gestures of reconciliation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : originally a church , then a mosque , now a museum : hagia sophia in istanbul on thursday evening , benedict xvi became the second pope in history to set foot in a mosque - after john paul ii in damascus in 2001 - when he visited istanbul 's famed blue mosque , coming from the nearby 6th century basilica-museum of hagia sophia . the hagia sophia visit has angered muslim hardliners , who perceive the visit as proof of an effort to reclaim the building - a mosque under ottoman rule before becoming a museum under the republic - as a church . but during his visit to the blue mosque , the pope turned towards mecca in a gesture of muslim prayer , his hands crossed over his stomach , at the suggestion of the muslim cleric accompanying him .

pope benedict xvi on thursday put the brakes on his charm offensive in eu-hopeful , muslim majority turkey , stressing europe 's " christian roots " and taking a strong stand on religious freedoms and minority rights . flanked by ecumenical patriarch bartholomew i after mass at the patriarchal church of st. george , the pontiff complained in a speech that " the process of secularization has weakened the hold of ...
-lrb- christian -rrb- tradition " in europe . " in the face of this reality , we are called , together with all other christian communities , to renew europe 's awareness of its christian roots , traditions and values , giving them new vitality , " he said . his statement came just two days after he reportedly told turkey 's islamist-turned-conservative prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , in what was widely seen as a spectacular u-turn , that he supported turkey 's membership in the european union . turkey in the eu , he had said while still joseph cardinal ratzinger , would be " a grave error ... against the tide of history . " religious freedom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope attended the divine liturgy at istanbul 's st. george 's church in a later joint declaration with bartholomew i , at the risk of once again rubbing up his hosts the wrong way , the pontiff said respect for religious freedom must be a criterion for membership in the eu , which must ensure that its members respect the rights of their religious minorities . it was near-overt backing for the patriarchate 's complaints of restrictions imposed on it by turkey , including the closure of a theological seminary and the confiscation of a number of properties from christian foundations . another bone of contention is turkey 's refusal to recognize bartholomew i as the ecumenical , or universal , leader of about 150 million orthodox faithful around the world . turkey repeated on thursday it has no intention of budging on this issue . " we see the patriarchate as a turkish institution and this is how our laws , too , see it , " said foreign ministry spokesman namik tan .
" other definitions are in no way binding for us .
we have proclaimed to the world that we do not recognize the title ' ecumenical . " ' overcoming the schism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi -lrb- left -rrb- called divisions among christians a " scandal to the world " benedict xvi and bartholomew i have both put reconciliation of the catholic and orthodox churches high on their agendas , and the pope described the schism , which dates back to 1054 , as a " scandal to the world . " but he remained steadfast on a key point of contention between the two rites - papal authority - by referring in his speech to the catholic leader 's " universal responsibility . " gestures of reconciliation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : originally a church , then a mosque , now a museum : hagia sophia in istanbul on thursday evening , benedict xvi became the second pope in history to set foot in a mosque - after john paul ii in damascus in 2001 - when he visited istanbul 's famed blue mosque , coming from the nearby 6th century basilica-museum of hagia sophia . the hagia sophia visit has angered muslim hardliners , who perceive the visit as proof of an effort to reclaim the building - a mosque under ottoman rule before becoming a museum under the republic - as a church . but during his visit to the blue mosque , the pope turned towards mecca in a gesture of muslim prayer , his hands crossed over his stomach , at the suggestion of the muslim cleric accompanying him .

two other locations are being searched . britain 's domestic press association news agency said it understood a number of litvinenko 's friends and family had also been tested , including berezovsky , but they are said to be in " perfect health . " the british daily telegraph newspaper reported that the polonium 210 that killed litvinenko had been dropped on the floor of a london hotel room , according to a senior government official . the paper also claimed that british scientists were believed to have identified the nuclear plant where the substance had been produced . the fact that 47 of the ba flights were between moscow and london reinforced " the theory that the origin of this material that killed alexander in moscow , " said litvinenko 's friend alex goldfarb in london . anti-terrorist investigators believe the substance was brought to london from moscow in the week before litvinenko 's death .

experts fear germany could face a shortage of qualified university graduates if the trend continues . according to the latest figures from the federal statistics office , the number of new students enrolling at university has dropped for the third year running , despite the rise in the number of school leavers graduating with a high school diploma . german universities registered 343,700 new students this year , 3.5 percent fewer than last year . as german research and education minister annette schavan pointed out in response to the survey , the development is particularly worrying given germany 's need for academics and the overall brain drain of recent years . the biggest declines come in the fields of engineering , technology and computer studies .
over all , the number of school-leavers opting for further education at universities and colleges in 2006 fell to 35.5 percent - short of the german government 's target of 40 percent . what 's behind the drop ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : too many courses are hard to get into the report cites several reasons for the decline .
one sticking point is that german states have tightened up entry requirements , and another is that many courses are available to a limited number of students .
first and foremost , however , is the fact that new students are being deterred by the introduction of higher education fees . " this is a slap in the face for the government , " achim meyer auf der heyde of the german students association told berlin 's daily taz , adding that education politicians should ask themselves whether the introduction of university fees and reduced students grants has sent the " wrong signals . " across the country , many students are simply refusing to pay up .
the action group against student fees hopes to have recruited some 400,000 students over the next 12 months , and many have the support of the universities themselves . but schavan told the handelsblatt newspaper on thursday that the introduction of fees was not behind the overall drop in students choosing to attend university as increasing numbers of students are enrolling in bavaria and hamburg 's universities despite students fee in place there . regional differences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students protested against the introduction of tuition fees the federal statistics office also pointed out that differences in enrollment numbers vary according from state to state .
saxony has 13 percent fewer new students , while baden württemberg and north rhine westphalia saw a drop of 10 percent . in eastern germany , many fear the current development is just the thin end of the wedge and that students are dying breed . " universities in eastern germany need to become better-known and more attractive , " said dieter dohmen , director of the berlin research institute for education and social economics .
" they especially need to attract more women . " women make up 49 percent of students in this part of the country compared to almost 60 percent in western germany , he said . optimism among graduates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students said they feel good about the future another study published this month revealed that german students are optimistic about the future , with 60 percent saying they are confident they will get a job . published by the center of human resources information systems , it questioned over 11,000 people about their employment prospects and established that graduates , especially those with degrees in economics and engineering , feel more upbeat about their professional lives than others . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german education an export hit in the arab world while germans continue to bemoan their educational system , german higher education is being successfully exported to the arab world .

both the western world , especially the us and the eu , and the eastern world , especially the extremist islamist groups , should closely follow this example and consider more moderation in their policies . - ege yildirim , turkish student in new york i think that -lrb- the pope -rrb- will move the roman catholic church closer to the orthodox church .
he is tactful , respectful , humble , and knowledgeable , and that is appreciated .
as for the muslims , no one can mend fences if there is no willingness for dialogue .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . i hope pope benedict 's visit turns out to be safe and satisfying for both sides in terms of the messages given for improved dialogue , understanding and support .
i expect that such a visit should set an example in bringing these cultures closer together , increasing mutual familiarity , decreasing fear and distrust .
both the western world , especially the us and the eu , and the eastern world , especially the extremist islamist groups , should closely follow this example and consider more moderation in their policies . - ege yildirim , turkish student in new york i think that -lrb- the pope -rrb- will move the roman catholic church closer to the orthodox church .
he is tactful , respectful , humble , and knowledgeable , and that is appreciated .
as for the muslims , no one can mend fences if there is no willingness for dialogue .
i feel that if the press judges the pope based on what he will accomplish in that matter , he will be misjudged .
everything one can do in some situations is to defend the truth . - elisabeth heptner , usa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's pm erdogan met briefly with the pope , though the visit was supposedly not political the pontiff 's visit has extreme ramifications for all organized religions around the world .
there needs to be more dialog , compassion , and understanding if religion is to survive .
the common thread between all the devotions is the communication and ability of the religious forces to help keep peace in the world .
it is within this universal compromise that all religious thought is correct and there is no one way to believe in the power of the universe , however you define it .
this attempt by the pope is noble and important .
i believe many feel this way , but there are those who do not .
we pray for them and perhaps they will see the light . - j. greenspan i am a german and a muslim .
the utterances of the pope did not disturb me , as he cited history .
the catholic church is anti-everything -lrb- except for their wrongdoings against choir-boys -rrb- .
on the other hand we muslims have to respect that we are all children of the same yahweh / god / allah and that includes the jews , who are by heritance the direct brothers of the arabs . - harm g. frey the raging crowds in turkey are angry and it 's their own fault .
they are the hateful ones and the intolerant ones .
there can be no dialogue until the angry crowds cool off and realize that they are wrong , not the pope . - f rank garlo by their very actions turkish muslims confirm that the papal quotes from a 14th century figure apply just as much to their culture today .
hopefully relations with orthodox christians will continue to improve .
i can see no animosity between orthodox and catholic christians at an individual level .
that happy state of affairs needs to be " ratified " by the religious institutions concerned .
i think we should all pray for the pope 's safety . - george j. berkowski bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dialog with the orthodox christians was a major reason for the trip when turks and turkish media meet this man they will begin to listen - not like the last time , when they went off crackers because they did not understand the nature of exploratory theological reminiscences .
their reaction was extremely disappointing and fed the voracious western media , whose take then bled into those within the muslim world who still see no option but to be hostile to any christian initiative .
the closed muslim mind is almost a greater threat to a world coalition of culture , religious values and - ultimately - economic interests .
the west awaits a muslim renaissance , which will take nothing from its integrity but merely express its participation in the human story .
perceived threats of a world dominated by us financial interests will be allayed with a joint financial venture between the enormous wealth of the oil-rich middle east and the west . in my country , australia , we have a noble history of reconciliation with the turkish people whose land our heroic military forces invaded at gallipoli in 1915 .
ataturk himself said in effect that the mothers of the australian dead need not mourn because the turkish people would honour the australian soldiers who lay on their land : they would harbour them .

retirement will be staggered for those born in the 10 years in between .
an exception to retirement at 67 will also be made for anyone who paid into the security system for 45 years or more . meanwhile , the social security court in kassel ruled to raise pensioners ' long-term care insurance contributions , with both measures triggering claims from the vdk social organization that senior citizens are becoming impoverished . " the barest of insurance " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those born before 1954 fall under the old rules " the government has pushed the retirement age up to 67 as another way of cutting pensions , said vdk president walter hirrlinger . " the pension is being reduced to the barest of insurance , " he said , stressing that the move would have negative repercussions for the younger generation in years to come . in fact , according to the federal statistics office , pensioners are better off than ever with only 2.7 percent of social welfare recipients older than 65 . but hirrlinger also pointed out that raising the retirement age is pointless when over 50 percent of employers will not hire workers over 50 . " politicians are getting ahead of themselves , " he said .
" what they need to do first is make sure that the elderly who can and do work are actually allowed to continue to do so until the age of 65 .
once this has been established , they can start thinking about raising the retirement age . " age discrimination bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's pension system is coming unstuck as it happens , the government has already begun addressing the problem of age discrimination . wednesday also saw labor minister franz müntefering unveil his " initiative 50 + . " the scheme is designed to boost employment options for the elderly and includes the introduction of state subsidies for further training and financial rewards for anyone who takes a job paid less than the would receive in unemployment benefits .
employers , meanwhile , will receive a bonus for hiring staff over 50 for at least one year . " intelligent , far-sighted companies have already realized that a cross-section of generations is a recipe for successful , " müntefering said at the project 's launch , pointing out that business needs the expertise of the elder generation , especially given the current shortage of qualified workers apparent in certain sectors . the minister said he hoped the initiative would result in jobs for 100,000 people . " only 45 percent of over-55s are still working , " he said .

" our goal remains to convince syria to play a constructive role in the middle east , both in terms of the conflict between israelis and palestinians and in particular lebanon , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 30.11.2006 reader response : " both east and west can learn from pope " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope celebrated mass in ephesus , turkey , during his four-day visit pope benedict xvi visited turkey this week and dw-world.de 's readers wrote in with their thoughts on the pontiff , the reactions from the host country and the need for increased inter-religious dialog . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . i hope pope benedict 's visit turns out to be safe and satisfying for both sides in terms of the messages given for improved dialogue , understanding and support .
i expect that such a visit should set an example in bringing these cultures closer together , increasing mutual familiarity , decreasing fear and distrust .
both the western world , especially the us and the eu , and the eastern world , especially the extremist islamist groups , should closely follow this example and consider more moderation in their policies . - ege yildirim , turkish student in new york i think that -lrb- the pope -rrb- will move the roman catholic church closer to the orthodox church .
he is tactful , respectful , humble , and knowledgeable , and that is appreciated .
as for the muslims , no one can mend fences if there is no willingness for dialogue .
i feel that if the press judges the pope based on what he will accomplish in that matter , he will be misjudged .
everything one can do in some situations is to defend the truth . - elisabeth heptner , usa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's pm erdogan met briefly with the pope , though the visit was supposedly not political the pontiff 's visit has extreme ramifications for all organized religions around the world .
there needs to be more dialog , compassion , and understanding if religion is to survive .
the common thread between all the devotions is the communication and ability of the religious forces to help keep peace in the world .
it is within this universal compromise that all religious thought is correct and there is no one way to believe in the power of the universe , however you define it .
this attempt by the pope is noble and important .
i believe many feel this way , but there are those who do not .
we pray for them and perhaps they will see the light . - j. greenspan i am a german and a muslim .
the utterances of the pope did not disturb me , as he cited history .
the catholic church is anti-everything -lrb- except for their wrongdoings against choir-boys -rrb- .
on the other hand we muslims have to respect that we are all children of the same yahweh / god / allah and that includes the jews , who are by heritance the direct brothers of the arabs . - harm g. frey the raging crowds in turkey are angry and it 's their own fault .
they are the hateful ones and the intolerant ones .
there can be no dialogue until the angry crowds cool off and realize that they are wrong , not the pope . - f rank garlo by their very actions turkish muslims confirm that the papal quotes from a 14th century figure apply just as much to their culture today .
hopefully relations with orthodox christians will continue to improve .
i can see no animosity between orthodox and catholic christians at an individual level .
that happy state of affairs needs to be " ratified " by the religious institutions concerned .
i think we should all pray for the pope 's safety . - george j. berkowski bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dialog with the orthodox christians was a major reason for the trip when turks and turkish media meet this man they will begin to listen - not like the last time , when they went off crackers because they did not understand the nature of exploratory theological reminiscences .
their reaction was extremely disappointing and fed the voracious western media , whose take then bled into those within the muslim world who still see no option but to be hostile to any christian initiative .
the closed muslim mind is almost a greater threat to a world coalition of culture , religious values and - ultimately - economic interests .
the west awaits a muslim renaissance , which will take nothing from its integrity but merely express its participation in the human story .
perceived threats of a world dominated by us financial interests will be allayed with a joint financial venture between the enormous wealth of the oil-rich middle east and the west . in my country , australia , we have a noble history of reconciliation with the turkish people whose land our heroic military forces invaded at gallipoli in 1915 .
ataturk himself said in effect that the mothers of the australian dead need not mourn because the turkish people would honour the australian soldiers who lay on their land : they would harbour them .
and over the last twenty years my city of melbourne has received tens of thousands of turkish immigrants who build mosques and businesses and even sent one daughter to the rather expensive roman catholic school where i teach .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . i hope pope benedict 's visit turns out to be safe and satisfying for both sides in terms of the messages given for improved dialogue , understanding and support .
i expect that such a visit should set an example in bringing these cultures closer together , increasing mutual familiarity , decreasing fear and distrust .
both the western world , especially the us and the eu , and the eastern world , especially the extremist islamist groups , should closely follow this example and consider more moderation in their policies . - ege yildirim , turkish student in new york i think that -lrb- the pope -rrb- will move the roman catholic church closer to the orthodox church .
he is tactful , respectful , humble , and knowledgeable , and that is appreciated .
as for the muslims , no one can mend fences if there is no willingness for dialogue .
i feel that if the press judges the pope based on what he will accomplish in that matter , he will be misjudged .
everything one can do in some situations is to defend the truth . - elisabeth heptner , usa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's pm erdogan met briefly with the pope , though the visit was supposedly not political the pontiff 's visit has extreme ramifications for all organized religions around the world .
there needs to be more dialog , compassion , and understanding if religion is to survive .
the common thread between all the devotions is the communication and ability of the religious forces to help keep peace in the world .
it is within this universal compromise that all religious thought is correct and there is no one way to believe in the power of the universe , however you define it .
this attempt by the pope is noble and important .
i believe many feel this way , but there are those who do not .
we pray for them and perhaps they will see the light . - j. greenspan i am a german and a muslim .
the utterances of the pope did not disturb me , as he cited history .
the catholic church is anti-everything -lrb- except for their wrongdoings against choir-boys -rrb- .
on the other hand we muslims have to respect that we are all children of the same yahweh / god / allah and that includes the jews , who are by heritance the direct brothers of the arabs . - harm g. frey the raging crowds in turkey are angry and it 's their own fault .
they are the hateful ones and the intolerant ones .
there can be no dialogue until the angry crowds cool off and realize that they are wrong , not the pope . - f rank garlo by their very actions turkish muslims confirm that the papal quotes from a 14th century figure apply just as much to their culture today .
hopefully relations with orthodox christians will continue to improve .
i can see no animosity between orthodox and catholic christians at an individual level .
that happy state of affairs needs to be " ratified " by the religious institutions concerned .
i think we should all pray for the pope 's safety . - george j. berkowski bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dialog with the orthodox christians was a major reason for the trip when turks and turkish media meet this man they will begin to listen - not like the last time , when they went off crackers because they did not understand the nature of exploratory theological reminiscences .
their reaction was extremely disappointing and fed the voracious western media , whose take then bled into those within the muslim world who still see no option but to be hostile to any christian initiative .
the closed muslim mind is almost a greater threat to a world coalition of culture , religious values and - ultimately - economic interests .
the west awaits a muslim renaissance , which will take nothing from its integrity but merely express its participation in the human story .
perceived threats of a world dominated by us financial interests will be allayed with a joint financial venture between the enormous wealth of the oil-rich middle east and the west . in my country , australia , we have a noble history of reconciliation with the turkish people whose land our heroic military forces invaded at gallipoli in 1915 .
ataturk himself said in effect that the mothers of the australian dead need not mourn because the turkish people would honour the australian soldiers who lay on their land : they would harbour them .
and over the last twenty years my city of melbourne has received tens of thousands of turkish immigrants who build mosques and businesses and even sent one daughter to the rather expensive roman catholic school where i teach .
christianity has no borders .
we are brought up -lrb- most of us -rrb- in the belief that samaritans are the first instructors to us of who is a human being and thus worthy of honour and protection . - herbie , melbourne , australia compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope 's trip to turkey starts on conciliatory note pope benedict xvi began a delicate mission to turkey , trading conciliatory gestures with prime minister recep tayyip erdogan as both sought to calm the storm unleashed when the pontiff appeared to link islam to violence .

is grinch planning to steal christmas again ? it 's started again : the annual euphoria which converts parts of the german capital into a teutonic version of a us shopping mall .
customers are beginning to be lured into a commercial winter paradise in which countless mugs of despair-dampening mulled wine , consumed against the headache-guaranteeing cacophony of jingle bells and white christmas , can easily drive many a parent to the brink of insanity .
at least , it comes only once a year . berlin 's newly built central train station has erected a 20-meter -lrb- 65-foot -rrb- monster tree with more than 28,000 branches and around 40,000 christmas crystal ornaments , the most expensive tree berlin has ever seen .

dw 's stefanie duckstein says it ended too soon . mission completed , mission successful ?
defense minister franz josef jung gives the impression that he 'd like to quickly put the whole operation behind him .
like a mantra - unmistakably and repeatedly - he has asserted that extending the mandate is out of the question . the punctual pullout recalls the tough route to deciding on the mission in the first place .
as the election date in the democratic republic of congo drew ever closer , all germany 's leading politicians were in agreement that a peaceful dr congo could be a stabilizing factor for the entire region .
but sending a bundeswehr deployment to safeguard elections in the framework of the european union ?
then the tenor of the discussion became more restrained . it took many more months of debate before the german government finally did agree : 780 german soldiers were sent to dr congo and gabun .
germany 's condition for participation was that its soldiers would only be deployed in the capital , kinshasa .
pacification of the country 's restive eastern provinces was incumbent upon the united nations mission monuc .
and a large portion of the soldiers deployed were stationed outside dr congo , in gabun . was the bundeswehr 's participation in the mission of a purely symbolic nature ?
certainly not .
the congolese have lauded the german troops ' sober-mindedness and diplomacy .
violent unrest in kinshasa that left 23 dead was quickly allayed due above all to two factors : diplomatic pressure and intervention on the part of eu and un soldiers . but the momentary calm in dr congo is specious .
challenger jean-pierre bemba contested his electoral defeat and lost in court .
previously there had been gun battles between supporters of the opposing camps in kinshasa .
and in eastern dr congo on monday , un soldiers had used helicopters to block a rebel advance .
thousands of people fled from the violence , which bundeswehr representatives described as an incidental flare-up . in the meantime , bemba has accepted his defeat and resigned himself to a role in the opposition .
a powerful rebel group in the country 's restive east has just announced they would lay down their weapons .
and the fact that the elections proceeded relatively peacefully and fairly is also a positive signal . still , it does n't ensure dr congo a peaceful , democratic future .
the people are still the same .
surely , they must be able to keep their country running - especially politicians who should serve as a good example for everyone . it would have been good for dr congo if the eu soldiers ' mission had had a somewhat longer wind .
eufor has formally fulfilled its job .
but dr congo 's government will only be formed in mid-december .
it would have been important to accompany the inauguration of the new president in africa 's third-largest state .

defense minister franz josef jung gives the impression that he 'd like to quickly put the whole operation behind him .
like a mantra - unmistakably and repeatedly - he has asserted that extending the mandate is out of the question . the punctual pullout recalls the tough route to deciding on the mission in the first place .
as the election date in the democratic republic of congo drew ever closer , all germany 's leading politicians were in agreement that a peaceful dr congo could be a stabilizing factor for the entire region .
but sending a bundeswehr deployment to safeguard elections in the framework of the european union ?
then the tenor of the discussion became more restrained . it took many more months of debate before the german government finally did agree : 780 german soldiers were sent to dr congo and gabun .
germany 's condition for participation was that its soldiers would only be deployed in the capital , kinshasa .
pacification of the country 's restive eastern provinces was incumbent upon the united nations mission monuc .

certainly not .
the congolese have lauded the german troops ' sober-mindedness and diplomacy .
violent unrest in kinshasa that left 23 dead was quickly allayed due above all to two factors : diplomatic pressure and intervention on the part of eu and un soldiers . but the momentary calm in dr congo is specious .

previously there had been gun battles between supporters of the opposing camps in kinshasa .
and in eastern dr congo on monday , un soldiers had used helicopters to block a rebel advance .
thousands of people fled from the violence , which bundeswehr representatives described as an incidental flare-up . in the meantime , bemba has accepted his defeat and resigned himself to a role in the opposition .
a powerful rebel group in the country 's restive east has just announced they would lay down their weapons .
and the fact that the elections proceeded relatively peacefully and fairly is also a positive signal . still , it does n't ensure dr congo a peaceful , democratic future .

surely , they must be able to keep their country running - especially politicians who should serve as a good example for everyone . it would have been good for dr congo if the eu soldiers ' mission had had a somewhat longer wind .

dw 's stefanie duckstein says it ended too soon . mission completed , mission successful ?
defense minister franz josef jung gives the impression that he 'd like to quickly put the whole operation behind him .
like a mantra - unmistakably and repeatedly - he has asserted that extending the mandate is out of the question . the punctual pullout recalls the tough route to deciding on the mission in the first place .
as the election date in the democratic republic of congo drew ever closer , all germany 's leading politicians were in agreement that a peaceful dr congo could be a stabilizing factor for the entire region .
but sending a bundeswehr deployment to safeguard elections in the framework of the european union ?
then the tenor of the discussion became more restrained . it took many more months of debate before the german government finally did agree : 780 german soldiers were sent to dr congo and gabun .
germany 's condition for participation was that its soldiers would only be deployed in the capital , kinshasa .
pacification of the country 's restive eastern provinces was incumbent upon the united nations mission monuc .
and a large portion of the soldiers deployed were stationed outside dr congo , in gabun . was the bundeswehr 's participation in the mission of a purely symbolic nature ?
certainly not .
the congolese have lauded the german troops ' sober-mindedness and diplomacy .
violent unrest in kinshasa that left 23 dead was quickly allayed due above all to two factors : diplomatic pressure and intervention on the part of eu and un soldiers . but the momentary calm in dr congo is specious .
challenger jean-pierre bemba contested his electoral defeat and lost in court .
previously there had been gun battles between supporters of the opposing camps in kinshasa .
and in eastern dr congo on monday , un soldiers had used helicopters to block a rebel advance .
thousands of people fled from the violence , which bundeswehr representatives described as an incidental flare-up . in the meantime , bemba has accepted his defeat and resigned himself to a role in the opposition .
a powerful rebel group in the country 's restive east has just announced they would lay down their weapons .
and the fact that the elections proceeded relatively peacefully and fairly is also a positive signal . still , it does n't ensure dr congo a peaceful , democratic future .
the people are still the same .
surely , they must be able to keep their country running - especially politicians who should serve as a good example for everyone . it would have been good for dr congo if the eu soldiers ' mission had had a somewhat longer wind .
eufor has formally fulfilled its job .
but dr congo 's government will only be formed in mid-december .
it would have been important to accompany the inauguration of the new president in africa 's third-largest state .
but the mandate was not meant for that , according to the bundeswehr 's spokesman .
the mission served to safeguard the presidential and parliamentary elections and they were concluded peacefully , he said .
the mandate was valid for exactly four months and not a day longer . stefanie duckstein is an editor for deutsche welle 's africa service -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german minister not in favor of extending eu congo mandate german troops in congo could be heading home at the end of the year after defense minister franz josef jung said monday that the eu 's mandate for the drc should not be extended past its nov .

-lrb- 26.09.2006 -rrb- eu peacekeepers intervene for first time in dr congo skirmishes between president kabila 's troops and rebel fighters began sunday when election results were announced .

is germany becoming a greater target for islamist terrorism ? guido steinberg : german security officials are convinced that germany is continually becoming a greater target for islamist terrorists .
and there are indeed indications that that 's the case .
the most important one was the failed attack on two regional trains in north rhine-westphalia in summer 2006 .
it failed because the two bombs packed in suitcases did n't detonate . unfortunately little more is known about the background than that two lebanese men from tripoli and its surrounding were responsible for the deed .
above all , it is unclear to what extent a larger terror organization was behind the two men .
without this information , it 's very difficult to judge to what extent germany is becoming a target .
however , it appears we have to reckon with increased terrorist activities here . what effects could that have on the debate over the responsibility of muslims in germany toward the greater society ?
bildunterschrift : guido steinberg the news of attack plans has already had an effect on the debate about the role of muslims here .
more and more germans view the presence of muslims in germany as a security risk .
thus the debate about the integration of immigrants is in danger of being laden with aspects of fighting terrorism .
this could lead to a stronger polarization , which would damage the long-term aim of the integration of foreigners .
in my opinion , the integration debate and the discussion about fighting terrorism should be strictly separated . the fact that terrorist attacks were prevented in the initial planning stages is a huge success for german security officials .
can terrorism be fought with police resources alone ? the plans for an attack on an airplane were discovered in such an early stage that i believe it 's not even certain the suspects were actually in the planning stage .
in this respect , i 'm not sure whether it actually is a case of success for security officials .
however , this example shows once more that the security officials are closely monitoring at least parts of the militant scene . on the other hand , the case of the suitcase bombers shows that attacks often ca n't be prevented no matter how effectively security officials work .
of course , the resources police and intelligence officials have are inadequate .
fighting terrorism is also - if not primarily - a political task .
one must win over the sympathizers of terrorist groups through political measures .
only in such a way can one prevent terrorist groups from continually recruiting members , financing themselves and operating under the protection of their supporters . many experts hold the ambiguous " jihad " responsible for terrorism .
what 's your assessment of jihad as a mobilizing force ? there is no actual " jihad " but rather various interpretations of it .
jihadists are characterized by having chosen a jihadist concept that centers on armed battle against " non-believers . "
they view everyone who rejects their ideology as non-believers , whether they 're muslims , christians or jews .
muslims are indeed much more often their victims than non-muslims .
this ideology 's ability to mobilize is very strong as has repeatedly been shown by the throngs joining jihadist organizations in recent years , not least here in europe .
jihadism is a greater problem today than it was in 2001 . are the potential terrorists the usual jihadists ?
how would you describe them ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dialog could help to ease tensions there is no such thing as a generic profile of an islamic terrorist .
students and petty criminals are among them , new immigrants and people born here in europe .
in many cases , however , a certain characteristic can be detected , namely " blocked upward mobility . "
young men reach limitations at some point in their history .
for example , they go to university , but still do n't get the job they want .
they immigrate to europe , but are forced to make their way as petty criminals .
individual failure then frequently turns into an aggressive , radical attitude toward society .
then the young men are receptive to militant ideologies . the dialog with muslims is lauded by many but criticized as well .
can a competent dialog serve to prevent islamist terrorism ? a dialog between muslims and greater society can certainly put tensions to rest .
in a process of dialog the government could make clear what it expects of muslims .
muslims , on the other hand , could express their complaints .
my opinion is that germany can certainly take decisive steps against terrorists if it tries at the same time to take measures against the partly accurate impressions of many muslims of being discriminated against here .
to put it shortly : no tolerance in security issues , more openness in religious , cultural areas .
general bans on head scarves or the ban on ritual slaughtering -lrb- of animals -rrb- , for example , could be revoked to make it clear that it is not the west battling islam , but that it is rather exclusively a fight against violent islamists .
such measures could be agreed on in a dialog . aladdin sarhan interviewed guido steinberg -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de terrorists planned plane bombing in germany german prosecutors have launched an investigation into a group that is thought to have started planning a terrorist attack on a german passenger plane last summer .

is germany becoming a greater target for islamist terrorism ? guido steinberg : german security officials are convinced that germany is continually becoming a greater target for islamist terrorists .
and there are indeed indications that that 's the case .
the most important one was the failed attack on two regional trains in north rhine-westphalia in summer 2006 .
it failed because the two bombs packed in suitcases did n't detonate . unfortunately little more is known about the background than that two lebanese men from tripoli and its surrounding were responsible for the deed .
above all , it is unclear to what extent a larger terror organization was behind the two men .
without this information , it 's very difficult to judge to what extent germany is becoming a target .
however , it appears we have to reckon with increased terrorist activities here . what effects could that have on the debate over the responsibility of muslims in germany toward the greater society ?
bildunterschrift : guido steinberg the news of attack plans has already had an effect on the debate about the role of muslims here .
more and more germans view the presence of muslims in germany as a security risk .
thus the debate about the integration of immigrants is in danger of being laden with aspects of fighting terrorism .
this could lead to a stronger polarization , which would damage the long-term aim of the integration of foreigners .
in my opinion , the integration debate and the discussion about fighting terrorism should be strictly separated . the fact that terrorist attacks were prevented in the initial planning stages is a huge success for german security officials .
can terrorism be fought with police resources alone ? the plans for an attack on an airplane were discovered in such an early stage that i believe it 's not even certain the suspects were actually in the planning stage .
in this respect , i 'm not sure whether it actually is a case of success for security officials .
however , this example shows once more that the security officials are closely monitoring at least parts of the militant scene . on the other hand , the case of the suitcase bombers shows that attacks often ca n't be prevented no matter how effectively security officials work .
of course , the resources police and intelligence officials have are inadequate .

what 's your assessment of jihad as a mobilizing force ? there is no actual " jihad " but rather various interpretations of it .
jihadists are characterized by having chosen a jihadist concept that centers on armed battle against " non-believers . "
they view everyone who rejects their ideology as non-believers , whether they 're muslims , christians or jews .
muslims are indeed much more often their victims than non-muslims .
this ideology 's ability to mobilize is very strong as has repeatedly been shown by the throngs joining jihadist organizations in recent years , not least here in europe .
jihadism is a greater problem today than it was in 2001 . are the potential terrorists the usual jihadists ?
how would you describe them ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dialog could help to ease tensions there is no such thing as a generic profile of an islamic terrorist .
students and petty criminals are among them , new immigrants and people born here in europe .
in many cases , however , a certain characteristic can be detected , namely " blocked upward mobility . "
young men reach limitations at some point in their history .
for example , they go to university , but still do n't get the job they want .
they immigrate to europe , but are forced to make their way as petty criminals .
individual failure then frequently turns into an aggressive , radical attitude toward society .
then the young men are receptive to militant ideologies . the dialog with muslims is lauded by many but criticized as well .
can a competent dialog serve to prevent islamist terrorism ? a dialog between muslims and greater society can certainly put tensions to rest .
in a process of dialog the government could make clear what it expects of muslims .
muslims , on the other hand , could express their complaints .
my opinion is that germany can certainly take decisive steps against terrorists if it tries at the same time to take measures against the partly accurate impressions of many muslims of being discriminated against here .
to put it shortly : no tolerance in security issues , more openness in religious , cultural areas .
general bans on head scarves or the ban on ritual slaughtering -lrb- of animals -rrb- , for example , could be revoked to make it clear that it is not the west battling islam , but that it is rather exclusively a fight against violent islamists .
such measures could be agreed on in a dialog . aladdin sarhan interviewed guido steinberg -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de terrorists planned plane bombing in germany german prosecutors have launched an investigation into a group that is thought to have started planning a terrorist attack on a german passenger plane last summer .

is grinch planning to steal christmas again ? it 's started again : the annual euphoria which converts parts of the german capital into a teutonic version of a us shopping mall .
customers are beginning to be lured into a commercial winter paradise in which countless mugs of despair-dampening mulled wine , consumed against the headache-guaranteeing cacophony of jingle bells and white christmas , can easily drive many a parent to the brink of insanity .
at least , it comes only once a year . berlin 's newly built central train station has erected a 20-meter -lrb- 65-foot -rrb- monster tree with more than 28,000 branches and around 40,000 christmas crystal ornaments , the most expensive tree berlin has ever seen .
but something is rotten in christmas land .
berlin 's santa clauses are , apparently , getting lazy . " heinzelmännchen " -lrb- santa 's little helpers -rrb- - a berlin-based student organization that specializes in finding employment for santa clauses and christmas angels - said that one month before christmas , they have only received 100 father christmas applications . " i 'm worried because we need young talent , " said project manager rene heydeck .
" we need 300 applicants more to cover some 4,500 jobs that we 're likely to have this year . " but what kind of angels ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's new popstar angels perhaps , germany is looking for a different kind of magic this winter .
the wildly popular german singing contest popstars , which over the past few years has produced one successful group -lrb- " no angels " -rrb- and a most diverse series of flops , was running this year under the motto " the country needs new angels . " and by angels , the producers certainly did n't have christmas in mind .
and if they did , then it 's because they , too , wanted to take advantage of the lucrative christmas market .
senna , bahar and mandy - the three girls who recently made it to the band called monrose - will have their first single released on dec .
1 . as it turns out , the christmas labor market is no less flourishing in the headquarters of berlin 's santa clause central . " last year , i had 70 santa clauses working for me , " said berlin 's senior father christmas , frank knorre , whose business card proudly declares that he has been a santa since 1980 .
" now i have assembled only one half of them .
i 'm taking candidates ranging from school kids to pensioners , if they fit . " what do santas really want ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one more mug , and i 'll be fine is it possible that santa clauses are getting tired of the whole holiday hullabaloo ?
do they really prefer to do what most germans do - eat more than they should and realize , at some point , that they have mulled wine coming out of their ears ? or are they hoping for something particularly wild this year - getting busted by the police for running around wearing nothing but christmas lights ?
or taking mrs. clause , for once , to the long-promised , topless caribbean vacation ? whatever it is , we can only hope that santa clauses will come to their senses , suppress their personal desires , forget about their secret fantasies , and remember that they 're there for children 's sake . not to mention that they can still make a buck or two .
renting a santa clause for a 20-minute visit to a family of up to children in berlin costs between 27 and 29 euros -lrb- $ 35 - $ 38 -rrb- . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " germany is certainly facing serious problems , but it 's also important not to forget to laugh once in a while .

retirement will be staggered for those born in the 10 years in between .
an exception to retirement at 67 will also be made for anyone who paid into the security system for 45 years or more . meanwhile , the social security court in kassel ruled to raise pensioners ' long-term care insurance contributions , with both measures triggering claims from the vdk social organization that senior citizens are becoming impoverished . " the barest of insurance " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those born before 1954 fall under the old rules " the government has pushed the retirement age up to 67 as another way of cutting pensions , said vdk president walter hirrlinger . " the pension is being reduced to the barest of insurance , " he said , stressing that the move would have negative repercussions for the younger generation in years to come . in fact , according to the federal statistics office , pensioners are better off than ever with only 2.7 percent of social welfare recipients older than 65 . but hirrlinger also pointed out that raising the retirement age is pointless when over 50 percent of employers will not hire workers over 50 . " politicians are getting ahead of themselves , " he said .
" what they need to do first is make sure that the elderly who can and do work are actually allowed to continue to do so until the age of 65 .
once this has been established , they can start thinking about raising the retirement age . " age discrimination bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's pension system is coming unstuck as it happens , the government has already begun addressing the problem of age discrimination . wednesday also saw labor minister franz müntefering unveil his " initiative 50 + . " the scheme is designed to boost employment options for the elderly and includes the introduction of state subsidies for further training and financial rewards for anyone who takes a job paid less than the would receive in unemployment benefits .
employers , meanwhile , will receive a bonus for hiring staff over 50 for at least one year . " intelligent , far-sighted companies have already realized that a cross-section of generations is a recipe for successful , " müntefering said at the project 's launch , pointing out that business needs the expertise of the elder generation , especially given the current shortage of qualified workers apparent in certain sectors . the minister said he hoped the initiative would result in jobs for 100,000 people .

an exception to retirement at 67 will also be made for anyone who paid into the security system for 45 years or more . meanwhile , the social security court in kassel ruled to raise pensioners ' long-term care insurance contributions , with both measures triggering claims from the vdk social organization that senior citizens are becoming impoverished . " the barest of insurance " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those born before 1954 fall under the old rules " the government has pushed the retirement age up to 67 as another way of cutting pensions , said vdk president walter hirrlinger . " the pension is being reduced to the barest of insurance , " he said , stressing that the move would have negative repercussions for the younger generation in years to come . in fact , according to the federal statistics office , pensioners are better off than ever with only 2.7 percent of social welfare recipients older than 65 . but hirrlinger also pointed out that raising the retirement age is pointless when over 50 percent of employers will not hire workers over 50 . " politicians are getting ahead of themselves , " he said .
" what they need to do first is make sure that the elderly who can and do work are actually allowed to continue to do so until the age of 65 .
once this has been established , they can start thinking about raising the retirement age . " age discrimination bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's pension system is coming unstuck as it happens , the government has already begun addressing the problem of age discrimination . wednesday also saw labor minister franz müntefering unveil his " initiative 50 + . " the scheme is designed to boost employment options for the elderly and includes the introduction of state subsidies for further training and financial rewards for anyone who takes a job paid less than the would receive in unemployment benefits .
employers , meanwhile , will receive a bonus for hiring staff over 50 for at least one year . " intelligent , far-sighted companies have already realized that a cross-section of generations is a recipe for successful , " müntefering said at the project 's launch , pointing out that business needs the expertise of the elder generation , especially given the current shortage of qualified workers apparent in certain sectors . the minister said he hoped the initiative would result in jobs for 100,000 people . " only 45 percent of over-55s are still working , " he said .
" this is not enough .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : christmas in germany americans taking bigger bite of german christmas fare berliners celebrate new shopping hours saint nicholas : the bearded legend germany 's christmas markets : all that is filling and festive from the fringe -pipe- 30.11.2006 berlin begging for more santas großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scenes like this one are something the german capital can only dream of this year germany 's unemployment rates are falling , but the german capital is experiencing a serious shortage of santa clauses this year .
is grinch planning to steal christmas again ? it 's started again : the annual euphoria which converts parts of the german capital into a teutonic version of a us shopping mall .
customers are beginning to be lured into a commercial winter paradise in which countless mugs of despair-dampening mulled wine , consumed against the headache-guaranteeing cacophony of jingle bells and white christmas , can easily drive many a parent to the brink of insanity .
at least , it comes only once a year . berlin 's newly built central train station has erected a 20-meter -lrb- 65-foot -rrb- monster tree with more than 28,000 branches and around 40,000 christmas crystal ornaments , the most expensive tree berlin has ever seen .
but something is rotten in christmas land .
berlin 's santa clauses are , apparently , getting lazy . " heinzelmännchen " -lrb- santa 's little helpers -rrb- - a berlin-based student organization that specializes in finding employment for santa clauses and christmas angels - said that one month before christmas , they have only received 100 father christmas applications . " i 'm worried because we need young talent , " said project manager rene heydeck .
" we need 300 applicants more to cover some 4,500 jobs that we 're likely to have this year . " but what kind of angels ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's new popstar angels perhaps , germany is looking for a different kind of magic this winter .
the wildly popular german singing contest popstars , which over the past few years has produced one successful group -lrb- " no angels " -rrb- and a most diverse series of flops , was running this year under the motto " the country needs new angels . " and by angels , the producers certainly did n't have christmas in mind .
and if they did , then it 's because they , too , wanted to take advantage of the lucrative christmas market .
senna , bahar and mandy - the three girls who recently made it to the band called monrose - will have their first single released on dec .
1 . as it turns out , the christmas labor market is no less flourishing in the headquarters of berlin 's santa clause central . " last year , i had 70 santa clauses working for me , " said berlin 's senior father christmas , frank knorre , whose business card proudly declares that he has been a santa since 1980 .
" now i have assembled only one half of them .
i 'm taking candidates ranging from school kids to pensioners , if they fit . " what do santas really want ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one more mug , and i 'll be fine is it possible that santa clauses are getting tired of the whole holiday hullabaloo ?
do they really prefer to do what most germans do - eat more than they should and realize , at some point , that they have mulled wine coming out of their ears ? or are they hoping for something particularly wild this year - getting busted by the police for running around wearing nothing but christmas lights ?
or taking mrs. clause , for once , to the long-promised , topless caribbean vacation ? whatever it is , we can only hope that santa clauses will come to their senses , suppress their personal desires , forget about their secret fantasies , and remember that they 're there for children 's sake . not to mention that they can still make a buck or two .

experts fear germany could face a shortage of qualified university graduates if the trend continues . according to the latest figures from the federal statistics office , the number of new students enrolling at university has dropped for the third year running , despite the rise in the number of school leavers graduating with a high school diploma . german universities registered 343,700 new students this year , 3.5 percent fewer than last year . as german research and education minister annette schavan pointed out in response to the survey , the development is particularly worrying given germany 's need for academics and the overall brain drain of recent years . the biggest declines come in the fields of engineering , technology and computer studies .
over all , the number of school-leavers opting for further education at universities and colleges in 2006 fell to 35.5 percent - short of the german government 's target of 40 percent . what 's behind the drop ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : too many courses are hard to get into the report cites several reasons for the decline .
one sticking point is that german states have tightened up entry requirements , and another is that many courses are available to a limited number of students .
first and foremost , however , is the fact that new students are being deterred by the introduction of higher education fees . " this is a slap in the face for the government , " achim meyer auf der heyde of the german students association told berlin 's daily taz , adding that education politicians should ask themselves whether the introduction of university fees and reduced students grants has sent the " wrong signals . " across the country , many students are simply refusing to pay up .
the action group against student fees hopes to have recruited some 400,000 students over the next 12 months , and many have the support of the universities themselves . but schavan told the handelsblatt newspaper on thursday that the introduction of fees was not behind the overall drop in students choosing to attend university as increasing numbers of students are enrolling in bavaria and hamburg 's universities despite students fee in place there . regional differences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students protested against the introduction of tuition fees the federal statistics office also pointed out that differences in enrollment numbers vary according from state to state .

experts fear germany could face a shortage of qualified university graduates if the trend continues . according to the latest figures from the federal statistics office , the number of new students enrolling at university has dropped for the third year running , despite the rise in the number of school leavers graduating with a high school diploma . german universities registered 343,700 new students this year , 3.5 percent fewer than last year . as german research and education minister annette schavan pointed out in response to the survey , the development is particularly worrying given germany 's need for academics and the overall brain drain of recent years . the biggest declines come in the fields of engineering , technology and computer studies .

one sticking point is that german states have tightened up entry requirements , and another is that many courses are available to a limited number of students .

dw 's stefanie duckstein says it ended too soon . mission completed , mission successful ?
defense minister franz josef jung gives the impression that he 'd like to quickly put the whole operation behind him .
like a mantra - unmistakably and repeatedly - he has asserted that extending the mandate is out of the question . the punctual pullout recalls the tough route to deciding on the mission in the first place .
as the election date in the democratic republic of congo drew ever closer , all germany 's leading politicians were in agreement that a peaceful dr congo could be a stabilizing factor for the entire region .
but sending a bundeswehr deployment to safeguard elections in the framework of the european union ?
then the tenor of the discussion became more restrained . it took many more months of debate before the german government finally did agree : 780 german soldiers were sent to dr congo and gabun .
germany 's condition for participation was that its soldiers would only be deployed in the capital , kinshasa .
pacification of the country 's restive eastern provinces was incumbent upon the united nations mission monuc .
and a large portion of the soldiers deployed were stationed outside dr congo , in gabun . was the bundeswehr 's participation in the mission of a purely symbolic nature ?
certainly not .
the congolese have lauded the german troops ' sober-mindedness and diplomacy .
violent unrest in kinshasa that left 23 dead was quickly allayed due above all to two factors : diplomatic pressure and intervention on the part of eu and un soldiers . but the momentary calm in dr congo is specious .
challenger jean-pierre bemba contested his electoral defeat and lost in court .
previously there had been gun battles between supporters of the opposing camps in kinshasa .
and in eastern dr congo on monday , un soldiers had used helicopters to block a rebel advance .
thousands of people fled from the violence , which bundeswehr representatives described as an incidental flare-up . in the meantime , bemba has accepted his defeat and resigned himself to a role in the opposition .
a powerful rebel group in the country 's restive east has just announced they would lay down their weapons .
and the fact that the elections proceeded relatively peacefully and fairly is also a positive signal . still , it does n't ensure dr congo a peaceful , democratic future .
the people are still the same .
surely , they must be able to keep their country running - especially politicians who should serve as a good example for everyone . it would have been good for dr congo if the eu soldiers ' mission had had a somewhat longer wind .
eufor has formally fulfilled its job .
but dr congo 's government will only be formed in mid-december .
it would have been important to accompany the inauguration of the new president in africa 's third-largest state .
but the mandate was not meant for that , according to the bundeswehr 's spokesman .
the mission served to safeguard the presidential and parliamentary elections and they were concluded peacefully , he said .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . i hope pope benedict 's visit turns out to be safe and satisfying for both sides in terms of the messages given for improved dialogue , understanding and support .
i expect that such a visit should set an example in bringing these cultures closer together , increasing mutual familiarity , decreasing fear and distrust .
both the western world , especially the us and the eu , and the eastern world , especially the extremist islamist groups , should closely follow this example and consider more moderation in their policies . - ege yildirim , turkish student in new york i think that -lrb- the pope -rrb- will move the roman catholic church closer to the orthodox church .
he is tactful , respectful , humble , and knowledgeable , and that is appreciated .
as for the muslims , no one can mend fences if there is no willingness for dialogue .
i feel that if the press judges the pope based on what he will accomplish in that matter , he will be misjudged .
everything one can do in some situations is to defend the truth . - elisabeth heptner , usa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's pm erdogan met briefly with the pope , though the visit was supposedly not political the pontiff 's visit has extreme ramifications for all organized religions around the world .
there needs to be more dialog , compassion , and understanding if religion is to survive .
the common thread between all the devotions is the communication and ability of the religious forces to help keep peace in the world .
it is within this universal compromise that all religious thought is correct and there is no one way to believe in the power of the universe , however you define it .
this attempt by the pope is noble and important .
i believe many feel this way , but there are those who do not .
we pray for them and perhaps they will see the light . - j. greenspan i am a german and a muslim .
the utterances of the pope did not disturb me , as he cited history .
the catholic church is anti-everything -lrb- except for their wrongdoings against choir-boys -rrb- .
on the other hand we muslims have to respect that we are all children of the same yahweh / god / allah and that includes the jews , who are by heritance the direct brothers of the arabs . - harm g. frey the raging crowds in turkey are angry and it 's their own fault .
they are the hateful ones and the intolerant ones .
there can be no dialogue until the angry crowds cool off and realize that they are wrong , not the pope . - f rank garlo by their very actions turkish muslims confirm that the papal quotes from a 14th century figure apply just as much to their culture today .
hopefully relations with orthodox christians will continue to improve .
i can see no animosity between orthodox and catholic christians at an individual level .
that happy state of affairs needs to be " ratified " by the religious institutions concerned .
i think we should all pray for the pope 's safety . - george j. berkowski bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dialog with the orthodox christians was a major reason for the trip when turks and turkish media meet this man they will begin to listen - not like the last time , when they went off crackers because they did not understand the nature of exploratory theological reminiscences .
their reaction was extremely disappointing and fed the voracious western media , whose take then bled into those within the muslim world who still see no option but to be hostile to any christian initiative .
the closed muslim mind is almost a greater threat to a world coalition of culture , religious values and - ultimately - economic interests .
the west awaits a muslim renaissance , which will take nothing from its integrity but merely express its participation in the human story .
perceived threats of a world dominated by us financial interests will be allayed with a joint financial venture between the enormous wealth of the oil-rich middle east and the west . in my country , australia , we have a noble history of reconciliation with the turkish people whose land our heroic military forces invaded at gallipoli in 1915 .
ataturk himself said in effect that the mothers of the australian dead need not mourn because the turkish people would honour the australian soldiers who lay on their land : they would harbour them .
and over the last twenty years my city of melbourne has received tens of thousands of turkish immigrants who build mosques and businesses and even sent one daughter to the rather expensive roman catholic school where i teach .
christianity has no borders .
we are brought up -lrb- most of us -rrb- in the belief that samaritans are the first instructors to us of who is a human being and thus worthy of honour and protection . - herbie , melbourne , australia compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope 's trip to turkey starts on conciliatory note pope benedict xvi began a delicate mission to turkey , trading conciliatory gestures with prime minister recep tayyip erdogan as both sought to calm the storm unleashed when the pontiff appeared to link islam to violence .
-lrb- 28.11.2006 -rrb- pope 's visit overshadowed by confrontation with islam pope benedict xvi 's visit to turkey to heal a rift with the eastern orthodox church , has been overshadowed by muslim anger over remarks about islam .
muslim turks seek dialogue , but will be monitoring his every word .
-lrb- 27.11.2006 -rrb- opinion : turkey 's unwelcome guest whether the pope likes it or not , his trip to turkey , which starts tuesday , has turned into a confrontation between islam and christianity , dw-tv 's religious correspondent john berwick writes .

the leaders broached sensitive topics such as kosovo and war criminals currently still at large . chancellor angela merkel met friday with serbian president boris tadic as part of a series of discussions with foreign leaders ahead of germany 's eu presidency starting in january . merkel said before the start of the meeting that she planned to raise the issue of kosovo , a province in southern serbia which has been under united nations administration since 1999 . a decision is due next year on whether the predominantly albanian-populated province should be given some form of independence - a step which serbia strongly opposes .
kosovo albanians , who make up 90 percent of the small province 's population , are demanding independence while serbia is only prepared to grant them autonomy . merkel told tadic that germany was interested in having close relations with serbia and was prepared to help bring it more in line with mainstream europe . war criminal prosecutions required bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the search for war criminals goes on a condition for this was that belgrade " cooperated well " with the international criminal tribunal for former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- in the hague that was prosecuting war crimes in the former yugoslavia , she said . tadic , a member of the pro-western opposition democratic party , said germany was " the key partner " for serbia in europe .
germany is a member of the contact group of foreign powers that has been overseeing peace in the breakaway serbian province of kosovo since the 1998-1999 conflict . the president also thanked merkel for her support at this week 's nato summit in latvia , which offered serbia and its western balkan neighbors bosnia and montenegro a " partnership for peace " -lrb- pfp -rrb- agreement with the alliance . delayed decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian voters backed the new constitution in a referendum tadic 's visit to germany comes at a particularly sensitive moment for his country . the un 's kosovo mediator martti ahtisaari recently decided not to announce his plans for the future of the southern serbian province until after the elections , which tadic had called for jan .
21 . the province has been run by a un mission since 1999 , when a nato bombing campaign ended a crackdown by belgrade on ethnic albanians in kosovo . the serbian parliament recently passed a new constitution - backed by voters in a referendum - that defined the province as an " integral " part of serbia .
but a final un proposal is widely expected to grant kosovo sovereignty . a small step towards the eu membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian president tadic was happy with nato responding to the " partnership for peace " agreement , which nato leaders , grouped at a summit in the latvian capital riga , offered to serbia on wednesday , the serbian president said in a statement that long reforms had paid off . " it is excellent news for our citizens , the army and state , " tadic said . tadic admitted that serbia still must arrest fugitive war crime suspects and bring them to justice at the icty . serbia 's failure to arrest the suspects , most of all the bosnian serb general ratko mladic , prompted brussels in may to suspend talks aimed at bringing belgrade closer to eu membership . icty head prosecutor carla del ponte , who has been pressing the west to isolate serbia over war crime fugitives , was disappointed with the decision in riga , her spokesman said in the hague . dw staff / afp , dpa -lrb- tt / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de serbia : getting the media on the right track since 2000 , the eu has poured millions of euros into various media projects in serbia .

the leaders broached sensitive topics such as kosovo and war criminals currently still at large . chancellor angela merkel met friday with serbian president boris tadic as part of a series of discussions with foreign leaders ahead of germany 's eu presidency starting in january . merkel said before the start of the meeting that she planned to raise the issue of kosovo , a province in southern serbia which has been under united nations administration since 1999 . a decision is due next year on whether the predominantly albanian-populated province should be given some form of independence - a step which serbia strongly opposes .
kosovo albanians , who make up 90 percent of the small province 's population , are demanding independence while serbia is only prepared to grant them autonomy . merkel told tadic that germany was interested in having close relations with serbia and was prepared to help bring it more in line with mainstream europe . war criminal prosecutions required bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the search for war criminals goes on a condition for this was that belgrade " cooperated well " with the international criminal tribunal for former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- in the hague that was prosecuting war crimes in the former yugoslavia , she said . tadic , a member of the pro-western opposition democratic party , said germany was " the key partner " for serbia in europe .
germany is a member of the contact group of foreign powers that has been overseeing peace in the breakaway serbian province of kosovo since the 1998-1999 conflict . the president also thanked merkel for her support at this week 's nato summit in latvia , which offered serbia and its western balkan neighbors bosnia and montenegro a " partnership for peace " -lrb- pfp -rrb- agreement with the alliance . delayed decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian voters backed the new constitution in a referendum tadic 's visit to germany comes at a particularly sensitive moment for his country . the un 's kosovo mediator martti ahtisaari recently decided not to announce his plans for the future of the southern serbian province until after the elections , which tadic had called for jan .

" it is excellent news for our citizens , the army and state , " tadic said . tadic admitted that serbia still must arrest fugitive war crime suspects and bring them to justice at the icty . serbia 's failure to arrest the suspects , most of all the bosnian serb general ratko mladic , prompted brussels in may to suspend talks aimed at bringing belgrade closer to eu membership . icty head prosecutor carla del ponte , who has been pressing the west to isolate serbia over war crime fugitives , was disappointed with the decision in riga , her spokesman said in the hague . dw staff / afp , dpa -lrb- tt / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de serbia : getting the media on the right track since 2000 , the eu has poured millions of euros into various media projects in serbia .

retirement will be staggered for those born in the 10 years in between .
an exception to retirement at 67 will also be made for anyone who paid into the security system for 45 years or more . meanwhile , the social security court in kassel ruled to raise pensioners ' long-term care insurance contributions , with both measures triggering claims from the vdk social organization that senior citizens are becoming impoverished . " the barest of insurance " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those born before 1954 fall under the old rules " the government has pushed the retirement age up to 67 as another way of cutting pensions , said vdk president walter hirrlinger . " the pension is being reduced to the barest of insurance , " he said , stressing that the move would have negative repercussions for the younger generation in years to come . in fact , according to the federal statistics office , pensioners are better off than ever with only 2.7 percent of social welfare recipients older than 65 . but hirrlinger also pointed out that raising the retirement age is pointless when over 50 percent of employers will not hire workers over 50 . " politicians are getting ahead of themselves , " he said .
" what they need to do first is make sure that the elderly who can and do work are actually allowed to continue to do so until the age of 65 .

" the scheme is designed to boost employment options for the elderly and includes the introduction of state subsidies for further training and financial rewards for anyone who takes a job paid less than the would receive in unemployment benefits .
employers , meanwhile , will receive a bonus for hiring staff over 50 for at least one year . " intelligent , far-sighted companies have already realized that a cross-section of generations is a recipe for successful , " müntefering said at the project 's launch , pointing out that business needs the expertise of the elder generation , especially given the current shortage of qualified workers apparent in certain sectors . the minister said he hoped the initiative would result in jobs for 100,000 people . " only 45 percent of over-55s are still working , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 30.11.2006 reader response : " both east and west can learn from pope " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope celebrated mass in ephesus , turkey , during his four-day visit pope benedict xvi visited turkey this week and dw-world.de 's readers wrote in with their thoughts on the pontiff , the reactions from the host country and the need for increased inter-religious dialog . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . i hope pope benedict 's visit turns out to be safe and satisfying for both sides in terms of the messages given for improved dialogue , understanding and support .
i expect that such a visit should set an example in bringing these cultures closer together , increasing mutual familiarity , decreasing fear and distrust .
both the western world , especially the us and the eu , and the eastern world , especially the extremist islamist groups , should closely follow this example and consider more moderation in their policies . - ege yildirim , turkish student in new york i think that -lrb- the pope -rrb- will move the roman catholic church closer to the orthodox church .
he is tactful , respectful , humble , and knowledgeable , and that is appreciated .
as for the muslims , no one can mend fences if there is no willingness for dialogue .
i feel that if the press judges the pope based on what he will accomplish in that matter , he will be misjudged .
everything one can do in some situations is to defend the truth . - elisabeth heptner , usa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's pm erdogan met briefly with the pope , though the visit was supposedly not political the pontiff 's visit has extreme ramifications for all organized religions around the world .
there needs to be more dialog , compassion , and understanding if religion is to survive .
the common thread between all the devotions is the communication and ability of the religious forces to help keep peace in the world .
it is within this universal compromise that all religious thought is correct and there is no one way to believe in the power of the universe , however you define it .
this attempt by the pope is noble and important .
i believe many feel this way , but there are those who do not .
we pray for them and perhaps they will see the light . - j. greenspan i am a german and a muslim .
the utterances of the pope did not disturb me , as he cited history .
the catholic church is anti-everything -lrb- except for their wrongdoings against choir-boys -rrb- .
on the other hand we muslims have to respect that we are all children of the same yahweh / god / allah and that includes the jews , who are by heritance the direct brothers of the arabs . - harm g. frey the raging crowds in turkey are angry and it 's their own fault .
they are the hateful ones and the intolerant ones .
there can be no dialogue until the angry crowds cool off and realize that they are wrong , not the pope . - f rank garlo by their very actions turkish muslims confirm that the papal quotes from a 14th century figure apply just as much to their culture today .
hopefully relations with orthodox christians will continue to improve .
i can see no animosity between orthodox and catholic christians at an individual level .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . i hope pope benedict 's visit turns out to be safe and satisfying for both sides in terms of the messages given for improved dialogue , understanding and support .
i expect that such a visit should set an example in bringing these cultures closer together , increasing mutual familiarity , decreasing fear and distrust .
both the western world , especially the us and the eu , and the eastern world , especially the extremist islamist groups , should closely follow this example and consider more moderation in their policies . - ege yildirim , turkish student in new york i think that -lrb- the pope -rrb- will move the roman catholic church closer to the orthodox church .
he is tactful , respectful , humble , and knowledgeable , and that is appreciated .
as for the muslims , no one can mend fences if there is no willingness for dialogue .
i feel that if the press judges the pope based on what he will accomplish in that matter , he will be misjudged .
everything one can do in some situations is to defend the truth . - elisabeth heptner , usa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's pm erdogan met briefly with the pope , though the visit was supposedly not political the pontiff 's visit has extreme ramifications for all organized religions around the world .
there needs to be more dialog , compassion , and understanding if religion is to survive .
the common thread between all the devotions is the communication and ability of the religious forces to help keep peace in the world .
it is within this universal compromise that all religious thought is correct and there is no one way to believe in the power of the universe , however you define it .
this attempt by the pope is noble and important .
i believe many feel this way , but there are those who do not .
we pray for them and perhaps they will see the light . - j. greenspan i am a german and a muslim .
the utterances of the pope did not disturb me , as he cited history .
the catholic church is anti-everything -lrb- except for their wrongdoings against choir-boys -rrb- .
on the other hand we muslims have to respect that we are all children of the same yahweh / god / allah and that includes the jews , who are by heritance the direct brothers of the arabs . - harm g. frey the raging crowds in turkey are angry and it 's their own fault .
they are the hateful ones and the intolerant ones .
there can be no dialogue until the angry crowds cool off and realize that they are wrong , not the pope . - f rank garlo by their very actions turkish muslims confirm that the papal quotes from a 14th century figure apply just as much to their culture today .
hopefully relations with orthodox christians will continue to improve .
i can see no animosity between orthodox and catholic christians at an individual level .
that happy state of affairs needs to be " ratified " by the religious institutions concerned .
i think we should all pray for the pope 's safety . - george j. berkowski bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dialog with the orthodox christians was a major reason for the trip when turks and turkish media meet this man they will begin to listen - not like the last time , when they went off crackers because they did not understand the nature of exploratory theological reminiscences .
their reaction was extremely disappointing and fed the voracious western media , whose take then bled into those within the muslim world who still see no option but to be hostile to any christian initiative .
the closed muslim mind is almost a greater threat to a world coalition of culture , religious values and - ultimately - economic interests .
the west awaits a muslim renaissance , which will take nothing from its integrity but merely express its participation in the human story .
perceived threats of a world dominated by us financial interests will be allayed with a joint financial venture between the enormous wealth of the oil-rich middle east and the west . in my country , australia , we have a noble history of reconciliation with the turkish people whose land our heroic military forces invaded at gallipoli in 1915 .

dw 's stefanie duckstein says it ended too soon . mission completed , mission successful ?
defense minister franz josef jung gives the impression that he 'd like to quickly put the whole operation behind him .
like a mantra - unmistakably and repeatedly - he has asserted that extending the mandate is out of the question . the punctual pullout recalls the tough route to deciding on the mission in the first place .
as the election date in the democratic republic of congo drew ever closer , all germany 's leading politicians were in agreement that a peaceful dr congo could be a stabilizing factor for the entire region .
but sending a bundeswehr deployment to safeguard elections in the framework of the european union ?
then the tenor of the discussion became more restrained . it took many more months of debate before the german government finally did agree : 780 german soldiers were sent to dr congo and gabun .
germany 's condition for participation was that its soldiers would only be deployed in the capital , kinshasa .
pacification of the country 's restive eastern provinces was incumbent upon the united nations mission monuc .
and a large portion of the soldiers deployed were stationed outside dr congo , in gabun . was the bundeswehr 's participation in the mission of a purely symbolic nature ?
certainly not .
the congolese have lauded the german troops ' sober-mindedness and diplomacy .
violent unrest in kinshasa that left 23 dead was quickly allayed due above all to two factors : diplomatic pressure and intervention on the part of eu and un soldiers . but the momentary calm in dr congo is specious .
challenger jean-pierre bemba contested his electoral defeat and lost in court .
previously there had been gun battles between supporters of the opposing camps in kinshasa .
and in eastern dr congo on monday , un soldiers had used helicopters to block a rebel advance .
thousands of people fled from the violence , which bundeswehr representatives described as an incidental flare-up . in the meantime , bemba has accepted his defeat and resigned himself to a role in the opposition .
a powerful rebel group in the country 's restive east has just announced they would lay down their weapons .
and the fact that the elections proceeded relatively peacefully and fairly is also a positive signal . still , it does n't ensure dr congo a peaceful , democratic future .
the people are still the same .
surely , they must be able to keep their country running - especially politicians who should serve as a good example for everyone . it would have been good for dr congo if the eu soldiers ' mission had had a somewhat longer wind .
eufor has formally fulfilled its job .
but dr congo 's government will only be formed in mid-december .
it would have been important to accompany the inauguration of the new president in africa 's third-largest state .
but the mandate was not meant for that , according to the bundeswehr 's spokesman .
the mission served to safeguard the presidential and parliamentary elections and they were concluded peacefully , he said .

retirement will be staggered for those born in the 10 years in between .
an exception to retirement at 67 will also be made for anyone who paid into the security system for 45 years or more . meanwhile , the social security court in kassel ruled to raise pensioners ' long-term care insurance contributions , with both measures triggering claims from the vdk social organization that senior citizens are becoming impoverished . " the barest of insurance " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those born before 1954 fall under the old rules " the government has pushed the retirement age up to 67 as another way of cutting pensions , said vdk president walter hirrlinger . " the pension is being reduced to the barest of insurance , " he said , stressing that the move would have negative repercussions for the younger generation in years to come . in fact , according to the federal statistics office , pensioners are better off than ever with only 2.7 percent of social welfare recipients older than 65 . but hirrlinger also pointed out that raising the retirement age is pointless when over 50 percent of employers will not hire workers over 50 . " politicians are getting ahead of themselves , " he said .
" what they need to do first is make sure that the elderly who can and do work are actually allowed to continue to do so until the age of 65 .
once this has been established , they can start thinking about raising the retirement age . " age discrimination bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's pension system is coming unstuck as it happens , the government has already begun addressing the problem of age discrimination . wednesday also saw labor minister franz müntefering unveil his " initiative 50 + . " the scheme is designed to boost employment options for the elderly and includes the introduction of state subsidies for further training and financial rewards for anyone who takes a job paid less than the would receive in unemployment benefits .
employers , meanwhile , will receive a bonus for hiring staff over 50 for at least one year . " intelligent , far-sighted companies have already realized that a cross-section of generations is a recipe for successful , " müntefering said at the project 's launch , pointing out that business needs the expertise of the elder generation , especially given the current shortage of qualified workers apparent in certain sectors . the minister said he hoped the initiative would result in jobs for 100,000 people . " only 45 percent of over-55s are still working , " he said .

do they really prefer to do what most germans do - eat more than they should and realize , at some point , that they have mulled wine coming out of their ears ? or are they hoping for something particularly wild this year - getting busted by the police for running around wearing nothing but christmas lights ?
or taking mrs. clause , for once , to the long-promised , topless caribbean vacation ? whatever it is , we can only hope that santa clauses will come to their senses , suppress their personal desires , forget about their secret fantasies , and remember that they 're there for children 's sake . not to mention that they can still make a buck or two .

" heinzelmännchen " -lrb- santa 's little helpers -rrb- - a berlin-based student organization that specializes in finding employment for santa clauses and christmas angels - said that one month before christmas , they have only received 100 father christmas applications . " i 'm worried because we need young talent , " said project manager rene heydeck .
" we need 300 applicants more to cover some 4,500 jobs that we 're likely to have this year . " but what kind of angels ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's new popstar angels perhaps , germany is looking for a different kind of magic this winter .
the wildly popular german singing contest popstars , which over the past few years has produced one successful group -lrb- " no angels " -rrb- and a most diverse series of flops , was running this year under the motto " the country needs new angels . " and by angels , the producers certainly did n't have christmas in mind .
and if they did , then it 's because they , too , wanted to take advantage of the lucrative christmas market .
senna , bahar and mandy - the three girls who recently made it to the band called monrose - will have their first single released on dec .

" last year , i had 70 santa clauses working for me , " said berlin 's senior father christmas , frank knorre , whose business card proudly declares that he has been a santa since 1980 .
" now i have assembled only one half of them .
i 'm taking candidates ranging from school kids to pensioners , if they fit . " what do santas really want ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one more mug , and i 'll be fine is it possible that santa clauses are getting tired of the whole holiday hullabaloo ?
do they really prefer to do what most germans do - eat more than they should and realize , at some point , that they have mulled wine coming out of their ears ? or are they hoping for something particularly wild this year - getting busted by the police for running around wearing nothing but christmas lights ?
or taking mrs. clause , for once , to the long-promised , topless caribbean vacation ? whatever it is , we can only hope that santa clauses will come to their senses , suppress their personal desires , forget about their secret fantasies , and remember that they 're there for children 's sake . not to mention that they can still make a buck or two .
renting a santa clause for a 20-minute visit to a family of up to children in berlin costs between 27 and 29 euros -lrb- $ 35 - $ 38 -rrb- . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " germany is certainly facing serious problems , but it 's also important not to forget to laugh once in a while .

experts fear germany could face a shortage of qualified university graduates if the trend continues . according to the latest figures from the federal statistics office , the number of new students enrolling at university has dropped for the third year running , despite the rise in the number of school leavers graduating with a high school diploma . german universities registered 343,700 new students this year , 3.5 percent fewer than last year . as german research and education minister annette schavan pointed out in response to the survey , the development is particularly worrying given germany 's need for academics and the overall brain drain of recent years . the biggest declines come in the fields of engineering , technology and computer studies .
over all , the number of school-leavers opting for further education at universities and colleges in 2006 fell to 35.5 percent - short of the german government 's target of 40 percent . what 's behind the drop ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : too many courses are hard to get into the report cites several reasons for the decline .
one sticking point is that german states have tightened up entry requirements , and another is that many courses are available to a limited number of students .
first and foremost , however , is the fact that new students are being deterred by the introduction of higher education fees . " this is a slap in the face for the government , " achim meyer auf der heyde of the german students association told berlin 's daily taz , adding that education politicians should ask themselves whether the introduction of university fees and reduced students grants has sent the " wrong signals . " across the country , many students are simply refusing to pay up .
the action group against student fees hopes to have recruited some 400,000 students over the next 12 months , and many have the support of the universities themselves . but schavan told the handelsblatt newspaper on thursday that the introduction of fees was not behind the overall drop in students choosing to attend university as increasing numbers of students are enrolling in bavaria and hamburg 's universities despite students fee in place there . regional differences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students protested against the introduction of tuition fees the federal statistics office also pointed out that differences in enrollment numbers vary according from state to state .

" we see the patriarchate as a turkish institution and this is how our laws , too , see it , " said foreign ministry spokesman namik tan .

experts fear germany could face a shortage of qualified university graduates if the trend continues . according to the latest figures from the federal statistics office , the number of new students enrolling at university has dropped for the third year running , despite the rise in the number of school leavers graduating with a high school diploma . german universities registered 343,700 new students this year , 3.5 percent fewer than last year . as german research and education minister annette schavan pointed out in response to the survey , the development is particularly worrying given germany 's need for academics and the overall brain drain of recent years . the biggest declines come in the fields of engineering , technology and computer studies .
over all , the number of school-leavers opting for further education at universities and colleges in 2006 fell to 35.5 percent - short of the german government 's target of 40 percent . what 's behind the drop ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : too many courses are hard to get into the report cites several reasons for the decline .
one sticking point is that german states have tightened up entry requirements , and another is that many courses are available to a limited number of students .
first and foremost , however , is the fact that new students are being deterred by the introduction of higher education fees . " this is a slap in the face for the government , " achim meyer auf der heyde of the german students association told berlin 's daily taz , adding that education politicians should ask themselves whether the introduction of university fees and reduced students grants has sent the " wrong signals . " across the country , many students are simply refusing to pay up .
the action group against student fees hopes to have recruited some 400,000 students over the next 12 months , and many have the support of the universities themselves . but schavan told the handelsblatt newspaper on thursday that the introduction of fees was not behind the overall drop in students choosing to attend university as increasing numbers of students are enrolling in bavaria and hamburg 's universities despite students fee in place there . regional differences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students protested against the introduction of tuition fees the federal statistics office also pointed out that differences in enrollment numbers vary according from state to state .
saxony has 13 percent fewer new students , while baden württemberg and north rhine westphalia saw a drop of 10 percent . in eastern germany , many fear the current development is just the thin end of the wedge and that students are dying breed . " universities in eastern germany need to become better-known and more attractive , " said dieter dohmen , director of the berlin research institute for education and social economics .
" they especially need to attract more women . " women make up 49 percent of students in this part of the country compared to almost 60 percent in western germany , he said . optimism among graduates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students said they feel good about the future another study published this month revealed that german students are optimistic about the future , with 60 percent saying they are confident they will get a job . published by the center of human resources information systems , it questioned over 11,000 people about their employment prospects and established that graduates , especially those with degrees in economics and engineering , feel more upbeat about their professional lives than others . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german education an export hit in the arab world while germans continue to bemoan their educational system , german higher education is being successfully exported to the arab world .

is germany becoming a greater target for islamist terrorism ? guido steinberg : german security officials are convinced that germany is continually becoming a greater target for islamist terrorists .
and there are indeed indications that that 's the case .
the most important one was the failed attack on two regional trains in north rhine-westphalia in summer 2006 .
it failed because the two bombs packed in suitcases did n't detonate . unfortunately little more is known about the background than that two lebanese men from tripoli and its surrounding were responsible for the deed .
above all , it is unclear to what extent a larger terror organization was behind the two men .
without this information , it 's very difficult to judge to what extent germany is becoming a target .
however , it appears we have to reckon with increased terrorist activities here . what effects could that have on the debate over the responsibility of muslims in germany toward the greater society ?
bildunterschrift : guido steinberg the news of attack plans has already had an effect on the debate about the role of muslims here .
more and more germans view the presence of muslims in germany as a security risk .
thus the debate about the integration of immigrants is in danger of being laden with aspects of fighting terrorism .
this could lead to a stronger polarization , which would damage the long-term aim of the integration of foreigners .
in my opinion , the integration debate and the discussion about fighting terrorism should be strictly separated . the fact that terrorist attacks were prevented in the initial planning stages is a huge success for german security officials .
can terrorism be fought with police resources alone ? the plans for an attack on an airplane were discovered in such an early stage that i believe it 's not even certain the suspects were actually in the planning stage .
in this respect , i 'm not sure whether it actually is a case of success for security officials .
however , this example shows once more that the security officials are closely monitoring at least parts of the militant scene . on the other hand , the case of the suitcase bombers shows that attacks often ca n't be prevented no matter how effectively security officials work .
of course , the resources police and intelligence officials have are inadequate .
fighting terrorism is also - if not primarily - a political task .
one must win over the sympathizers of terrorist groups through political measures .
only in such a way can one prevent terrorist groups from continually recruiting members , financing themselves and operating under the protection of their supporters . many experts hold the ambiguous " jihad " responsible for terrorism .
what 's your assessment of jihad as a mobilizing force ? there is no actual " jihad " but rather various interpretations of it .
jihadists are characterized by having chosen a jihadist concept that centers on armed battle against " non-believers . "
they view everyone who rejects their ideology as non-believers , whether they 're muslims , christians or jews .
muslims are indeed much more often their victims than non-muslims .

can a competent dialog serve to prevent islamist terrorism ? a dialog between muslims and greater society can certainly put tensions to rest .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dialog could help to ease tensions there is no such thing as a generic profile of an islamic terrorist .
students and petty criminals are among them , new immigrants and people born here in europe .
in many cases , however , a certain characteristic can be detected , namely " blocked upward mobility . "
young men reach limitations at some point in their history .
for example , they go to university , but still do n't get the job they want .
they immigrate to europe , but are forced to make their way as petty criminals .
individual failure then frequently turns into an aggressive , radical attitude toward society .
then the young men are receptive to militant ideologies . the dialog with muslims is lauded by many but criticized as well .
can a competent dialog serve to prevent islamist terrorism ? a dialog between muslims and greater society can certainly put tensions to rest .
in a process of dialog the government could make clear what it expects of muslims .
muslims , on the other hand , could express their complaints .
my opinion is that germany can certainly take decisive steps against terrorists if it tries at the same time to take measures against the partly accurate impressions of many muslims of being discriminated against here .
to put it shortly : no tolerance in security issues , more openness in religious , cultural areas .
general bans on head scarves or the ban on ritual slaughtering -lrb- of animals -rrb- , for example , could be revoked to make it clear that it is not the west battling islam , but that it is rather exclusively a fight against violent islamists .
such measures could be agreed on in a dialog . aladdin sarhan interviewed guido steinberg -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de terrorists planned plane bombing in germany german prosecutors have launched an investigation into a group that is thought to have started planning a terrorist attack on a german passenger plane last summer .

experts fear germany could face a shortage of qualified university graduates if the trend continues . according to the latest figures from the federal statistics office , the number of new students enrolling at university has dropped for the third year running , despite the rise in the number of school leavers graduating with a high school diploma . german universities registered 343,700 new students this year , 3.5 percent fewer than last year . as german research and education minister annette schavan pointed out in response to the survey , the development is particularly worrying given germany 's need for academics and the overall brain drain of recent years . the biggest declines come in the fields of engineering , technology and computer studies .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 30.11.2006 " jihadism is a greater problem today than it was in 2001 " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police foiled a planned attack on trains in august islamic studies scholar guido steinberg spoke to dw-world.de about the likelihood of a terrorist attack in germany and the need to separate the issue of integration from the fight against terrorism . guido steinberg is an islamic studies scholar and a researcher at the german institute for international and security affairs , in berlin . dw-world.de : several terror attacks were prevented in germany in 2006 .
is germany becoming a greater target for islamist terrorism ? guido steinberg : german security officials are convinced that germany is continually becoming a greater target for islamist terrorists .
and there are indeed indications that that 's the case .
the most important one was the failed attack on two regional trains in north rhine-westphalia in summer 2006 .
it failed because the two bombs packed in suitcases did n't detonate . unfortunately little more is known about the background than that two lebanese men from tripoli and its surrounding were responsible for the deed .
above all , it is unclear to what extent a larger terror organization was behind the two men .
without this information , it 's very difficult to judge to what extent germany is becoming a target .
however , it appears we have to reckon with increased terrorist activities here . what effects could that have on the debate over the responsibility of muslims in germany toward the greater society ?
bildunterschrift : guido steinberg the news of attack plans has already had an effect on the debate about the role of muslims here .
more and more germans view the presence of muslims in germany as a security risk .
thus the debate about the integration of immigrants is in danger of being laden with aspects of fighting terrorism .
this could lead to a stronger polarization , which would damage the long-term aim of the integration of foreigners .
in my opinion , the integration debate and the discussion about fighting terrorism should be strictly separated . the fact that terrorist attacks were prevented in the initial planning stages is a huge success for german security officials .
can terrorism be fought with police resources alone ? the plans for an attack on an airplane were discovered in such an early stage that i believe it 's not even certain the suspects were actually in the planning stage .
in this respect , i 'm not sure whether it actually is a case of success for security officials .
however , this example shows once more that the security officials are closely monitoring at least parts of the militant scene . on the other hand , the case of the suitcase bombers shows that attacks often ca n't be prevented no matter how effectively security officials work .
of course , the resources police and intelligence officials have are inadequate .
fighting terrorism is also - if not primarily - a political task .
one must win over the sympathizers of terrorist groups through political measures .
only in such a way can one prevent terrorist groups from continually recruiting members , financing themselves and operating under the protection of their supporters . many experts hold the ambiguous " jihad " responsible for terrorism .
what 's your assessment of jihad as a mobilizing force ? there is no actual " jihad " but rather various interpretations of it .
jihadists are characterized by having chosen a jihadist concept that centers on armed battle against " non-believers . "
they view everyone who rejects their ideology as non-believers , whether they 're muslims , christians or jews .
muslims are indeed much more often their victims than non-muslims .
this ideology 's ability to mobilize is very strong as has repeatedly been shown by the throngs joining jihadist organizations in recent years , not least here in europe .
jihadism is a greater problem today than it was in 2001 . are the potential terrorists the usual jihadists ?
how would you describe them ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dialog could help to ease tensions there is no such thing as a generic profile of an islamic terrorist .
students and petty criminals are among them , new immigrants and people born here in europe .
in many cases , however , a certain characteristic can be detected , namely " blocked upward mobility . "
young men reach limitations at some point in their history .
for example , they go to university , but still do n't get the job they want .
they immigrate to europe , but are forced to make their way as petty criminals .
individual failure then frequently turns into an aggressive , radical attitude toward society .
then the young men are receptive to militant ideologies . the dialog with muslims is lauded by many but criticized as well .

my opinion is that germany can certainly take decisive steps against terrorists if it tries at the same time to take measures against the partly accurate impressions of many muslims of being discriminated against here .
to put it shortly : no tolerance in security issues , more openness in religious , cultural areas .
general bans on head scarves or the ban on ritual slaughtering -lrb- of animals -rrb- , for example , could be revoked to make it clear that it is not the west battling islam , but that it is rather exclusively a fight against violent islamists .

and there are indeed indications that that 's the case .
the most important one was the failed attack on two regional trains in north rhine-westphalia in summer 2006 .
it failed because the two bombs packed in suitcases did n't detonate . unfortunately little more is known about the background than that two lebanese men from tripoli and its surrounding were responsible for the deed .
above all , it is unclear to what extent a larger terror organization was behind the two men .
without this information , it 's very difficult to judge to what extent germany is becoming a target .
however , it appears we have to reckon with increased terrorist activities here . what effects could that have on the debate over the responsibility of muslims in germany toward the greater society ?
bildunterschrift : guido steinberg the news of attack plans has already had an effect on the debate about the role of muslims here .
more and more germans view the presence of muslims in germany as a security risk .
thus the debate about the integration of immigrants is in danger of being laden with aspects of fighting terrorism .
this could lead to a stronger polarization , which would damage the long-term aim of the integration of foreigners .
in my opinion , the integration debate and the discussion about fighting terrorism should be strictly separated . the fact that terrorist attacks were prevented in the initial planning stages is a huge success for german security officials .
can terrorism be fought with police resources alone ? the plans for an attack on an airplane were discovered in such an early stage that i believe it 's not even certain the suspects were actually in the planning stage .
in this respect , i 'm not sure whether it actually is a case of success for security officials .
however , this example shows once more that the security officials are closely monitoring at least parts of the militant scene . on the other hand , the case of the suitcase bombers shows that attacks often ca n't be prevented no matter how effectively security officials work .
of course , the resources police and intelligence officials have are inadequate .
fighting terrorism is also - if not primarily - a political task .
one must win over the sympathizers of terrorist groups through political measures .
only in such a way can one prevent terrorist groups from continually recruiting members , financing themselves and operating under the protection of their supporters . many experts hold the ambiguous " jihad " responsible for terrorism .
what 's your assessment of jihad as a mobilizing force ? there is no actual " jihad " but rather various interpretations of it .
jihadists are characterized by having chosen a jihadist concept that centers on armed battle against " non-believers . "
they view everyone who rejects their ideology as non-believers , whether they 're muslims , christians or jews .
muslims are indeed much more often their victims than non-muslims .
this ideology 's ability to mobilize is very strong as has repeatedly been shown by the throngs joining jihadist organizations in recent years , not least here in europe .
jihadism is a greater problem today than it was in 2001 . are the potential terrorists the usual jihadists ?
how would you describe them ?

can a competent dialog serve to prevent islamist terrorism ? a dialog between muslims and greater society can certainly put tensions to rest .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . i hope pope benedict 's visit turns out to be safe and satisfying for both sides in terms of the messages given for improved dialogue , understanding and support .
i expect that such a visit should set an example in bringing these cultures closer together , increasing mutual familiarity , decreasing fear and distrust .
both the western world , especially the us and the eu , and the eastern world , especially the extremist islamist groups , should closely follow this example and consider more moderation in their policies . - ege yildirim , turkish student in new york i think that -lrb- the pope -rrb- will move the roman catholic church closer to the orthodox church .
he is tactful , respectful , humble , and knowledgeable , and that is appreciated .
as for the muslims , no one can mend fences if there is no willingness for dialogue .
i feel that if the press judges the pope based on what he will accomplish in that matter , he will be misjudged .
everything one can do in some situations is to defend the truth . - elisabeth heptner , usa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's pm erdogan met briefly with the pope , though the visit was supposedly not political the pontiff 's visit has extreme ramifications for all organized religions around the world .
there needs to be more dialog , compassion , and understanding if religion is to survive .
the common thread between all the devotions is the communication and ability of the religious forces to help keep peace in the world .
it is within this universal compromise that all religious thought is correct and there is no one way to believe in the power of the universe , however you define it .
this attempt by the pope is noble and important .
i believe many feel this way , but there are those who do not .
we pray for them and perhaps they will see the light . - j. greenspan i am a german and a muslim .
the utterances of the pope did not disturb me , as he cited history .
the catholic church is anti-everything -lrb- except for their wrongdoings against choir-boys -rrb- .
on the other hand we muslims have to respect that we are all children of the same yahweh / god / allah and that includes the jews , who are by heritance the direct brothers of the arabs . - harm g. frey the raging crowds in turkey are angry and it 's their own fault .
they are the hateful ones and the intolerant ones .
there can be no dialogue until the angry crowds cool off and realize that they are wrong , not the pope . - f rank garlo by their very actions turkish muslims confirm that the papal quotes from a 14th century figure apply just as much to their culture today .
hopefully relations with orthodox christians will continue to improve .
i can see no animosity between orthodox and catholic christians at an individual level .
that happy state of affairs needs to be " ratified " by the religious institutions concerned .
i think we should all pray for the pope 's safety . - george j. berkowski bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dialog with the orthodox christians was a major reason for the trip when turks and turkish media meet this man they will begin to listen - not like the last time , when they went off crackers because they did not understand the nature of exploratory theological reminiscences .
their reaction was extremely disappointing and fed the voracious western media , whose take then bled into those within the muslim world who still see no option but to be hostile to any christian initiative .
the closed muslim mind is almost a greater threat to a world coalition of culture , religious values and - ultimately - economic interests .
the west awaits a muslim renaissance , which will take nothing from its integrity but merely express its participation in the human story .
perceived threats of a world dominated by us financial interests will be allayed with a joint financial venture between the enormous wealth of the oil-rich middle east and the west . in my country , australia , we have a noble history of reconciliation with the turkish people whose land our heroic military forces invaded at gallipoli in 1915 .
ataturk himself said in effect that the mothers of the australian dead need not mourn because the turkish people would honour the australian soldiers who lay on their land : they would harbour them .
and over the last twenty years my city of melbourne has received tens of thousands of turkish immigrants who build mosques and businesses and even sent one daughter to the rather expensive roman catholic school where i teach .
christianity has no borders .
we are brought up -lrb- most of us -rrb- in the belief that samaritans are the first instructors to us of who is a human being and thus worthy of honour and protection . - herbie , melbourne , australia compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope 's trip to turkey starts on conciliatory note pope benedict xvi began a delicate mission to turkey , trading conciliatory gestures with prime minister recep tayyip erdogan as both sought to calm the storm unleashed when the pontiff appeared to link islam to violence .
-lrb- 28.11.2006 -rrb- pope 's visit overshadowed by confrontation with islam pope benedict xvi 's visit to turkey to heal a rift with the eastern orthodox church , has been overshadowed by muslim anger over remarks about islam .

dw 's stefanie duckstein says it ended too soon . mission completed , mission successful ?
defense minister franz josef jung gives the impression that he 'd like to quickly put the whole operation behind him .
like a mantra - unmistakably and repeatedly - he has asserted that extending the mandate is out of the question . the punctual pullout recalls the tough route to deciding on the mission in the first place .
as the election date in the democratic republic of congo drew ever closer , all germany 's leading politicians were in agreement that a peaceful dr congo could be a stabilizing factor for the entire region .
but sending a bundeswehr deployment to safeguard elections in the framework of the european union ?
then the tenor of the discussion became more restrained . it took many more months of debate before the german government finally did agree : 780 german soldiers were sent to dr congo and gabun .
germany 's condition for participation was that its soldiers would only be deployed in the capital , kinshasa .
pacification of the country 's restive eastern provinces was incumbent upon the united nations mission monuc .
and a large portion of the soldiers deployed were stationed outside dr congo , in gabun . was the bundeswehr 's participation in the mission of a purely symbolic nature ?
certainly not .
the congolese have lauded the german troops ' sober-mindedness and diplomacy .
violent unrest in kinshasa that left 23 dead was quickly allayed due above all to two factors : diplomatic pressure and intervention on the part of eu and un soldiers . but the momentary calm in dr congo is specious .
challenger jean-pierre bemba contested his electoral defeat and lost in court .
previously there had been gun battles between supporters of the opposing camps in kinshasa .
and in eastern dr congo on monday , un soldiers had used helicopters to block a rebel advance .
thousands of people fled from the violence , which bundeswehr representatives described as an incidental flare-up . in the meantime , bemba has accepted his defeat and resigned himself to a role in the opposition .
a powerful rebel group in the country 's restive east has just announced they would lay down their weapons .
and the fact that the elections proceeded relatively peacefully and fairly is also a positive signal . still , it does n't ensure dr congo a peaceful , democratic future .
the people are still the same .
surely , they must be able to keep their country running - especially politicians who should serve as a good example for everyone . it would have been good for dr congo if the eu soldiers ' mission had had a somewhat longer wind .
eufor has formally fulfilled its job .
but dr congo 's government will only be formed in mid-december .
it would have been important to accompany the inauguration of the new president in africa 's third-largest state .
but the mandate was not meant for that , according to the bundeswehr 's spokesman .
the mission served to safeguard the presidential and parliamentary elections and they were concluded peacefully , he said .
the mandate was valid for exactly four months and not a day longer . stefanie duckstein is an editor for deutsche welle 's africa service -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german minister not in favor of extending eu congo mandate german troops in congo could be heading home at the end of the year after defense minister franz josef jung said monday that the eu 's mandate for the drc should not be extended past its nov .
30 deadline .
-lrb- 26.09.2006 -rrb- eu peacekeepers intervene for first time in dr congo skirmishes between president kabila 's troops and rebel fighters began sunday when election results were announced .
eu and un troops stepped in when the fighting escalated and foreign diplomats were caught under fire .
-lrb- 22.08.2006 -rrb- experts say eu mission in dr congo is merely symbolic some 2,000 european troops , including 780 germans , will help safeguard the elections in dr congo .
government officials see the deployment as an important peacekeeping effort , but most experts call it a symbolic gesture .

dw 's stefanie duckstein says it ended too soon . mission completed , mission successful ?
defense minister franz josef jung gives the impression that he 'd like to quickly put the whole operation behind him .
like a mantra - unmistakably and repeatedly - he has asserted that extending the mandate is out of the question . the punctual pullout recalls the tough route to deciding on the mission in the first place .
as the election date in the democratic republic of congo drew ever closer , all germany 's leading politicians were in agreement that a peaceful dr congo could be a stabilizing factor for the entire region .
but sending a bundeswehr deployment to safeguard elections in the framework of the european union ?
then the tenor of the discussion became more restrained . it took many more months of debate before the german government finally did agree : 780 german soldiers were sent to dr congo and gabun .
germany 's condition for participation was that its soldiers would only be deployed in the capital , kinshasa .
pacification of the country 's restive eastern provinces was incumbent upon the united nations mission monuc .
and a large portion of the soldiers deployed were stationed outside dr congo , in gabun . was the bundeswehr 's participation in the mission of a purely symbolic nature ?
certainly not .
the congolese have lauded the german troops ' sober-mindedness and diplomacy .
violent unrest in kinshasa that left 23 dead was quickly allayed due above all to two factors : diplomatic pressure and intervention on the part of eu and un soldiers . but the momentary calm in dr congo is specious .
challenger jean-pierre bemba contested his electoral defeat and lost in court .
previously there had been gun battles between supporters of the opposing camps in kinshasa .
and in eastern dr congo on monday , un soldiers had used helicopters to block a rebel advance .
thousands of people fled from the violence , which bundeswehr representatives described as an incidental flare-up . in the meantime , bemba has accepted his defeat and resigned himself to a role in the opposition .
a powerful rebel group in the country 's restive east has just announced they would lay down their weapons .
and the fact that the elections proceeded relatively peacefully and fairly is also a positive signal . still , it does n't ensure dr congo a peaceful , democratic future .
the people are still the same .
surely , they must be able to keep their country running - especially politicians who should serve as a good example for everyone . it would have been good for dr congo if the eu soldiers ' mission had had a somewhat longer wind .
eufor has formally fulfilled its job .
but dr congo 's government will only be formed in mid-december .
it would have been important to accompany the inauguration of the new president in africa 's third-largest state .
but the mandate was not meant for that , according to the bundeswehr 's spokesman .
the mission served to safeguard the presidential and parliamentary elections and they were concluded peacefully , he said .
the mandate was valid for exactly four months and not a day longer . stefanie duckstein is an editor for deutsche welle 's africa service -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german minister not in favor of extending eu congo mandate german troops in congo could be heading home at the end of the year after defense minister franz josef jung said monday that the eu 's mandate for the drc should not be extended past its nov .

passengers on 221 european flights have been asked to contact their doctors . british airways -lrb- ba -rrb- said " very low traces of a radioactive substance " had been found on two of its three aircraft , which were taken out of service to " enable forensic examination to be carried out . " the third plane under investigation was given the all-clear late on thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uk authorities asked visitors who ate at london 's itsu sushi bar on nov .
1 to contact them ba published on its web site a list of the boeing 767 flights concerned , covering incoming and outgoing flights throughout november from london heathrow to düsseldorf , frankfurt , athens , barcelona , istanbul , larnaca , madrid , moscow , stockholm and vienna . greece , turkey and spain have asked ba to provide information on the flights which passed through their airports .
the airline estimated that 221 flights involving the three aircraft were affected , involving 33,000 passengers .
passengers on those planes were asked to contact their doctors .
it wrote that it was contacting passengers on the affected flights and had set up a telephone hotline for concerned customers . ba said it had been advised that the risk to public health was low and this was corroborated by british home secretary , john reid . in germany , the concerns of some worried parents were allayed by scientists at the gsf research institute near munich . " in our opinion , the health risks for the passengers are almost nil , " herwig paretzke , the head of the radiation protection department , told the süddeutsche zeitung : traces at sushi bar large quantities of the radioactive substance polonium 210 were found in the urine of former russian spy alexander litvinenko , who died on nov .
23 .
from his sick bed , he had accused russian president vladimir putin of ordering his killing .
russia has rejected the allegations . traces of polonium 210 have also been discovered at a central london sushi bar where he met with the italian academic mario scaramella and a central london hotel where the ex-secret serviceman met two russian contacts on nov .
1 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : litvinenko had been a kgb spy and was a critic of putin scaramella has reportedly been given the all-clear from possible radiation contamination . the substance has also been found at litvinenko 's north london home , at the office of exiled russian billionaire boris berezovsky - an acquaintance of litvinenko - and a security company .
two other locations are being searched . britain 's domestic press association news agency said it understood a number of litvinenko 's friends and family had also been tested , including berezovsky , but they are said to be in " perfect health . " the british daily telegraph newspaper reported that the polonium 210 that killed litvinenko had been dropped on the floor of a london hotel room , according to a senior government official . the paper also claimed that british scientists were believed to have identified the nuclear plant where the substance had been produced . the fact that 47 of the ba flights were between moscow and london reinforced " the theory that the origin of this material that killed alexander in moscow , " said litvinenko 's friend alex goldfarb in london . anti-terrorist investigators believe the substance was brought to london from moscow in the week before litvinenko 's death .
hospital staff tested public health officials have so far sent eight people for precautionary tests at a special clinic .
forty-nine staff at the two hospitals where litvinenko was treated have also had to provide urine for testing , with results expected next week .
none has been referred to the clinic and there was no risk of contamination at the hospitals , according to the health protection agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the investigation is ongoing elsewhere , speculation that poisoning could also be behind a mystery illness suffered by former russian prime minister yegor gaidar who was recuperating in a moscow hospital was confirmed by his spokesman valery natarov . " this was an unnatural poisoning , " natarov said .
" the doctors ca n't say what the substance is yet .
we are expecting an official diagnosis at the beginning of next week . " police in ireland , where gaidar fell ill last friday , have started an investigation into the cause of his illness . the academic , who is currently recovering in a moscow hospital , heads an economic think-tank in moscow that frequently criticizes putin 's policy of increasing state control over the economy . the confirmation of the unnatural nature of gaidar 's illness has fuelled fears that his case might be connected with the death of alexander litvinenko and murdered russian journalist anna politkovskaya . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans want council of europe involved in litvinenko inquiry the council of europe , not only british authorities , should be investigating the mysterious death of former russian spy alexander litvinenko , according to some german politicians .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : litvinenko had been a kgb spy and was a critic of putin scaramella has reportedly been given the all-clear from possible radiation contamination . the substance has also been found at litvinenko 's north london home , at the office of exiled russian billionaire boris berezovsky - an acquaintance of litvinenko - and a security company .
two other locations are being searched . britain 's domestic press association news agency said it understood a number of litvinenko 's friends and family had also been tested , including berezovsky , but they are said to be in " perfect health . " the british daily telegraph newspaper reported that the polonium 210 that killed litvinenko had been dropped on the floor of a london hotel room , according to a senior government official . the paper also claimed that british scientists were believed to have identified the nuclear plant where the substance had been produced . the fact that 47 of the ba flights were between moscow and london reinforced " the theory that the origin of this material that killed alexander in moscow , " said litvinenko 's friend alex goldfarb in london . anti-terrorist investigators believe the substance was brought to london from moscow in the week before litvinenko 's death .
hospital staff tested public health officials have so far sent eight people for precautionary tests at a special clinic .
forty-nine staff at the two hospitals where litvinenko was treated have also had to provide urine for testing , with results expected next week .
none has been referred to the clinic and there was no risk of contamination at the hospitals , according to the health protection agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the investigation is ongoing elsewhere , speculation that poisoning could also be behind a mystery illness suffered by former russian prime minister yegor gaidar who was recuperating in a moscow hospital was confirmed by his spokesman valery natarov . " this was an unnatural poisoning , " natarov said .
" the doctors ca n't say what the substance is yet .
we are expecting an official diagnosis at the beginning of next week . " police in ireland , where gaidar fell ill last friday , have started an investigation into the cause of his illness . the academic , who is currently recovering in a moscow hospital , heads an economic think-tank in moscow that frequently criticizes putin 's policy of increasing state control over the economy . the confirmation of the unnatural nature of gaidar 's illness has fuelled fears that his case might be connected with the death of alexander litvinenko and murdered russian journalist anna politkovskaya . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans want council of europe involved in litvinenko inquiry the council of europe , not only british authorities , should be investigating the mysterious death of former russian spy alexander litvinenko , according to some german politicians .

is germany becoming a greater target for islamist terrorism ? guido steinberg : german security officials are convinced that germany is continually becoming a greater target for islamist terrorists .
and there are indeed indications that that 's the case .
the most important one was the failed attack on two regional trains in north rhine-westphalia in summer 2006 .
it failed because the two bombs packed in suitcases did n't detonate . unfortunately little more is known about the background than that two lebanese men from tripoli and its surrounding were responsible for the deed .
above all , it is unclear to what extent a larger terror organization was behind the two men .
without this information , it 's very difficult to judge to what extent germany is becoming a target .
however , it appears we have to reckon with increased terrorist activities here . what effects could that have on the debate over the responsibility of muslims in germany toward the greater society ?
bildunterschrift : guido steinberg the news of attack plans has already had an effect on the debate about the role of muslims here .
more and more germans view the presence of muslims in germany as a security risk .
thus the debate about the integration of immigrants is in danger of being laden with aspects of fighting terrorism .
this could lead to a stronger polarization , which would damage the long-term aim of the integration of foreigners .
in my opinion , the integration debate and the discussion about fighting terrorism should be strictly separated . the fact that terrorist attacks were prevented in the initial planning stages is a huge success for german security officials .
can terrorism be fought with police resources alone ? the plans for an attack on an airplane were discovered in such an early stage that i believe it 's not even certain the suspects were actually in the planning stage .
in this respect , i 'm not sure whether it actually is a case of success for security officials .
however , this example shows once more that the security officials are closely monitoring at least parts of the militant scene . on the other hand , the case of the suitcase bombers shows that attacks often ca n't be prevented no matter how effectively security officials work .
of course , the resources police and intelligence officials have are inadequate .
fighting terrorism is also - if not primarily - a political task .
one must win over the sympathizers of terrorist groups through political measures .
only in such a way can one prevent terrorist groups from continually recruiting members , financing themselves and operating under the protection of their supporters . many experts hold the ambiguous " jihad " responsible for terrorism .
what 's your assessment of jihad as a mobilizing force ? there is no actual " jihad " but rather various interpretations of it .
jihadists are characterized by having chosen a jihadist concept that centers on armed battle against " non-believers . "
they view everyone who rejects their ideology as non-believers , whether they 're muslims , christians or jews .
muslims are indeed much more often their victims than non-muslims .
this ideology 's ability to mobilize is very strong as has repeatedly been shown by the throngs joining jihadist organizations in recent years , not least here in europe .

can a competent dialog serve to prevent islamist terrorism ? a dialog between muslims and greater society can certainly put tensions to rest .

is germany becoming a greater target for islamist terrorism ? guido steinberg : german security officials are convinced that germany is continually becoming a greater target for islamist terrorists .
and there are indeed indications that that 's the case .
the most important one was the failed attack on two regional trains in north rhine-westphalia in summer 2006 .
it failed because the two bombs packed in suitcases did n't detonate . unfortunately little more is known about the background than that two lebanese men from tripoli and its surrounding were responsible for the deed .
above all , it is unclear to what extent a larger terror organization was behind the two men .
without this information , it 's very difficult to judge to what extent germany is becoming a target .
however , it appears we have to reckon with increased terrorist activities here . what effects could that have on the debate over the responsibility of muslims in germany toward the greater society ?
bildunterschrift : guido steinberg the news of attack plans has already had an effect on the debate about the role of muslims here .
more and more germans view the presence of muslims in germany as a security risk .
thus the debate about the integration of immigrants is in danger of being laden with aspects of fighting terrorism .
this could lead to a stronger polarization , which would damage the long-term aim of the integration of foreigners .
in my opinion , the integration debate and the discussion about fighting terrorism should be strictly separated . the fact that terrorist attacks were prevented in the initial planning stages is a huge success for german security officials .
can terrorism be fought with police resources alone ? the plans for an attack on an airplane were discovered in such an early stage that i believe it 's not even certain the suspects were actually in the planning stage .
in this respect , i 'm not sure whether it actually is a case of success for security officials .
however , this example shows once more that the security officials are closely monitoring at least parts of the militant scene . on the other hand , the case of the suitcase bombers shows that attacks often ca n't be prevented no matter how effectively security officials work .
of course , the resources police and intelligence officials have are inadequate .
fighting terrorism is also - if not primarily - a political task .
one must win over the sympathizers of terrorist groups through political measures .
only in such a way can one prevent terrorist groups from continually recruiting members , financing themselves and operating under the protection of their supporters . many experts hold the ambiguous " jihad " responsible for terrorism .
what 's your assessment of jihad as a mobilizing force ? there is no actual " jihad " but rather various interpretations of it .
jihadists are characterized by having chosen a jihadist concept that centers on armed battle against " non-believers . "
they view everyone who rejects their ideology as non-believers , whether they 're muslims , christians or jews .
muslims are indeed much more often their victims than non-muslims .
this ideology 's ability to mobilize is very strong as has repeatedly been shown by the throngs joining jihadist organizations in recent years , not least here in europe .

dw 's stefanie duckstein says it ended too soon . mission completed , mission successful ?
defense minister franz josef jung gives the impression that he 'd like to quickly put the whole operation behind him .
like a mantra - unmistakably and repeatedly - he has asserted that extending the mandate is out of the question . the punctual pullout recalls the tough route to deciding on the mission in the first place .
as the election date in the democratic republic of congo drew ever closer , all germany 's leading politicians were in agreement that a peaceful dr congo could be a stabilizing factor for the entire region .
but sending a bundeswehr deployment to safeguard elections in the framework of the european union ?
then the tenor of the discussion became more restrained . it took many more months of debate before the german government finally did agree : 780 german soldiers were sent to dr congo and gabun .
germany 's condition for participation was that its soldiers would only be deployed in the capital , kinshasa .
pacification of the country 's restive eastern provinces was incumbent upon the united nations mission monuc .
and a large portion of the soldiers deployed were stationed outside dr congo , in gabun . was the bundeswehr 's participation in the mission of a purely symbolic nature ?
certainly not .
the congolese have lauded the german troops ' sober-mindedness and diplomacy .
violent unrest in kinshasa that left 23 dead was quickly allayed due above all to two factors : diplomatic pressure and intervention on the part of eu and un soldiers . but the momentary calm in dr congo is specious .
challenger jean-pierre bemba contested his electoral defeat and lost in court .
previously there had been gun battles between supporters of the opposing camps in kinshasa .
and in eastern dr congo on monday , un soldiers had used helicopters to block a rebel advance .
thousands of people fled from the violence , which bundeswehr representatives described as an incidental flare-up . in the meantime , bemba has accepted his defeat and resigned himself to a role in the opposition .
a powerful rebel group in the country 's restive east has just announced they would lay down their weapons .
and the fact that the elections proceeded relatively peacefully and fairly is also a positive signal . still , it does n't ensure dr congo a peaceful , democratic future .
the people are still the same .
surely , they must be able to keep their country running - especially politicians who should serve as a good example for everyone . it would have been good for dr congo if the eu soldiers ' mission had had a somewhat longer wind .
eufor has formally fulfilled its job .
but dr congo 's government will only be formed in mid-december .
it would have been important to accompany the inauguration of the new president in africa 's third-largest state .
but the mandate was not meant for that , according to the bundeswehr 's spokesman .
the mission served to safeguard the presidential and parliamentary elections and they were concluded peacefully , he said .
the mandate was valid for exactly four months and not a day longer . stefanie duckstein is an editor for deutsche welle 's africa service -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german minister not in favor of extending eu congo mandate german troops in congo could be heading home at the end of the year after defense minister franz josef jung said monday that the eu 's mandate for the drc should not be extended past its nov .
30 deadline .
-lrb- 26.09.2006 -rrb- eu peacekeepers intervene for first time in dr congo skirmishes between president kabila 's troops and rebel fighters began sunday when election results were announced .
eu and un troops stepped in when the fighting escalated and foreign diplomats were caught under fire .
-lrb- 22.08.2006 -rrb- experts say eu mission in dr congo is merely symbolic some 2,000 european troops , including 780 germans , will help safeguard the elections in dr congo .
government officials see the deployment as an important peacekeeping effort , but most experts call it a symbolic gesture .

kosovo albanians , who make up 90 percent of the small province 's population , are demanding independence while serbia is only prepared to grant them autonomy . merkel told tadic that germany was interested in having close relations with serbia and was prepared to help bring it more in line with mainstream europe . war criminal prosecutions required bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the search for war criminals goes on a condition for this was that belgrade " cooperated well " with the international criminal tribunal for former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- in the hague that was prosecuting war crimes in the former yugoslavia , she said . tadic , a member of the pro-western opposition democratic party , said germany was " the key partner " for serbia in europe .
germany is a member of the contact group of foreign powers that has been overseeing peace in the breakaway serbian province of kosovo since the 1998-1999 conflict . the president also thanked merkel for her support at this week 's nato summit in latvia , which offered serbia and its western balkan neighbors bosnia and montenegro a " partnership for peace " -lrb- pfp -rrb- agreement with the alliance . delayed decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian voters backed the new constitution in a referendum tadic 's visit to germany comes at a particularly sensitive moment for his country . the un 's kosovo mediator martti ahtisaari recently decided not to announce his plans for the future of the southern serbian province until after the elections , which tadic had called for jan .

the leaders broached sensitive topics such as kosovo and war criminals currently still at large . chancellor angela merkel met friday with serbian president boris tadic as part of a series of discussions with foreign leaders ahead of germany 's eu presidency starting in january . merkel said before the start of the meeting that she planned to raise the issue of kosovo , a province in southern serbia which has been under united nations administration since 1999 . a decision is due next year on whether the predominantly albanian-populated province should be given some form of independence - a step which serbia strongly opposes .
kosovo albanians , who make up 90 percent of the small province 's population , are demanding independence while serbia is only prepared to grant them autonomy . merkel told tadic that germany was interested in having close relations with serbia and was prepared to help bring it more in line with mainstream europe . war criminal prosecutions required bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the search for war criminals goes on a condition for this was that belgrade " cooperated well " with the international criminal tribunal for former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- in the hague that was prosecuting war crimes in the former yugoslavia , she said . tadic , a member of the pro-western opposition democratic party , said germany was " the key partner " for serbia in europe .
germany is a member of the contact group of foreign powers that has been overseeing peace in the breakaway serbian province of kosovo since the 1998-1999 conflict . the president also thanked merkel for her support at this week 's nato summit in latvia , which offered serbia and its western balkan neighbors bosnia and montenegro a " partnership for peace " -lrb- pfp -rrb- agreement with the alliance . delayed decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian voters backed the new constitution in a referendum tadic 's visit to germany comes at a particularly sensitive moment for his country . the un 's kosovo mediator martti ahtisaari recently decided not to announce his plans for the future of the southern serbian province until after the elections , which tadic had called for jan .
21 . the province has been run by a un mission since 1999 , when a nato bombing campaign ended a crackdown by belgrade on ethnic albanians in kosovo . the serbian parliament recently passed a new constitution - backed by voters in a referendum - that defined the province as an " integral " part of serbia .

" it is excellent news for our citizens , the army and state , " tadic said . tadic admitted that serbia still must arrest fugitive war crime suspects and bring them to justice at the icty . serbia 's failure to arrest the suspects , most of all the bosnian serb general ratko mladic , prompted brussels in may to suspend talks aimed at bringing belgrade closer to eu membership . icty head prosecutor carla del ponte , who has been pressing the west to isolate serbia over war crime fugitives , was disappointed with the decision in riga , her spokesman said in the hague . dw staff / afp , dpa -lrb- tt / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de serbia : getting the media on the right track since 2000 , the eu has poured millions of euros into various media projects in serbia .

experts fear germany could face a shortage of qualified university graduates if the trend continues . according to the latest figures from the federal statistics office , the number of new students enrolling at university has dropped for the third year running , despite the rise in the number of school leavers graduating with a high school diploma . german universities registered 343,700 new students this year , 3.5 percent fewer than last year . as german research and education minister annette schavan pointed out in response to the survey , the development is particularly worrying given germany 's need for academics and the overall brain drain of recent years . the biggest declines come in the fields of engineering , technology and computer studies .

one sticking point is that german states have tightened up entry requirements , and another is that many courses are available to a limited number of students .
first and foremost , however , is the fact that new students are being deterred by the introduction of higher education fees . " this is a slap in the face for the government , " achim meyer auf der heyde of the german students association told berlin 's daily taz , adding that education politicians should ask themselves whether the introduction of university fees and reduced students grants has sent the " wrong signals .

the action group against student fees hopes to have recruited some 400,000 students over the next 12 months , and many have the support of the universities themselves . but schavan told the handelsblatt newspaper on thursday that the introduction of fees was not behind the overall drop in students choosing to attend university as increasing numbers of students are enrolling in bavaria and hamburg 's universities despite students fee in place there . regional differences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students protested against the introduction of tuition fees the federal statistics office also pointed out that differences in enrollment numbers vary according from state to state .

the leaders broached sensitive topics such as kosovo and war criminals currently still at large . chancellor angela merkel met friday with serbian president boris tadic as part of a series of discussions with foreign leaders ahead of germany 's eu presidency starting in january . merkel said before the start of the meeting that she planned to raise the issue of kosovo , a province in southern serbia which has been under united nations administration since 1999 . a decision is due next year on whether the predominantly albanian-populated province should be given some form of independence - a step which serbia strongly opposes .
kosovo albanians , who make up 90 percent of the small province 's population , are demanding independence while serbia is only prepared to grant them autonomy . merkel told tadic that germany was interested in having close relations with serbia and was prepared to help bring it more in line with mainstream europe . war criminal prosecutions required bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the search for war criminals goes on a condition for this was that belgrade " cooperated well " with the international criminal tribunal for former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- in the hague that was prosecuting war crimes in the former yugoslavia , she said . tadic , a member of the pro-western opposition democratic party , said germany was " the key partner " for serbia in europe .
germany is a member of the contact group of foreign powers that has been overseeing peace in the breakaway serbian province of kosovo since the 1998-1999 conflict . the president also thanked merkel for her support at this week 's nato summit in latvia , which offered serbia and its western balkan neighbors bosnia and montenegro a " partnership for peace " -lrb- pfp -rrb- agreement with the alliance . delayed decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian voters backed the new constitution in a referendum tadic 's visit to germany comes at a particularly sensitive moment for his country . the un 's kosovo mediator martti ahtisaari recently decided not to announce his plans for the future of the southern serbian province until after the elections , which tadic had called for jan .
21 . the province has been run by a un mission since 1999 , when a nato bombing campaign ended a crackdown by belgrade on ethnic albanians in kosovo . the serbian parliament recently passed a new constitution - backed by voters in a referendum - that defined the province as an " integral " part of serbia .
but a final un proposal is widely expected to grant kosovo sovereignty . a small step towards the eu membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian president tadic was happy with nato responding to the " partnership for peace " agreement , which nato leaders , grouped at a summit in the latvian capital riga , offered to serbia on wednesday , the serbian president said in a statement that long reforms had paid off . " it is excellent news for our citizens , the army and state , " tadic said . tadic admitted that serbia still must arrest fugitive war crime suspects and bring them to justice at the icty . serbia 's failure to arrest the suspects , most of all the bosnian serb general ratko mladic , prompted brussels in may to suspend talks aimed at bringing belgrade closer to eu membership . icty head prosecutor carla del ponte , who has been pressing the west to isolate serbia over war crime fugitives , was disappointed with the decision in riga , her spokesman said in the hague . dw staff / afp , dpa -lrb- tt / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de serbia : getting the media on the right track since 2000 , the eu has poured millions of euros into various media projects in serbia .

" in the face of this reality , we are called , together with all other christian communities , to renew europe 's awareness of its christian roots , traditions and values , giving them new vitality , " he said . his statement came just two days after he reportedly told turkey 's islamist-turned-conservative prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , in what was widely seen as a spectacular u-turn , that he supported turkey 's membership in the european union . turkey in the eu , he had said while still joseph cardinal ratzinger , would be " a grave error ... against the tide of history . " religious freedom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope attended the divine liturgy at istanbul 's st. george 's church in a later joint declaration with bartholomew i , at the risk of once again rubbing up his hosts the wrong way , the pontiff said respect for religious freedom must be a criterion for membership in the eu , which must ensure that its members respect the rights of their religious minorities . it was near-overt backing for the patriarchate 's complaints of restrictions imposed on it by turkey , including the closure of a theological seminary and the confiscation of a number of properties from christian foundations . another bone of contention is turkey 's refusal to recognize bartholomew i as the ecumenical , or universal , leader of about 150 million orthodox faithful around the world . turkey repeated on thursday it has no intention of budging on this issue . " we see the patriarchate as a turkish institution and this is how our laws , too , see it , " said foreign ministry spokesman namik tan .
" other definitions are in no way binding for us .
we have proclaimed to the world that we do not recognize the title ' ecumenical . " ' overcoming the schism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi -lrb- left -rrb- called divisions among christians a " scandal to the world " benedict xvi and bartholomew i have both put reconciliation of the catholic and orthodox churches high on their agendas , and the pope described the schism , which dates back to 1054 , as a " scandal to the world . " but he remained steadfast on a key point of contention between the two rites - papal authority - by referring in his speech to the catholic leader 's " universal responsibility . " gestures of reconciliation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : originally a church , then a mosque , now a museum : hagia sophia in istanbul on thursday evening , benedict xvi became the second pope in history to set foot in a mosque - after john paul ii in damascus in 2001 - when he visited istanbul 's famed blue mosque , coming from the nearby 6th century basilica-museum of hagia sophia . the hagia sophia visit has angered muslim hardliners , who perceive the visit as proof of an effort to reclaim the building - a mosque under ottoman rule before becoming a museum under the republic - as a church . but during his visit to the blue mosque , the pope turned towards mecca in a gesture of muslim prayer , his hands crossed over his stomach , at the suggestion of the muslim cleric accompanying him .

" i am glad that we will be able to continue these discussions in washington before christmas , " steinmeier told reporters , adding that a meeting had been called on dec .

if the negotiations between hamas and fatah could restart and the power struggle be resolved then this would be a great asset to bring to the table in discussions with israel , steinmeier added . palestinian president mahmud abbas said on thursday that talks between the warring factions had reached an impasse .
steinmeier was due to meet with abbas later on friday . steinmeier also reiterated the need for syria to be involved in any middle east peace discussions , noting that while damascus seemed reticent on the subject , it was obvious to all involved that stability in the region depended in no small part to syria 's involvement . " all the partners in these discussions must work to end this conflict , " steinmeier said .
" and i believe that we need syria if we are going to create a lasting solution . " steinmeier ready to talk with syria steinmeier plans to visit the syrian capital on monday but has no official appointment at this time .

" our goal remains to convince syria to play a constructive role in the middle east , both in terms of the conflict between israelis and palestinians and in particular lebanon , " he said . " i would like to stress in this context that syria must know that our support for an independent and sovereign lebanon is a key component of our middle east policy .

is grinch planning to steal christmas again ? it 's started again : the annual euphoria which converts parts of the german capital into a teutonic version of a us shopping mall .
customers are beginning to be lured into a commercial winter paradise in which countless mugs of despair-dampening mulled wine , consumed against the headache-guaranteeing cacophony of jingle bells and white christmas , can easily drive many a parent to the brink of insanity .
at least , it comes only once a year . berlin 's newly built central train station has erected a 20-meter -lrb- 65-foot -rrb- monster tree with more than 28,000 branches and around 40,000 christmas crystal ornaments , the most expensive tree berlin has ever seen .
but something is rotten in christmas land .
berlin 's santa clauses are , apparently , getting lazy . " heinzelmännchen " -lrb- santa 's little helpers -rrb- - a berlin-based student organization that specializes in finding employment for santa clauses and christmas angels - said that one month before christmas , they have only received 100 father christmas applications . " i 'm worried because we need young talent , " said project manager rene heydeck .
" we need 300 applicants more to cover some 4,500 jobs that we 're likely to have this year . " but what kind of angels ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's new popstar angels perhaps , germany is looking for a different kind of magic this winter .
the wildly popular german singing contest popstars , which over the past few years has produced one successful group -lrb- " no angels " -rrb- and a most diverse series of flops , was running this year under the motto " the country needs new angels . " and by angels , the producers certainly did n't have christmas in mind .
and if they did , then it 's because they , too , wanted to take advantage of the lucrative christmas market .
senna , bahar and mandy - the three girls who recently made it to the band called monrose - will have their first single released on dec .

dw 's stefanie duckstein says it ended too soon . mission completed , mission successful ?
defense minister franz josef jung gives the impression that he 'd like to quickly put the whole operation behind him .
like a mantra - unmistakably and repeatedly - he has asserted that extending the mandate is out of the question . the punctual pullout recalls the tough route to deciding on the mission in the first place .
as the election date in the democratic republic of congo drew ever closer , all germany 's leading politicians were in agreement that a peaceful dr congo could be a stabilizing factor for the entire region .
but sending a bundeswehr deployment to safeguard elections in the framework of the european union ?
then the tenor of the discussion became more restrained . it took many more months of debate before the german government finally did agree : 780 german soldiers were sent to dr congo and gabun .
germany 's condition for participation was that its soldiers would only be deployed in the capital , kinshasa .
pacification of the country 's restive eastern provinces was incumbent upon the united nations mission monuc .
and a large portion of the soldiers deployed were stationed outside dr congo , in gabun . was the bundeswehr 's participation in the mission of a purely symbolic nature ?
certainly not .
the congolese have lauded the german troops ' sober-mindedness and diplomacy .
violent unrest in kinshasa that left 23 dead was quickly allayed due above all to two factors : diplomatic pressure and intervention on the part of eu and un soldiers . but the momentary calm in dr congo is specious .
challenger jean-pierre bemba contested his electoral defeat and lost in court .
previously there had been gun battles between supporters of the opposing camps in kinshasa .
and in eastern dr congo on monday , un soldiers had used helicopters to block a rebel advance .
thousands of people fled from the violence , which bundeswehr representatives described as an incidental flare-up . in the meantime , bemba has accepted his defeat and resigned himself to a role in the opposition .
a powerful rebel group in the country 's restive east has just announced they would lay down their weapons .
and the fact that the elections proceeded relatively peacefully and fairly is also a positive signal . still , it does n't ensure dr congo a peaceful , democratic future .
the people are still the same .
surely , they must be able to keep their country running - especially politicians who should serve as a good example for everyone . it would have been good for dr congo if the eu soldiers ' mission had had a somewhat longer wind .
eufor has formally fulfilled its job .
but dr congo 's government will only be formed in mid-december .
it would have been important to accompany the inauguration of the new president in africa 's third-largest state .
but the mandate was not meant for that , according to the bundeswehr 's spokesman .
the mission served to safeguard the presidential and parliamentary elections and they were concluded peacefully , he said .
the mandate was valid for exactly four months and not a day longer . stefanie duckstein is an editor for deutsche welle 's africa service -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german minister not in favor of extending eu congo mandate german troops in congo could be heading home at the end of the year after defense minister franz josef jung said monday that the eu 's mandate for the drc should not be extended past its nov .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . i hope pope benedict 's visit turns out to be safe and satisfying for both sides in terms of the messages given for improved dialogue , understanding and support .
i expect that such a visit should set an example in bringing these cultures closer together , increasing mutual familiarity , decreasing fear and distrust .
both the western world , especially the us and the eu , and the eastern world , especially the extremist islamist groups , should closely follow this example and consider more moderation in their policies . - ege yildirim , turkish student in new york i think that -lrb- the pope -rrb- will move the roman catholic church closer to the orthodox church .
he is tactful , respectful , humble , and knowledgeable , and that is appreciated .
as for the muslims , no one can mend fences if there is no willingness for dialogue .
i feel that if the press judges the pope based on what he will accomplish in that matter , he will be misjudged .
everything one can do in some situations is to defend the truth . - elisabeth heptner , usa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's pm erdogan met briefly with the pope , though the visit was supposedly not political the pontiff 's visit has extreme ramifications for all organized religions around the world .
there needs to be more dialog , compassion , and understanding if religion is to survive .
the common thread between all the devotions is the communication and ability of the religious forces to help keep peace in the world .
it is within this universal compromise that all religious thought is correct and there is no one way to believe in the power of the universe , however you define it .
this attempt by the pope is noble and important .
i believe many feel this way , but there are those who do not .
we pray for them and perhaps they will see the light . - j. greenspan i am a german and a muslim .
the utterances of the pope did not disturb me , as he cited history .
the catholic church is anti-everything -lrb- except for their wrongdoings against choir-boys -rrb- .
on the other hand we muslims have to respect that we are all children of the same yahweh / god / allah and that includes the jews , who are by heritance the direct brothers of the arabs . - harm g. frey the raging crowds in turkey are angry and it 's their own fault .
they are the hateful ones and the intolerant ones .
there can be no dialogue until the angry crowds cool off and realize that they are wrong , not the pope . - f rank garlo by their very actions turkish muslims confirm that the papal quotes from a 14th century figure apply just as much to their culture today .
hopefully relations with orthodox christians will continue to improve .
i can see no animosity between orthodox and catholic christians at an individual level .
that happy state of affairs needs to be " ratified " by the religious institutions concerned .
i think we should all pray for the pope 's safety . - george j. berkowski bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dialog with the orthodox christians was a major reason for the trip when turks and turkish media meet this man they will begin to listen - not like the last time , when they went off crackers because they did not understand the nature of exploratory theological reminiscences .
their reaction was extremely disappointing and fed the voracious western media , whose take then bled into those within the muslim world who still see no option but to be hostile to any christian initiative .
the closed muslim mind is almost a greater threat to a world coalition of culture , religious values and - ultimately - economic interests .
the west awaits a muslim renaissance , which will take nothing from its integrity but merely express its participation in the human story .
perceived threats of a world dominated by us financial interests will be allayed with a joint financial venture between the enormous wealth of the oil-rich middle east and the west . in my country , australia , we have a noble history of reconciliation with the turkish people whose land our heroic military forces invaded at gallipoli in 1915 .
ataturk himself said in effect that the mothers of the australian dead need not mourn because the turkish people would honour the australian soldiers who lay on their land : they would harbour them .
and over the last twenty years my city of melbourne has received tens of thousands of turkish immigrants who build mosques and businesses and even sent one daughter to the rather expensive roman catholic school where i teach .
christianity has no borders .
we are brought up -lrb- most of us -rrb- in the belief that samaritans are the first instructors to us of who is a human being and thus worthy of honour and protection . - herbie , melbourne , australia compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope 's trip to turkey starts on conciliatory note pope benedict xvi began a delicate mission to turkey , trading conciliatory gestures with prime minister recep tayyip erdogan as both sought to calm the storm unleashed when the pontiff appeared to link islam to violence .
-lrb- 28.11.2006 -rrb- pope 's visit overshadowed by confrontation with islam pope benedict xvi 's visit to turkey to heal a rift with the eastern orthodox church , has been overshadowed by muslim anger over remarks about islam .
muslim turks seek dialogue , but will be monitoring his every word .
-lrb- 27.11.2006 -rrb- opinion : turkey 's unwelcome guest whether the pope likes it or not , his trip to turkey , which starts tuesday , has turned into a confrontation between islam and christianity , dw-tv 's religious correspondent john berwick writes .

the leaders broached sensitive topics such as kosovo and war criminals currently still at large . chancellor angela merkel met friday with serbian president boris tadic as part of a series of discussions with foreign leaders ahead of germany 's eu presidency starting in january . merkel said before the start of the meeting that she planned to raise the issue of kosovo , a province in southern serbia which has been under united nations administration since 1999 . a decision is due next year on whether the predominantly albanian-populated province should be given some form of independence - a step which serbia strongly opposes .
kosovo albanians , who make up 90 percent of the small province 's population , are demanding independence while serbia is only prepared to grant them autonomy . merkel told tadic that germany was interested in having close relations with serbia and was prepared to help bring it more in line with mainstream europe . war criminal prosecutions required bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the search for war criminals goes on a condition for this was that belgrade " cooperated well " with the international criminal tribunal for former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- in the hague that was prosecuting war crimes in the former yugoslavia , she said . tadic , a member of the pro-western opposition democratic party , said germany was " the key partner " for serbia in europe .
germany is a member of the contact group of foreign powers that has been overseeing peace in the breakaway serbian province of kosovo since the 1998-1999 conflict . the president also thanked merkel for her support at this week 's nato summit in latvia , which offered serbia and its western balkan neighbors bosnia and montenegro a " partnership for peace " -lrb- pfp -rrb- agreement with the alliance . delayed decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian voters backed the new constitution in a referendum tadic 's visit to germany comes at a particularly sensitive moment for his country . the un 's kosovo mediator martti ahtisaari recently decided not to announce his plans for the future of the southern serbian province until after the elections , which tadic had called for jan .

" it is excellent news for our citizens , the army and state , " tadic said . tadic admitted that serbia still must arrest fugitive war crime suspects and bring them to justice at the icty . serbia 's failure to arrest the suspects , most of all the bosnian serb general ratko mladic , prompted brussels in may to suspend talks aimed at bringing belgrade closer to eu membership . icty head prosecutor carla del ponte , who has been pressing the west to isolate serbia over war crime fugitives , was disappointed with the decision in riga , her spokesman said in the hague . dw staff / afp , dpa -lrb- tt / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de serbia : getting the media on the right track since 2000 , the eu has poured millions of euros into various media projects in serbia .

" i am glad that we will be able to continue these discussions in washington before christmas , " steinmeier told reporters , adding that a meeting had been called on dec .

if the negotiations between hamas and fatah could restart and the power struggle be resolved then this would be a great asset to bring to the table in discussions with israel , steinmeier added . palestinian president mahmud abbas said on thursday that talks between the warring factions had reached an impasse .
steinmeier was due to meet with abbas later on friday . steinmeier also reiterated the need for syria to be involved in any middle east peace discussions , noting that while damascus seemed reticent on the subject , it was obvious to all involved that stability in the region depended in no small part to syria 's involvement . " all the partners in these discussions must work to end this conflict , " steinmeier said .
" and i believe that we need syria if we are going to create a lasting solution . " steinmeier ready to talk with syria steinmeier plans to visit the syrian capital on monday but has no official appointment at this time .
his last planned trip to damascus was postponed in august due to what he called inflammatory statements from syria 's president about israel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier may pay assad a visit president bashar al-assad described israel as an enemy , said it was an honor for syria to support hezbollah in its struggle against israel and described resistance against the jewish state as legitimate . martin jäger , the foreign ministry 's spokesman , echoed steinmeier 's message to syria in a statement to reporters .

the leaders broached sensitive topics such as kosovo and war criminals currently still at large . chancellor angela merkel met friday with serbian president boris tadic as part of a series of discussions with foreign leaders ahead of germany 's eu presidency starting in january . merkel said before the start of the meeting that she planned to raise the issue of kosovo , a province in southern serbia which has been under united nations administration since 1999 . a decision is due next year on whether the predominantly albanian-populated province should be given some form of independence - a step which serbia strongly opposes .
kosovo albanians , who make up 90 percent of the small province 's population , are demanding independence while serbia is only prepared to grant them autonomy . merkel told tadic that germany was interested in having close relations with serbia and was prepared to help bring it more in line with mainstream europe . war criminal prosecutions required bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the search for war criminals goes on a condition for this was that belgrade " cooperated well " with the international criminal tribunal for former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- in the hague that was prosecuting war crimes in the former yugoslavia , she said . tadic , a member of the pro-western opposition democratic party , said germany was " the key partner " for serbia in europe .
germany is a member of the contact group of foreign powers that has been overseeing peace in the breakaway serbian province of kosovo since the 1998-1999 conflict . the president also thanked merkel for her support at this week 's nato summit in latvia , which offered serbia and its western balkan neighbors bosnia and montenegro a " partnership for peace " -lrb- pfp -rrb- agreement with the alliance . delayed decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian voters backed the new constitution in a referendum tadic 's visit to germany comes at a particularly sensitive moment for his country . the un 's kosovo mediator martti ahtisaari recently decided not to announce his plans for the future of the southern serbian province until after the elections , which tadic had called for jan .
21 . the province has been run by a un mission since 1999 , when a nato bombing campaign ended a crackdown by belgrade on ethnic albanians in kosovo . the serbian parliament recently passed a new constitution - backed by voters in a referendum - that defined the province as an " integral " part of serbia .
but a final un proposal is widely expected to grant kosovo sovereignty . a small step towards the eu membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian president tadic was happy with nato responding to the " partnership for peace " agreement , which nato leaders , grouped at a summit in the latvian capital riga , offered to serbia on wednesday , the serbian president said in a statement that long reforms had paid off . " it is excellent news for our citizens , the army and state , " tadic said . tadic admitted that serbia still must arrest fugitive war crime suspects and bring them to justice at the icty . serbia 's failure to arrest the suspects , most of all the bosnian serb general ratko mladic , prompted brussels in may to suspend talks aimed at bringing belgrade closer to eu membership . icty head prosecutor carla del ponte , who has been pressing the west to isolate serbia over war crime fugitives , was disappointed with the decision in riga , her spokesman said in the hague . dw staff / afp , dpa -lrb- tt / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de serbia : getting the media on the right track since 2000 , the eu has poured millions of euros into various media projects in serbia .

the leaders broached sensitive topics such as kosovo and war criminals currently still at large . chancellor angela merkel met friday with serbian president boris tadic as part of a series of discussions with foreign leaders ahead of germany 's eu presidency starting in january . merkel said before the start of the meeting that she planned to raise the issue of kosovo , a province in southern serbia which has been under united nations administration since 1999 . a decision is due next year on whether the predominantly albanian-populated province should be given some form of independence - a step which serbia strongly opposes .
kosovo albanians , who make up 90 percent of the small province 's population , are demanding independence while serbia is only prepared to grant them autonomy . merkel told tadic that germany was interested in having close relations with serbia and was prepared to help bring it more in line with mainstream europe . war criminal prosecutions required bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the search for war criminals goes on a condition for this was that belgrade " cooperated well " with the international criminal tribunal for former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- in the hague that was prosecuting war crimes in the former yugoslavia , she said . tadic , a member of the pro-western opposition democratic party , said germany was " the key partner " for serbia in europe .

the leaders broached sensitive topics such as kosovo and war criminals currently still at large . chancellor angela merkel met friday with serbian president boris tadic as part of a series of discussions with foreign leaders ahead of germany 's eu presidency starting in january . merkel said before the start of the meeting that she planned to raise the issue of kosovo , a province in southern serbia which has been under united nations administration since 1999 . a decision is due next year on whether the predominantly albanian-populated province should be given some form of independence - a step which serbia strongly opposes .
kosovo albanians , who make up 90 percent of the small province 's population , are demanding independence while serbia is only prepared to grant them autonomy . merkel told tadic that germany was interested in having close relations with serbia and was prepared to help bring it more in line with mainstream europe . war criminal prosecutions required bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the search for war criminals goes on a condition for this was that belgrade " cooperated well " with the international criminal tribunal for former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- in the hague that was prosecuting war crimes in the former yugoslavia , she said . tadic , a member of the pro-western opposition democratic party , said germany was " the key partner " for serbia in europe .
germany is a member of the contact group of foreign powers that has been overseeing peace in the breakaway serbian province of kosovo since the 1998-1999 conflict . the president also thanked merkel for her support at this week 's nato summit in latvia , which offered serbia and its western balkan neighbors bosnia and montenegro a " partnership for peace " -lrb- pfp -rrb- agreement with the alliance . delayed decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian voters backed the new constitution in a referendum tadic 's visit to germany comes at a particularly sensitive moment for his country . the un 's kosovo mediator martti ahtisaari recently decided not to announce his plans for the future of the southern serbian province until after the elections , which tadic had called for jan .
21 . the province has been run by a un mission since 1999 , when a nato bombing campaign ended a crackdown by belgrade on ethnic albanians in kosovo . the serbian parliament recently passed a new constitution - backed by voters in a referendum - that defined the province as an " integral " part of serbia .
but a final un proposal is widely expected to grant kosovo sovereignty . a small step towards the eu membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian president tadic was happy with nato responding to the " partnership for peace " agreement , which nato leaders , grouped at a summit in the latvian capital riga , offered to serbia on wednesday , the serbian president said in a statement that long reforms had paid off . " it is excellent news for our citizens , the army and state , " tadic said . tadic admitted that serbia still must arrest fugitive war crime suspects and bring them to justice at the icty . serbia 's failure to arrest the suspects , most of all the bosnian serb general ratko mladic , prompted brussels in may to suspend talks aimed at bringing belgrade closer to eu membership . icty head prosecutor carla del ponte , who has been pressing the west to isolate serbia over war crime fugitives , was disappointed with the decision in riga , her spokesman said in the hague . dw staff / afp , dpa -lrb- tt / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de serbia : getting the media on the right track since 2000 , the eu has poured millions of euros into various media projects in serbia .

the commission said that : " despite its high cost , home credit is much valued by many customers and we would not be helping these people if we made home credit less available . "
new obligations in response , ed mayo chair of the ncc welcomed the competition commissions proposed reforms .

so what is at stake ?
microsoft founded : 1975 hq : redmond , washington staff : 71,000 sales : $ 44.3bn operating profit : $ 16.5bn windows sales : $ 13.2bn office sales : ~ $ 10bn financial year to 30 june 2006 source : annual report 2006 you run a company where two of your product lines account for more than 56 % of your sales .
they make enough profit to sustain losses in other divisions .
would you worry about relaunching them at the same time ?
we are not talking about pocket money here .
during the last financial year microsoft 's operating system and office software divisions made an operating profit of $ 18.5bn -lrb- £ 9.5bn , 14.1bn euro -rrb- on a turnover of just under $ 25bn .
but is microsoft really taking a gamble ?
no vista christmas let 's not forget that vista is late .
very late .
instead of three years , it has taken microsoft five years and 10,000 workers to get windows vista ready for the big time .
because last-minute delays pushed the launch to the end of the year , microsoft had to settle for an awkward staged release .
microsoft has given its office 2007 software suite a new look enlarge image the new operating system will be sold to corporate customers first ; consumers will not get their hands on vista until 30 january 2007 .
logistically it would have been " just too difficult to make vista broadly available to everyone , " says gordon frazer , managing director of microsoft uk .
that means that microsoft and its hardware partners - computer makers including dell and hewlett-packard - will be missing out on this year 's christmas business .
" it 's no secret that -lsb- computer manufacturers -rsb- would have liked the launch in time for the holidays , " says david smith , a vista expert at consulting firm gartner .
why upgrade ?
to make things worse , many customers will ask why they should upgrade at all .
yes , microsoft 's current operating system , windows xp , does not look as pretty as rival offerings like apple 's os x. but it is stable , fairly secure , and compatible with tens of thousands of supporting hardware and computer programs .
why go through the cost and pain of buying , installing and learning a new operating system ?
many companies are wary .
they run specialised software on windows and use hundreds of different pieces of hardware .
they will have to test each and every one of them to see whether they work under vista .
and then there are those who wonder whether operating systems do matter at all .
run a good browser on any old operating system , they say , and the majority of people can meet most of their software needs online and on demand .
the vista wave on new computers vista promises to be much easier on the eye that does not stop microsoft from being bullish about the prospects for its new operating system .
" vista will be the fastest-selling windows operating system , " predicts microsoft 's gordon frazer .
he points to forecasts by technology consulting firms like idc , who predict that within one year 100m computers will be running vista .
david smith at gartner agrees : " in 18 months you will see the majority of -lsb- business -rsb- computers running on vista . "
the captive customer in some ways , vista 's success is inevitable .
this is not a function of vista 's selling points - better security , entertainment and performance - but habit .
only early adopters will upgrade to vista straight away - for example avid gamers who want to play snazzy games that make use of microsoft 's new vista-only directx 10 standard .
start : vista users will not have to learn windows from scratch most consumers will adopt vista gradually , as they replace their old computers .
from 30 january 2007 nearly every new windows computer on every shelf will come either preloaded with vista , or the promise of a free upgrade to the new operating system .
traditionally this so-called oem business -lrb- where the operating system is pre-installed on the computer -rrb- accounts for about 80 % of microsoft 's windows revenues .
after a couple of " tough months in december and january " computer makers will see " increased sales from consumers who waited to buy , " predicts gartner 's david smith .
and as vista is much better than microsoft 's current offering , there is little reason to assume that customers will defect en masse to rivals like apple or linux .
after all , they failed to do so when windows xp was riddled with security holes .
it 's not much different for large companies , who tend to be firmly wedded in the microsoft universe .
most corporate it managers plan their computer replacement cycles around windows upgrades .
it helps that vista can adapt to the hardware capabilities of the computer it runs on .
companies will take about 18 months to sort out compatibility problems , says mr smith .
in 2008 at the latest we will see " massive numbers of upgrades " .
the office software will follow a similar pattern , or be even more successful as it can run on both windows vista and xp .
" office 2007 will find good acceptance , " says melissa webster of idc .
the last big windows roll-out ?
there are still pitfalls , though .
the european commission is breathing down microsoft 's neck , pushing the software maker to give rivals better access to the inner workings of its operating system .
many vista testers reported compatibility issues ; if they are not sorted in time for the consumer launch plenty of customers might stay away .
and if eager hackers find a way past microsoft 's new defences - " vista is secure by design , " says microsoft 's gordon frazer - then the new operating system could be in real trouble .
microsoft , however , has an even bigger problem to solve : what will it do next ?
have your say i have been using both pieces of software in various beta forms , the progress is outstanding in each build darren wilson , huntingdon send us your experiences should the company really commit so many resources to yet another hugely complex software project ?
instead , says david smith at gartner , microsoft may prefer to adopt a more modular approach and offer many smaller paid-for updates of its operating system .

so what is at stake ?
microsoft founded : 1975 hq : redmond , washington staff : 71,000 sales : $ 44.3bn operating profit : $ 16.5bn windows sales : $ 13.2bn office sales : ~ $ 10bn financial year to 30 june 2006 source : annual report 2006 you run a company where two of your product lines account for more than 56 % of your sales .
they make enough profit to sustain losses in other divisions .
would you worry about relaunching them at the same time ?
we are not talking about pocket money here .
during the last financial year microsoft 's operating system and office software divisions made an operating profit of $ 18.5bn -lrb- £ 9.5bn , 14.1bn euro -rrb- on a turnover of just under $ 25bn .
but is microsoft really taking a gamble ?
no vista christmas let 's not forget that vista is late .
very late .
instead of three years , it has taken microsoft five years and 10,000 workers to get windows vista ready for the big time .
because last-minute delays pushed the launch to the end of the year , microsoft had to settle for an awkward staged release .
the new operating system will be sold to corporate customers first ; consumers will not get their hands on vista until 30 january 2007 .
logistically it would have been " just too difficult to make vista broadly available to everyone , " says gordon frazer , managing director of microsoft uk .
that means that microsoft and its hardware partners - computer makers including dell and hewlett-packard - will be missing out on this year 's christmas business .
" it 's no secret that -lsb- computer manufacturers -rsb- would have liked the launch in time for the holidays , " says david smith , a vista expert at consulting firm gartner .
why upgrade ?
to make things worse , many customers will ask why they should upgrade at all .
yes , microsoft 's current operating system , windows xp , does not look as pretty as rival offerings like apple 's os x. but it is stable , fairly secure , and compatible with tens of thousands of supporting hardware and computer programs .
why go through the cost and pain of buying , installing and learning a new operating system ?
many companies are wary .
they run specialised software on windows and use hundreds of different pieces of hardware .
they will have to test each and every one of them to see whether they work under vista .
and then there are those who wonder whether operating systems do matter at all .
run a good browser on any old operating system , they say , and the majority of people can meet most of their software needs online and on demand .
the vista wave that does not stop microsoft from being bullish about the prospects for its new operating system .
" vista will be the fastest-selling windows operating system , " predicts microsoft 's gordon frazer .
he points to forecasts by technology consulting firms like idc , who predict that within one year 100m computers will be running vista .
david smith at gartner agrees : " in 18 months you will see the majority of -lsb- business -rsb- computers running on vista . "
the captive customer in some ways , vista 's success is inevitable .
this is not a function of vista 's selling points - better security , entertainment and performance - but habit .
only early adopters will upgrade to vista straight away - for example avid gamers who want to play snazzy games that make use of microsoft 's new vista-only directx 10 standard .
most consumers will adopt vista gradually , as they replace their old computers .
from 30 january 2007 nearly every new windows computer on every shelf will come either preloaded with vista , or the promise of a free upgrade to the new operating system .
traditionally this so-called oem business -lrb- where the operating system is pre-installed on the computer -rrb- accounts for about 80 % of microsoft 's windows revenues .
after a couple of " tough months in december and january " computer makers will see " increased sales from consumers who waited to buy , " predicts gartner 's david smith .
and as vista is much better than microsoft 's current offering , there is little reason to assume that customers will defect en masse to rivals like apple or linux .
after all , they failed to do so when windows xp was riddled with security holes .
it 's not much different for large companies , who tend to be firmly wedded in the microsoft universe .
most corporate it managers plan their computer replacement cycles around windows upgrades .
it helps that vista can adapt to the hardware capabilities of the computer it runs on .
companies will take about 18 months to sort out compatibility problems , says mr smith .
in 2008 at the latest we will see " massive numbers of upgrades " .
the office software will follow a similar pattern , or be even more successful as it can run on both windows vista and xp .
" office 2007 will find good acceptance , " says melissa webster of idc .
the last big windows roll-out ?
there are still pitfalls , though .
the european commission is breathing down microsoft 's neck , pushing the software maker to give rivals better access to the inner workings of its operating system .
many vista testers reported compatibility issues ; if they are not sorted in time for the consumer launch plenty of customers might stay away .
and if eager hackers find a way past microsoft 's new defences - " vista is secure by design , " says microsoft 's gordon frazer - then the new operating system could be in real trouble .
microsoft , however , has an even bigger problem to solve : what will it do next ?
have your say " i have been using both pieces of software in various beta forms , the progress is outstanding in each build " darren wilson , huntingdon send us your experiences should the company really commit so many resources to yet another hugely complex software project ?
instead , says david smith at gartner , microsoft may prefer to adopt a more modular approach and offer many smaller paid-for updates of its operating system .
then it would not just be vista 's user interface that increasingly looks like something coming from apple .

bbc news -pipe- uk -pipe- scotland -pipe- concern at nutrition in hospitals bbc news / scotland graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- uk contents : england -pipe- northern ireland -pipe- scotland -pipe- wales -pipe- uk politics -pipe- education -pipe- magazine thursday , 30 november 2006 , 08:31 gmt concern at nutrition in hospitals hospital food needs to be more nutritious , according to a watchdog .
the audit scotland report said patients were not routinely screened for poor nutrition , and claimed this should be a priority for the nhs .
the research also suggested catering services had improved over the past three years and patients were now being offered a greater choice of food .
health minister andy kerr said he accepted that things needed to improve across scotland .
the scottish executive said it was now working on new nutritional standards , which nhs caterers will have to meet .
in 2003 audit scotland called for nutritional care to be given a higher priority by staff in the nhs .
the new study , based on checks of 149 hospitals across 16 health boards , suggested boards still needed to do more .
patient surveys the 2003 report said health boards should carry out surveys at least every three months to find out patients ' views on hospital food .
however , the new report said only 30 % of hospitals were doing that and suggested almost a fifth did not carry out any patient satisfaction surveys .
barbara hurst , director of public reporting in health at audit scotland , said : " hospital food was key to the nutritional care of patients and helped them to get better .
" boards need to do more to ensure patients are getting the nutritional care they need as a matter of priority . "
she added boards were now providing greater choice , with meals catering for vegetarians and people from different religions .
dr sumantra ray of the british medical association in scotland urged nhs boards to meet mandatory screening requirements for under-nutrition , introduced in 2003 . "
this is a budget that would hardly feed a budgie " carolyn leckie msp ssp " hospital malnutrition remains a major problem in the nhs and this must be addressed as a matter of urgency .
" it is estimated that uk-wide , malnutrition costs the nhs £ 7.3bn a year .
" it is ironic that , at a time when the importance of eating well is high on the health agenda , this is not mirrored in our hospitals . "
mr kerr said the report showed " variable " practice across the nhs and that was why it was important " not to be static on the issue " .
but he added : " we learn in scotland from best practice internationally , and i think we are the front of much of that best practice - but here , we are not .
' hardly feed a budgie ' " we are making progress .
but i fully accept it is variable across the country and we need to do better . "
snp health spokeswoman shona robison said the report showed some good progress had been made but raised concern over " inconsistent prioritisation of nutritional care and the lack of routine screening for under-nutrition " .
scottish conservative health spokeswoman nanette milne said too many nhs boards were failing to meet the nutritional requirements .
more than 17 million meals are served in scotland 's hospitals each year , at a cost of £ 73m or just under £ 4.30 a meal .
however , scottish socialist party msp carolyn leckie said hospitals were actually spending about £ 2.50 a day on food for all three of a patient 's meals .
" this is a budget that would hardly feed a budgie and it is hard to see how it is possible to serve sick people three healthy meals a day for less than the price of a fish supper , " she said .

the audit scotland report said patients were not routinely screened for poor nutrition , and claimed this should be a priority for the nhs .
the research also suggested catering services had improved over the past three years and patients were now being offered a greater choice of food .
health minister andy kerr said he accepted that things needed to improve across scotland .
the scottish executive said it was now working on new nutritional standards , which nhs caterers will have to meet .
in 2003 audit scotland called for nutritional care to be given a higher priority by staff in the nhs .
the new study , based on checks of 149 hospitals across 16 health boards , suggested boards still needed to do more .
patient surveys the 2003 report said health boards should carry out surveys at least every three months to find out patients ' views on hospital food .
however , the new report said only 30 % of hospitals were doing that and suggested almost a fifth did not carry out any patient satisfaction surveys .
barbara hurst , director of public reporting in health at audit scotland , said : " hospital food was key to the nutritional care of patients and helped them to get better .
" boards need to do more to ensure patients are getting the nutritional care they need as a matter of priority . "
she added boards were now providing greater choice , with meals catering for vegetarians and people from different religions .
dr sumantra ray of the british medical association in scotland urged nhs boards to meet mandatory screening requirements for under-nutrition , introduced in 2003 .
this is a budget that would hardly feed a budgie carolyn leckie msp ssp " hospital malnutrition remains a major problem in the nhs and this must be addressed as a matter of urgency .
" it is estimated that uk-wide , malnutrition costs the nhs £ 7.3bn a year .
" it is ironic that , at a time when the importance of eating well is high on the health agenda , this is not mirrored in our hospitals . "
mr kerr said the report showed " variable " practice across the nhs and that was why it was important " not to be static on the issue " .
but he added : " we learn in scotland from best practice internationally , and i think we are the front of much of that best practice - but here , we are not .
' hardly feed a budgie ' " we are making progress .
but i fully accept it is variable across the country and we need to do better . "
snp health spokeswoman shona robison said the report showed some good progress had been made but raised concern over " inconsistent prioritisation of nutritional care and the lack of routine screening for under-nutrition " .
scottish conservative health spokeswoman nanette milne said too many nhs boards were failing to meet the nutritional requirements .
more than 17 million meals are served in scotland 's hospitals each year , at a cost of £ 73m or just under £ 4.30 a meal .
however , scottish socialist party msp carolyn leckie said hospitals were actually spending about £ 2.50 a day on food for all three of a patient 's meals .
" this is a budget that would hardly feed a budgie and it is hard to see how it is possible to serve sick people three healthy meals a day for less than the price of a fish supper , " she said .

richard brunstrom told bbc wales ' dragon 's eye that the home office 's funding formula favoured urban forces and penalised rural areas .
he said planned cuts were because he " can not afford " current staff levels .
the home office said north wales police had received extra funding and services should be protected .
last month , the force announced 120 backroom posts would be cut by march 2007 .
i now can not afford the number of staff that we have been encouraged to employ richard brunstrom mr brunstrom said funding was " increasingly skewed towards big cities " .
he said : " they ca n't skew the money towards big cities and then say there are no consequences for rural areas like north wales or lincolnshire . "
he said the 120 jobs would go because of a £ 2m cut in funding this year and an anticipated £ 3m cut in 2007 .
' gimmicks ' " i simply ca n't afford the staff that we 've got , " he said .
mr brunstrom said the force had followed uk government strategy but the money had run out .
" i now can not afford the number of staff that we have been encouraged to employ , so it 's very simple - we will have to downsize , " he said .
he said the loss of the civilian posts would affect frontline services as officers would " without question " be used to fill the gaps .
mr brunstrom faced criticism this month from a group of north wales labour mps .
mark tami mp for alyn and deeside claimed a " frightening " amount of money had been " wasted on gimmicks " and ynys mon mp albert owen accused the chief constable of scaremongering over job cuts .
' catastrophic ' but his position has been defended by conservative mp for clwyd west david jones , who said the labour mps were " playing politics with an important public service " .
he told bbc news : " if you have a look at north wales police 's record , they 're a pretty efficient force .
" we 've got a home office which , by the admission of its own home secretary is dysfunctional and not fit for purpose .
" last year we had the catastrophic attempt to merge police forces which wasted about £ 250,000 of north wales police 's money .
" it is a crisis of government funding and if the chief constable does n't stand up for his force and draw attention to the problems that it faces , who can do that ? "
the home office said north wales police had received millions of pounds in extra funding so front-line services and neighbourhood policing should be protected .
the interview with richard brunstrom can be seen on dragon 's eye , on thursday on bbc2w at 2100 gmt and bbc1 wales at 2235 gmt .

he is one of 7,500 people in the uk with the genetic disease .
the condition will mean he is likely to need daily sessions of physiotherapy and drug treatment .
people with cystic fibrosis have an average life expectancy of 31 , but advances in treatment mean those born with the disease now are living much longer .
the condition causes the glands which produce mucus , saliva and intestinal fluids not to work properly , resulting in secretions which clog vital organs , making it difficult to breathe and digest food properly .
there is no reason to think that a baby born with cystic fibrosis today wo n't have a near-normal life expectancy as a result of better treatments dr jim littlewood , of the cf trust to help with processing food , patients often take enzyme pills .
many will also need daily physiotherapy and massages to help loosen the mucus in the lungs .
parents are taught to do this for babies , but older children and adults are able to perform them for themselves .
breathing exercises can also help .
drugs any chest infections , which those with cf are prone too , must be treated quickly with antibiotics and patients are routinely given flu jabs .
drugs can also be taken to open the airways and control inflammation .
but those with the condition are also encouraged to take proactive steps .
exercise is recommended to help build up the upper body which helps drain the mucus .
swimming , running and tennis are particularly useful for this .
ed owen , of the cystic fibrosis trust , whose four-year-old daughter has cystic fibrosis , said : " the outlook is a pretty positive one in terms of treatment which allows children to live a relatively healthy and active lifestyle .
" it is a pretty rigorous heavy duty regime of medication , physiotherapy and regular hospital trips .
" but within that kids can enjoy a relatively happy lifestyle and there is every prospect gordon and sarah 's child will have that . "
parents of children with cf are also being offered the hope of a future cure .
researchers are currently working on gene therapy which could eventually mend or replace the faulty gene and deal with the effects of the disease .
however , such a prospect is still thought to be a few years away at least .
so for some older cf patients , lung transplants may be necessary .
one of those was reenie ferguson , who is now 52 , but was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis when she was 24 .
she had a heart and lung transplant in the 1990s after suffering from lung problems for years .
" i was in a wheelchair before the operation , but i now live a a normal life , i travel , i work part-time .
it transformed my life . "

he is one of 7,500 people in the uk with the genetic disease .
the condition will mean he is likely to need daily sessions of physiotherapy and drug treatment .
people with cystic fibrosis have an average life expectancy of 31 , but advances in treatment mean those born with the disease now are living much longer .
the condition causes the glands which produce mucus , saliva and intestinal fluids not to work properly , resulting in secretions which clog vital organs , making it difficult to breathe and digest food properly .
there is no reason to think that a baby born with cystic fibrosis today wo n't have a near-normal life expectancy as a result of better treatments dr jim littlewood , of the cf trust to help with processing food , patients often take enzyme pills .
many will also need daily physiotherapy and massages to help loosen the mucus in the lungs .
parents are taught to do this for babies , but older children and adults are able to perform them for themselves .
breathing exercises can also help .
drugs any chest infections , which those with cf are prone too , must be treated quickly with antibiotics and patients are routinely given flu jabs .
drugs can also be taken to open the airways and control inflammation .
but those with the condition are also encouraged to take proactive steps .
exercise is recommended to help build up the upper body which helps drain the mucus .
swimming , running and tennis are particularly useful for this .
ed owen , of the cystic fibrosis trust , whose four-year-old daughter has cystic fibrosis , said : " the outlook is a pretty positive one in terms of treatment which allows children to live a relatively healthy and active lifestyle .
" it is a pretty rigorous heavy duty regime of medication , physiotherapy and regular hospital trips .
" but within that kids can enjoy a relatively happy lifestyle and there is every prospect gordon and sarah 's child will have that . "
parents of children with cf are also being offered the hope of a future cure .
researchers are currently working on gene therapy which could eventually mend or replace the faulty gene and deal with the effects of the disease .
however , such a prospect is still thought to be a few years away at least .
so for some older cf patients , lung transplants may be necessary .
one of those was reenie ferguson , who is now 52 , but was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis when she was 24 .
she had a heart and lung transplant in the 1990s after suffering from lung problems for years .
" i was in a wheelchair before the operation , but i now live a a normal life , i travel , i work part-time .

bbc news -pipe- entertainment -pipe- talking shop : robert webb bbc news / entertainment graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- entertainment contents : arts & culture thursday , 30 november 2006 , 09:06 gmt talking shop : robert webb for those who yearn for comedy sketch shows that actually have jokes in them , robert webb could be a shining hope .
with david mitchell he has created bbc two 's that mitchell and webb look , as well as channel 4 's cult series peep show .
now they have taken to the road with a live show - the two faces of mitchell and webb .
it has taken a lot of work to get this far .
how does it feel ?
we started with a show called bruiser which was in that well known comedy slot right after newsnight .
then we went over to a channel called play uk and was watched by about eight people .
now it 's more of an enjoyable conveyor belt where people do n't ask what we are doing but just ask if we want to carry on .
you have taken your act on the road .
how does that compare ?
it adds a new dimension to the show .
an audience makes noises and reacts - usually in the places you do n't expect .
then there is the timing you have to get right - the costume changes are less fraught now .
do you improvise ?
when things go wrong , yes .
that seems to be the bit the audience enjoys the most , but we play by the rules and do n't do it deliberately .
there is a part of the show , a discussion programme called big talk , where we go into the audience and they get to ask their big questions , which is always unpredictable .
fortunatley as i play the host raymond terrific , i get to watch everyone else struggle .
you both have done solo projects so how do you prioritise ?
in general the mitchell and webb stuff gets first call on our time .
david started doing panel shows because i got the smoking room .
but now of course there is no more smoking room , whereas he is established as the new ned sherrin .
do you have a favourite character , or part of the show ?
i have a soft spot for raymond terrific if for no other reason than i get to shout at david which is very cathartic .
the big characters who get into the most trouble are always the most fun .
are you enjoying any perks of success ?
i spend most of my time on a garish gold tour bus so that is hard to say , but at least it is n't an estate car .
the transport now has a kettle , that 's the big difference .
what does the future hold ?
we are to film a new series of peep show and another of that mitchell and webb look , so without being greedy , that is doing pretty well .
what about a movie role ?
a bond villain perhaps ?
i would love to be a bond villain .
but even more i would like to be a dr who villain .
even if it was just a short cyberman , i would jump at the chance .

with david mitchell he has created bbc two 's that mitchell and webb look , as well as channel 4 's cult series peep show .
now they have taken to the road with a live show - the two faces of mitchell and webb .
it has taken a lot of work to get this far .
how does it feel ?
we started with a show called bruiser which was in that well known comedy slot right after newsnight .
then we went over to a channel called play uk and was watched by about eight people .
now it 's more of an enjoyable conveyor belt where people do n't ask what we are doing but just ask if we want to carry on .
you have taken your act on the road .
how does that compare ?
the smoking room was a successful solo project it adds a new dimension to the show .
an audience makes noises and reacts - usually in the places you do n't expect .
then there is the timing you have to get right - the costume changes are less fraught now .
do you improvise ?
when things go wrong , yes .
that seems to be the bit the audience enjoys the most , but we play by the rules and do n't do it deliberately .
there is a part of the show , a discussion programme called big talk , where we go into the audience and they get to ask their big questions , which is always unpredictable .
fortunatley as i play the host raymond terrific , i get to watch everyone else struggle .
you both have done solo projects so how do you prioritise ?
in general the mitchell and webb stuff gets first call on our time .
david started doing panel shows because i got the smoking room .
but now of course there is no more smoking room , whereas he is established as the new ned sherrin .
do you have a favourite character , or part of the show ?
i have a soft spot for raymond terrific if for no other reason than i get to shout at david which is very cathartic .
the big characters who get into the most trouble are always the most fun .
are you enjoying any perks of success ?
i spend most of my time on a garish gold tour bus so that is hard to say , but at least it is n't an estate car .
the transport now has a kettle , that 's the big difference .
what does the future hold ?
we are to film a new series of peep show and another of that mitchell and webb look , so without being greedy , that is doing pretty well .
what about a movie role ?
a bond villain perhaps ?
i would love to be a bond villain .
but even more i would like to be a dr who villain .
even if it was just a short cyberman , i would jump at the chance .

london 's mayor saw them as " potential agents of revolutionary change " , not equals wanting a better life , he said .
it follows the mayor 's attacks on calls for multiculturalism to be ditched .
the mayor said mr cameron 's view was just a " softer version of the tebbit test " whereby people must lose their cultural identity to be truly british .
earlier this week the mayor of london boycotted an event organised by mr phillips , head of the commission for racial equality , as part of an ongoing row .
bnp outburst he recently suggested mr phillips , who said that the term multiculturalism implied " separateness " and should be dropped , had " gone so far over to the other side that i expect soon he 'll be joining the bnp " .
on wednesday , in a speech to the ethnic media conference , mr cameron said " any serious conversation " about racism must move beyond " old marxist clichés " . "
it 's a discreditable attempt by an ageing far left politician to hang on to a narrative about race that sees people from ethnic minorities as potential agents of revolutionary change " david cameron mr cameron said : " insulting trevor by saying he should join the bnp is n't a serious contribution to debate .
" it 's a discreditable attempt by an ageing far left politician to hang on to a narrative about race that sees people from ethnic minorities as potential agents of revolutionary change . "
he added that they should be seen as " full and equal citizens who would rather build a better life for themselves and their families than man the barricades at the behest of middle class white fantasists " .
monitoring scheme mr cameron went on to say that he wanted to " broaden the base " of the conservative party by encouraging more black and asian people to get involved .
he said he would introduce the monitoring of their progress within the conservative party - from local council and parliamentary candidates , to people employed by the party .
" i know that monitoring makes some uneasy , but if we fail to find how well we as a body are doing , we have no way of remedying the situation , " he said .
there would also be a road show in british cities in partnership with operation black vote to encourage more political participation among ethnic minority communities .
and the party would offer internships for 20 young black and asian people a year to work at conservative headquarters , or in parliament .
mr cameron said that , in the past , the tories had thought it did enough to provide equal opportunities - but that was not the case .
' attack on multiculturalism ' " the fact is that it 's not enough to open the door to ethnic minorities .
if people look in and a see an all-white room they are less likely to hang around .
" an unlocked door is not the same as a genuine invitation to come in . "

london 's mayor saw them as " potential agents of revolutionary change " , not equals wanting a better life , he said .
it follows the mayor 's attacks on calls for multiculturalism to be ditched .
the mayor said mr cameron 's view was just a " softer version of the tebbit test " whereby people must lose their cultural identity to be truly british .
earlier this week the mayor of london boycotted an event organised by mr phillips , head of the commission for racial equality , as part of an ongoing row .
bnp outburst he recently suggested mr phillips , who said that the term multiculturalism implied " separateness " and should be dropped , had " gone so far over to the other side that i expect soon he 'll be joining the bnp " .
on wednesday , in a speech to the ethnic media conference , mr cameron said " any serious conversation " about racism must move beyond " old marxist clichés " .
it 's a discreditable attempt by an ageing far left politician to hang on to a narrative about race that sees people from ethnic minorities as potential agents of revolutionary change david cameron mr cameron said : " insulting trevor by saying he should join the bnp is n't a serious contribution to debate .
" it 's a discreditable attempt by an ageing far left politician to hang on to a narrative about race that sees people from ethnic minorities as potential agents of revolutionary change . "
he added that they should be seen as " full and equal citizens who would rather build a better life for themselves and their families than man the barricades at the behest of middle class white fantasists " .
monitoring scheme mr cameron went on to say that he wanted to " broaden the base " of the conservative party by encouraging more black and asian people to get involved .
he said he would introduce the monitoring of their progress within the conservative party - from local council and parliamentary candidates , to people employed by the party .
" i know that monitoring makes some uneasy , but if we fail to find how well we as a body are doing , we have no way of remedying the situation , " he said .
the mayor has clashed with mr phillips several times there would also be a road show in british cities in partnership with operation black vote to encourage more political participation among ethnic minority communities .
and the party would offer internships for 20 young black and asian people a year to work at conservative headquarters , or in parliament .
mr cameron said that , in the past , the tories had thought it did enough to provide equal opportunities - but that was not the case .
' attack on multiculturalism ' " the fact is that it 's not enough to open the door to ethnic minorities .

mr brown received messages of support from political allies and opponents , with tory leader david cameron among the first to offer his best wishes .
in a positive statement mr brown and his wife sarah said their son was " fit and healthy " .
they lost their daughter jennifer jane in 2002 after she was born prematurely .
a spokesman for the couple - who have one other son , john - said they were told in late july that fraser may have the genetic disease and tests had now confirmed it .
' helping others ' the spokesman said fraser was " fit , healthy and making all the progress that you would expect any little boy to make " .
cystic fibrosis -lrb- cf -rrb- is a life-threatening inherited disease that disrupts the way the digestive and respiratory systems work .
cystic fibrosis most common inherited life-threatening disease in uk it affects vital organs - lungs and pancreas there is currently no cure more than 7,500 people in uk have cf 70 % of those are under 20 years old each week five babies are born with cf average life expectancy is 31 figures from the cystic fibrosis trust the future with cystic fibrosis mr brown 's spokesman said : " thousands of other parents are in the same position .
" they are confident that the advice and treatments available , including proper exercise and , later , sporting activity will keep him fit and healthy .
" the nhs is doing a great job , and gordon and sarah are very optimistic that the advances being made in medicine will help him and many others , and they hope to be able to play their part in doing what they can to help others . "
messages of support were issued soon after fraser 's condition was made public .
conservative leader david cameron , whose four-year-old son ivan has cerebral palsy , said : " sam and i are thinking of gordon and sarah and their family at this time and we send them our best wishes for the future . "
housing minister yvette cooper , a close friend of the browns along with her husband , economic secretary ed balls , told the bbc fraser was a " happy and healthy little boy " .
she added : " they are a very strong and happy family , so whilst obviously , it is the same for any parent , it 's not the kind of thing you ever want to happen - but they are very optimistic . "
ed owen , a friend of mr brown 's and former political adviser whose four-year-old daughter has cystic fibrosis , explained the treatment fraser would receive .
a child diagnosed at birth and treated immediately should remain quite well rosie barnes cystic fibrosis trust cystic fibrosis " it 's a pretty rigorous , heavy duty regime of medication , physiotherapy , regular hospital trips , but within that and alongside that , kids can enjoy a relatively happy lifestyle , and there 's every prospect that gordon and sarah 's son will have that for years to come , " he told bbc 's newsnight programme .
mr brown 's brother , john , said : " the key thing was that the baby arrived safely , given what they have been through . "
mr brown , who is widely tipped as the favourite to succeed tony blair when he steps down as prime minister , said after fraser 's birth in july : " i love being a dad .
it 's great fun and there 's nothing more important and there 's nothing i enjoy better . "
advances cystic fibrosis trust chief executive rosie barnes said while the disease remained a " very serious medical condition " , advances meant the future was much more optimistic than it used to be .
everyone 's thoughts will be with gordon and sarah brown bbc political editor nick robinson read nick 's comments in full " i believe fraser was tested at birth for cystic fibrosis so it would be diagnosed just a few weeks after he was born .
" if that test takes place it 's very quick and treatment can start immediately ...
a child diagnosed at birth and treated immediately should remain quite well . "
ms barnes said he would have to accept regular medical treatment .
she also said that while there were people in their 20s and 30s who were waiting for lung transplants , the treatments today were not available when they were children .
a downing street spokesman said anything mr blair had said to mr brown was a private matter .
