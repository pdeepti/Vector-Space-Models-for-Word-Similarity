ahmadinejad and bush iran and the us need to tone down their rhetoric and start showing a willingness to compromise in order to resolve the nuclear crisis diplomatically , says janet kursawe of the german institute for middle east studies . when the un security council 's ultimatum calling on iran to halt its nuclear program expires on friday , a positive outcome in the form of iran giving in to the demands is highly unlikely .
that 's not very surprising , considering that chances of success were limited from the beginning .
and since the ultimatum was not issued in the form of a resolution that 's binding in terms of international law , sanctions are not going to follow . thirty days ago , at the time the ultimatum was given , the iranian government reacted quickly by saying that it would not give in to international pressure by giving up its right to peaceful use of nuclear power .
tehran 's announcement to withdraw from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and the international atomic energy agency in case of sanctions were also predictable . what 's surprising is the escalation of the last few months .
ever since iran 's sixth president , mahmoud ahmadinejad , took office , the dynamics of conflict that the us and iran engaged in via provocative statements have made it increasingly difficult to reach a diplomatic solution . both sides seem to have found a perfect match : ahmadinejad 's piety and self-presentation , combined with excessive nationalism and a readiness to sacrifice , is the logical response to george w. bush 's sense of mission . blow n out of proportio n the demands on iran that are unique in the non-proliferation treaty 's history are insulting and offending when one considers the country 's significant sense of national pride and the fact that iran has been a member of the treaty since 1968 . the situation has paved the way to turn the right to use nuclear power into a question of national self-determination , as happened since ahmadinejad took over .
his government and radical , conservative forces of other political organs have managed to preempt all domestic and foreign policy issues in the dispute over iran 's right to use nuclear power , limiting the power of the opposition even further as a result . no one helps iran 's leader more in this respect than the us government .
while opposition voices are increasingly calling for an end to the course of confrontation and back a compromise and even a temporary halt to uranium enrichment , their power and ability to act is extremely limited . a deteriorating political climate and increasing human rights abuses are a consequence of iran 's growing isolation .
should the isolation continue , the conservative , radical establishment will consolidate its political power even further and lead to a militarization of domestic and foreign policies . mutual suspicio n s preve n t solutio n iran is still a long way from being able to produce nuclear weapons .
should the conflict continue , the government is certain to increase its efforts in the field of nuclear research and will use them to raise its deterrent potential .
ahmadinejad 's propagandistic remarks during military exercises at the beginning of april served the same purpose . mutual suspicion and alternating threats between the us and iran are currently the biggest hindrances to a diplomatic solution .
iran feels threatened because of us military presence in its immediate vicinity and because of washington 's assurances that it wants to bring about a regime change in tehran .
the fact that israel feels threatened - and exercises pressure on the us - because of ahmadinejad 's anti-semitic remarks also contributes to the dynamics of escalation . the current insistence on refusing to compromise could lead to a decision to push the military option .
any military action - even a limited one that only aims to destroy nuclear plants - will have fatal security consequences for the region in the long run . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : janet kursawe instead , people should consider rethinking a russian proposal that was outright rejected by the us administration .
moscow suggested that the iranian nuclear program should continue outside the country with russia 's technological help .
in order for this to happen , however , all sides would have to work towards de-escalating the situation and the us government would have to be willing to sit down and negotiate with iran . janet kursawe is an ethnologist , political scientist and psychologist .

" we will now be asking the security council to increase the pressure on iran , so that the international community can be assured that its nuclear program is not a threat to peace and security , " british foreign secretary jack straw said . the international atomic energy agency said in a report that iran had not met demands to freeze uranium enrichment , american , british and french diplomats said they expected to present a text in the security council next week . " after more than three years of agency efforts to seek clarity about all aspects of iran 's nuclear program , the existing gaps in knowledge continue to be a matter of concern , " the iaea report said .
" any progress in that regard requires full transparency and active cooperation by iran . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier called for " international unity " germany committed to peaceful solution german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called for the international community to close ranks in opposition to the iranian nuclear program and push for a peaceful solution . steinmeier said germany would be prepared to restart negotiations with iran , but only if teheran produced a solid basis for negotiations but remained cautious , adding " until now there have not been any signals of compromise . " french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy also called for iranian " gestures that will re-establish confidence about the goals of their nuclear program . " iran says its program is part of a peaceful civilian nuclear energy drive .
the united states and europe fear , however , that it is hiding secret atomic weapons development . iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad said friday that iran was being denied its right to atomic energy and issued another veiled threat to cut off ties with the un 's nuclear watchdog . " we still want to work within the framework of the agency and we are committed to its regulations , " ahmadinejad told the official iranian irna agency .
" but if these regulations that guarantee our rights are used against us , we will totally change our way of dealing with the organizations . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad said iran would offer a timetable to work with the iaea iran wants iaea , not security council , to organize inspections iran has , however , offered to provide a timetable for cooperation with un nuclear inspectors if the un nuclear agency , rather than the security council , oversees iranian compliance , according to the un agency . " iran will provide a timetable within the next three weeks " if " the iran nuclear dossier will remain , in full , in the framework of the iaea and under its safeguards , " according to friday 's iaea report . a chapter 7 resolution , under which efforts to enact sanctions would be taken , is invoked to take : " action with respect to threats to the peace , breaches of the peace , and acts of aggression . "
several security council resolutions against iraq were taken under chapter 7 , before the march 2003 us-led invasion . the resolutions are binding on all un member states , but before action can be taken , chapter 7 says , the council can first " call upon the parties concerned to comply with such provisional measures as it deems necessary or desirable . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the security council still favor diplomacy in dealing with iran russian , chinese veto threat holds sanctions in check diplomats at the united nations said the upcoming resolution would not contain a threat of sanctions against iran , which are strenuously opposed by russia and china , two security council members with veto powers .
" we will study this report very carefully with the aim of agreeing a position and possible future steps to resolve the issues surrounding the iranian nuclear problem , " deputy foreign minister sergei kislyak told interfax , saying any further comments at this point would be premature . un diplomats made clear that the new resolution would only be a first step that would be followed by another resolution mandating sanctions . under the charter , when the security council has noted the " failure to comply with such provisional measures " then it should move on to more serious measures . article 41 of the chapter allows for sanctions , including economic and transport measures or the severance of diplomatic relations . if the council decides that measures under article 41 have failed , then article 42 states " it may take such action by air , sea , or land forces as may be necessary to maintain or restore international peace and security .

ukraine reiterated friday its desire to join nato despite russian qualms , after the western alliance hinted heavily that the politically troubled ex-soviet state could soon win approval for membership . during the meeting of nato foreign ministers in the bulgarian capital sofia , ukrainian foreign minister borys tarasyuk said : " ukraine 's strategy towards joining nato is irreversible . " the sofia talks were the first such contact with nato since parliamentary elections on march 26 which were widely praised as free and fair , although they have left kiev in political limbo . nato officials at the sofia talks say there is widespread support for ukraine 's bid , despite its political problems .
speaking on thursday , nato head jaap de hoop scheffer hinted there could be an opening to aspiring members at a summit in the latvian capital in november . " i have no doubt that in riga , countries aspiring to nato membership will want a signal .
there will be a signal at riga , " de hoop scheffer said . " when they are ready , nato is ready , " he said in comments that referred also to georgia , another ex-soviet republic bidding to join nato . ukraine struggles with a turbulent past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : independence square in ukraine 's capital kiev addressing the political dispute that has dragged on in ukraine since march 26 parliamentary elections , u.s. secretary of state condoleezza rice said the country faced an uphill struggle to join nato . " the ukrainian government and the ukrainian people will have to decide whether or not this is something that they wish to pursue , " rice told reporters on the sidelines of the sofia meeting on thursday .
" and they will also have to work very hard , i think , to meet the criteria , " she added . ukrainian president viktor yushchenko has set out an ambitious pro-west agenda since coming to power in 2005 after a wave of popular protests known as the " orange revolution " that brought down a moscow-backed regime . but his party performed badly in march and has been forced into coalition talks that could bring to power either a government favoring links with europe and nato or one preferring a strong bond with russia . new dividing lines in europe ? moscow , which held sway over kiev in soviet times and maintains a strong influence over its western neighbor , meanwhile reasserted its opposition to ukraine 's nato hopes . " we are against the creation of new dividing lines in europe , " mikhail kamynin , russia 's foreign ministry spokesman , was quoted as saying in an interview with ria-novosti news agency on thursday .

ukraine reiterated friday its desire to join nato despite russian qualms , after the western alliance hinted heavily that the politically troubled ex-soviet state could soon win approval for membership . during the meeting of nato foreign ministers in the bulgarian capital sofia , ukrainian foreign minister borys tarasyuk said : " ukraine 's strategy towards joining nato is irreversible . " the sofia talks were the first such contact with nato since parliamentary elections on march 26 which were widely praised as free and fair , although they have left kiev in political limbo . nato officials at the sofia talks say there is widespread support for ukraine 's bid , despite its political problems .
speaking on thursday , nato head jaap de hoop scheffer hinted there could be an opening to aspiring members at a summit in the latvian capital in november . " i have no doubt that in riga , countries aspiring to nato membership will want a signal .
there will be a signal at riga , " de hoop scheffer said . " when they are ready , nato is ready , " he said in comments that referred also to georgia , another ex-soviet republic bidding to join nato . ukraine struggles with a turbulent past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : independence square in ukraine 's capital kiev addressing the political dispute that has dragged on in ukraine since march 26 parliamentary elections , u.s. secretary of state condoleezza rice said the country faced an uphill struggle to join nato . " the ukrainian government and the ukrainian people will have to decide whether or not this is something that they wish to pursue , " rice told reporters on the sidelines of the sofia meeting on thursday .
" and they will also have to work very hard , i think , to meet the criteria , " she added . ukrainian president viktor yushchenko has set out an ambitious pro-west agenda since coming to power in 2005 after a wave of popular protests known as the " orange revolution " that brought down a moscow-backed regime . but his party performed badly in march and has been forced into coalition talks that could bring to power either a government favoring links with europe and nato or one preferring a strong bond with russia . new dividing lines in europe ? moscow , which held sway over kiev in soviet times and maintains a strong influence over its western neighbor , meanwhile reasserted its opposition to ukraine 's nato hopes . " we are against the creation of new dividing lines in europe , " mikhail kamynin , russia 's foreign ministry spokesman , was quoted as saying in an interview with ria-novosti news agency on thursday . " today there are algorithms of cooperation with nato that allow states to cooperate in the widest security spectrum without formal accession to the alliance , " kamynin said . nato sending ukraine mixed signals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato foreign ministers meeting at the national palace of culture in sofia but nato on thursday appeared to play down reports that ukraine could be offered the alliance 's " membership action plan " , the key step before being invited to join . " ukraine 's aspirations to join the alliance are welcomed by all allies , " nato spokesman james appathurai told reporters in sofia .
" what i can not predict is timelines for membership action plans , " he added . albania , croatia and macedonia are currently in the membership action plan with the north atlantic treaty organisation -lrb- nato -rrb- . ten countries that were once allied with russia - bulgaria , czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , poland , romania , slovakia and slovenia - have joined nato since 1999 . also on friday , during a sideline meeting , u.s. secretary of state condoleezza rice signed a bilateral agreement with bulgarian officials to establish three military bases in the country as the u.s. shifts troops from old cold war positions to smaller units closer to the middle east and africa . nato boosts darfur aid moving from the european to the african continent during talks in sofia , nato has said it is ready to boost assistance in sudan 's violence-scarred darfur region .
the alliance has said it will increase logistical support , but said any presence should be limited and only in support of african or u.n. efforts . in nato 's first operation on the african continent , the alliance has provided training and transportation to african union troops trying to stem the violence there .

he has accused the cia of kidnapping him in late 2003 from macedonia and interrogating him in afghanistan . skopje has denied any involvement in the alleged operation by the us spy agency . upon arrival , the delegation met macedonian president branko crvenkovski and were due to meet deputy prime minister radmila secerinska and former foreign minister slobodan casule , the eu spokesman andrea angeli told afp news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giovanni claudio fava , european lawmaker leading cia flight probe " the target is the truth , just the truth , " the eu lawmaker leading the probe , claudio fava , told reporters after the meeting with crvenkovski . the eu deputies are scheduled to meet former interior minister siljan avramovski , his successor ljubomir mihajlovski and parliamentary speaker ljupco jordanovski on friday . earlier this year european deputies decided to set up a special committee to look into the allegations that the central intelligence agency secretly operated flights carrying prisoners it considered terror suspects which passed through eu territory . the parliament 's inquiry started in january and is expected to issue a first report next month . more than 1,000 secret cia flights have gone through european airspace and airports since 2001 without governments requesting information , fava said upon presenting a preliminary report . " it is hard to believe that the authorities and governments of certain countries were unaware of what was going on on their territory .
our probe shows that they must have known , " fava said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. col. steven f. dreyer at the air base near bucharest fava singled out sweden , italy and bosnia for particular criticism .
for more than three months , the eu parliamentary inquiry has heard testimony from alleged victims and human rights groups - all saying that european states had handed over terrorism suspects to foreign agents , and ignoring hundreds of cia flights that had used their airports .
some former detainees provided detailed accounts of alleged torture carried out in secret prisons outside eu or us jurisdiction . the eu lawmakers investigating the khalid al-masri case in macedonia want to find out how the plane with al-masri on board could leave europe unchallenged . fava believes that there were hundreds of similar incidents .
" if we look at all the testimonies we have got , it becomes very clear that these incidents were n't sporadic , but that it was a common practice .
that 's the only conclusion i can draw , " fava said . the cia declined to comment on the eu parliamentarians ' findings .
the inquiry committee has no legal powers , but it will recommend what political action should be taken against any countries found to have been involved , including the united states .
several eu lawmakers are expected to go to washington in early may to try to meet secretary of state condoleezza rice and cia chief porter goss . the european union has granted macedonia candidate status , but no date has been set to begin talks for membership in the bloc . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the cia affair and eu : who has responsiblity ?

" we are constantly hearing about some threat of dependence on russia , that something must be done to limit the entry of russian companies into the european market , " putin said at a joint news conference with german chancellor angela merkel after two days of talks focused on energy . " what are we supposed to do when we hear the same thing every day ?
we start looking for other markets .
when we continually hear the same thing , we perceive this as a threat to limit our admittance to the market and we begin to look for other outlets , " the russian leader said . putin said russia had no wish to cut back on supplies of energy to countries in europe - they depend overall on russia for around one-fourth of their natural gas supplies and a large share of oil supplies - and stressed that moscow had always been a reliable supplier independent of politics . " we have worked well with you for many years , even when there was the cold war . ...
day after day , the soviet union delivered for its partners in europe .
what is the point of stoking fears about excessive dependence with regard to russia today ? "
putin asked . moscow 's threat to shift energy priorities east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin is looking at china and the far east for energy partners putin and other top russian officials have however stressed in recent weeks that china , japan and other huge markets in asia are increasingly hungry for russian energy supplies and have warned that moscow may shift its priority to serving those clients at the expense of european buyers . the european union , some of whose members felt disruption to their gas supplies from russia in january when moscow briefly cut shipments to ukraine amid a price dispute , has responded by telling moscow not to " politicize " energy trade . while russia 's state-run gas giant gazprom , for example , has complained of efforts to block its expansion plans in european markets , it has also flatly rejected european demands that it relax its own domestic monopoly and open excess gas pipeline capacity to foreign firms . tensions with west exacerbated by energy struggles putin 's comments were certain to heighten tensions on energy between russia - the world 's second-largest crude oil exporter and largest supplier of natural gas - and the west , which is anxious over linkage of kremlin energy strategy with political objectives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and merkel found little common ground on energy issues in comments to officials on wednesday shortly before he greeted merkel , putin complained that russia 's aims to expand in western energy markets were being systematically thwarted by " unfair competition " barriers . " we are being blocked to the north , the south and the west on any pretext .
we have to find outlets , to fit into the global development process , " putin said wednesday hours before greeting merkel . by way of example he cited reports that the british government had recently considered modifying anti-monopoly legislation in such a way as to prevent gazprom from buying centrica , britain 's biggest household gas supplier . british prime minister tony blair ruled out any move to block the takeover , the daily financial times reported wednesday , sparking a surge in centrica 's share price . putin said gazprom had never intended to buy the company anyway .
" we need to agree on the rules of the game " and those should be applied on an equal basis to all countries , he said . eu failing in bid to rein in russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to ensure the supply stays open the european union has ratcheted up pressure on russia to sign its energy charter , a document that regulates energy transport and would prohibit any signatory from disrupting contracted supplies for any reason . a top gazprom official , alexander medvedev , told participants at an economic forum in london earlier this week that the pact was " stillborn . " however , putin 's economic advisor referred to the prickly eu-russian relationship as a normal sign of a changing balance of power . " having this tension is okay , it 's a problem with any growth , " said igor shuvalov , who is also russia 's sherpa to the group of eight industrialized countries .
" russia is part of the family ; we were considered the small kid .
now we are growing and we raise our voice , " he added . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel , putin hail gas deal , disagree on iran concluding their two-day summit in siberia , russian and german leaders saw the signing of a major joint venture between companies from both countries to develop a natural gas field .

with not a mao jacket or red scarf in sight , it showcases vintage chic straight out of " barbarella . "
realistic it is n't . " we thought everyone in the gdr walked around in drab , dismal clothes , but suddenly we found this incredible stuff which showed there was a thriving fashion industry , " said caz hildebrand , the british art director who put the collection together . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " sibylle " - the arty face of gdr fashion but was there really ?
the photos were taken by günter rubitzsch , a leipzig-based photographer who worked regularly for women 's weeklies such as pramo -lrb- abbreviated from " praktische mode " or " practical fashion " -rrb- and für dich -lrb- " for you " -rrb- , magazines which featured sewing or knitting patterns for women who liked to make their own clothes .
and most of them had to . " everyone looked the same , so if you wanted something special you had to make it yourself , " explained antje lond benn , who studied at the technical college for clothing design in east berlin in the 1980s .
" fabrics and patterns were really cheap , and everyone would improvize with them .
and if you were lucky , you could fit into the kids ' clothes , which were heavily subsidized . " honecker 's haute couture so the groovy gdr depicted in " off the wall " might , perhaps , be a little off the mark .
but at least it scuppers a few cliches . " it 's an acknowledgment of my work , and i 'm glad it shows a different side of the gdr , " said rubitzsch .
" it proves that we were n't all impoverished and that it was possible to be creative despite the restrictions we worked with . " after the berlin wall fell , he sold the rights to his pictures to the international agency akg images - and never thought that one day , they 'd be rediscovered as high camp , communist-style . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fashion in ' sybille ' captured a mood - it did n't showcase clothes dating back to decades that taste forgot not just in east germany , what really sets his pictures apart are their unmistakably socialist backdrops .
one image features models reclining in vamped-up folksy frocks against a gleaming combine harvester , while others show girls posing in front of chemical plants , industrial sites and of course , the inevitable trabants . " i worked in leipzig , and there was a limit to the backdrops available , " explained rubitzsch .
" the city was very industrial and that 's why many of the pictures were taken in front of factories or agricultural cooperatives . " " in those days , fashion photography in the west was set in exotic locations like the caribbean and so on , " he pointed out .
" obviously , we could n't match that - we had to make do with what we had , and that meant being very inventive . " sibylle woman bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gdr style , circa 1985 meanwhile , at the more sophisticated end of the market was the magazine sibylle , which took its cues less from good housekeeping and more from french vogue .
the fashion conscious woman 's style bible , its editor was dorothea melis , who later compiled the only book on gdr fashion to have been published in germany since the demise of communism .
" sibylle - fashion photography from three decades of the gdr " appeared in 1998 and flew off the shelves . dorothea melis agrees with rubitzsch . " necessity is the mother of invention , " she said .
" everyone has this idea that women in the gdr went round in aprons , headscarves and flat shoes , so i thought : i 'll show you how stylish we really were !
back then women were so much more creative than are today , they 'd take the cotton we were getting from somewhere like uzbekistan and dye or embroider it to rework classic looks we 'd seen tourists wearing , on television or in magazines from the west . " like rubitzsch , she wholeheartedly rejects the idea that fashion was a thwarted industry in the gdr .
" back then , we 'd have one editor , one photographer and two models on an average photo shoot .
we had to do everything ourselves , there was no huge team like they have today .
we 'd all have to double up .
the editor would do the girls ' make-up , the photographer would also be the driver .
it was a very intense experience . " not so exquisite " exquisit " after leaving sibylle , melis went on to work in the publicity department of the gdr 's most upmarket store " exquisit , " where most of the clothes modeled in " off the wall " would have been sold . " exquisit opened in 1970 as a deliberate attempt on the part of the party to placate the masses and make them think the gdr was n't all bad , " she said . # b # it stocked western labels such as daniel hechter and georges rech , and until the end of communism , remained the first port-of-call for any east germans wanting to treat themselves - despite a minor upset in the mid-80s when customer complaints about a range of italian shirts that had been falling apart prompted the store to reveal they were actually made from shrouds . the rest of the time , people settled with cheap imitations of western styles , with the gdr even making a point of designing its own synthetics , such as the nylon-like " dederon , " the frotte-esque " malimo , " and its piece de resistance , the extraordinarily static " präsent 20 , " specially developed for the 20th anniversary of the gdr in 1969 . " there was no scope to actually design , " said antje lond benn .
" if you wanted to put in two extra seams , add a couple of buttons or use a different fabric , you 'd always be told it was too expensive - and the best stuff was always exported to west germany anyway . " " basically , there was no fashion industry , " she added . " there were just clothes .

ahmadinejad and bush iran and the us need to tone down their rhetoric and start showing a willingness to compromise in order to resolve the nuclear crisis diplomatically , says janet kursawe of the german institute for middle east studies . when the un security council 's ultimatum calling on iran to halt its nuclear program expires on friday , a positive outcome in the form of iran giving in to the demands is highly unlikely .
that 's not very surprising , considering that chances of success were limited from the beginning .
and since the ultimatum was not issued in the form of a resolution that 's binding in terms of international law , sanctions are not going to follow . thirty days ago , at the time the ultimatum was given , the iranian government reacted quickly by saying that it would not give in to international pressure by giving up its right to peaceful use of nuclear power .
tehran 's announcement to withdraw from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and the international atomic energy agency in case of sanctions were also predictable . what 's surprising is the escalation of the last few months .
ever since iran 's sixth president , mahmoud ahmadinejad , took office , the dynamics of conflict that the us and iran engaged in via provocative statements have made it increasingly difficult to reach a diplomatic solution . both sides seem to have found a perfect match : ahmadinejad 's piety and self-presentation , combined with excessive nationalism and a readiness to sacrifice , is the logical response to george w. bush 's sense of mission . blow n out of proportio n the demands on iran that are unique in the non-proliferation treaty 's history are insulting and offending when one considers the country 's significant sense of national pride and the fact that iran has been a member of the treaty since 1968 . the situation has paved the way to turn the right to use nuclear power into a question of national self-determination , as happened since ahmadinejad took over .
his government and radical , conservative forces of other political organs have managed to preempt all domestic and foreign policy issues in the dispute over iran 's right to use nuclear power , limiting the power of the opposition even further as a result . no one helps iran 's leader more in this respect than the us government .
while opposition voices are increasingly calling for an end to the course of confrontation and back a compromise and even a temporary halt to uranium enrichment , their power and ability to act is extremely limited . a deteriorating political climate and increasing human rights abuses are a consequence of iran 's growing isolation .
should the isolation continue , the conservative , radical establishment will consolidate its political power even further and lead to a militarization of domestic and foreign policies . mutual suspicio n s preve n t solutio n iran is still a long way from being able to produce nuclear weapons .
should the conflict continue , the government is certain to increase its efforts in the field of nuclear research and will use them to raise its deterrent potential .
ahmadinejad 's propagandistic remarks during military exercises at the beginning of april served the same purpose . mutual suspicion and alternating threats between the us and iran are currently the biggest hindrances to a diplomatic solution .
iran feels threatened because of us military presence in its immediate vicinity and because of washington 's assurances that it wants to bring about a regime change in tehran .
the fact that israel feels threatened - and exercises pressure on the us - because of ahmadinejad 's anti-semitic remarks also contributes to the dynamics of escalation . the current insistence on refusing to compromise could lead to a decision to push the military option .
any military action - even a limited one that only aims to destroy nuclear plants - will have fatal security consequences for the region in the long run . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : janet kursawe instead , people should consider rethinking a russian proposal that was outright rejected by the us administration .
moscow suggested that the iranian nuclear program should continue outside the country with russia 's technological help .
in order for this to happen , however , all sides would have to work towards de-escalating the situation and the us government would have to be willing to sit down and negotiate with iran . janet kursawe is an ethnologist , political scientist and psychologist .

" we will now be asking the security council to increase the pressure on iran , so that the international community can be assured that its nuclear program is not a threat to peace and security , " british foreign secretary jack straw said . the international atomic energy agency said in a report that iran had not met demands to freeze uranium enrichment , american , british and french diplomats said they expected to present a text in the security council next week . " after more than three years of agency efforts to seek clarity about all aspects of iran 's nuclear program , the existing gaps in knowledge continue to be a matter of concern , " the iaea report said .
" any progress in that regard requires full transparency and active cooperation by iran . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier called for " international unity " germany committed to peaceful solution german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called for the international community to close ranks in opposition to the iranian nuclear program and push for a peaceful solution . steinmeier said germany would be prepared to restart negotiations with iran , but only if teheran produced a solid basis for negotiations but remained cautious , adding " until now there have not been any signals of compromise . " french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy also called for iranian " gestures that will re-establish confidence about the goals of their nuclear program . " iran says its program is part of a peaceful civilian nuclear energy drive .
the united states and europe fear , however , that it is hiding secret atomic weapons development . iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad said friday that iran was being denied its right to atomic energy and issued another veiled threat to cut off ties with the un 's nuclear watchdog . " we still want to work within the framework of the agency and we are committed to its regulations , " ahmadinejad told the official iranian irna agency .
" but if these regulations that guarantee our rights are used against us , we will totally change our way of dealing with the organizations . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad said iran would offer a timetable to work with the iaea iran wants iaea , not security council , to organize inspections iran has , however , offered to provide a timetable for cooperation with un nuclear inspectors if the un nuclear agency , rather than the security council , oversees iranian compliance , according to the un agency . " iran will provide a timetable within the next three weeks " if " the iran nuclear dossier will remain , in full , in the framework of the iaea and under its safeguards , " according to friday 's iaea report . a chapter 7 resolution , under which efforts to enact sanctions would be taken , is invoked to take : " action with respect to threats to the peace , breaches of the peace , and acts of aggression . "
several security council resolutions against iraq were taken under chapter 7 , before the march 2003 us-led invasion . the resolutions are binding on all un member states , but before action can be taken , chapter 7 says , the council can first " call upon the parties concerned to comply with such provisional measures as it deems necessary or desirable . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the security council still favor diplomacy in dealing with iran russian , chinese veto threat holds sanctions in check diplomats at the united nations said the upcoming resolution would not contain a threat of sanctions against iran , which are strenuously opposed by russia and china , two security council members with veto powers .
" we will study this report very carefully with the aim of agreeing a position and possible future steps to resolve the issues surrounding the iranian nuclear problem , " deputy foreign minister sergei kislyak told interfax , saying any further comments at this point would be premature . un diplomats made clear that the new resolution would only be a first step that would be followed by another resolution mandating sanctions . under the charter , when the security council has noted the " failure to comply with such provisional measures " then it should move on to more serious measures . article 41 of the chapter allows for sanctions , including economic and transport measures or the severance of diplomatic relations . if the council decides that measures under article 41 have failed , then article 42 states " it may take such action by air , sea , or land forces as may be necessary to maintain or restore international peace and security .

the photos were taken by günter rubitzsch , a leipzig-based photographer who worked regularly for women 's weeklies such as pramo -lrb- abbreviated from " praktische mode " or " practical fashion " -rrb- and für dich -lrb- " for you " -rrb- , magazines which featured sewing or knitting patterns for women who liked to make their own clothes .

" i worked in leipzig , and there was a limit to the backdrops available , " explained rubitzsch .
" the city was very industrial and that 's why many of the pictures were taken in front of factories or agricultural cooperatives . " " in those days , fashion photography in the west was set in exotic locations like the caribbean and so on , " he pointed out .

" sibylle - fashion photography from three decades of the gdr " appeared in 1998 and flew off the shelves . dorothea melis agrees with rubitzsch . " necessity is the mother of invention , " she said .
" everyone has this idea that women in the gdr went round in aprons , headscarves and flat shoes , so i thought : i 'll show you how stylish we really were !
back then women were so much more creative than are today , they 'd take the cotton we were getting from somewhere like uzbekistan and dye or embroider it to rework classic looks we 'd seen tourists wearing , on television or in magazines from the west .

" back then , we 'd have one editor , one photographer and two models on an average photo shoot .

we 'd all have to double up .
the editor would do the girls ' make-up , the photographer would also be the driver .
it was a very intense experience .

with not a mao jacket or red scarf in sight , it showcases vintage chic straight out of " barbarella . "
realistic it is n't . " we thought everyone in the gdr walked around in drab , dismal clothes , but suddenly we found this incredible stuff which showed there was a thriving fashion industry , " said caz hildebrand , the british art director who put the collection together . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " sibylle " - the arty face of gdr fashion but was there really ?
the photos were taken by günter rubitzsch , a leipzig-based photographer who worked regularly for women 's weeklies such as pramo -lrb- abbreviated from " praktische mode " or " practical fashion " -rrb- and für dich -lrb- " for you " -rrb- , magazines which featured sewing or knitting patterns for women who liked to make their own clothes .
and most of them had to . " everyone looked the same , so if you wanted something special you had to make it yourself , " explained antje lond benn , who studied at the technical college for clothing design in east berlin in the 1980s .
" fabrics and patterns were really cheap , and everyone would improvize with them .
and if you were lucky , you could fit into the kids ' clothes , which were heavily subsidized . " honecker 's haute couture so the groovy gdr depicted in " off the wall " might , perhaps , be a little off the mark .
but at least it scuppers a few cliches . " it 's an acknowledgment of my work , and i 'm glad it shows a different side of the gdr , " said rubitzsch .
" it proves that we were n't all impoverished and that it was possible to be creative despite the restrictions we worked with . " after the berlin wall fell , he sold the rights to his pictures to the international agency akg images - and never thought that one day , they 'd be rediscovered as high camp , communist-style . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fashion in ' sybille ' captured a mood - it did n't showcase clothes dating back to decades that taste forgot not just in east germany , what really sets his pictures apart are their unmistakably socialist backdrops .
one image features models reclining in vamped-up folksy frocks against a gleaming combine harvester , while others show girls posing in front of chemical plants , industrial sites and of course , the inevitable trabants . " i worked in leipzig , and there was a limit to the backdrops available , " explained rubitzsch .
" the city was very industrial and that 's why many of the pictures were taken in front of factories or agricultural cooperatives . " " in those days , fashion photography in the west was set in exotic locations like the caribbean and so on , " he pointed out .
" obviously , we could n't match that - we had to make do with what we had , and that meant being very inventive . " sibylle woman bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gdr style , circa 1985 meanwhile , at the more sophisticated end of the market was the magazine sibylle , which took its cues less from good housekeeping and more from french vogue .
the fashion conscious woman 's style bible , its editor was dorothea melis , who later compiled the only book on gdr fashion to have been published in germany since the demise of communism .
" sibylle - fashion photography from three decades of the gdr " appeared in 1998 and flew off the shelves . dorothea melis agrees with rubitzsch . " necessity is the mother of invention , " she said .
" everyone has this idea that women in the gdr went round in aprons , headscarves and flat shoes , so i thought : i 'll show you how stylish we really were !
back then women were so much more creative than are today , they 'd take the cotton we were getting from somewhere like uzbekistan and dye or embroider it to rework classic looks we 'd seen tourists wearing , on television or in magazines from the west . " like rubitzsch , she wholeheartedly rejects the idea that fashion was a thwarted industry in the gdr .
" back then , we 'd have one editor , one photographer and two models on an average photo shoot .
we had to do everything ourselves , there was no huge team like they have today .
we 'd all have to double up .
the editor would do the girls ' make-up , the photographer would also be the driver .
it was a very intense experience . " not so exquisite " exquisit " after leaving sibylle , melis went on to work in the publicity department of the gdr 's most upmarket store " exquisit , " where most of the clothes modeled in " off the wall " would have been sold .

" we will now be asking the security council to increase the pressure on iran , so that the international community can be assured that its nuclear program is not a threat to peace and security , " british foreign secretary jack straw said . the international atomic energy agency said in a report that iran had not met demands to freeze uranium enrichment , american , british and french diplomats said they expected to present a text in the security council next week . " after more than three years of agency efforts to seek clarity about all aspects of iran 's nuclear program , the existing gaps in knowledge continue to be a matter of concern , " the iaea report said .
" any progress in that regard requires full transparency and active cooperation by iran . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier called for " international unity " germany committed to peaceful solution german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called for the international community to close ranks in opposition to the iranian nuclear program and push for a peaceful solution . steinmeier said germany would be prepared to restart negotiations with iran , but only if teheran produced a solid basis for negotiations but remained cautious , adding " until now there have not been any signals of compromise . " french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy also called for iranian " gestures that will re-establish confidence about the goals of their nuclear program . " iran says its program is part of a peaceful civilian nuclear energy drive .
the united states and europe fear , however , that it is hiding secret atomic weapons development . iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad said friday that iran was being denied its right to atomic energy and issued another veiled threat to cut off ties with the un 's nuclear watchdog . " we still want to work within the framework of the agency and we are committed to its regulations , " ahmadinejad told the official iranian irna agency .
" but if these regulations that guarantee our rights are used against us , we will totally change our way of dealing with the organizations . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad said iran would offer a timetable to work with the iaea iran wants iaea , not security council , to organize inspections iran has , however , offered to provide a timetable for cooperation with un nuclear inspectors if the un nuclear agency , rather than the security council , oversees iranian compliance , according to the un agency . " iran will provide a timetable within the next three weeks " if " the iran nuclear dossier will remain , in full , in the framework of the iaea and under its safeguards , " according to friday 's iaea report . a chapter 7 resolution , under which efforts to enact sanctions would be taken , is invoked to take : " action with respect to threats to the peace , breaches of the peace , and acts of aggression . "
several security council resolutions against iraq were taken under chapter 7 , before the march 2003 us-led invasion . the resolutions are binding on all un member states , but before action can be taken , chapter 7 says , the council can first " call upon the parties concerned to comply with such provisional measures as it deems necessary or desirable . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the security council still favor diplomacy in dealing with iran russian , chinese veto threat holds sanctions in check diplomats at the united nations said the upcoming resolution would not contain a threat of sanctions against iran , which are strenuously opposed by russia and china , two security council members with veto powers .
" we will study this report very carefully with the aim of agreeing a position and possible future steps to resolve the issues surrounding the iranian nuclear problem , " deputy foreign minister sergei kislyak told interfax , saying any further comments at this point would be premature . un diplomats made clear that the new resolution would only be a first step that would be followed by another resolution mandating sanctions . under the charter , when the security council has noted the " failure to comply with such provisional measures " then it should move on to more serious measures . article 41 of the chapter allows for sanctions , including economic and transport measures or the severance of diplomatic relations . if the council decides that measures under article 41 have failed , then article 42 states " it may take such action by air , sea , or land forces as may be necessary to maintain or restore international peace and security .

the united states and europe fear , however , that it is hiding secret atomic weapons development . iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad said friday that iran was being denied its right to atomic energy and issued another veiled threat to cut off ties with the un 's nuclear watchdog . " we still want to work within the framework of the agency and we are committed to its regulations , " ahmadinejad told the official iranian irna agency .
" but if these regulations that guarantee our rights are used against us , we will totally change our way of dealing with the organizations . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad said iran would offer a timetable to work with the iaea iran wants iaea , not security council , to organize inspections iran has , however , offered to provide a timetable for cooperation with un nuclear inspectors if the un nuclear agency , rather than the security council , oversees iranian compliance , according to the un agency . " iran will provide a timetable within the next three weeks " if " the iran nuclear dossier will remain , in full , in the framework of the iaea and under its safeguards , " according to friday 's iaea report . a chapter 7 resolution , under which efforts to enact sanctions would be taken , is invoked to take : " action with respect to threats to the peace , breaches of the peace , and acts of aggression . "
several security council resolutions against iraq were taken under chapter 7 , before the march 2003 us-led invasion . the resolutions are binding on all un member states , but before action can be taken , chapter 7 says , the council can first " call upon the parties concerned to comply with such provisional measures as it deems necessary or desirable . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the security council still favor diplomacy in dealing with iran russian , chinese veto threat holds sanctions in check diplomats at the united nations said the upcoming resolution would not contain a threat of sanctions against iran , which are strenuously opposed by russia and china , two security council members with veto powers .
" we will study this report very carefully with the aim of agreeing a position and possible future steps to resolve the issues surrounding the iranian nuclear problem , " deputy foreign minister sergei kislyak told interfax , saying any further comments at this point would be premature . un diplomats made clear that the new resolution would only be a first step that would be followed by another resolution mandating sanctions . under the charter , when the security council has noted the " failure to comply with such provisional measures " then it should move on to more serious measures . article 41 of the chapter allows for sanctions , including economic and transport measures or the severance of diplomatic relations . if the council decides that measures under article 41 have failed , then article 42 states " it may take such action by air , sea , or land forces as may be necessary to maintain or restore international peace and security .

" we are constantly hearing about some threat of dependence on russia , that something must be done to limit the entry of russian companies into the european market , " putin said at a joint news conference with german chancellor angela merkel after two days of talks focused on energy . " what are we supposed to do when we hear the same thing every day ?
we start looking for other markets .
when we continually hear the same thing , we perceive this as a threat to limit our admittance to the market and we begin to look for other outlets , " the russian leader said . putin said russia had no wish to cut back on supplies of energy to countries in europe - they depend overall on russia for around one-fourth of their natural gas supplies and a large share of oil supplies - and stressed that moscow had always been a reliable supplier independent of politics . " we have worked well with you for many years , even when there was the cold war . ...
day after day , the soviet union delivered for its partners in europe .
what is the point of stoking fears about excessive dependence with regard to russia today ? "
putin asked . moscow 's threat to shift energy priorities east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin is looking at china and the far east for energy partners putin and other top russian officials have however stressed in recent weeks that china , japan and other huge markets in asia are increasingly hungry for russian energy supplies and have warned that moscow may shift its priority to serving those clients at the expense of european buyers . the european union , some of whose members felt disruption to their gas supplies from russia in january when moscow briefly cut shipments to ukraine amid a price dispute , has responded by telling moscow not to " politicize " energy trade . while russia 's state-run gas giant gazprom , for example , has complained of efforts to block its expansion plans in european markets , it has also flatly rejected european demands that it relax its own domestic monopoly and open excess gas pipeline capacity to foreign firms . tensions with west exacerbated by energy struggles putin 's comments were certain to heighten tensions on energy between russia - the world 's second-largest crude oil exporter and largest supplier of natural gas - and the west , which is anxious over linkage of kremlin energy strategy with political objectives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and merkel found little common ground on energy issues in comments to officials on wednesday shortly before he greeted merkel , putin complained that russia 's aims to expand in western energy markets were being systematically thwarted by " unfair competition " barriers . " we are being blocked to the north , the south and the west on any pretext .
we have to find outlets , to fit into the global development process , " putin said wednesday hours before greeting merkel . by way of example he cited reports that the british government had recently considered modifying anti-monopoly legislation in such a way as to prevent gazprom from buying centrica , britain 's biggest household gas supplier . british prime minister tony blair ruled out any move to block the takeover , the daily financial times reported wednesday , sparking a surge in centrica 's share price . putin said gazprom had never intended to buy the company anyway .
" we need to agree on the rules of the game " and those should be applied on an equal basis to all countries , he said . eu failing in bid to rein in russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to ensure the supply stays open the european union has ratcheted up pressure on russia to sign its energy charter , a document that regulates energy transport and would prohibit any signatory from disrupting contracted supplies for any reason . a top gazprom official , alexander medvedev , told participants at an economic forum in london earlier this week that the pact was " stillborn . " however , putin 's economic advisor referred to the prickly eu-russian relationship as a normal sign of a changing balance of power . " having this tension is okay , it 's a problem with any growth , " said igor shuvalov , who is also russia 's sherpa to the group of eight industrialized countries .
" russia is part of the family ; we were considered the small kid .

" thanks to god , we are a nuclear state , " he said in a speech in the west of iran . no good n ews this leaves little room for elbaradei to do anything other than state the obvious in a report the head of the vienna-based international atomic energy agency is to file friday to mark the expiry of the deadline , diplomats said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a reactor building of iran 's bushehr nuclear power plant elbaradei will also be reporting on whether iran has met security council demands for iran to cooperate with iaea inspectors , who have not been able to conclude after over three years of investigation whether the iranian program is peaceful , as tehran claims . on this topic also little progress is believed to have taken place . " it is not going to be a good report , " said a senior european diplomat , who requested anonymity .
" that is quite clear .
what is there positive to report ? " new phase of diplomacy the report is thus almost certain to open the door to a new phase of diplomacy over an iranian nuclear program which the united states charges hides the development of atomic weapons . washington wants the security council to adopt a " chapter 7 " resolution which would legally oblige iran to meet the iaea 's calls . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the security council take action ?
this could lead , if iran still refuses to comply , to punishing economic sanctions and even military action against iran , although tehran 's allies and major trading partners russia and china oppose such a move . us secretary of state condoleezza rice said thursday that the security council " has to act " in response to iran 's defiance . but speaking on the sidelines of a nato meeting in sofia , rice played down talk of military action , saying : " we are committed to a diplomatic course . " elbaradei 's report will be released friday afternoon " both to member states of the iaea board of governors and to the un security council " in new york , iaea spokeswoman melissa fleming said . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran shuns un on eve of nuclear deadline iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad vowed thursday that his country " will not bow to injustice and pressure , " the day before a un deadline to stop sensitive nuclear work expires .

why would this be so dangerous ?
the aspen 's institute jeffrey gedmin offers answers . the us and the european union share nearly identical views .
teheran says it wants nuclear power for peaceful purposes .
no one believes the mullahs .
iran should have enough oil and gas to take care of its energy needs for several hundred years .
there are other reasons to believe that the government in teheran is lying .
iran played cat and mouse with the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- for 18 years .
we expect the iaea to issue iran yet another rebuke this friday . still , why should iran not have the bomb ?
after all , india , pakistan and israel are all nuclear powers , right ?
if you follow this logic - and cast aside for a moment the fact that by signing the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- iran has pledged not to acquire nuclear weapons - then you had better ponder the following . setti n g off a n uclear arms race ? first , when iran gets the bomb , be prepared for a nuclear arms race .
saudi arabia , egypt and turkey -lrb- perhaps syria , algeria and eventually iraq -rrb- would all find it hard to understand that they do not enjoy the right to a nuclear option .
this is presumably a principal reason why -lrb- former german foreign minister -rrb- joschka fischer once described the thought of iran with the bomb as one of the worst imaginable nightmares . second , imagine an emboldened iran meddling to an even greater extent in iraq and afghanistan .
the mullahs may have an interest in stability in both countries ; but most surely not in democracy and pro-western governments .
expect more dead americans -lrb- and germans -rrb- in the short-term . third , bet on significantly higher oil prices , says henry sokolksi , director of the nonproliferation policy education center in washington .
a nuclear iran may feel tempted to intimidate saudi arabia -lrb- which has the world 's largest oil production capacity -rrb- , according to sokolski , or perhaps even threaten the freedom of the seas to manipulate oil prices dramatically upward . more terrorism to come ? fourth , get used to more terrorism .
iran remains a prominent supporter of palestinian terror , of course .
but the iranian regime has also struck targets in europe in the 1980s and 1990s .

" thanks to god , we are a nuclear state , " he said in a speech in the west of iran . no good n ews this leaves little room for elbaradei to do anything other than state the obvious in a report the head of the vienna-based international atomic energy agency is to file friday to mark the expiry of the deadline , diplomats said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a reactor building of iran 's bushehr nuclear power plant elbaradei will also be reporting on whether iran has met security council demands for iran to cooperate with iaea inspectors , who have not been able to conclude after over three years of investigation whether the iranian program is peaceful , as tehran claims . on this topic also little progress is believed to have taken place . " it is not going to be a good report , " said a senior european diplomat , who requested anonymity .
" that is quite clear .
what is there positive to report ? " new phase of diplomacy the report is thus almost certain to open the door to a new phase of diplomacy over an iranian nuclear program which the united states charges hides the development of atomic weapons . washington wants the security council to adopt a " chapter 7 " resolution which would legally oblige iran to meet the iaea 's calls . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the security council take action ?
this could lead , if iran still refuses to comply , to punishing economic sanctions and even military action against iran , although tehran 's allies and major trading partners russia and china oppose such a move . us secretary of state condoleezza rice said thursday that the security council " has to act " in response to iran 's defiance . but speaking on the sidelines of a nato meeting in sofia , rice played down talk of military action , saying : " we are committed to a diplomatic course . " elbaradei 's report will be released friday afternoon " both to member states of the iaea board of governors and to the un security council " in new york , iaea spokeswoman melissa fleming said . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran shuns un on eve of nuclear deadline iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad vowed thursday that his country " will not bow to injustice and pressure , " the day before a un deadline to stop sensitive nuclear work expires .

" we are constantly hearing about some threat of dependence on russia , that something must be done to limit the entry of russian companies into the european market , " putin said at a joint news conference with german chancellor angela merkel after two days of talks focused on energy . " what are we supposed to do when we hear the same thing every day ?
we start looking for other markets .
when we continually hear the same thing , we perceive this as a threat to limit our admittance to the market and we begin to look for other outlets , " the russian leader said . putin said russia had no wish to cut back on supplies of energy to countries in europe - they depend overall on russia for around one-fourth of their natural gas supplies and a large share of oil supplies - and stressed that moscow had always been a reliable supplier independent of politics . " we have worked well with you for many years , even when there was the cold war . ...
day after day , the soviet union delivered for its partners in europe .
what is the point of stoking fears about excessive dependence with regard to russia today ? "
putin asked . moscow 's threat to shift energy priorities east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin is looking at china and the far east for energy partners putin and other top russian officials have however stressed in recent weeks that china , japan and other huge markets in asia are increasingly hungry for russian energy supplies and have warned that moscow may shift its priority to serving those clients at the expense of european buyers . the european union , some of whose members felt disruption to their gas supplies from russia in january when moscow briefly cut shipments to ukraine amid a price dispute , has responded by telling moscow not to " politicize " energy trade . while russia 's state-run gas giant gazprom , for example , has complained of efforts to block its expansion plans in european markets , it has also flatly rejected european demands that it relax its own domestic monopoly and open excess gas pipeline capacity to foreign firms . tensions with west exacerbated by energy struggles putin 's comments were certain to heighten tensions on energy between russia - the world 's second-largest crude oil exporter and largest supplier of natural gas - and the west , which is anxious over linkage of kremlin energy strategy with political objectives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and merkel found little common ground on energy issues in comments to officials on wednesday shortly before he greeted merkel , putin complained that russia 's aims to expand in western energy markets were being systematically thwarted by " unfair competition " barriers . " we are being blocked to the north , the south and the west on any pretext .
we have to find outlets , to fit into the global development process , " putin said wednesday hours before greeting merkel . by way of example he cited reports that the british government had recently considered modifying anti-monopoly legislation in such a way as to prevent gazprom from buying centrica , britain 's biggest household gas supplier . british prime minister tony blair ruled out any move to block the takeover , the daily financial times reported wednesday , sparking a surge in centrica 's share price . putin said gazprom had never intended to buy the company anyway .
" we need to agree on the rules of the game " and those should be applied on an equal basis to all countries , he said . eu failing in bid to rein in russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to ensure the supply stays open the european union has ratcheted up pressure on russia to sign its energy charter , a document that regulates energy transport and would prohibit any signatory from disrupting contracted supplies for any reason . a top gazprom official , alexander medvedev , told participants at an economic forum in london earlier this week that the pact was " stillborn . " however , putin 's economic advisor referred to the prickly eu-russian relationship as a normal sign of a changing balance of power . " having this tension is okay , it 's a problem with any growth , " said igor shuvalov , who is also russia 's sherpa to the group of eight industrialized countries .
" russia is part of the family ; we were considered the small kid .
now we are growing and we raise our voice , " he added . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel , putin hail gas deal , disagree on iran concluding their two-day summit in siberia , russian and german leaders saw the signing of a major joint venture between companies from both countries to develop a natural gas field .

saudi arabia , egypt and turkey -lrb- perhaps syria , algeria and eventually iraq -rrb- would all find it hard to understand that they do not enjoy the right to a nuclear option .
this is presumably a principal reason why -lrb- former german foreign minister -rrb- joschka fischer once described the thought of iran with the bomb as one of the worst imaginable nightmares . second , imagine an emboldened iran meddling to an even greater extent in iraq and afghanistan .
the mullahs may have an interest in stability in both countries ; but most surely not in democracy and pro-western governments .
expect more dead americans -lrb- and germans -rrb- in the short-term . third , bet on significantly higher oil prices , says henry sokolksi , director of the nonproliferation policy education center in washington .
a nuclear iran may feel tempted to intimidate saudi arabia -lrb- which has the world 's largest oil production capacity -rrb- , according to sokolski , or perhaps even threaten the freedom of the seas to manipulate oil prices dramatically upward . more terrorism to come ? fourth , get used to more terrorism .
iran remains a prominent supporter of palestinian terror , of course .
but the iranian regime has also struck targets in europe in the 1980s and 1990s .
there is evidence , moreover , that as recently as 2004 the iranians sought to assist terrorist groups in identify targets in the united states . one feeble excuse made on behalf of the iranian regime is that iran has legitimate security concerns : it feels threatened by the us presence in iraq and afghanistan .
but then iran had been busy pursuing its bomb long before the united states ever had troops in either country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeffrey gedmin iran 's leaders say ahmadineejad wants to wipe israel off the map .
the mullahs say they want to be a regional hegemonic power .
the iranian president also says iran wants more .
ahmadineejad talks of the rising islamic " superpower " and a coming " clash of civilizations . "
where insanity meets modern technology , there is surely reason for concern . jeffrey gedmi n is director of the aspe n i n stitute berli n send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel , putin hail gas deal , disagree on iran concluding their two-day summit in siberia , russian and german leaders saw the signing of a major joint venture between companies from both countries to develop a natural gas field .

" we will now be asking the security council to increase the pressure on iran , so that the international community can be assured that its nuclear program is not a threat to peace and security , " british foreign secretary jack straw said . the international atomic energy agency said in a report that iran had not met demands to freeze uranium enrichment , american , british and french diplomats said they expected to present a text in the security council next week . " after more than three years of agency efforts to seek clarity about all aspects of iran 's nuclear program , the existing gaps in knowledge continue to be a matter of concern , " the iaea report said .
" any progress in that regard requires full transparency and active cooperation by iran . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier called for " international unity " germany committed to peaceful solution german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called for the international community to close ranks in opposition to the iranian nuclear program and push for a peaceful solution . steinmeier said germany would be prepared to restart negotiations with iran , but only if teheran produced a solid basis for negotiations but remained cautious , adding " until now there have not been any signals of compromise . " french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy also called for iranian " gestures that will re-establish confidence about the goals of their nuclear program . " iran says its program is part of a peaceful civilian nuclear energy drive .
the united states and europe fear , however , that it is hiding secret atomic weapons development . iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad said friday that iran was being denied its right to atomic energy and issued another veiled threat to cut off ties with the un 's nuclear watchdog . " we still want to work within the framework of the agency and we are committed to its regulations , " ahmadinejad told the official iranian irna agency .
" but if these regulations that guarantee our rights are used against us , we will totally change our way of dealing with the organizations .

" iran will provide a timetable within the next three weeks " if " the iran nuclear dossier will remain , in full , in the framework of the iaea and under its safeguards , " according to friday 's iaea report . a chapter 7 resolution , under which efforts to enact sanctions would be taken , is invoked to take : " action with respect to threats to the peace , breaches of the peace , and acts of aggression . "
several security council resolutions against iraq were taken under chapter 7 , before the march 2003 us-led invasion . the resolutions are binding on all un member states , but before action can be taken , chapter 7 says , the council can first " call upon the parties concerned to comply with such provisional measures as it deems necessary or desirable .

ahmadinejad and bush iran and the us need to tone down their rhetoric and start showing a willingness to compromise in order to resolve the nuclear crisis diplomatically , says janet kursawe of the german institute for middle east studies . when the un security council 's ultimatum calling on iran to halt its nuclear program expires on friday , a positive outcome in the form of iran giving in to the demands is highly unlikely .
that 's not very surprising , considering that chances of success were limited from the beginning .
and since the ultimatum was not issued in the form of a resolution that 's binding in terms of international law , sanctions are not going to follow . thirty days ago , at the time the ultimatum was given , the iranian government reacted quickly by saying that it would not give in to international pressure by giving up its right to peaceful use of nuclear power .
tehran 's announcement to withdraw from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and the international atomic energy agency in case of sanctions were also predictable . what 's surprising is the escalation of the last few months .
ever since iran 's sixth president , mahmoud ahmadinejad , took office , the dynamics of conflict that the us and iran engaged in via provocative statements have made it increasingly difficult to reach a diplomatic solution . both sides seem to have found a perfect match : ahmadinejad 's piety and self-presentation , combined with excessive nationalism and a readiness to sacrifice , is the logical response to george w. bush 's sense of mission . blow n out of proportio n the demands on iran that are unique in the non-proliferation treaty 's history are insulting and offending when one considers the country 's significant sense of national pride and the fact that iran has been a member of the treaty since 1968 . the situation has paved the way to turn the right to use nuclear power into a question of national self-determination , as happened since ahmadinejad took over .
his government and radical , conservative forces of other political organs have managed to preempt all domestic and foreign policy issues in the dispute over iran 's right to use nuclear power , limiting the power of the opposition even further as a result . no one helps iran 's leader more in this respect than the us government .
while opposition voices are increasingly calling for an end to the course of confrontation and back a compromise and even a temporary halt to uranium enrichment , their power and ability to act is extremely limited . a deteriorating political climate and increasing human rights abuses are a consequence of iran 's growing isolation .
should the isolation continue , the conservative , radical establishment will consolidate its political power even further and lead to a militarization of domestic and foreign policies . mutual suspicio n s preve n t solutio n iran is still a long way from being able to produce nuclear weapons .
should the conflict continue , the government is certain to increase its efforts in the field of nuclear research and will use them to raise its deterrent potential .
ahmadinejad 's propagandistic remarks during military exercises at the beginning of april served the same purpose . mutual suspicion and alternating threats between the us and iran are currently the biggest hindrances to a diplomatic solution .
iran feels threatened because of us military presence in its immediate vicinity and because of washington 's assurances that it wants to bring about a regime change in tehran .
the fact that israel feels threatened - and exercises pressure on the us - because of ahmadinejad 's anti-semitic remarks also contributes to the dynamics of escalation . the current insistence on refusing to compromise could lead to a decision to push the military option .

" we are constantly hearing about some threat of dependence on russia , that something must be done to limit the entry of russian companies into the european market , " putin said at a joint news conference with german chancellor angela merkel after two days of talks focused on energy . " what are we supposed to do when we hear the same thing every day ?
we start looking for other markets .
when we continually hear the same thing , we perceive this as a threat to limit our admittance to the market and we begin to look for other outlets , " the russian leader said . putin said russia had no wish to cut back on supplies of energy to countries in europe - they depend overall on russia for around one-fourth of their natural gas supplies and a large share of oil supplies - and stressed that moscow had always been a reliable supplier independent of politics . " we have worked well with you for many years , even when there was the cold war . ...

" we are being blocked to the north , the south and the west on any pretext .
we have to find outlets , to fit into the global development process , " putin said wednesday hours before greeting merkel . by way of example he cited reports that the british government had recently considered modifying anti-monopoly legislation in such a way as to prevent gazprom from buying centrica , britain 's biggest household gas supplier . british prime minister tony blair ruled out any move to block the takeover , the daily financial times reported wednesday , sparking a surge in centrica 's share price . putin said gazprom had never intended to buy the company anyway .

" having this tension is okay , it 's a problem with any growth , " said igor shuvalov , who is also russia 's sherpa to the group of eight industrialized countries .

" our aim is to limit the cost of each kilometer of maglev line to approximately 200 million yuan -lrb- $ 25 million -rrb- , " the paper quoted zhang as saying . that means the unit cost will be cut by one-third , the china daily said .
the current line cost 310 million yuan -lrb- $ 39 million -rrb- per kilometer to build . " lowering the cost of a maglev system is a significant issue in the study and construction of the shanghai-hangzhou maglev railway .
we are now confident we can achieve that , " zhang was quoted as saying . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a station worker guides a passenger near a maglev train in shanghai china currently operates the world 's only commercial maglev line , which runs 30 kilometers from shanghai 's airport to the financial center in the pudong district . the shanghai-hangzhou maglev line should be completed ahead of the 2010 world expo in shanghai , according to earlier state press reports .
planners expect to construct four stations along the route that will whisk passengers from shanghai 's international airport to hangzhou in just 26 minutes , the reports said . original designer germany 's transrapid international , a consortium between german industrial giants thyssenkrupp and siemens , is the original designer and builder of the maglev trains , which travel at up to 430 kilometers -lrb- 270 miles -rrb- per hour . transrapid has already signed a deal to be involved in the new line to hangzhou , but thursday 's report indicates its role will be scaled back compared with the service between shanghai and the airport . as in many other high-tech industries such as aerospace and autos , china is intent on developing its own technologies so as not to be reliant on foreign companies and to ensure it can cut costs . the china daily said the state council , china 's cabinet , was encouraging engineers to " learn and absorb foreign advanced technologies while making further innovations . " technology theft ? but some in germany are concerned about copyright protection , and accuse the chinese of copying technology from countries doing business there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the transrapid is the world 's only commercial magnetic-levitation train , but not for long " what 's happening in china smells suspiciously like technology theft , " said bavarian premier edmund stoiber after he learned of china 's plans to build its own maglev train .
he has suggested putting the issue of chinese development and intellectual property protections on the agenda of the next g8 meeting . the head of thyssenkrupp , ekkehard schulz , was somewhat more diplomatic .
" it appears that some chinese patents overlap quite a bit with our own , " he said . there are similar worries about technology and china being voiced across the atlantic .
former us commerce secretary donald evans made us concerns official in beijing .
he cited the example the qq mini car from china 's chery automobile co .
american carmaker general motors claims the qq is a copy of its chevrolet spark model . the chinese deny any technology plagiarism in both cases .
the china aviation industry corporation has said the new chinese " zhui feng " magnetic train is not dependent on foreign technology .

tehran 's decision to ignore a un ultimatum to freeze its nuclear enrichment work was described as irresponsible and a slap in the face of the international community . in the search for solutions to the standoff , wolfgang gerhardt , a foreign policy expert from the opposition liberal free democrats , said russia and china must play a more pro-active role now . " we can only stop tehran if russia and china come to realize that they can no longer stand on the sidelines in this dispute , " he said .
" within the next few days it is crucial that these countries drive home to iran that it will definitely face punitive action if it continues down this path of confrontation . " ingo friedrich , a member of the conservative csu party also believes that moscow and beijing must now come forward to step up international pressure on iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
he thinks that efforts within the united nations aimed at imposing sanctions must be intensified . " it is now a matter of credibility for the united nations to impose sanctions , " he said .
" iran must be made to understand that it can not defy demands by the international community without punishment . " military actio n u n likely as the conflict is heating up , the prospect of a military confrontation is looming ever larger .
washington has n't ruled out the use of military force to stop iran building nuclear weapons . but ullrich klose , foreign policy spokesman of the social democrats said he believes this is just empty rhetoric .
he added that he is rather pessimistic about a positive outcome of the conflict . " people say the conflict will develop similar to what we saw in iraq , " klose said .
" i do n't think this will happen because the united states have had a bad time of it there and a war with iran would overstretch the country 's capabilities .
so in the end we 'll either have a political solution or face the situation that iran continues its nuclear program unfazed . " public anger in germany about the mullah regime in tehran has been fuelled recently after ahamadinejad said he wanted to visit germany to attend one of iran 's world cup soccer matches this summer .
german politicians such as csu leader edmund stoiber have vowed to do everything in their power to prevent that .

ukraine reiterated friday its desire to join nato despite russian qualms , after the western alliance hinted heavily that the politically troubled ex-soviet state could soon win approval for membership . during the meeting of nato foreign ministers in the bulgarian capital sofia , ukrainian foreign minister borys tarasyuk said : " ukraine 's strategy towards joining nato is irreversible . " the sofia talks were the first such contact with nato since parliamentary elections on march 26 which were widely praised as free and fair , although they have left kiev in political limbo . nato officials at the sofia talks say there is widespread support for ukraine 's bid , despite its political problems .
speaking on thursday , nato head jaap de hoop scheffer hinted there could be an opening to aspiring members at a summit in the latvian capital in november . " i have no doubt that in riga , countries aspiring to nato membership will want a signal .
there will be a signal at riga , " de hoop scheffer said . " when they are ready , nato is ready , " he said in comments that referred also to georgia , another ex-soviet republic bidding to join nato . ukraine struggles with a turbulent past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : independence square in ukraine 's capital kiev addressing the political dispute that has dragged on in ukraine since march 26 parliamentary elections , u.s. secretary of state condoleezza rice said the country faced an uphill struggle to join nato . " the ukrainian government and the ukrainian people will have to decide whether or not this is something that they wish to pursue , " rice told reporters on the sidelines of the sofia meeting on thursday .
" and they will also have to work very hard , i think , to meet the criteria , " she added . ukrainian president viktor yushchenko has set out an ambitious pro-west agenda since coming to power in 2005 after a wave of popular protests known as the " orange revolution " that brought down a moscow-backed regime . but his party performed badly in march and has been forced into coalition talks that could bring to power either a government favoring links with europe and nato or one preferring a strong bond with russia . new dividing lines in europe ? moscow , which held sway over kiev in soviet times and maintains a strong influence over its western neighbor , meanwhile reasserted its opposition to ukraine 's nato hopes . " we are against the creation of new dividing lines in europe , " mikhail kamynin , russia 's foreign ministry spokesman , was quoted as saying in an interview with ria-novosti news agency on thursday . " today there are algorithms of cooperation with nato that allow states to cooperate in the widest security spectrum without formal accession to the alliance , " kamynin said . nato sending ukraine mixed signals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato foreign ministers meeting at the national palace of culture in sofia but nato on thursday appeared to play down reports that ukraine could be offered the alliance 's " membership action plan " , the key step before being invited to join . " ukraine 's aspirations to join the alliance are welcomed by all allies , " nato spokesman james appathurai told reporters in sofia .
" what i can not predict is timelines for membership action plans , " he added . albania , croatia and macedonia are currently in the membership action plan with the north atlantic treaty organisation -lrb- nato -rrb- . ten countries that were once allied with russia - bulgaria , czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , poland , romania , slovakia and slovenia - have joined nato since 1999 . also on friday , during a sideline meeting , u.s. secretary of state condoleezza rice signed a bilateral agreement with bulgarian officials to establish three military bases in the country as the u.s. shifts troops from old cold war positions to smaller units closer to the middle east and africa . nato boosts darfur aid moving from the european to the african continent during talks in sofia , nato has said it is ready to boost assistance in sudan 's violence-scarred darfur region .
the alliance has said it will increase logistical support , but said any presence should be limited and only in support of african or u.n. efforts . in nato 's first operation on the african continent , the alliance has provided training and transportation to african union troops trying to stem the violence there .

he has accused the cia of kidnapping him in late 2003 from macedonia and interrogating him in afghanistan . skopje has denied any involvement in the alleged operation by the us spy agency . upon arrival , the delegation met macedonian president branko crvenkovski and were due to meet deputy prime minister radmila secerinska and former foreign minister slobodan casule , the eu spokesman andrea angeli told afp news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giovanni claudio fava , european lawmaker leading cia flight probe " the target is the truth , just the truth , " the eu lawmaker leading the probe , claudio fava , told reporters after the meeting with crvenkovski . the eu deputies are scheduled to meet former interior minister siljan avramovski , his successor ljubomir mihajlovski and parliamentary speaker ljupco jordanovski on friday . earlier this year european deputies decided to set up a special committee to look into the allegations that the central intelligence agency secretly operated flights carrying prisoners it considered terror suspects which passed through eu territory . the parliament 's inquiry started in january and is expected to issue a first report next month . more than 1,000 secret cia flights have gone through european airspace and airports since 2001 without governments requesting information , fava said upon presenting a preliminary report . " it is hard to believe that the authorities and governments of certain countries were unaware of what was going on on their territory .
our probe shows that they must have known , " fava said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. col. steven f. dreyer at the air base near bucharest fava singled out sweden , italy and bosnia for particular criticism .
for more than three months , the eu parliamentary inquiry has heard testimony from alleged victims and human rights groups - all saying that european states had handed over terrorism suspects to foreign agents , and ignoring hundreds of cia flights that had used their airports .
some former detainees provided detailed accounts of alleged torture carried out in secret prisons outside eu or us jurisdiction . the eu lawmakers investigating the khalid al-masri case in macedonia want to find out how the plane with al-masri on board could leave europe unchallenged . fava believes that there were hundreds of similar incidents .
" if we look at all the testimonies we have got , it becomes very clear that these incidents were n't sporadic , but that it was a common practice .
that 's the only conclusion i can draw , " fava said . the cia declined to comment on the eu parliamentarians ' findings .
the inquiry committee has no legal powers , but it will recommend what political action should be taken against any countries found to have been involved , including the united states .
several eu lawmakers are expected to go to washington in early may to try to meet secretary of state condoleezza rice and cia chief porter goss . the european union has granted macedonia candidate status , but no date has been set to begin talks for membership in the bloc . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the cia affair and eu : who has responsiblity ?

ukraine reiterated friday its desire to join nato despite russian qualms , after the western alliance hinted heavily that the politically troubled ex-soviet state could soon win approval for membership . during the meeting of nato foreign ministers in the bulgarian capital sofia , ukrainian foreign minister borys tarasyuk said : " ukraine 's strategy towards joining nato is irreversible . " the sofia talks were the first such contact with nato since parliamentary elections on march 26 which were widely praised as free and fair , although they have left kiev in political limbo . nato officials at the sofia talks say there is widespread support for ukraine 's bid , despite its political problems .
speaking on thursday , nato head jaap de hoop scheffer hinted there could be an opening to aspiring members at a summit in the latvian capital in november . " i have no doubt that in riga , countries aspiring to nato membership will want a signal .
there will be a signal at riga , " de hoop scheffer said . " when they are ready , nato is ready , " he said in comments that referred also to georgia , another ex-soviet republic bidding to join nato . ukraine struggles with a turbulent past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : independence square in ukraine 's capital kiev addressing the political dispute that has dragged on in ukraine since march 26 parliamentary elections , u.s. secretary of state condoleezza rice said the country faced an uphill struggle to join nato . " the ukrainian government and the ukrainian people will have to decide whether or not this is something that they wish to pursue , " rice told reporters on the sidelines of the sofia meeting on thursday .
" and they will also have to work very hard , i think , to meet the criteria , " she added . ukrainian president viktor yushchenko has set out an ambitious pro-west agenda since coming to power in 2005 after a wave of popular protests known as the " orange revolution " that brought down a moscow-backed regime . but his party performed badly in march and has been forced into coalition talks that could bring to power either a government favoring links with europe and nato or one preferring a strong bond with russia . new dividing lines in europe ? moscow , which held sway over kiev in soviet times and maintains a strong influence over its western neighbor , meanwhile reasserted its opposition to ukraine 's nato hopes . " we are against the creation of new dividing lines in europe , " mikhail kamynin , russia 's foreign ministry spokesman , was quoted as saying in an interview with ria-novosti news agency on thursday . " today there are algorithms of cooperation with nato that allow states to cooperate in the widest security spectrum without formal accession to the alliance , " kamynin said . nato sending ukraine mixed signals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato foreign ministers meeting at the national palace of culture in sofia but nato on thursday appeared to play down reports that ukraine could be offered the alliance 's " membership action plan " , the key step before being invited to join . " ukraine 's aspirations to join the alliance are welcomed by all allies , " nato spokesman james appathurai told reporters in sofia .
" what i can not predict is timelines for membership action plans , " he added . albania , croatia and macedonia are currently in the membership action plan with the north atlantic treaty organisation -lrb- nato -rrb- . ten countries that were once allied with russia - bulgaria , czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , poland , romania , slovakia and slovenia - have joined nato since 1999 . also on friday , during a sideline meeting , u.s. secretary of state condoleezza rice signed a bilateral agreement with bulgarian officials to establish three military bases in the country as the u.s. shifts troops from old cold war positions to smaller units closer to the middle east and africa . nato boosts darfur aid moving from the european to the african continent during talks in sofia , nato has said it is ready to boost assistance in sudan 's violence-scarred darfur region .
the alliance has said it will increase logistical support , but said any presence should be limited and only in support of african or u.n. efforts . in nato 's first operation on the african continent , the alliance has provided training and transportation to african union troops trying to stem the violence there .

he has accused the cia of kidnapping him in late 2003 from macedonia and interrogating him in afghanistan . skopje has denied any involvement in the alleged operation by the us spy agency . upon arrival , the delegation met macedonian president branko crvenkovski and were due to meet deputy prime minister radmila secerinska and former foreign minister slobodan casule , the eu spokesman andrea angeli told afp news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giovanni claudio fava , european lawmaker leading cia flight probe " the target is the truth , just the truth , " the eu lawmaker leading the probe , claudio fava , told reporters after the meeting with crvenkovski . the eu deputies are scheduled to meet former interior minister siljan avramovski , his successor ljubomir mihajlovski and parliamentary speaker ljupco jordanovski on friday . earlier this year european deputies decided to set up a special committee to look into the allegations that the central intelligence agency secretly operated flights carrying prisoners it considered terror suspects which passed through eu territory . the parliament 's inquiry started in january and is expected to issue a first report next month . more than 1,000 secret cia flights have gone through european airspace and airports since 2001 without governments requesting information , fava said upon presenting a preliminary report . " it is hard to believe that the authorities and governments of certain countries were unaware of what was going on on their territory .
our probe shows that they must have known , " fava said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. col. steven f. dreyer at the air base near bucharest fava singled out sweden , italy and bosnia for particular criticism .
for more than three months , the eu parliamentary inquiry has heard testimony from alleged victims and human rights groups - all saying that european states had handed over terrorism suspects to foreign agents , and ignoring hundreds of cia flights that had used their airports .
some former detainees provided detailed accounts of alleged torture carried out in secret prisons outside eu or us jurisdiction . the eu lawmakers investigating the khalid al-masri case in macedonia want to find out how the plane with al-masri on board could leave europe unchallenged . fava believes that there were hundreds of similar incidents .
" if we look at all the testimonies we have got , it becomes very clear that these incidents were n't sporadic , but that it was a common practice .
that 's the only conclusion i can draw , " fava said . the cia declined to comment on the eu parliamentarians ' findings .
the inquiry committee has no legal powers , but it will recommend what political action should be taken against any countries found to have been involved , including the united states .
several eu lawmakers are expected to go to washington in early may to try to meet secretary of state condoleezza rice and cia chief porter goss . the european union has granted macedonia candidate status , but no date has been set to begin talks for membership in the bloc . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the cia affair and eu : who has responsiblity ?

ahmadinejad and bush iran and the us need to tone down their rhetoric and start showing a willingness to compromise in order to resolve the nuclear crisis diplomatically , says janet kursawe of the german institute for middle east studies . when the un security council 's ultimatum calling on iran to halt its nuclear program expires on friday , a positive outcome in the form of iran giving in to the demands is highly unlikely .
that 's not very surprising , considering that chances of success were limited from the beginning .
and since the ultimatum was not issued in the form of a resolution that 's binding in terms of international law , sanctions are not going to follow . thirty days ago , at the time the ultimatum was given , the iranian government reacted quickly by saying that it would not give in to international pressure by giving up its right to peaceful use of nuclear power .
tehran 's announcement to withdraw from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and the international atomic energy agency in case of sanctions were also predictable . what 's surprising is the escalation of the last few months .
ever since iran 's sixth president , mahmoud ahmadinejad , took office , the dynamics of conflict that the us and iran engaged in via provocative statements have made it increasingly difficult to reach a diplomatic solution . both sides seem to have found a perfect match : ahmadinejad 's piety and self-presentation , combined with excessive nationalism and a readiness to sacrifice , is the logical response to george w. bush 's sense of mission . blow n out of proportio n the demands on iran that are unique in the non-proliferation treaty 's history are insulting and offending when one considers the country 's significant sense of national pride and the fact that iran has been a member of the treaty since 1968 . the situation has paved the way to turn the right to use nuclear power into a question of national self-determination , as happened since ahmadinejad took over .
his government and radical , conservative forces of other political organs have managed to preempt all domestic and foreign policy issues in the dispute over iran 's right to use nuclear power , limiting the power of the opposition even further as a result . no one helps iran 's leader more in this respect than the us government .
while opposition voices are increasingly calling for an end to the course of confrontation and back a compromise and even a temporary halt to uranium enrichment , their power and ability to act is extremely limited . a deteriorating political climate and increasing human rights abuses are a consequence of iran 's growing isolation .
should the isolation continue , the conservative , radical establishment will consolidate its political power even further and lead to a militarization of domestic and foreign policies . mutual suspicio n s preve n t solutio n iran is still a long way from being able to produce nuclear weapons .
should the conflict continue , the government is certain to increase its efforts in the field of nuclear research and will use them to raise its deterrent potential .
ahmadinejad 's propagandistic remarks during military exercises at the beginning of april served the same purpose . mutual suspicion and alternating threats between the us and iran are currently the biggest hindrances to a diplomatic solution .
iran feels threatened because of us military presence in its immediate vicinity and because of washington 's assurances that it wants to bring about a regime change in tehran .
the fact that israel feels threatened - and exercises pressure on the us - because of ahmadinejad 's anti-semitic remarks also contributes to the dynamics of escalation . the current insistence on refusing to compromise could lead to a decision to push the military option .
any military action - even a limited one that only aims to destroy nuclear plants - will have fatal security consequences for the region in the long run . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : janet kursawe instead , people should consider rethinking a russian proposal that was outright rejected by the us administration .
moscow suggested that the iranian nuclear program should continue outside the country with russia 's technological help .
in order for this to happen , however , all sides would have to work towards de-escalating the situation and the us government would have to be willing to sit down and negotiate with iran . janet kursawe is an ethnologist , political scientist and psychologist .

" our aim is to limit the cost of each kilometer of maglev line to approximately 200 million yuan -lrb- $ 25 million -rrb- , " the paper quoted zhang as saying . that means the unit cost will be cut by one-third , the china daily said .
the current line cost 310 million yuan -lrb- $ 39 million -rrb- per kilometer to build . " lowering the cost of a maglev system is a significant issue in the study and construction of the shanghai-hangzhou maglev railway .

president ahmadinejad again insisted his country is seeking only to develop peaceful nuclear power , and not bombs . here dw-world.de presents a timeline of the crisis : dec .
2002 : us satellite photographs reveal the existence of active nuclear sites in iran .
the country , which is a signatory of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- , agrees that the sites can be inspected by the un 's international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- .
however the npt provides for such checks to be announced in advance . july 2003 : un inspectors say they have found traces of enriched uranium at iran 's natanz facility .

2004 : iran successfully tests a new version of its shahab-3 medium range missile .
it could easily attain israel , which is widely believed to have nuclear missiles . nov .

the iaea places seals on several nuclear facilities in iran . june 2005 : mahmoud ahmadinejad , a hard-line populist , is elected president of iran .
he takes over in august .
only days after his accession , iran resumes uranium work . aug .

ahmadinejad and bush iran and the us need to tone down their rhetoric and start showing a willingness to compromise in order to resolve the nuclear crisis diplomatically , says janet kursawe of the german institute for middle east studies . when the un security council 's ultimatum calling on iran to halt its nuclear program expires on friday , a positive outcome in the form of iran giving in to the demands is highly unlikely .
that 's not very surprising , considering that chances of success were limited from the beginning .
and since the ultimatum was not issued in the form of a resolution that 's binding in terms of international law , sanctions are not going to follow . thirty days ago , at the time the ultimatum was given , the iranian government reacted quickly by saying that it would not give in to international pressure by giving up its right to peaceful use of nuclear power .
tehran 's announcement to withdraw from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and the international atomic energy agency in case of sanctions were also predictable . what 's surprising is the escalation of the last few months .
ever since iran 's sixth president , mahmoud ahmadinejad , took office , the dynamics of conflict that the us and iran engaged in via provocative statements have made it increasingly difficult to reach a diplomatic solution . both sides seem to have found a perfect match : ahmadinejad 's piety and self-presentation , combined with excessive nationalism and a readiness to sacrifice , is the logical response to george w. bush 's sense of mission . blow n out of proportio n the demands on iran that are unique in the non-proliferation treaty 's history are insulting and offending when one considers the country 's significant sense of national pride and the fact that iran has been a member of the treaty since 1968 . the situation has paved the way to turn the right to use nuclear power into a question of national self-determination , as happened since ahmadinejad took over .
his government and radical , conservative forces of other political organs have managed to preempt all domestic and foreign policy issues in the dispute over iran 's right to use nuclear power , limiting the power of the opposition even further as a result . no one helps iran 's leader more in this respect than the us government .
while opposition voices are increasingly calling for an end to the course of confrontation and back a compromise and even a temporary halt to uranium enrichment , their power and ability to act is extremely limited . a deteriorating political climate and increasing human rights abuses are a consequence of iran 's growing isolation .
should the isolation continue , the conservative , radical establishment will consolidate its political power even further and lead to a militarization of domestic and foreign policies . mutual suspicio n s preve n t solutio n iran is still a long way from being able to produce nuclear weapons .
should the conflict continue , the government is certain to increase its efforts in the field of nuclear research and will use them to raise its deterrent potential .
ahmadinejad 's propagandistic remarks during military exercises at the beginning of april served the same purpose . mutual suspicion and alternating threats between the us and iran are currently the biggest hindrances to a diplomatic solution .
iran feels threatened because of us military presence in its immediate vicinity and because of washington 's assurances that it wants to bring about a regime change in tehran .
the fact that israel feels threatened - and exercises pressure on the us - because of ahmadinejad 's anti-semitic remarks also contributes to the dynamics of escalation . the current insistence on refusing to compromise could lead to a decision to push the military option .
any military action - even a limited one that only aims to destroy nuclear plants - will have fatal security consequences for the region in the long run . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : janet kursawe instead , people should consider rethinking a russian proposal that was outright rejected by the us administration .
moscow suggested that the iranian nuclear program should continue outside the country with russia 's technological help .
in order for this to happen , however , all sides would have to work towards de-escalating the situation and the us government would have to be willing to sit down and negotiate with iran . janet kursawe is an ethnologist , political scientist and psychologist .

we are now confident we can achieve that , " zhang was quoted as saying . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a station worker guides a passenger near a maglev train in shanghai china currently operates the world 's only commercial maglev line , which runs 30 kilometers from shanghai 's airport to the financial center in the pudong district . the shanghai-hangzhou maglev line should be completed ahead of the 2010 world expo in shanghai , according to earlier state press reports .
planners expect to construct four stations along the route that will whisk passengers from shanghai 's international airport to hangzhou in just 26 minutes , the reports said . original designer germany 's transrapid international , a consortium between german industrial giants thyssenkrupp and siemens , is the original designer and builder of the maglev trains , which travel at up to 430 kilometers -lrb- 270 miles -rrb- per hour . transrapid has already signed a deal to be involved in the new line to hangzhou , but thursday 's report indicates its role will be scaled back compared with the service between shanghai and the airport . as in many other high-tech industries such as aerospace and autos , china is intent on developing its own technologies so as not to be reliant on foreign companies and to ensure it can cut costs . the china daily said the state council , china 's cabinet , was encouraging engineers to " learn and absorb foreign advanced technologies while making further innovations . " technology theft ? but some in germany are concerned about copyright protection , and accuse the chinese of copying technology from countries doing business there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the transrapid is the world 's only commercial magnetic-levitation train , but not for long " what 's happening in china smells suspiciously like technology theft , " said bavarian premier edmund stoiber after he learned of china 's plans to build its own maglev train .
he has suggested putting the issue of chinese development and intellectual property protections on the agenda of the next g8 meeting . the head of thyssenkrupp , ekkehard schulz , was somewhat more diplomatic .
" it appears that some chinese patents overlap quite a bit with our own , " he said . there are similar worries about technology and china being voiced across the atlantic .
former us commerce secretary donald evans made us concerns official in beijing .
he cited the example the qq mini car from china 's chery automobile co .
american carmaker general motors claims the qq is a copy of its chevrolet spark model . the chinese deny any technology plagiarism in both cases .
the china aviation industry corporation has said the new chinese " zhui feng " magnetic train is not dependent on foreign technology .
it is much lighter than the transrapid product , the company said , and features a much more advanced design . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german foreign minister to walk diplomatic tightrope in china stressing germany 's stance against lifting the eu arms embargo , talking tough on human rights and deepening business ties - foreign minister steinmeier will have his hands full when he visits china wednesday .

why would this be so dangerous ?
the aspen 's institute jeffrey gedmin offers answers . the us and the european union share nearly identical views .
teheran says it wants nuclear power for peaceful purposes .
no one believes the mullahs .
iran should have enough oil and gas to take care of its energy needs for several hundred years .
there are other reasons to believe that the government in teheran is lying .
iran played cat and mouse with the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- for 18 years .
we expect the iaea to issue iran yet another rebuke this friday . still , why should iran not have the bomb ?
after all , india , pakistan and israel are all nuclear powers , right ?
if you follow this logic - and cast aside for a moment the fact that by signing the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- iran has pledged not to acquire nuclear weapons - then you had better ponder the following . setti n g off a n uclear arms race ? first , when iran gets the bomb , be prepared for a nuclear arms race .
saudi arabia , egypt and turkey -lrb- perhaps syria , algeria and eventually iraq -rrb- would all find it hard to understand that they do not enjoy the right to a nuclear option .
this is presumably a principal reason why -lrb- former german foreign minister -rrb- joschka fischer once described the thought of iran with the bomb as one of the worst imaginable nightmares . second , imagine an emboldened iran meddling to an even greater extent in iraq and afghanistan .
the mullahs may have an interest in stability in both countries ; but most surely not in democracy and pro-western governments .
expect more dead americans -lrb- and germans -rrb- in the short-term . third , bet on significantly higher oil prices , says henry sokolksi , director of the nonproliferation policy education center in washington .
a nuclear iran may feel tempted to intimidate saudi arabia -lrb- which has the world 's largest oil production capacity -rrb- , according to sokolski , or perhaps even threaten the freedom of the seas to manipulate oil prices dramatically upward . more terrorism to come ? fourth , get used to more terrorism .
iran remains a prominent supporter of palestinian terror , of course .
but the iranian regime has also struck targets in europe in the 1980s and 1990s .
there is evidence , moreover , that as recently as 2004 the iranians sought to assist terrorist groups in identify targets in the united states . one feeble excuse made on behalf of the iranian regime is that iran has legitimate security concerns : it feels threatened by the us presence in iraq and afghanistan .
but then iran had been busy pursuing its bomb long before the united states ever had troops in either country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeffrey gedmin iran 's leaders say ahmadineejad wants to wipe israel off the map .
the mullahs say they want to be a regional hegemonic power .
the iranian president also says iran wants more .
ahmadineejad talks of the rising islamic " superpower " and a coming " clash of civilizations . "

ukraine reiterated friday its desire to join nato despite russian qualms , after the western alliance hinted heavily that the politically troubled ex-soviet state could soon win approval for membership . during the meeting of nato foreign ministers in the bulgarian capital sofia , ukrainian foreign minister borys tarasyuk said : " ukraine 's strategy towards joining nato is irreversible . " the sofia talks were the first such contact with nato since parliamentary elections on march 26 which were widely praised as free and fair , although they have left kiev in political limbo . nato officials at the sofia talks say there is widespread support for ukraine 's bid , despite its political problems .
speaking on thursday , nato head jaap de hoop scheffer hinted there could be an opening to aspiring members at a summit in the latvian capital in november . " i have no doubt that in riga , countries aspiring to nato membership will want a signal .
there will be a signal at riga , " de hoop scheffer said . " when they are ready , nato is ready , " he said in comments that referred also to georgia , another ex-soviet republic bidding to join nato . ukraine struggles with a turbulent past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : independence square in ukraine 's capital kiev addressing the political dispute that has dragged on in ukraine since march 26 parliamentary elections , u.s. secretary of state condoleezza rice said the country faced an uphill struggle to join nato . " the ukrainian government and the ukrainian people will have to decide whether or not this is something that they wish to pursue , " rice told reporters on the sidelines of the sofia meeting on thursday .
" and they will also have to work very hard , i think , to meet the criteria , " she added . ukrainian president viktor yushchenko has set out an ambitious pro-west agenda since coming to power in 2005 after a wave of popular protests known as the " orange revolution " that brought down a moscow-backed regime . but his party performed badly in march and has been forced into coalition talks that could bring to power either a government favoring links with europe and nato or one preferring a strong bond with russia . new dividing lines in europe ? moscow , which held sway over kiev in soviet times and maintains a strong influence over its western neighbor , meanwhile reasserted its opposition to ukraine 's nato hopes . " we are against the creation of new dividing lines in europe , " mikhail kamynin , russia 's foreign ministry spokesman , was quoted as saying in an interview with ria-novosti news agency on thursday . " today there are algorithms of cooperation with nato that allow states to cooperate in the widest security spectrum without formal accession to the alliance , " kamynin said . nato sending ukraine mixed signals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato foreign ministers meeting at the national palace of culture in sofia but nato on thursday appeared to play down reports that ukraine could be offered the alliance 's " membership action plan " , the key step before being invited to join . " ukraine 's aspirations to join the alliance are welcomed by all allies , " nato spokesman james appathurai told reporters in sofia .
" what i can not predict is timelines for membership action plans , " he added . albania , croatia and macedonia are currently in the membership action plan with the north atlantic treaty organisation -lrb- nato -rrb- . ten countries that were once allied with russia - bulgaria , czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , poland , romania , slovakia and slovenia - have joined nato since 1999 . also on friday , during a sideline meeting , u.s. secretary of state condoleezza rice signed a bilateral agreement with bulgarian officials to establish three military bases in the country as the u.s. shifts troops from old cold war positions to smaller units closer to the middle east and africa . nato boosts darfur aid moving from the european to the african continent during talks in sofia , nato has said it is ready to boost assistance in sudan 's violence-scarred darfur region .
the alliance has said it will increase logistical support , but said any presence should be limited and only in support of african or u.n. efforts . in nato 's first operation on the african continent , the alliance has provided training and transportation to african union troops trying to stem the violence there .

" our aim is to limit the cost of each kilometer of maglev line to approximately 200 million yuan -lrb- $ 25 million -rrb- , " the paper quoted zhang as saying . that means the unit cost will be cut by one-third , the china daily said .
the current line cost 310 million yuan -lrb- $ 39 million -rrb- per kilometer to build . " lowering the cost of a maglev system is a significant issue in the study and construction of the shanghai-hangzhou maglev railway .
we are now confident we can achieve that , " zhang was quoted as saying . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a station worker guides a passenger near a maglev train in shanghai china currently operates the world 's only commercial maglev line , which runs 30 kilometers from shanghai 's airport to the financial center in the pudong district . the shanghai-hangzhou maglev line should be completed ahead of the 2010 world expo in shanghai , according to earlier state press reports .
planners expect to construct four stations along the route that will whisk passengers from shanghai 's international airport to hangzhou in just 26 minutes , the reports said . original designer germany 's transrapid international , a consortium between german industrial giants thyssenkrupp and siemens , is the original designer and builder of the maglev trains , which travel at up to 430 kilometers -lrb- 270 miles -rrb- per hour . transrapid has already signed a deal to be involved in the new line to hangzhou , but thursday 's report indicates its role will be scaled back compared with the service between shanghai and the airport . as in many other high-tech industries such as aerospace and autos , china is intent on developing its own technologies so as not to be reliant on foreign companies and to ensure it can cut costs . the china daily said the state council , china 's cabinet , was encouraging engineers to " learn and absorb foreign advanced technologies while making further innovations . " technology theft ? but some in germany are concerned about copyright protection , and accuse the chinese of copying technology from countries doing business there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the transrapid is the world 's only commercial magnetic-levitation train , but not for long " what 's happening in china smells suspiciously like technology theft , " said bavarian premier edmund stoiber after he learned of china 's plans to build its own maglev train .
he has suggested putting the issue of chinese development and intellectual property protections on the agenda of the next g8 meeting . the head of thyssenkrupp , ekkehard schulz , was somewhat more diplomatic .
" it appears that some chinese patents overlap quite a bit with our own , " he said . there are similar worries about technology and china being voiced across the atlantic .
former us commerce secretary donald evans made us concerns official in beijing .
he cited the example the qq mini car from china 's chery automobile co .
american carmaker general motors claims the qq is a copy of its chevrolet spark model . the chinese deny any technology plagiarism in both cases .
the china aviation industry corporation has said the new chinese " zhui feng " magnetic train is not dependent on foreign technology .

" we thought everyone in the gdr walked around in drab , dismal clothes , but suddenly we found this incredible stuff which showed there was a thriving fashion industry , " said caz hildebrand , the british art director who put the collection together . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " sibylle " - the arty face of gdr fashion but was there really ?
the photos were taken by günter rubitzsch , a leipzig-based photographer who worked regularly for women 's weeklies such as pramo -lrb- abbreviated from " praktische mode " or " practical fashion " -rrb- and für dich -lrb- " for you " -rrb- , magazines which featured sewing or knitting patterns for women who liked to make their own clothes .
and most of them had to . " everyone looked the same , so if you wanted something special you had to make it yourself , " explained antje lond benn , who studied at the technical college for clothing design in east berlin in the 1980s .
" fabrics and patterns were really cheap , and everyone would improvize with them .
and if you were lucky , you could fit into the kids ' clothes , which were heavily subsidized . " honecker 's haute couture so the groovy gdr depicted in " off the wall " might , perhaps , be a little off the mark .
but at least it scuppers a few cliches . " it 's an acknowledgment of my work , and i 'm glad it shows a different side of the gdr , " said rubitzsch .
" it proves that we were n't all impoverished and that it was possible to be creative despite the restrictions we worked with . " after the berlin wall fell , he sold the rights to his pictures to the international agency akg images - and never thought that one day , they 'd be rediscovered as high camp , communist-style . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fashion in ' sybille ' captured a mood - it did n't showcase clothes dating back to decades that taste forgot not just in east germany , what really sets his pictures apart are their unmistakably socialist backdrops .
one image features models reclining in vamped-up folksy frocks against a gleaming combine harvester , while others show girls posing in front of chemical plants , industrial sites and of course , the inevitable trabants . " i worked in leipzig , and there was a limit to the backdrops available , " explained rubitzsch .
" the city was very industrial and that 's why many of the pictures were taken in front of factories or agricultural cooperatives . " " in those days , fashion photography in the west was set in exotic locations like the caribbean and so on , " he pointed out .
" obviously , we could n't match that - we had to make do with what we had , and that meant being very inventive . " sibylle woman bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gdr style , circa 1985 meanwhile , at the more sophisticated end of the market was the magazine sibylle , which took its cues less from good housekeeping and more from french vogue .
the fashion conscious woman 's style bible , its editor was dorothea melis , who later compiled the only book on gdr fashion to have been published in germany since the demise of communism .
" sibylle - fashion photography from three decades of the gdr " appeared in 1998 and flew off the shelves . dorothea melis agrees with rubitzsch . " necessity is the mother of invention , " she said .
" everyone has this idea that women in the gdr went round in aprons , headscarves and flat shoes , so i thought : i 'll show you how stylish we really were !
back then women were so much more creative than are today , they 'd take the cotton we were getting from somewhere like uzbekistan and dye or embroider it to rework classic looks we 'd seen tourists wearing , on television or in magazines from the west . " like rubitzsch , she wholeheartedly rejects the idea that fashion was a thwarted industry in the gdr .
" back then , we 'd have one editor , one photographer and two models on an average photo shoot .
we had to do everything ourselves , there was no huge team like they have today .
we 'd all have to double up .
the editor would do the girls ' make-up , the photographer would also be the driver .
it was a very intense experience . " not so exquisite " exquisit " after leaving sibylle , melis went on to work in the publicity department of the gdr 's most upmarket store " exquisit , " where most of the clothes modeled in " off the wall " would have been sold . " exquisit opened in 1970 as a deliberate attempt on the part of the party to placate the masses and make them think the gdr was n't all bad , " she said . # b # it stocked western labels such as daniel hechter and georges rech , and until the end of communism , remained the first port-of-call for any east germans wanting to treat themselves - despite a minor upset in the mid-80s when customer complaints about a range of italian shirts that had been falling apart prompted the store to reveal they were actually made from shrouds . the rest of the time , people settled with cheap imitations of western styles , with the gdr even making a point of designing its own synthetics , such as the nylon-like " dederon , " the frotte-esque " malimo , " and its piece de resistance , the extraordinarily static " präsent 20 , " specially developed for the 20th anniversary of the gdr in 1969 . " there was no scope to actually design , " said antje lond benn .
" if you wanted to put in two extra seams , add a couple of buttons or use a different fabric , you 'd always be told it was too expensive - and the best stuff was always exported to west germany anyway .

one image features models reclining in vamped-up folksy frocks against a gleaming combine harvester , while others show girls posing in front of chemical plants , industrial sites and of course , the inevitable trabants . " i worked in leipzig , and there was a limit to the backdrops available , " explained rubitzsch .
" the city was very industrial and that 's why many of the pictures were taken in front of factories or agricultural cooperatives . " " in those days , fashion photography in the west was set in exotic locations like the caribbean and so on , " he pointed out .

" sibylle - fashion photography from three decades of the gdr " appeared in 1998 and flew off the shelves . dorothea melis agrees with rubitzsch . " necessity is the mother of invention , " she said .
" everyone has this idea that women in the gdr went round in aprons , headscarves and flat shoes , so i thought : i 'll show you how stylish we really were !
back then women were so much more creative than are today , they 'd take the cotton we were getting from somewhere like uzbekistan and dye or embroider it to rework classic looks we 'd seen tourists wearing , on television or in magazines from the west . " like rubitzsch , she wholeheartedly rejects the idea that fashion was a thwarted industry in the gdr .
" back then , we 'd have one editor , one photographer and two models on an average photo shoot .
we had to do everything ourselves , there was no huge team like they have today .
we 'd all have to double up .
the editor would do the girls ' make-up , the photographer would also be the driver .
it was a very intense experience . " not so exquisite " exquisit " after leaving sibylle , melis went on to work in the publicity department of the gdr 's most upmarket store " exquisit , " where most of the clothes modeled in " off the wall " would have been sold .

ahmadinejad and bush iran and the us need to tone down their rhetoric and start showing a willingness to compromise in order to resolve the nuclear crisis diplomatically , says janet kursawe of the german institute for middle east studies . when the un security council 's ultimatum calling on iran to halt its nuclear program expires on friday , a positive outcome in the form of iran giving in to the demands is highly unlikely .
that 's not very surprising , considering that chances of success were limited from the beginning .
and since the ultimatum was not issued in the form of a resolution that 's binding in terms of international law , sanctions are not going to follow . thirty days ago , at the time the ultimatum was given , the iranian government reacted quickly by saying that it would not give in to international pressure by giving up its right to peaceful use of nuclear power .
tehran 's announcement to withdraw from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and the international atomic energy agency in case of sanctions were also predictable . what 's surprising is the escalation of the last few months .
ever since iran 's sixth president , mahmoud ahmadinejad , took office , the dynamics of conflict that the us and iran engaged in via provocative statements have made it increasingly difficult to reach a diplomatic solution . both sides seem to have found a perfect match : ahmadinejad 's piety and self-presentation , combined with excessive nationalism and a readiness to sacrifice , is the logical response to george w. bush 's sense of mission . blow n out of proportio n the demands on iran that are unique in the non-proliferation treaty 's history are insulting and offending when one considers the country 's significant sense of national pride and the fact that iran has been a member of the treaty since 1968 . the situation has paved the way to turn the right to use nuclear power into a question of national self-determination , as happened since ahmadinejad took over .
his government and radical , conservative forces of other political organs have managed to preempt all domestic and foreign policy issues in the dispute over iran 's right to use nuclear power , limiting the power of the opposition even further as a result . no one helps iran 's leader more in this respect than the us government .
while opposition voices are increasingly calling for an end to the course of confrontation and back a compromise and even a temporary halt to uranium enrichment , their power and ability to act is extremely limited . a deteriorating political climate and increasing human rights abuses are a consequence of iran 's growing isolation .
should the isolation continue , the conservative , radical establishment will consolidate its political power even further and lead to a militarization of domestic and foreign policies . mutual suspicio n s preve n t solutio n iran is still a long way from being able to produce nuclear weapons .
should the conflict continue , the government is certain to increase its efforts in the field of nuclear research and will use them to raise its deterrent potential .
ahmadinejad 's propagandistic remarks during military exercises at the beginning of april served the same purpose . mutual suspicion and alternating threats between the us and iran are currently the biggest hindrances to a diplomatic solution .
iran feels threatened because of us military presence in its immediate vicinity and because of washington 's assurances that it wants to bring about a regime change in tehran .
the fact that israel feels threatened - and exercises pressure on the us - because of ahmadinejad 's anti-semitic remarks also contributes to the dynamics of escalation . the current insistence on refusing to compromise could lead to a decision to push the military option .
any military action - even a limited one that only aims to destroy nuclear plants - will have fatal security consequences for the region in the long run . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : janet kursawe instead , people should consider rethinking a russian proposal that was outright rejected by the us administration .
moscow suggested that the iranian nuclear program should continue outside the country with russia 's technological help .
in order for this to happen , however , all sides would have to work towards de-escalating the situation and the us government would have to be willing to sit down and negotiate with iran . janet kursawe is an ethnologist , political scientist and psychologist .

tehran 's decision to ignore a un ultimatum to freeze its nuclear enrichment work was described as irresponsible and a slap in the face of the international community . in the search for solutions to the standoff , wolfgang gerhardt , a foreign policy expert from the opposition liberal free democrats , said russia and china must play a more pro-active role now .

" iran must be made to understand that it can not defy demands by the international community without punishment . " military actio n u n likely as the conflict is heating up , the prospect of a military confrontation is looming ever larger .

he added that he is rather pessimistic about a positive outcome of the conflict . " people say the conflict will develop similar to what we saw in iraq , " klose said .

" public anger in germany about the mullah regime in tehran has been fuelled recently after ahamadinejad said he wanted to visit germany to attend one of iran 's world cup soccer matches this summer .

with not a mao jacket or red scarf in sight , it showcases vintage chic straight out of " barbarella . "
realistic it is n't .

" what are we supposed to do when we hear the same thing every day ?
we start looking for other markets .
when we continually hear the same thing , we perceive this as a threat to limit our admittance to the market and we begin to look for other outlets , " the russian leader said . putin said russia had no wish to cut back on supplies of energy to countries in europe - they depend overall on russia for around one-fourth of their natural gas supplies and a large share of oil supplies - and stressed that moscow had always been a reliable supplier independent of politics . " we have worked well with you for many years , even when there was the cold war . ...

" we are being blocked to the north , the south and the west on any pretext .
we have to find outlets , to fit into the global development process , " putin said wednesday hours before greeting merkel . by way of example he cited reports that the british government had recently considered modifying anti-monopoly legislation in such a way as to prevent gazprom from buying centrica , britain 's biggest household gas supplier . british prime minister tony blair ruled out any move to block the takeover , the daily financial times reported wednesday , sparking a surge in centrica 's share price . putin said gazprom had never intended to buy the company anyway .

" we are constantly hearing about some threat of dependence on russia , that something must be done to limit the entry of russian companies into the european market , " putin said at a joint news conference with german chancellor angela merkel after two days of talks focused on energy . " what are we supposed to do when we hear the same thing every day ?
we start looking for other markets .
when we continually hear the same thing , we perceive this as a threat to limit our admittance to the market and we begin to look for other outlets , " the russian leader said . putin said russia had no wish to cut back on supplies of energy to countries in europe - they depend overall on russia for around one-fourth of their natural gas supplies and a large share of oil supplies - and stressed that moscow had always been a reliable supplier independent of politics . " we have worked well with you for many years , even when there was the cold war . ...

" we are being blocked to the north , the south and the west on any pretext .
we have to find outlets , to fit into the global development process , " putin said wednesday hours before greeting merkel . by way of example he cited reports that the british government had recently considered modifying anti-monopoly legislation in such a way as to prevent gazprom from buying centrica , britain 's biggest household gas supplier . british prime minister tony blair ruled out any move to block the takeover , the daily financial times reported wednesday , sparking a surge in centrica 's share price . putin said gazprom had never intended to buy the company anyway .

why would this be so dangerous ?
the aspen 's institute jeffrey gedmin offers answers . the us and the european union share nearly identical views .
teheran says it wants nuclear power for peaceful purposes .
no one believes the mullahs .
iran should have enough oil and gas to take care of its energy needs for several hundred years .
there are other reasons to believe that the government in teheran is lying .
iran played cat and mouse with the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- for 18 years .
we expect the iaea to issue iran yet another rebuke this friday . still , why should iran not have the bomb ?
after all , india , pakistan and israel are all nuclear powers , right ?
if you follow this logic - and cast aside for a moment the fact that by signing the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- iran has pledged not to acquire nuclear weapons - then you had better ponder the following . setti n g off a n uclear arms race ? first , when iran gets the bomb , be prepared for a nuclear arms race .
saudi arabia , egypt and turkey -lrb- perhaps syria , algeria and eventually iraq -rrb- would all find it hard to understand that they do not enjoy the right to a nuclear option .
this is presumably a principal reason why -lrb- former german foreign minister -rrb- joschka fischer once described the thought of iran with the bomb as one of the worst imaginable nightmares . second , imagine an emboldened iran meddling to an even greater extent in iraq and afghanistan .
the mullahs may have an interest in stability in both countries ; but most surely not in democracy and pro-western governments .
expect more dead americans -lrb- and germans -rrb- in the short-term . third , bet on significantly higher oil prices , says henry sokolksi , director of the nonproliferation policy education center in washington .
a nuclear iran may feel tempted to intimidate saudi arabia -lrb- which has the world 's largest oil production capacity -rrb- , according to sokolski , or perhaps even threaten the freedom of the seas to manipulate oil prices dramatically upward . more terrorism to come ? fourth , get used to more terrorism .
iran remains a prominent supporter of palestinian terror , of course .

why would this be so dangerous ?
the aspen 's institute jeffrey gedmin offers answers . the us and the european union share nearly identical views .
teheran says it wants nuclear power for peaceful purposes .
no one believes the mullahs .
iran should have enough oil and gas to take care of its energy needs for several hundred years .
there are other reasons to believe that the government in teheran is lying .
iran played cat and mouse with the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- for 18 years .
we expect the iaea to issue iran yet another rebuke this friday . still , why should iran not have the bomb ?
after all , india , pakistan and israel are all nuclear powers , right ?
if you follow this logic - and cast aside for a moment the fact that by signing the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- iran has pledged not to acquire nuclear weapons - then you had better ponder the following . setti n g off a n uclear arms race ? first , when iran gets the bomb , be prepared for a nuclear arms race .
saudi arabia , egypt and turkey -lrb- perhaps syria , algeria and eventually iraq -rrb- would all find it hard to understand that they do not enjoy the right to a nuclear option .
this is presumably a principal reason why -lrb- former german foreign minister -rrb- joschka fischer once described the thought of iran with the bomb as one of the worst imaginable nightmares . second , imagine an emboldened iran meddling to an even greater extent in iraq and afghanistan .
the mullahs may have an interest in stability in both countries ; but most surely not in democracy and pro-western governments .
expect more dead americans -lrb- and germans -rrb- in the short-term . third , bet on significantly higher oil prices , says henry sokolksi , director of the nonproliferation policy education center in washington .
a nuclear iran may feel tempted to intimidate saudi arabia -lrb- which has the world 's largest oil production capacity -rrb- , according to sokolski , or perhaps even threaten the freedom of the seas to manipulate oil prices dramatically upward . more terrorism to come ? fourth , get used to more terrorism .
iran remains a prominent supporter of palestinian terror , of course .

why would this be so dangerous ?
the aspen 's institute jeffrey gedmin offers answers . the us and the european union share nearly identical views .
teheran says it wants nuclear power for peaceful purposes .
no one believes the mullahs .
iran should have enough oil and gas to take care of its energy needs for several hundred years .
there are other reasons to believe that the government in teheran is lying .
iran played cat and mouse with the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- for 18 years .
we expect the iaea to issue iran yet another rebuke this friday . still , why should iran not have the bomb ?
after all , india , pakistan and israel are all nuclear powers , right ?
if you follow this logic - and cast aside for a moment the fact that by signing the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- iran has pledged not to acquire nuclear weapons - then you had better ponder the following . setti n g off a n uclear arms race ? first , when iran gets the bomb , be prepared for a nuclear arms race .
saudi arabia , egypt and turkey -lrb- perhaps syria , algeria and eventually iraq -rrb- would all find it hard to understand that they do not enjoy the right to a nuclear option .
this is presumably a principal reason why -lrb- former german foreign minister -rrb- joschka fischer once described the thought of iran with the bomb as one of the worst imaginable nightmares . second , imagine an emboldened iran meddling to an even greater extent in iraq and afghanistan .
the mullahs may have an interest in stability in both countries ; but most surely not in democracy and pro-western governments .
expect more dead americans -lrb- and germans -rrb- in the short-term . third , bet on significantly higher oil prices , says henry sokolksi , director of the nonproliferation policy education center in washington .
a nuclear iran may feel tempted to intimidate saudi arabia -lrb- which has the world 's largest oil production capacity -rrb- , according to sokolski , or perhaps even threaten the freedom of the seas to manipulate oil prices dramatically upward . more terrorism to come ? fourth , get used to more terrorism .
iran remains a prominent supporter of palestinian terror , of course .
but the iranian regime has also struck targets in europe in the 1980s and 1990s .
there is evidence , moreover , that as recently as 2004 the iranians sought to assist terrorist groups in identify targets in the united states . one feeble excuse made on behalf of the iranian regime is that iran has legitimate security concerns : it feels threatened by the us presence in iraq and afghanistan .
but then iran had been busy pursuing its bomb long before the united states ever had troops in either country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeffrey gedmin iran 's leaders say ahmadineejad wants to wipe israel off the map .
the mullahs say they want to be a regional hegemonic power .
the iranian president also says iran wants more .
ahmadineejad talks of the rising islamic " superpower " and a coming " clash of civilizations . "
where insanity meets modern technology , there is surely reason for concern . jeffrey gedmi n is director of the aspe n i n stitute berli n send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel , putin hail gas deal , disagree on iran concluding their two-day summit in siberia , russian and german leaders saw the signing of a major joint venture between companies from both countries to develop a natural gas field .
they failed to agree on iran .
-lrb- april 27 , 2006 -rrb- un nuclear report expected to be bad news for iran , world un nuclear chief mohamed elbaradei is expected to report friday that iran has failed to meet a un deadline to stop enriching uranium , opening the door to possible sanctions against the islamic republic .

this is presumably a principal reason why -lrb- former german foreign minister -rrb- joschka fischer once described the thought of iran with the bomb as one of the worst imaginable nightmares . second , imagine an emboldened iran meddling to an even greater extent in iraq and afghanistan .
the mullahs may have an interest in stability in both countries ; but most surely not in democracy and pro-western governments .
expect more dead americans -lrb- and germans -rrb- in the short-term . third , bet on significantly higher oil prices , says henry sokolksi , director of the nonproliferation policy education center in washington .
a nuclear iran may feel tempted to intimidate saudi arabia -lrb- which has the world 's largest oil production capacity -rrb- , according to sokolski , or perhaps even threaten the freedom of the seas to manipulate oil prices dramatically upward . more terrorism to come ? fourth , get used to more terrorism .
iran remains a prominent supporter of palestinian terror , of course .
but the iranian regime has also struck targets in europe in the 1980s and 1990s .
there is evidence , moreover , that as recently as 2004 the iranians sought to assist terrorist groups in identify targets in the united states . one feeble excuse made on behalf of the iranian regime is that iran has legitimate security concerns : it feels threatened by the us presence in iraq and afghanistan .
but then iran had been busy pursuing its bomb long before the united states ever had troops in either country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeffrey gedmin iran 's leaders say ahmadineejad wants to wipe israel off the map .
the mullahs say they want to be a regional hegemonic power .
the iranian president also says iran wants more .
ahmadineejad talks of the rising islamic " superpower " and a coming " clash of civilizations . "
where insanity meets modern technology , there is surely reason for concern . jeffrey gedmi n is director of the aspe n i n stitute berli n send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel , putin hail gas deal , disagree on iran concluding their two-day summit in siberia , russian and german leaders saw the signing of a major joint venture between companies from both countries to develop a natural gas field .

ahmadinejad and bush iran and the us need to tone down their rhetoric and start showing a willingness to compromise in order to resolve the nuclear crisis diplomatically , says janet kursawe of the german institute for middle east studies . when the un security council 's ultimatum calling on iran to halt its nuclear program expires on friday , a positive outcome in the form of iran giving in to the demands is highly unlikely .
that 's not very surprising , considering that chances of success were limited from the beginning .
and since the ultimatum was not issued in the form of a resolution that 's binding in terms of international law , sanctions are not going to follow . thirty days ago , at the time the ultimatum was given , the iranian government reacted quickly by saying that it would not give in to international pressure by giving up its right to peaceful use of nuclear power .
tehran 's announcement to withdraw from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and the international atomic energy agency in case of sanctions were also predictable . what 's surprising is the escalation of the last few months .
ever since iran 's sixth president , mahmoud ahmadinejad , took office , the dynamics of conflict that the us and iran engaged in via provocative statements have made it increasingly difficult to reach a diplomatic solution . both sides seem to have found a perfect match : ahmadinejad 's piety and self-presentation , combined with excessive nationalism and a readiness to sacrifice , is the logical response to george w. bush 's sense of mission . blow n out of proportio n the demands on iran that are unique in the non-proliferation treaty 's history are insulting and offending when one considers the country 's significant sense of national pride and the fact that iran has been a member of the treaty since 1968 . the situation has paved the way to turn the right to use nuclear power into a question of national self-determination , as happened since ahmadinejad took over .
his government and radical , conservative forces of other political organs have managed to preempt all domestic and foreign policy issues in the dispute over iran 's right to use nuclear power , limiting the power of the opposition even further as a result . no one helps iran 's leader more in this respect than the us government .
while opposition voices are increasingly calling for an end to the course of confrontation and back a compromise and even a temporary halt to uranium enrichment , their power and ability to act is extremely limited . a deteriorating political climate and increasing human rights abuses are a consequence of iran 's growing isolation .
should the isolation continue , the conservative , radical establishment will consolidate its political power even further and lead to a militarization of domestic and foreign policies . mutual suspicio n s preve n t solutio n iran is still a long way from being able to produce nuclear weapons .
should the conflict continue , the government is certain to increase its efforts in the field of nuclear research and will use them to raise its deterrent potential .
ahmadinejad 's propagandistic remarks during military exercises at the beginning of april served the same purpose . mutual suspicion and alternating threats between the us and iran are currently the biggest hindrances to a diplomatic solution .
iran feels threatened because of us military presence in its immediate vicinity and because of washington 's assurances that it wants to bring about a regime change in tehran .
the fact that israel feels threatened - and exercises pressure on the us - because of ahmadinejad 's anti-semitic remarks also contributes to the dynamics of escalation . the current insistence on refusing to compromise could lead to a decision to push the military option .
any military action - even a limited one that only aims to destroy nuclear plants - will have fatal security consequences for the region in the long run . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : janet kursawe instead , people should consider rethinking a russian proposal that was outright rejected by the us administration .
moscow suggested that the iranian nuclear program should continue outside the country with russia 's technological help .
in order for this to happen , however , all sides would have to work towards de-escalating the situation and the us government would have to be willing to sit down and negotiate with iran . janet kursawe is an ethnologist , political scientist and psychologist .

ahmadinejad and bush iran and the us need to tone down their rhetoric and start showing a willingness to compromise in order to resolve the nuclear crisis diplomatically , says janet kursawe of the german institute for middle east studies . when the un security council 's ultimatum calling on iran to halt its nuclear program expires on friday , a positive outcome in the form of iran giving in to the demands is highly unlikely .
that 's not very surprising , considering that chances of success were limited from the beginning .
and since the ultimatum was not issued in the form of a resolution that 's binding in terms of international law , sanctions are not going to follow . thirty days ago , at the time the ultimatum was given , the iranian government reacted quickly by saying that it would not give in to international pressure by giving up its right to peaceful use of nuclear power .
tehran 's announcement to withdraw from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and the international atomic energy agency in case of sanctions were also predictable . what 's surprising is the escalation of the last few months .
ever since iran 's sixth president , mahmoud ahmadinejad , took office , the dynamics of conflict that the us and iran engaged in via provocative statements have made it increasingly difficult to reach a diplomatic solution . both sides seem to have found a perfect match : ahmadinejad 's piety and self-presentation , combined with excessive nationalism and a readiness to sacrifice , is the logical response to george w. bush 's sense of mission . blow n out of proportio n the demands on iran that are unique in the non-proliferation treaty 's history are insulting and offending when one considers the country 's significant sense of national pride and the fact that iran has been a member of the treaty since 1968 . the situation has paved the way to turn the right to use nuclear power into a question of national self-determination , as happened since ahmadinejad took over .
his government and radical , conservative forces of other political organs have managed to preempt all domestic and foreign policy issues in the dispute over iran 's right to use nuclear power , limiting the power of the opposition even further as a result . no one helps iran 's leader more in this respect than the us government .
while opposition voices are increasingly calling for an end to the course of confrontation and back a compromise and even a temporary halt to uranium enrichment , their power and ability to act is extremely limited . a deteriorating political climate and increasing human rights abuses are a consequence of iran 's growing isolation .
should the isolation continue , the conservative , radical establishment will consolidate its political power even further and lead to a militarization of domestic and foreign policies . mutual suspicio n s preve n t solutio n iran is still a long way from being able to produce nuclear weapons .
should the conflict continue , the government is certain to increase its efforts in the field of nuclear research and will use them to raise its deterrent potential .
ahmadinejad 's propagandistic remarks during military exercises at the beginning of april served the same purpose . mutual suspicion and alternating threats between the us and iran are currently the biggest hindrances to a diplomatic solution .
iran feels threatened because of us military presence in its immediate vicinity and because of washington 's assurances that it wants to bring about a regime change in tehran .
the fact that israel feels threatened - and exercises pressure on the us - because of ahmadinejad 's anti-semitic remarks also contributes to the dynamics of escalation . the current insistence on refusing to compromise could lead to a decision to push the military option .
any military action - even a limited one that only aims to destroy nuclear plants - will have fatal security consequences for the region in the long run . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : janet kursawe instead , people should consider rethinking a russian proposal that was outright rejected by the us administration .
moscow suggested that the iranian nuclear program should continue outside the country with russia 's technological help .
in order for this to happen , however , all sides would have to work towards de-escalating the situation and the us government would have to be willing to sit down and negotiate with iran . janet kursawe is an ethnologist , political scientist and psychologist .

ukraine reiterated friday its desire to join nato despite russian qualms , after the western alliance hinted heavily that the politically troubled ex-soviet state could soon win approval for membership . during the meeting of nato foreign ministers in the bulgarian capital sofia , ukrainian foreign minister borys tarasyuk said : " ukraine 's strategy towards joining nato is irreversible . " the sofia talks were the first such contact with nato since parliamentary elections on march 26 which were widely praised as free and fair , although they have left kiev in political limbo . nato officials at the sofia talks say there is widespread support for ukraine 's bid , despite its political problems .

" the ukrainian government and the ukrainian people will have to decide whether or not this is something that they wish to pursue , " rice told reporters on the sidelines of the sofia meeting on thursday .
" and they will also have to work very hard , i think , to meet the criteria , " she added . ukrainian president viktor yushchenko has set out an ambitious pro-west agenda since coming to power in 2005 after a wave of popular protests known as the " orange revolution " that brought down a moscow-backed regime . but his party performed badly in march and has been forced into coalition talks that could bring to power either a government favoring links with europe and nato or one preferring a strong bond with russia . new dividing lines in europe ? moscow , which held sway over kiev in soviet times and maintains a strong influence over its western neighbor , meanwhile reasserted its opposition to ukraine 's nato hopes . " we are against the creation of new dividing lines in europe , " mikhail kamynin , russia 's foreign ministry spokesman , was quoted as saying in an interview with ria-novosti news agency on thursday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 28.04.2006 rediscovering fabulous fashion behind the wall a volume of photographs called " off the wall - fashion from the gdr " is a surprise hit in britain .
with not a mao jacket or red scarf in sight , it showcases vintage chic straight out of " barbarella . "
realistic it is n't . " we thought everyone in the gdr walked around in drab , dismal clothes , but suddenly we found this incredible stuff which showed there was a thriving fashion industry , " said caz hildebrand , the british art director who put the collection together . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " sibylle " - the arty face of gdr fashion but was there really ?
the photos were taken by günter rubitzsch , a leipzig-based photographer who worked regularly for women 's weeklies such as pramo -lrb- abbreviated from " praktische mode " or " practical fashion " -rrb- and für dich -lrb- " for you " -rrb- , magazines which featured sewing or knitting patterns for women who liked to make their own clothes .
and most of them had to . " everyone looked the same , so if you wanted something special you had to make it yourself , " explained antje lond benn , who studied at the technical college for clothing design in east berlin in the 1980s .
" fabrics and patterns were really cheap , and everyone would improvize with them .
and if you were lucky , you could fit into the kids ' clothes , which were heavily subsidized . " honecker 's haute couture so the groovy gdr depicted in " off the wall " might , perhaps , be a little off the mark .
but at least it scuppers a few cliches . " it 's an acknowledgment of my work , and i 'm glad it shows a different side of the gdr , " said rubitzsch .
" it proves that we were n't all impoverished and that it was possible to be creative despite the restrictions we worked with .

with not a mao jacket or red scarf in sight , it showcases vintage chic straight out of " barbarella . "
realistic it is n't . " we thought everyone in the gdr walked around in drab , dismal clothes , but suddenly we found this incredible stuff which showed there was a thriving fashion industry , " said caz hildebrand , the british art director who put the collection together . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " sibylle " - the arty face of gdr fashion but was there really ?
the photos were taken by günter rubitzsch , a leipzig-based photographer who worked regularly for women 's weeklies such as pramo -lrb- abbreviated from " praktische mode " or " practical fashion " -rrb- and für dich -lrb- " for you " -rrb- , magazines which featured sewing or knitting patterns for women who liked to make their own clothes .
and most of them had to . " everyone looked the same , so if you wanted something special you had to make it yourself , " explained antje lond benn , who studied at the technical college for clothing design in east berlin in the 1980s .
" fabrics and patterns were really cheap , and everyone would improvize with them .
and if you were lucky , you could fit into the kids ' clothes , which were heavily subsidized . " honecker 's haute couture so the groovy gdr depicted in " off the wall " might , perhaps , be a little off the mark .
but at least it scuppers a few cliches . " it 's an acknowledgment of my work , and i 'm glad it shows a different side of the gdr , " said rubitzsch .
" it proves that we were n't all impoverished and that it was possible to be creative despite the restrictions we worked with . " after the berlin wall fell , he sold the rights to his pictures to the international agency akg images - and never thought that one day , they 'd be rediscovered as high camp , communist-style . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fashion in ' sybille ' captured a mood - it did n't showcase clothes dating back to decades that taste forgot not just in east germany , what really sets his pictures apart are their unmistakably socialist backdrops .

" our aim is to limit the cost of each kilometer of maglev line to approximately 200 million yuan -lrb- $ 25 million -rrb- , " the paper quoted zhang as saying . that means the unit cost will be cut by one-third , the china daily said .
the current line cost 310 million yuan -lrb- $ 39 million -rrb- per kilometer to build . " lowering the cost of a maglev system is a significant issue in the study and construction of the shanghai-hangzhou maglev railway .
we are now confident we can achieve that , " zhang was quoted as saying . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a station worker guides a passenger near a maglev train in shanghai china currently operates the world 's only commercial maglev line , which runs 30 kilometers from shanghai 's airport to the financial center in the pudong district . the shanghai-hangzhou maglev line should be completed ahead of the 2010 world expo in shanghai , according to earlier state press reports .
planners expect to construct four stations along the route that will whisk passengers from shanghai 's international airport to hangzhou in just 26 minutes , the reports said . original designer germany 's transrapid international , a consortium between german industrial giants thyssenkrupp and siemens , is the original designer and builder of the maglev trains , which travel at up to 430 kilometers -lrb- 270 miles -rrb- per hour . transrapid has already signed a deal to be involved in the new line to hangzhou , but thursday 's report indicates its role will be scaled back compared with the service between shanghai and the airport . as in many other high-tech industries such as aerospace and autos , china is intent on developing its own technologies so as not to be reliant on foreign companies and to ensure it can cut costs . the china daily said the state council , china 's cabinet , was encouraging engineers to " learn and absorb foreign advanced technologies while making further innovations . " technology theft ? but some in germany are concerned about copyright protection , and accuse the chinese of copying technology from countries doing business there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the transrapid is the world 's only commercial magnetic-levitation train , but not for long " what 's happening in china smells suspiciously like technology theft , " said bavarian premier edmund stoiber after he learned of china 's plans to build its own maglev train .
he has suggested putting the issue of chinese development and intellectual property protections on the agenda of the next g8 meeting . the head of thyssenkrupp , ekkehard schulz , was somewhat more diplomatic .
" it appears that some chinese patents overlap quite a bit with our own , " he said . there are similar worries about technology and china being voiced across the atlantic .
former us commerce secretary donald evans made us concerns official in beijing .
he cited the example the qq mini car from china 's chery automobile co .
american carmaker general motors claims the qq is a copy of its chevrolet spark model . the chinese deny any technology plagiarism in both cases .
the china aviation industry corporation has said the new chinese " zhui feng " magnetic train is not dependent on foreign technology .
it is much lighter than the transrapid product , the company said , and features a much more advanced design . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german foreign minister to walk diplomatic tightrope in china stressing germany 's stance against lifting the eu arms embargo , talking tough on human rights and deepening business ties - foreign minister steinmeier will have his hands full when he visits china wednesday .

" we are constantly hearing about some threat of dependence on russia , that something must be done to limit the entry of russian companies into the european market , " putin said at a joint news conference with german chancellor angela merkel after two days of talks focused on energy . " what are we supposed to do when we hear the same thing every day ?
we start looking for other markets .
when we continually hear the same thing , we perceive this as a threat to limit our admittance to the market and we begin to look for other outlets , " the russian leader said . putin said russia had no wish to cut back on supplies of energy to countries in europe - they depend overall on russia for around one-fourth of their natural gas supplies and a large share of oil supplies - and stressed that moscow had always been a reliable supplier independent of politics . " we have worked well with you for many years , even when there was the cold war . ...
day after day , the soviet union delivered for its partners in europe .
what is the point of stoking fears about excessive dependence with regard to russia today ? "
putin asked . moscow 's threat to shift energy priorities east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin is looking at china and the far east for energy partners putin and other top russian officials have however stressed in recent weeks that china , japan and other huge markets in asia are increasingly hungry for russian energy supplies and have warned that moscow may shift its priority to serving those clients at the expense of european buyers . the european union , some of whose members felt disruption to their gas supplies from russia in january when moscow briefly cut shipments to ukraine amid a price dispute , has responded by telling moscow not to " politicize " energy trade . while russia 's state-run gas giant gazprom , for example , has complained of efforts to block its expansion plans in european markets , it has also flatly rejected european demands that it relax its own domestic monopoly and open excess gas pipeline capacity to foreign firms . tensions with west exacerbated by energy struggles putin 's comments were certain to heighten tensions on energy between russia - the world 's second-largest crude oil exporter and largest supplier of natural gas - and the west , which is anxious over linkage of kremlin energy strategy with political objectives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and merkel found little common ground on energy issues in comments to officials on wednesday shortly before he greeted merkel , putin complained that russia 's aims to expand in western energy markets were being systematically thwarted by " unfair competition " barriers . " we are being blocked to the north , the south and the west on any pretext .
we have to find outlets , to fit into the global development process , " putin said wednesday hours before greeting merkel . by way of example he cited reports that the british government had recently considered modifying anti-monopoly legislation in such a way as to prevent gazprom from buying centrica , britain 's biggest household gas supplier . british prime minister tony blair ruled out any move to block the takeover , the daily financial times reported wednesday , sparking a surge in centrica 's share price . putin said gazprom had never intended to buy the company anyway .
" we need to agree on the rules of the game " and those should be applied on an equal basis to all countries , he said . eu failing in bid to rein in russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to ensure the supply stays open the european union has ratcheted up pressure on russia to sign its energy charter , a document that regulates energy transport and would prohibit any signatory from disrupting contracted supplies for any reason . a top gazprom official , alexander medvedev , told participants at an economic forum in london earlier this week that the pact was " stillborn . " however , putin 's economic advisor referred to the prickly eu-russian relationship as a normal sign of a changing balance of power . " having this tension is okay , it 's a problem with any growth , " said igor shuvalov , who is also russia 's sherpa to the group of eight industrialized countries .
" russia is part of the family ; we were considered the small kid .

he has accused the cia of kidnapping him in late 2003 from macedonia and interrogating him in afghanistan . skopje has denied any involvement in the alleged operation by the us spy agency . upon arrival , the delegation met macedonian president branko crvenkovski and were due to meet deputy prime minister radmila secerinska and former foreign minister slobodan casule , the eu spokesman andrea angeli told afp news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giovanni claudio fava , european lawmaker leading cia flight probe " the target is the truth , just the truth , " the eu lawmaker leading the probe , claudio fava , told reporters after the meeting with crvenkovski . the eu deputies are scheduled to meet former interior minister siljan avramovski , his successor ljubomir mihajlovski and parliamentary speaker ljupco jordanovski on friday . earlier this year european deputies decided to set up a special committee to look into the allegations that the central intelligence agency secretly operated flights carrying prisoners it considered terror suspects which passed through eu territory . the parliament 's inquiry started in january and is expected to issue a first report next month . more than 1,000 secret cia flights have gone through european airspace and airports since 2001 without governments requesting information , fava said upon presenting a preliminary report . " it is hard to believe that the authorities and governments of certain countries were unaware of what was going on on their territory .
our probe shows that they must have known , " fava said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. col. steven f. dreyer at the air base near bucharest fava singled out sweden , italy and bosnia for particular criticism .
for more than three months , the eu parliamentary inquiry has heard testimony from alleged victims and human rights groups - all saying that european states had handed over terrorism suspects to foreign agents , and ignoring hundreds of cia flights that had used their airports .
some former detainees provided detailed accounts of alleged torture carried out in secret prisons outside eu or us jurisdiction . the eu lawmakers investigating the khalid al-masri case in macedonia want to find out how the plane with al-masri on board could leave europe unchallenged . fava believes that there were hundreds of similar incidents .
" if we look at all the testimonies we have got , it becomes very clear that these incidents were n't sporadic , but that it was a common practice .
that 's the only conclusion i can draw , " fava said . the cia declined to comment on the eu parliamentarians ' findings .
the inquiry committee has no legal powers , but it will recommend what political action should be taken against any countries found to have been involved , including the united states .
several eu lawmakers are expected to go to washington in early may to try to meet secretary of state condoleezza rice and cia chief porter goss . the european union has granted macedonia candidate status , but no date has been set to begin talks for membership in the bloc . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the cia affair and eu : who has responsiblity ?

" we are constantly hearing about some threat of dependence on russia , that something must be done to limit the entry of russian companies into the european market , " putin said at a joint news conference with german chancellor angela merkel after two days of talks focused on energy . " what are we supposed to do when we hear the same thing every day ?
we start looking for other markets .
when we continually hear the same thing , we perceive this as a threat to limit our admittance to the market and we begin to look for other outlets , " the russian leader said . putin said russia had no wish to cut back on supplies of energy to countries in europe - they depend overall on russia for around one-fourth of their natural gas supplies and a large share of oil supplies - and stressed that moscow had always been a reliable supplier independent of politics . " we have worked well with you for many years , even when there was the cold war . ...

" our aim is to limit the cost of each kilometer of maglev line to approximately 200 million yuan -lrb- $ 25 million -rrb- , " the paper quoted zhang as saying . that means the unit cost will be cut by one-third , the china daily said .
the current line cost 310 million yuan -lrb- $ 39 million -rrb- per kilometer to build . " lowering the cost of a maglev system is a significant issue in the study and construction of the shanghai-hangzhou maglev railway .
we are now confident we can achieve that , " zhang was quoted as saying . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a station worker guides a passenger near a maglev train in shanghai china currently operates the world 's only commercial maglev line , which runs 30 kilometers from shanghai 's airport to the financial center in the pudong district . the shanghai-hangzhou maglev line should be completed ahead of the 2010 world expo in shanghai , according to earlier state press reports .
planners expect to construct four stations along the route that will whisk passengers from shanghai 's international airport to hangzhou in just 26 minutes , the reports said . original designer germany 's transrapid international , a consortium between german industrial giants thyssenkrupp and siemens , is the original designer and builder of the maglev trains , which travel at up to 430 kilometers -lrb- 270 miles -rrb- per hour . transrapid has already signed a deal to be involved in the new line to hangzhou , but thursday 's report indicates its role will be scaled back compared with the service between shanghai and the airport . as in many other high-tech industries such as aerospace and autos , china is intent on developing its own technologies so as not to be reliant on foreign companies and to ensure it can cut costs . the china daily said the state council , china 's cabinet , was encouraging engineers to " learn and absorb foreign advanced technologies while making further innovations . " technology theft ? but some in germany are concerned about copyright protection , and accuse the chinese of copying technology from countries doing business there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the transrapid is the world 's only commercial magnetic-levitation train , but not for long " what 's happening in china smells suspiciously like technology theft , " said bavarian premier edmund stoiber after he learned of china 's plans to build its own maglev train .
he has suggested putting the issue of chinese development and intellectual property protections on the agenda of the next g8 meeting . the head of thyssenkrupp , ekkehard schulz , was somewhat more diplomatic .
" it appears that some chinese patents overlap quite a bit with our own , " he said . there are similar worries about technology and china being voiced across the atlantic .
former us commerce secretary donald evans made us concerns official in beijing .
he cited the example the qq mini car from china 's chery automobile co .
american carmaker general motors claims the qq is a copy of its chevrolet spark model . the chinese deny any technology plagiarism in both cases .
the china aviation industry corporation has said the new chinese " zhui feng " magnetic train is not dependent on foreign technology .
it is much lighter than the transrapid product , the company said , and features a much more advanced design . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german foreign minister to walk diplomatic tightrope in china stressing germany 's stance against lifting the eu arms embargo , talking tough on human rights and deepening business ties - foreign minister steinmeier will have his hands full when he visits china wednesday .

with not a mao jacket or red scarf in sight , it showcases vintage chic straight out of " barbarella . "
realistic it is n't . " we thought everyone in the gdr walked around in drab , dismal clothes , but suddenly we found this incredible stuff which showed there was a thriving fashion industry , " said caz hildebrand , the british art director who put the collection together . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " sibylle " - the arty face of gdr fashion but was there really ?
the photos were taken by günter rubitzsch , a leipzig-based photographer who worked regularly for women 's weeklies such as pramo -lrb- abbreviated from " praktische mode " or " practical fashion " -rrb- and für dich -lrb- " for you " -rrb- , magazines which featured sewing or knitting patterns for women who liked to make their own clothes .
and most of them had to . " everyone looked the same , so if you wanted something special you had to make it yourself , " explained antje lond benn , who studied at the technical college for clothing design in east berlin in the 1980s .
" fabrics and patterns were really cheap , and everyone would improvize with them .
and if you were lucky , you could fit into the kids ' clothes , which were heavily subsidized . " honecker 's haute couture so the groovy gdr depicted in " off the wall " might , perhaps , be a little off the mark .
but at least it scuppers a few cliches . " it 's an acknowledgment of my work , and i 'm glad it shows a different side of the gdr , " said rubitzsch .
" it proves that we were n't all impoverished and that it was possible to be creative despite the restrictions we worked with . " after the berlin wall fell , he sold the rights to his pictures to the international agency akg images - and never thought that one day , they 'd be rediscovered as high camp , communist-style . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fashion in ' sybille ' captured a mood - it did n't showcase clothes dating back to decades that taste forgot not just in east germany , what really sets his pictures apart are their unmistakably socialist backdrops .
one image features models reclining in vamped-up folksy frocks against a gleaming combine harvester , while others show girls posing in front of chemical plants , industrial sites and of course , the inevitable trabants . " i worked in leipzig , and there was a limit to the backdrops available , " explained rubitzsch .
" the city was very industrial and that 's why many of the pictures were taken in front of factories or agricultural cooperatives . " " in those days , fashion photography in the west was set in exotic locations like the caribbean and so on , " he pointed out .
" obviously , we could n't match that - we had to make do with what we had , and that meant being very inventive . " sibylle woman bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gdr style , circa 1985 meanwhile , at the more sophisticated end of the market was the magazine sibylle , which took its cues less from good housekeeping and more from french vogue .
the fashion conscious woman 's style bible , its editor was dorothea melis , who later compiled the only book on gdr fashion to have been published in germany since the demise of communism .
" sibylle - fashion photography from three decades of the gdr " appeared in 1998 and flew off the shelves . dorothea melis agrees with rubitzsch . " necessity is the mother of invention , " she said .
" everyone has this idea that women in the gdr went round in aprons , headscarves and flat shoes , so i thought : i 'll show you how stylish we really were !
back then women were so much more creative than are today , they 'd take the cotton we were getting from somewhere like uzbekistan and dye or embroider it to rework classic looks we 'd seen tourists wearing , on television or in magazines from the west . " like rubitzsch , she wholeheartedly rejects the idea that fashion was a thwarted industry in the gdr .
" back then , we 'd have one editor , one photographer and two models on an average photo shoot .
we had to do everything ourselves , there was no huge team like they have today .
we 'd all have to double up .
the editor would do the girls ' make-up , the photographer would also be the driver .
it was a very intense experience . " not so exquisite " exquisit " after leaving sibylle , melis went on to work in the publicity department of the gdr 's most upmarket store " exquisit , " where most of the clothes modeled in " off the wall " would have been sold . " exquisit opened in 1970 as a deliberate attempt on the part of the party to placate the masses and make them think the gdr was n't all bad , " she said . # b # it stocked western labels such as daniel hechter and georges rech , and until the end of communism , remained the first port-of-call for any east germans wanting to treat themselves - despite a minor upset in the mid-80s when customer complaints about a range of italian shirts that had been falling apart prompted the store to reveal they were actually made from shrouds . the rest of the time , people settled with cheap imitations of western styles , with the gdr even making a point of designing its own synthetics , such as the nylon-like " dederon , " the frotte-esque " malimo , " and its piece de resistance , the extraordinarily static " präsent 20 , " specially developed for the 20th anniversary of the gdr in 1969 . " there was no scope to actually design , " said antje lond benn .
" if you wanted to put in two extra seams , add a couple of buttons or use a different fabric , you 'd always be told it was too expensive - and the best stuff was always exported to west germany anyway .

tehran 's decision to ignore a un ultimatum to freeze its nuclear enrichment work was described as irresponsible and a slap in the face of the international community . in the search for solutions to the standoff , wolfgang gerhardt , a foreign policy expert from the opposition liberal free democrats , said russia and china must play a more pro-active role now . " we can only stop tehran if russia and china come to realize that they can no longer stand on the sidelines in this dispute , " he said .
" within the next few days it is crucial that these countries drive home to iran that it will definitely face punitive action if it continues down this path of confrontation . " ingo friedrich , a member of the conservative csu party also believes that moscow and beijing must now come forward to step up international pressure on iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
he thinks that efforts within the united nations aimed at imposing sanctions must be intensified . " it is now a matter of credibility for the united nations to impose sanctions , " he said .
" iran must be made to understand that it can not defy demands by the international community without punishment . " military actio n u n likely as the conflict is heating up , the prospect of a military confrontation is looming ever larger .
washington has n't ruled out the use of military force to stop iran building nuclear weapons . but ullrich klose , foreign policy spokesman of the social democrats said he believes this is just empty rhetoric .
he added that he is rather pessimistic about a positive outcome of the conflict . " people say the conflict will develop similar to what we saw in iraq , " klose said .
" i do n't think this will happen because the united states have had a bad time of it there and a war with iran would overstretch the country 's capabilities .
so in the end we 'll either have a political solution or face the situation that iran continues its nuclear program unfazed . " public anger in germany about the mullah regime in tehran has been fuelled recently after ahamadinejad said he wanted to visit germany to attend one of iran 's world cup soccer matches this summer .
german politicians such as csu leader edmund stoiber have vowed to do everything in their power to prevent that .

tehran 's decision to ignore a un ultimatum to freeze its nuclear enrichment work was described as irresponsible and a slap in the face of the international community . in the search for solutions to the standoff , wolfgang gerhardt , a foreign policy expert from the opposition liberal free democrats , said russia and china must play a more pro-active role now .

ahmadinejad and bush iran and the us need to tone down their rhetoric and start showing a willingness to compromise in order to resolve the nuclear crisis diplomatically , says janet kursawe of the german institute for middle east studies . when the un security council 's ultimatum calling on iran to halt its nuclear program expires on friday , a positive outcome in the form of iran giving in to the demands is highly unlikely .
that 's not very surprising , considering that chances of success were limited from the beginning .
and since the ultimatum was not issued in the form of a resolution that 's binding in terms of international law , sanctions are not going to follow . thirty days ago , at the time the ultimatum was given , the iranian government reacted quickly by saying that it would not give in to international pressure by giving up its right to peaceful use of nuclear power .
tehran 's announcement to withdraw from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and the international atomic energy agency in case of sanctions were also predictable . what 's surprising is the escalation of the last few months .
ever since iran 's sixth president , mahmoud ahmadinejad , took office , the dynamics of conflict that the us and iran engaged in via provocative statements have made it increasingly difficult to reach a diplomatic solution . both sides seem to have found a perfect match : ahmadinejad 's piety and self-presentation , combined with excessive nationalism and a readiness to sacrifice , is the logical response to george w. bush 's sense of mission . blow n out of proportio n the demands on iran that are unique in the non-proliferation treaty 's history are insulting and offending when one considers the country 's significant sense of national pride and the fact that iran has been a member of the treaty since 1968 . the situation has paved the way to turn the right to use nuclear power into a question of national self-determination , as happened since ahmadinejad took over .
his government and radical , conservative forces of other political organs have managed to preempt all domestic and foreign policy issues in the dispute over iran 's right to use nuclear power , limiting the power of the opposition even further as a result . no one helps iran 's leader more in this respect than the us government .
while opposition voices are increasingly calling for an end to the course of confrontation and back a compromise and even a temporary halt to uranium enrichment , their power and ability to act is extremely limited . a deteriorating political climate and increasing human rights abuses are a consequence of iran 's growing isolation .
should the isolation continue , the conservative , radical establishment will consolidate its political power even further and lead to a militarization of domestic and foreign policies . mutual suspicio n s preve n t solutio n iran is still a long way from being able to produce nuclear weapons .
should the conflict continue , the government is certain to increase its efforts in the field of nuclear research and will use them to raise its deterrent potential .
ahmadinejad 's propagandistic remarks during military exercises at the beginning of april served the same purpose . mutual suspicion and alternating threats between the us and iran are currently the biggest hindrances to a diplomatic solution .
iran feels threatened because of us military presence in its immediate vicinity and because of washington 's assurances that it wants to bring about a regime change in tehran .
the fact that israel feels threatened - and exercises pressure on the us - because of ahmadinejad 's anti-semitic remarks also contributes to the dynamics of escalation . the current insistence on refusing to compromise could lead to a decision to push the military option .
any military action - even a limited one that only aims to destroy nuclear plants - will have fatal security consequences for the region in the long run . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : janet kursawe instead , people should consider rethinking a russian proposal that was outright rejected by the us administration .
moscow suggested that the iranian nuclear program should continue outside the country with russia 's technological help .
in order for this to happen , however , all sides would have to work towards de-escalating the situation and the us government would have to be willing to sit down and negotiate with iran . janet kursawe is an ethnologist , political scientist and psychologist .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.04.2006 putin : russia threatened by europe 's energy demands großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin threatens to take his massive energy resources elsewhere russia feels threatened by european union moves to curtail its role in europe 's energy markets and has no choice but to seek other buyers , president vladimir putin said thursday . " we are constantly hearing about some threat of dependence on russia , that something must be done to limit the entry of russian companies into the european market , " putin said at a joint news conference with german chancellor angela merkel after two days of talks focused on energy . " what are we supposed to do when we hear the same thing every day ?
we start looking for other markets .
when we continually hear the same thing , we perceive this as a threat to limit our admittance to the market and we begin to look for other outlets , " the russian leader said . putin said russia had no wish to cut back on supplies of energy to countries in europe - they depend overall on russia for around one-fourth of their natural gas supplies and a large share of oil supplies - and stressed that moscow had always been a reliable supplier independent of politics . " we have worked well with you for many years , even when there was the cold war . ...
day after day , the soviet union delivered for its partners in europe .
what is the point of stoking fears about excessive dependence with regard to russia today ? "
putin asked . moscow 's threat to shift energy priorities east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin is looking at china and the far east for energy partners putin and other top russian officials have however stressed in recent weeks that china , japan and other huge markets in asia are increasingly hungry for russian energy supplies and have warned that moscow may shift its priority to serving those clients at the expense of european buyers . the european union , some of whose members felt disruption to their gas supplies from russia in january when moscow briefly cut shipments to ukraine amid a price dispute , has responded by telling moscow not to " politicize " energy trade . while russia 's state-run gas giant gazprom , for example , has complained of efforts to block its expansion plans in european markets , it has also flatly rejected european demands that it relax its own domestic monopoly and open excess gas pipeline capacity to foreign firms . tensions with west exacerbated by energy struggles putin 's comments were certain to heighten tensions on energy between russia - the world 's second-largest crude oil exporter and largest supplier of natural gas - and the west , which is anxious over linkage of kremlin energy strategy with political objectives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and merkel found little common ground on energy issues in comments to officials on wednesday shortly before he greeted merkel , putin complained that russia 's aims to expand in western energy markets were being systematically thwarted by " unfair competition " barriers . " we are being blocked to the north , the south and the west on any pretext .
we have to find outlets , to fit into the global development process , " putin said wednesday hours before greeting merkel . by way of example he cited reports that the british government had recently considered modifying anti-monopoly legislation in such a way as to prevent gazprom from buying centrica , britain 's biggest household gas supplier . british prime minister tony blair ruled out any move to block the takeover , the daily financial times reported wednesday , sparking a surge in centrica 's share price . putin said gazprom had never intended to buy the company anyway .
" we need to agree on the rules of the game " and those should be applied on an equal basis to all countries , he said . eu failing in bid to rein in russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to ensure the supply stays open the european union has ratcheted up pressure on russia to sign its energy charter , a document that regulates energy transport and would prohibit any signatory from disrupting contracted supplies for any reason . a top gazprom official , alexander medvedev , told participants at an economic forum in london earlier this week that the pact was " stillborn . " however , putin 's economic advisor referred to the prickly eu-russian relationship as a normal sign of a changing balance of power . " having this tension is okay , it 's a problem with any growth , " said igor shuvalov , who is also russia 's sherpa to the group of eight industrialized countries .
" russia is part of the family ; we were considered the small kid .
now we are growing and we raise our voice , " he added . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel , putin hail gas deal , disagree on iran concluding their two-day summit in siberia , russian and german leaders saw the signing of a major joint venture between companies from both countries to develop a natural gas field .

we start looking for other markets .
when we continually hear the same thing , we perceive this as a threat to limit our admittance to the market and we begin to look for other outlets , " the russian leader said . putin said russia had no wish to cut back on supplies of energy to countries in europe - they depend overall on russia for around one-fourth of their natural gas supplies and a large share of oil supplies - and stressed that moscow had always been a reliable supplier independent of politics .

ukraine reiterated friday its desire to join nato despite russian qualms , after the western alliance hinted heavily that the politically troubled ex-soviet state could soon win approval for membership . during the meeting of nato foreign ministers in the bulgarian capital sofia , ukrainian foreign minister borys tarasyuk said : " ukraine 's strategy towards joining nato is irreversible . " the sofia talks were the first such contact with nato since parliamentary elections on march 26 which were widely praised as free and fair , although they have left kiev in political limbo . nato officials at the sofia talks say there is widespread support for ukraine 's bid , despite its political problems .
speaking on thursday , nato head jaap de hoop scheffer hinted there could be an opening to aspiring members at a summit in the latvian capital in november . " i have no doubt that in riga , countries aspiring to nato membership will want a signal .
there will be a signal at riga , " de hoop scheffer said .

" the ukrainian government and the ukrainian people will have to decide whether or not this is something that they wish to pursue , " rice told reporters on the sidelines of the sofia meeting on thursday .
" and they will also have to work very hard , i think , to meet the criteria , " she added . ukrainian president viktor yushchenko has set out an ambitious pro-west agenda since coming to power in 2005 after a wave of popular protests known as the " orange revolution " that brought down a moscow-backed regime . but his party performed badly in march and has been forced into coalition talks that could bring to power either a government favoring links with europe and nato or one preferring a strong bond with russia . new dividing lines in europe ? moscow , which held sway over kiev in soviet times and maintains a strong influence over its western neighbor , meanwhile reasserted its opposition to ukraine 's nato hopes . " we are against the creation of new dividing lines in europe , " mikhail kamynin , russia 's foreign ministry spokesman , was quoted as saying in an interview with ria-novosti news agency on thursday . " today there are algorithms of cooperation with nato that allow states to cooperate in the widest security spectrum without formal accession to the alliance , " kamynin said . nato sending ukraine mixed signals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato foreign ministers meeting at the national palace of culture in sofia but nato on thursday appeared to play down reports that ukraine could be offered the alliance 's " membership action plan " , the key step before being invited to join . " ukraine 's aspirations to join the alliance are welcomed by all allies , " nato spokesman james appathurai told reporters in sofia .
" what i can not predict is timelines for membership action plans , " he added . albania , croatia and macedonia are currently in the membership action plan with the north atlantic treaty organisation -lrb- nato -rrb- . ten countries that were once allied with russia - bulgaria , czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , poland , romania , slovakia and slovenia - have joined nato since 1999 . also on friday , during a sideline meeting , u.s. secretary of state condoleezza rice signed a bilateral agreement with bulgarian officials to establish three military bases in the country as the u.s. shifts troops from old cold war positions to smaller units closer to the middle east and africa . nato boosts darfur aid moving from the european to the african continent during talks in sofia , nato has said it is ready to boost assistance in sudan 's violence-scarred darfur region .
the alliance has said it will increase logistical support , but said any presence should be limited and only in support of african or u.n. efforts . in nato 's first operation on the african continent , the alliance has provided training and transportation to african union troops trying to stem the violence there .

" our aim is to limit the cost of each kilometer of maglev line to approximately 200 million yuan -lrb- $ 25 million -rrb- , " the paper quoted zhang as saying . that means the unit cost will be cut by one-third , the china daily said .
the current line cost 310 million yuan -lrb- $ 39 million -rrb- per kilometer to build . " lowering the cost of a maglev system is a significant issue in the study and construction of the shanghai-hangzhou maglev railway .
we are now confident we can achieve that , " zhang was quoted as saying . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a station worker guides a passenger near a maglev train in shanghai china currently operates the world 's only commercial maglev line , which runs 30 kilometers from shanghai 's airport to the financial center in the pudong district . the shanghai-hangzhou maglev line should be completed ahead of the 2010 world expo in shanghai , according to earlier state press reports .
planners expect to construct four stations along the route that will whisk passengers from shanghai 's international airport to hangzhou in just 26 minutes , the reports said . original designer germany 's transrapid international , a consortium between german industrial giants thyssenkrupp and siemens , is the original designer and builder of the maglev trains , which travel at up to 430 kilometers -lrb- 270 miles -rrb- per hour . transrapid has already signed a deal to be involved in the new line to hangzhou , but thursday 's report indicates its role will be scaled back compared with the service between shanghai and the airport . as in many other high-tech industries such as aerospace and autos , china is intent on developing its own technologies so as not to be reliant on foreign companies and to ensure it can cut costs . the china daily said the state council , china 's cabinet , was encouraging engineers to " learn and absorb foreign advanced technologies while making further innovations . " technology theft ? but some in germany are concerned about copyright protection , and accuse the chinese of copying technology from countries doing business there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the transrapid is the world 's only commercial magnetic-levitation train , but not for long " what 's happening in china smells suspiciously like technology theft , " said bavarian premier edmund stoiber after he learned of china 's plans to build its own maglev train .
he has suggested putting the issue of chinese development and intellectual property protections on the agenda of the next g8 meeting . the head of thyssenkrupp , ekkehard schulz , was somewhat more diplomatic .
" it appears that some chinese patents overlap quite a bit with our own , " he said . there are similar worries about technology and china being voiced across the atlantic .
former us commerce secretary donald evans made us concerns official in beijing .
he cited the example the qq mini car from china 's chery automobile co .
american carmaker general motors claims the qq is a copy of its chevrolet spark model . the chinese deny any technology plagiarism in both cases .
the china aviation industry corporation has said the new chinese " zhui feng " magnetic train is not dependent on foreign technology .

" our aim is to limit the cost of each kilometer of maglev line to approximately 200 million yuan -lrb- $ 25 million -rrb- , " the paper quoted zhang as saying . that means the unit cost will be cut by one-third , the china daily said .
the current line cost 310 million yuan -lrb- $ 39 million -rrb- per kilometer to build . " lowering the cost of a maglev system is a significant issue in the study and construction of the shanghai-hangzhou maglev railway .
we are now confident we can achieve that , " zhang was quoted as saying . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a station worker guides a passenger near a maglev train in shanghai china currently operates the world 's only commercial maglev line , which runs 30 kilometers from shanghai 's airport to the financial center in the pudong district . the shanghai-hangzhou maglev line should be completed ahead of the 2010 world expo in shanghai , according to earlier state press reports .
planners expect to construct four stations along the route that will whisk passengers from shanghai 's international airport to hangzhou in just 26 minutes , the reports said . original designer germany 's transrapid international , a consortium between german industrial giants thyssenkrupp and siemens , is the original designer and builder of the maglev trains , which travel at up to 430 kilometers -lrb- 270 miles -rrb- per hour . transrapid has already signed a deal to be involved in the new line to hangzhou , but thursday 's report indicates its role will be scaled back compared with the service between shanghai and the airport . as in many other high-tech industries such as aerospace and autos , china is intent on developing its own technologies so as not to be reliant on foreign companies and to ensure it can cut costs . the china daily said the state council , china 's cabinet , was encouraging engineers to " learn and absorb foreign advanced technologies while making further innovations .

he has suggested putting the issue of chinese development and intellectual property protections on the agenda of the next g8 meeting . the head of thyssenkrupp , ekkehard schulz , was somewhat more diplomatic .
" it appears that some chinese patents overlap quite a bit with our own , " he said . there are similar worries about technology and china being voiced across the atlantic .

planners expect to construct four stations along the route that will whisk passengers from shanghai 's international airport to hangzhou in just 26 minutes , the reports said . original designer germany 's transrapid international , a consortium between german industrial giants thyssenkrupp and siemens , is the original designer and builder of the maglev trains , which travel at up to 430 kilometers -lrb- 270 miles -rrb- per hour . transrapid has already signed a deal to be involved in the new line to hangzhou , but thursday 's report indicates its role will be scaled back compared with the service between shanghai and the airport . as in many other high-tech industries such as aerospace and autos , china is intent on developing its own technologies so as not to be reliant on foreign companies and to ensure it can cut costs . the china daily said the state council , china 's cabinet , was encouraging engineers to " learn and absorb foreign advanced technologies while making further innovations . " technology theft ? but some in germany are concerned about copyright protection , and accuse the chinese of copying technology from countries doing business there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the transrapid is the world 's only commercial magnetic-levitation train , but not for long " what 's happening in china smells suspiciously like technology theft , " said bavarian premier edmund stoiber after he learned of china 's plans to build its own maglev train .
he has suggested putting the issue of chinese development and intellectual property protections on the agenda of the next g8 meeting . the head of thyssenkrupp , ekkehard schulz , was somewhat more diplomatic .
" it appears that some chinese patents overlap quite a bit with our own , " he said . there are similar worries about technology and china being voiced across the atlantic .
former us commerce secretary donald evans made us concerns official in beijing .
he cited the example the qq mini car from china 's chery automobile co .
american carmaker general motors claims the qq is a copy of its chevrolet spark model . the chinese deny any technology plagiarism in both cases .

ukraine reiterated friday its desire to join nato despite russian qualms , after the western alliance hinted heavily that the politically troubled ex-soviet state could soon win approval for membership . during the meeting of nato foreign ministers in the bulgarian capital sofia , ukrainian foreign minister borys tarasyuk said : " ukraine 's strategy towards joining nato is irreversible . " the sofia talks were the first such contact with nato since parliamentary elections on march 26 which were widely praised as free and fair , although they have left kiev in political limbo . nato officials at the sofia talks say there is widespread support for ukraine 's bid , despite its political problems .
speaking on thursday , nato head jaap de hoop scheffer hinted there could be an opening to aspiring members at a summit in the latvian capital in november . " i have no doubt that in riga , countries aspiring to nato membership will want a signal .
there will be a signal at riga , " de hoop scheffer said . " when they are ready , nato is ready , " he said in comments that referred also to georgia , another ex-soviet republic bidding to join nato . ukraine struggles with a turbulent past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : independence square in ukraine 's capital kiev addressing the political dispute that has dragged on in ukraine since march 26 parliamentary elections , u.s. secretary of state condoleezza rice said the country faced an uphill struggle to join nato . " the ukrainian government and the ukrainian people will have to decide whether or not this is something that they wish to pursue , " rice told reporters on the sidelines of the sofia meeting on thursday .
" and they will also have to work very hard , i think , to meet the criteria , " she added . ukrainian president viktor yushchenko has set out an ambitious pro-west agenda since coming to power in 2005 after a wave of popular protests known as the " orange revolution " that brought down a moscow-backed regime . but his party performed badly in march and has been forced into coalition talks that could bring to power either a government favoring links with europe and nato or one preferring a strong bond with russia . new dividing lines in europe ? moscow , which held sway over kiev in soviet times and maintains a strong influence over its western neighbor , meanwhile reasserted its opposition to ukraine 's nato hopes . " we are against the creation of new dividing lines in europe , " mikhail kamynin , russia 's foreign ministry spokesman , was quoted as saying in an interview with ria-novosti news agency on thursday . " today there are algorithms of cooperation with nato that allow states to cooperate in the widest security spectrum without formal accession to the alliance , " kamynin said . nato sending ukraine mixed signals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato foreign ministers meeting at the national palace of culture in sofia but nato on thursday appeared to play down reports that ukraine could be offered the alliance 's " membership action plan " , the key step before being invited to join . " ukraine 's aspirations to join the alliance are welcomed by all allies , " nato spokesman james appathurai told reporters in sofia .
" what i can not predict is timelines for membership action plans , " he added . albania , croatia and macedonia are currently in the membership action plan with the north atlantic treaty organisation -lrb- nato -rrb- . ten countries that were once allied with russia - bulgaria , czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , poland , romania , slovakia and slovenia - have joined nato since 1999 . also on friday , during a sideline meeting , u.s. secretary of state condoleezza rice signed a bilateral agreement with bulgarian officials to establish three military bases in the country as the u.s. shifts troops from old cold war positions to smaller units closer to the middle east and africa . nato boosts darfur aid moving from the european to the african continent during talks in sofia , nato has said it is ready to boost assistance in sudan 's violence-scarred darfur region .
the alliance has said it will increase logistical support , but said any presence should be limited and only in support of african or u.n. efforts . in nato 's first operation on the african continent , the alliance has provided training and transportation to african union troops trying to stem the violence there .

with not a mao jacket or red scarf in sight , it showcases vintage chic straight out of " barbarella . "
realistic it is n't . " we thought everyone in the gdr walked around in drab , dismal clothes , but suddenly we found this incredible stuff which showed there was a thriving fashion industry , " said caz hildebrand , the british art director who put the collection together . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " sibylle " - the arty face of gdr fashion but was there really ?
the photos were taken by günter rubitzsch , a leipzig-based photographer who worked regularly for women 's weeklies such as pramo -lrb- abbreviated from " praktische mode " or " practical fashion " -rrb- and für dich -lrb- " for you " -rrb- , magazines which featured sewing or knitting patterns for women who liked to make their own clothes .
and most of them had to . " everyone looked the same , so if you wanted something special you had to make it yourself , " explained antje lond benn , who studied at the technical college for clothing design in east berlin in the 1980s .
" fabrics and patterns were really cheap , and everyone would improvize with them .
and if you were lucky , you could fit into the kids ' clothes , which were heavily subsidized . " honecker 's haute couture so the groovy gdr depicted in " off the wall " might , perhaps , be a little off the mark .
but at least it scuppers a few cliches . " it 's an acknowledgment of my work , and i 'm glad it shows a different side of the gdr , " said rubitzsch .
" it proves that we were n't all impoverished and that it was possible to be creative despite the restrictions we worked with . " after the berlin wall fell , he sold the rights to his pictures to the international agency akg images - and never thought that one day , they 'd be rediscovered as high camp , communist-style . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fashion in ' sybille ' captured a mood - it did n't showcase clothes dating back to decades that taste forgot not just in east germany , what really sets his pictures apart are their unmistakably socialist backdrops .
one image features models reclining in vamped-up folksy frocks against a gleaming combine harvester , while others show girls posing in front of chemical plants , industrial sites and of course , the inevitable trabants . " i worked in leipzig , and there was a limit to the backdrops available , " explained rubitzsch .
" the city was very industrial and that 's why many of the pictures were taken in front of factories or agricultural cooperatives . " " in those days , fashion photography in the west was set in exotic locations like the caribbean and so on , " he pointed out .
" obviously , we could n't match that - we had to make do with what we had , and that meant being very inventive . " sibylle woman bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gdr style , circa 1985 meanwhile , at the more sophisticated end of the market was the magazine sibylle , which took its cues less from good housekeeping and more from french vogue .
the fashion conscious woman 's style bible , its editor was dorothea melis , who later compiled the only book on gdr fashion to have been published in germany since the demise of communism .
" sibylle - fashion photography from three decades of the gdr " appeared in 1998 and flew off the shelves . dorothea melis agrees with rubitzsch . " necessity is the mother of invention , " she said .
" everyone has this idea that women in the gdr went round in aprons , headscarves and flat shoes , so i thought : i 'll show you how stylish we really were !
back then women were so much more creative than are today , they 'd take the cotton we were getting from somewhere like uzbekistan and dye or embroider it to rework classic looks we 'd seen tourists wearing , on television or in magazines from the west . " like rubitzsch , she wholeheartedly rejects the idea that fashion was a thwarted industry in the gdr .
" back then , we 'd have one editor , one photographer and two models on an average photo shoot .
we had to do everything ourselves , there was no huge team like they have today .
we 'd all have to double up .
the editor would do the girls ' make-up , the photographer would also be the driver .
it was a very intense experience . " not so exquisite " exquisit " after leaving sibylle , melis went on to work in the publicity department of the gdr 's most upmarket store " exquisit , " where most of the clothes modeled in " off the wall " would have been sold .

and most of them had to . " everyone looked the same , so if you wanted something special you had to make it yourself , " explained antje lond benn , who studied at the technical college for clothing design in east berlin in the 1980s .
" fabrics and patterns were really cheap , and everyone would improvize with them .
and if you were lucky , you could fit into the kids ' clothes , which were heavily subsidized . " honecker 's haute couture so the groovy gdr depicted in " off the wall " might , perhaps , be a little off the mark .
but at least it scuppers a few cliches . " it 's an acknowledgment of my work , and i 'm glad it shows a different side of the gdr , " said rubitzsch .
" it proves that we were n't all impoverished and that it was possible to be creative despite the restrictions we worked with . " after the berlin wall fell , he sold the rights to his pictures to the international agency akg images - and never thought that one day , they 'd be rediscovered as high camp , communist-style . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fashion in ' sybille ' captured a mood - it did n't showcase clothes dating back to decades that taste forgot not just in east germany , what really sets his pictures apart are their unmistakably socialist backdrops .
one image features models reclining in vamped-up folksy frocks against a gleaming combine harvester , while others show girls posing in front of chemical plants , industrial sites and of course , the inevitable trabants . " i worked in leipzig , and there was a limit to the backdrops available , " explained rubitzsch .
" the city was very industrial and that 's why many of the pictures were taken in front of factories or agricultural cooperatives . " " in those days , fashion photography in the west was set in exotic locations like the caribbean and so on , " he pointed out .
" obviously , we could n't match that - we had to make do with what we had , and that meant being very inventive . " sibylle woman bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gdr style , circa 1985 meanwhile , at the more sophisticated end of the market was the magazine sibylle , which took its cues less from good housekeeping and more from french vogue .
the fashion conscious woman 's style bible , its editor was dorothea melis , who later compiled the only book on gdr fashion to have been published in germany since the demise of communism .
" sibylle - fashion photography from three decades of the gdr " appeared in 1998 and flew off the shelves . dorothea melis agrees with rubitzsch . " necessity is the mother of invention , " she said .
" everyone has this idea that women in the gdr went round in aprons , headscarves and flat shoes , so i thought : i 'll show you how stylish we really were !
back then women were so much more creative than are today , they 'd take the cotton we were getting from somewhere like uzbekistan and dye or embroider it to rework classic looks we 'd seen tourists wearing , on television or in magazines from the west . " like rubitzsch , she wholeheartedly rejects the idea that fashion was a thwarted industry in the gdr .
" back then , we 'd have one editor , one photographer and two models on an average photo shoot .
we had to do everything ourselves , there was no huge team like they have today .
we 'd all have to double up .
the editor would do the girls ' make-up , the photographer would also be the driver .
it was a very intense experience . " not so exquisite " exquisit " after leaving sibylle , melis went on to work in the publicity department of the gdr 's most upmarket store " exquisit , " where most of the clothes modeled in " off the wall " would have been sold . " exquisit opened in 1970 as a deliberate attempt on the part of the party to placate the masses and make them think the gdr was n't all bad , " she said . # b # it stocked western labels such as daniel hechter and georges rech , and until the end of communism , remained the first port-of-call for any east germans wanting to treat themselves - despite a minor upset in the mid-80s when customer complaints about a range of italian shirts that had been falling apart prompted the store to reveal they were actually made from shrouds . the rest of the time , people settled with cheap imitations of western styles , with the gdr even making a point of designing its own synthetics , such as the nylon-like " dederon , " the frotte-esque " malimo , " and its piece de resistance , the extraordinarily static " präsent 20 , " specially developed for the 20th anniversary of the gdr in 1969 . " there was no scope to actually design , " said antje lond benn .
" if you wanted to put in two extra seams , add a couple of buttons or use a different fabric , you 'd always be told it was too expensive - and the best stuff was always exported to west germany anyway . " " basically , there was no fashion industry , " she added . " there were just clothes .

" we will now be asking the security council to increase the pressure on iran , so that the international community can be assured that its nuclear program is not a threat to peace and security , " british foreign secretary jack straw said . the international atomic energy agency said in a report that iran had not met demands to freeze uranium enrichment , american , british and french diplomats said they expected to present a text in the security council next week .

" we will now be asking the security council to increase the pressure on iran , so that the international community can be assured that its nuclear program is not a threat to peace and security , " british foreign secretary jack straw said . the international atomic energy agency said in a report that iran had not met demands to freeze uranium enrichment , american , british and french diplomats said they expected to present a text in the security council next week . " after more than three years of agency efforts to seek clarity about all aspects of iran 's nuclear program , the existing gaps in knowledge continue to be a matter of concern , " the iaea report said .
" any progress in that regard requires full transparency and active cooperation by iran . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier called for " international unity " germany committed to peaceful solution german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called for the international community to close ranks in opposition to the iranian nuclear program and push for a peaceful solution . steinmeier said germany would be prepared to restart negotiations with iran , but only if teheran produced a solid basis for negotiations but remained cautious , adding " until now there have not been any signals of compromise .

with not a mao jacket or red scarf in sight , it showcases vintage chic straight out of " barbarella . "
realistic it is n't . " we thought everyone in the gdr walked around in drab , dismal clothes , but suddenly we found this incredible stuff which showed there was a thriving fashion industry , " said caz hildebrand , the british art director who put the collection together . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " sibylle " - the arty face of gdr fashion but was there really ?
the photos were taken by günter rubitzsch , a leipzig-based photographer who worked regularly for women 's weeklies such as pramo -lrb- abbreviated from " praktische mode " or " practical fashion " -rrb- and für dich -lrb- " for you " -rrb- , magazines which featured sewing or knitting patterns for women who liked to make their own clothes .
and most of them had to . " everyone looked the same , so if you wanted something special you had to make it yourself , " explained antje lond benn , who studied at the technical college for clothing design in east berlin in the 1980s .
" fabrics and patterns were really cheap , and everyone would improvize with them .
and if you were lucky , you could fit into the kids ' clothes , which were heavily subsidized . " honecker 's haute couture so the groovy gdr depicted in " off the wall " might , perhaps , be a little off the mark .
but at least it scuppers a few cliches . " it 's an acknowledgment of my work , and i 'm glad it shows a different side of the gdr , " said rubitzsch .
" it proves that we were n't all impoverished and that it was possible to be creative despite the restrictions we worked with . " after the berlin wall fell , he sold the rights to his pictures to the international agency akg images - and never thought that one day , they 'd be rediscovered as high camp , communist-style . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fashion in ' sybille ' captured a mood - it did n't showcase clothes dating back to decades that taste forgot not just in east germany , what really sets his pictures apart are their unmistakably socialist backdrops .
one image features models reclining in vamped-up folksy frocks against a gleaming combine harvester , while others show girls posing in front of chemical plants , industrial sites and of course , the inevitable trabants . " i worked in leipzig , and there was a limit to the backdrops available , " explained rubitzsch .
" the city was very industrial and that 's why many of the pictures were taken in front of factories or agricultural cooperatives . " " in those days , fashion photography in the west was set in exotic locations like the caribbean and so on , " he pointed out .
" obviously , we could n't match that - we had to make do with what we had , and that meant being very inventive . " sibylle woman bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gdr style , circa 1985 meanwhile , at the more sophisticated end of the market was the magazine sibylle , which took its cues less from good housekeeping and more from french vogue .
the fashion conscious woman 's style bible , its editor was dorothea melis , who later compiled the only book on gdr fashion to have been published in germany since the demise of communism .
" sibylle - fashion photography from three decades of the gdr " appeared in 1998 and flew off the shelves . dorothea melis agrees with rubitzsch . " necessity is the mother of invention , " she said .
" everyone has this idea that women in the gdr went round in aprons , headscarves and flat shoes , so i thought : i 'll show you how stylish we really were !
back then women were so much more creative than are today , they 'd take the cotton we were getting from somewhere like uzbekistan and dye or embroider it to rework classic looks we 'd seen tourists wearing , on television or in magazines from the west . " like rubitzsch , she wholeheartedly rejects the idea that fashion was a thwarted industry in the gdr .
" back then , we 'd have one editor , one photographer and two models on an average photo shoot .
we had to do everything ourselves , there was no huge team like they have today .
we 'd all have to double up .
the editor would do the girls ' make-up , the photographer would also be the driver .
it was a very intense experience . " not so exquisite " exquisit " after leaving sibylle , melis went on to work in the publicity department of the gdr 's most upmarket store " exquisit , " where most of the clothes modeled in " off the wall " would have been sold . " exquisit opened in 1970 as a deliberate attempt on the part of the party to placate the masses and make them think the gdr was n't all bad , " she said . # b # it stocked western labels such as daniel hechter and georges rech , and until the end of communism , remained the first port-of-call for any east germans wanting to treat themselves - despite a minor upset in the mid-80s when customer complaints about a range of italian shirts that had been falling apart prompted the store to reveal they were actually made from shrouds . the rest of the time , people settled with cheap imitations of western styles , with the gdr even making a point of designing its own synthetics , such as the nylon-like " dederon , " the frotte-esque " malimo , " and its piece de resistance , the extraordinarily static " präsent 20 , " specially developed for the 20th anniversary of the gdr in 1969 . " there was no scope to actually design , " said antje lond benn .
" if you wanted to put in two extra seams , add a couple of buttons or use a different fabric , you 'd always be told it was too expensive - and the best stuff was always exported to west germany anyway .

with not a mao jacket or red scarf in sight , it showcases vintage chic straight out of " barbarella . "
realistic it is n't . " we thought everyone in the gdr walked around in drab , dismal clothes , but suddenly we found this incredible stuff which showed there was a thriving fashion industry , " said caz hildebrand , the british art director who put the collection together . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " sibylle " - the arty face of gdr fashion but was there really ?
the photos were taken by günter rubitzsch , a leipzig-based photographer who worked regularly for women 's weeklies such as pramo -lrb- abbreviated from " praktische mode " or " practical fashion " -rrb- and für dich -lrb- " for you " -rrb- , magazines which featured sewing or knitting patterns for women who liked to make their own clothes .
and most of them had to . " everyone looked the same , so if you wanted something special you had to make it yourself , " explained antje lond benn , who studied at the technical college for clothing design in east berlin in the 1980s .
" fabrics and patterns were really cheap , and everyone would improvize with them .
and if you were lucky , you could fit into the kids ' clothes , which were heavily subsidized . " honecker 's haute couture so the groovy gdr depicted in " off the wall " might , perhaps , be a little off the mark .
but at least it scuppers a few cliches . " it 's an acknowledgment of my work , and i 'm glad it shows a different side of the gdr , " said rubitzsch .
" it proves that we were n't all impoverished and that it was possible to be creative despite the restrictions we worked with . " after the berlin wall fell , he sold the rights to his pictures to the international agency akg images - and never thought that one day , they 'd be rediscovered as high camp , communist-style . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fashion in ' sybille ' captured a mood - it did n't showcase clothes dating back to decades that taste forgot not just in east germany , what really sets his pictures apart are their unmistakably socialist backdrops .
one image features models reclining in vamped-up folksy frocks against a gleaming combine harvester , while others show girls posing in front of chemical plants , industrial sites and of course , the inevitable trabants . " i worked in leipzig , and there was a limit to the backdrops available , " explained rubitzsch .
" the city was very industrial and that 's why many of the pictures were taken in front of factories or agricultural cooperatives . " " in those days , fashion photography in the west was set in exotic locations like the caribbean and so on , " he pointed out .
" obviously , we could n't match that - we had to make do with what we had , and that meant being very inventive . " sibylle woman bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gdr style , circa 1985 meanwhile , at the more sophisticated end of the market was the magazine sibylle , which took its cues less from good housekeeping and more from french vogue .
the fashion conscious woman 's style bible , its editor was dorothea melis , who later compiled the only book on gdr fashion to have been published in germany since the demise of communism .
" sibylle - fashion photography from three decades of the gdr " appeared in 1998 and flew off the shelves . dorothea melis agrees with rubitzsch . " necessity is the mother of invention , " she said .
" everyone has this idea that women in the gdr went round in aprons , headscarves and flat shoes , so i thought : i 'll show you how stylish we really were !
back then women were so much more creative than are today , they 'd take the cotton we were getting from somewhere like uzbekistan and dye or embroider it to rework classic looks we 'd seen tourists wearing , on television or in magazines from the west . " like rubitzsch , she wholeheartedly rejects the idea that fashion was a thwarted industry in the gdr .
" back then , we 'd have one editor , one photographer and two models on an average photo shoot .
we had to do everything ourselves , there was no huge team like they have today .
we 'd all have to double up .
the editor would do the girls ' make-up , the photographer would also be the driver .
it was a very intense experience . " not so exquisite " exquisit " after leaving sibylle , melis went on to work in the publicity department of the gdr 's most upmarket store " exquisit , " where most of the clothes modeled in " off the wall " would have been sold . " exquisit opened in 1970 as a deliberate attempt on the part of the party to placate the masses and make them think the gdr was n't all bad , " she said . # b # it stocked western labels such as daniel hechter and georges rech , and until the end of communism , remained the first port-of-call for any east germans wanting to treat themselves - despite a minor upset in the mid-80s when customer complaints about a range of italian shirts that had been falling apart prompted the store to reveal they were actually made from shrouds . the rest of the time , people settled with cheap imitations of western styles , with the gdr even making a point of designing its own synthetics , such as the nylon-like " dederon , " the frotte-esque " malimo , " and its piece de resistance , the extraordinarily static " präsent 20 , " specially developed for the 20th anniversary of the gdr in 1969 . " there was no scope to actually design , " said antje lond benn .
" if you wanted to put in two extra seams , add a couple of buttons or use a different fabric , you 'd always be told it was too expensive - and the best stuff was always exported to west germany anyway . " " basically , there was no fashion industry , " she added . " there were just clothes .

" thanks to god , we are a nuclear state , " he said in a speech in the west of iran . no good n ews this leaves little room for elbaradei to do anything other than state the obvious in a report the head of the vienna-based international atomic energy agency is to file friday to mark the expiry of the deadline , diplomats said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a reactor building of iran 's bushehr nuclear power plant elbaradei will also be reporting on whether iran has met security council demands for iran to cooperate with iaea inspectors , who have not been able to conclude after over three years of investigation whether the iranian program is peaceful , as tehran claims . on this topic also little progress is believed to have taken place . " it is not going to be a good report , " said a senior european diplomat , who requested anonymity .
" that is quite clear .
what is there positive to report ? " new phase of diplomacy the report is thus almost certain to open the door to a new phase of diplomacy over an iranian nuclear program which the united states charges hides the development of atomic weapons . washington wants the security council to adopt a " chapter 7 " resolution which would legally oblige iran to meet the iaea 's calls . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the security council take action ?
this could lead , if iran still refuses to comply , to punishing economic sanctions and even military action against iran , although tehran 's allies and major trading partners russia and china oppose such a move . us secretary of state condoleezza rice said thursday that the security council " has to act " in response to iran 's defiance . but speaking on the sidelines of a nato meeting in sofia , rice played down talk of military action , saying : " we are committed to a diplomatic course .

but at least it scuppers a few cliches . " it 's an acknowledgment of my work , and i 'm glad it shows a different side of the gdr , " said rubitzsch .
" it proves that we were n't all impoverished and that it was possible to be creative despite the restrictions we worked with . " after the berlin wall fell , he sold the rights to his pictures to the international agency akg images - and never thought that one day , they 'd be rediscovered as high camp , communist-style . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fashion in ' sybille ' captured a mood - it did n't showcase clothes dating back to decades that taste forgot not just in east germany , what really sets his pictures apart are their unmistakably socialist backdrops .
one image features models reclining in vamped-up folksy frocks against a gleaming combine harvester , while others show girls posing in front of chemical plants , industrial sites and of course , the inevitable trabants . " i worked in leipzig , and there was a limit to the backdrops available , " explained rubitzsch .
" the city was very industrial and that 's why many of the pictures were taken in front of factories or agricultural cooperatives . " " in those days , fashion photography in the west was set in exotic locations like the caribbean and so on , " he pointed out .
" obviously , we could n't match that - we had to make do with what we had , and that meant being very inventive . " sibylle woman bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gdr style , circa 1985 meanwhile , at the more sophisticated end of the market was the magazine sibylle , which took its cues less from good housekeeping and more from french vogue .
the fashion conscious woman 's style bible , its editor was dorothea melis , who later compiled the only book on gdr fashion to have been published in germany since the demise of communism .
" sibylle - fashion photography from three decades of the gdr " appeared in 1998 and flew off the shelves . dorothea melis agrees with rubitzsch . " necessity is the mother of invention , " she said .
" everyone has this idea that women in the gdr went round in aprons , headscarves and flat shoes , so i thought : i 'll show you how stylish we really were !
back then women were so much more creative than are today , they 'd take the cotton we were getting from somewhere like uzbekistan and dye or embroider it to rework classic looks we 'd seen tourists wearing , on television or in magazines from the west . " like rubitzsch , she wholeheartedly rejects the idea that fashion was a thwarted industry in the gdr .
" back then , we 'd have one editor , one photographer and two models on an average photo shoot .
we had to do everything ourselves , there was no huge team like they have today .
we 'd all have to double up .
the editor would do the girls ' make-up , the photographer would also be the driver .
it was a very intense experience . " not so exquisite " exquisit " after leaving sibylle , melis went on to work in the publicity department of the gdr 's most upmarket store " exquisit , " where most of the clothes modeled in " off the wall " would have been sold . " exquisit opened in 1970 as a deliberate attempt on the part of the party to placate the masses and make them think the gdr was n't all bad , " she said . # b # it stocked western labels such as daniel hechter and georges rech , and until the end of communism , remained the first port-of-call for any east germans wanting to treat themselves - despite a minor upset in the mid-80s when customer complaints about a range of italian shirts that had been falling apart prompted the store to reveal they were actually made from shrouds . the rest of the time , people settled with cheap imitations of western styles , with the gdr even making a point of designing its own synthetics , such as the nylon-like " dederon , " the frotte-esque " malimo , " and its piece de resistance , the extraordinarily static " präsent 20 , " specially developed for the 20th anniversary of the gdr in 1969 . " there was no scope to actually design , " said antje lond benn .
" if you wanted to put in two extra seams , add a couple of buttons or use a different fabric , you 'd always be told it was too expensive - and the best stuff was always exported to west germany anyway . " " basically , there was no fashion industry , " she added . " there were just clothes .

ukraine reiterated friday its desire to join nato despite russian qualms , after the western alliance hinted heavily that the politically troubled ex-soviet state could soon win approval for membership . during the meeting of nato foreign ministers in the bulgarian capital sofia , ukrainian foreign minister borys tarasyuk said : " ukraine 's strategy towards joining nato is irreversible . " the sofia talks were the first such contact with nato since parliamentary elections on march 26 which were widely praised as free and fair , although they have left kiev in political limbo . nato officials at the sofia talks say there is widespread support for ukraine 's bid , despite its political problems .
speaking on thursday , nato head jaap de hoop scheffer hinted there could be an opening to aspiring members at a summit in the latvian capital in november . " i have no doubt that in riga , countries aspiring to nato membership will want a signal .
there will be a signal at riga , " de hoop scheffer said . " when they are ready , nato is ready , " he said in comments that referred also to georgia , another ex-soviet republic bidding to join nato . ukraine struggles with a turbulent past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : independence square in ukraine 's capital kiev addressing the political dispute that has dragged on in ukraine since march 26 parliamentary elections , u.s. secretary of state condoleezza rice said the country faced an uphill struggle to join nato . " the ukrainian government and the ukrainian people will have to decide whether or not this is something that they wish to pursue , " rice told reporters on the sidelines of the sofia meeting on thursday .
" and they will also have to work very hard , i think , to meet the criteria , " she added . ukrainian president viktor yushchenko has set out an ambitious pro-west agenda since coming to power in 2005 after a wave of popular protests known as the " orange revolution " that brought down a moscow-backed regime . but his party performed badly in march and has been forced into coalition talks that could bring to power either a government favoring links with europe and nato or one preferring a strong bond with russia . new dividing lines in europe ? moscow , which held sway over kiev in soviet times and maintains a strong influence over its western neighbor , meanwhile reasserted its opposition to ukraine 's nato hopes . " we are against the creation of new dividing lines in europe , " mikhail kamynin , russia 's foreign ministry spokesman , was quoted as saying in an interview with ria-novosti news agency on thursday . " today there are algorithms of cooperation with nato that allow states to cooperate in the widest security spectrum without formal accession to the alliance , " kamynin said . nato sending ukraine mixed signals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato foreign ministers meeting at the national palace of culture in sofia but nato on thursday appeared to play down reports that ukraine could be offered the alliance 's " membership action plan " , the key step before being invited to join . " ukraine 's aspirations to join the alliance are welcomed by all allies , " nato spokesman james appathurai told reporters in sofia .
" what i can not predict is timelines for membership action plans , " he added . albania , croatia and macedonia are currently in the membership action plan with the north atlantic treaty organisation -lrb- nato -rrb- . ten countries that were once allied with russia - bulgaria , czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , poland , romania , slovakia and slovenia - have joined nato since 1999 . also on friday , during a sideline meeting , u.s. secretary of state condoleezza rice signed a bilateral agreement with bulgarian officials to establish three military bases in the country as the u.s. shifts troops from old cold war positions to smaller units closer to the middle east and africa . nato boosts darfur aid moving from the european to the african continent during talks in sofia , nato has said it is ready to boost assistance in sudan 's violence-scarred darfur region .
the alliance has said it will increase logistical support , but said any presence should be limited and only in support of african or u.n. efforts . in nato 's first operation on the african continent , the alliance has provided training and transportation to african union troops trying to stem the violence there .

tehran 's decision to ignore a un ultimatum to freeze its nuclear enrichment work was described as irresponsible and a slap in the face of the international community . in the search for solutions to the standoff , wolfgang gerhardt , a foreign policy expert from the opposition liberal free democrats , said russia and china must play a more pro-active role now .

" we are constantly hearing about some threat of dependence on russia , that something must be done to limit the entry of russian companies into the european market , " putin said at a joint news conference with german chancellor angela merkel after two days of talks focused on energy . " what are we supposed to do when we hear the same thing every day ?

why would this be so dangerous ?
the aspen 's institute jeffrey gedmin offers answers . the us and the european union share nearly identical views .
teheran says it wants nuclear power for peaceful purposes .
no one believes the mullahs .
iran should have enough oil and gas to take care of its energy needs for several hundred years .
there are other reasons to believe that the government in teheran is lying .
iran played cat and mouse with the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- for 18 years .
we expect the iaea to issue iran yet another rebuke this friday . still , why should iran not have the bomb ?
after all , india , pakistan and israel are all nuclear powers , right ?
if you follow this logic - and cast aside for a moment the fact that by signing the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- iran has pledged not to acquire nuclear weapons - then you had better ponder the following . setti n g off a n uclear arms race ? first , when iran gets the bomb , be prepared for a nuclear arms race .
saudi arabia , egypt and turkey -lrb- perhaps syria , algeria and eventually iraq -rrb- would all find it hard to understand that they do not enjoy the right to a nuclear option .
this is presumably a principal reason why -lrb- former german foreign minister -rrb- joschka fischer once described the thought of iran with the bomb as one of the worst imaginable nightmares . second , imagine an emboldened iran meddling to an even greater extent in iraq and afghanistan .
the mullahs may have an interest in stability in both countries ; but most surely not in democracy and pro-western governments .
expect more dead americans -lrb- and germans -rrb- in the short-term . third , bet on significantly higher oil prices , says henry sokolksi , director of the nonproliferation policy education center in washington .
a nuclear iran may feel tempted to intimidate saudi arabia -lrb- which has the world 's largest oil production capacity -rrb- , according to sokolski , or perhaps even threaten the freedom of the seas to manipulate oil prices dramatically upward . more terrorism to come ? fourth , get used to more terrorism .
iran remains a prominent supporter of palestinian terror , of course .
but the iranian regime has also struck targets in europe in the 1980s and 1990s .
there is evidence , moreover , that as recently as 2004 the iranians sought to assist terrorist groups in identify targets in the united states . one feeble excuse made on behalf of the iranian regime is that iran has legitimate security concerns : it feels threatened by the us presence in iraq and afghanistan .
but then iran had been busy pursuing its bomb long before the united states ever had troops in either country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeffrey gedmin iran 's leaders say ahmadineejad wants to wipe israel off the map .

why would this be so dangerous ?
the aspen 's institute jeffrey gedmin offers answers . the us and the european union share nearly identical views .
teheran says it wants nuclear power for peaceful purposes .
no one believes the mullahs .
iran should have enough oil and gas to take care of its energy needs for several hundred years .
there are other reasons to believe that the government in teheran is lying .
iran played cat and mouse with the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- for 18 years .
we expect the iaea to issue iran yet another rebuke this friday . still , why should iran not have the bomb ?
after all , india , pakistan and israel are all nuclear powers , right ?
if you follow this logic - and cast aside for a moment the fact that by signing the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- iran has pledged not to acquire nuclear weapons - then you had better ponder the following . setti n g off a n uclear arms race ? first , when iran gets the bomb , be prepared for a nuclear arms race .
saudi arabia , egypt and turkey -lrb- perhaps syria , algeria and eventually iraq -rrb- would all find it hard to understand that they do not enjoy the right to a nuclear option .
this is presumably a principal reason why -lrb- former german foreign minister -rrb- joschka fischer once described the thought of iran with the bomb as one of the worst imaginable nightmares . second , imagine an emboldened iran meddling to an even greater extent in iraq and afghanistan .
the mullahs may have an interest in stability in both countries ; but most surely not in democracy and pro-western governments .
expect more dead americans -lrb- and germans -rrb- in the short-term . third , bet on significantly higher oil prices , says henry sokolksi , director of the nonproliferation policy education center in washington .
a nuclear iran may feel tempted to intimidate saudi arabia -lrb- which has the world 's largest oil production capacity -rrb- , according to sokolski , or perhaps even threaten the freedom of the seas to manipulate oil prices dramatically upward . more terrorism to come ? fourth , get used to more terrorism .
iran remains a prominent supporter of palestinian terror , of course .
but the iranian regime has also struck targets in europe in the 1980s and 1990s .
there is evidence , moreover , that as recently as 2004 the iranians sought to assist terrorist groups in identify targets in the united states . one feeble excuse made on behalf of the iranian regime is that iran has legitimate security concerns : it feels threatened by the us presence in iraq and afghanistan .
but then iran had been busy pursuing its bomb long before the united states ever had troops in either country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeffrey gedmin iran 's leaders say ahmadineejad wants to wipe israel off the map .
the mullahs say they want to be a regional hegemonic power .

tehran 's decision to ignore a un ultimatum to freeze its nuclear enrichment work was described as irresponsible and a slap in the face of the international community . in the search for solutions to the standoff , wolfgang gerhardt , a foreign policy expert from the opposition liberal free democrats , said russia and china must play a more pro-active role now . " we can only stop tehran if russia and china come to realize that they can no longer stand on the sidelines in this dispute , " he said .
" within the next few days it is crucial that these countries drive home to iran that it will definitely face punitive action if it continues down this path of confrontation . " ingo friedrich , a member of the conservative csu party also believes that moscow and beijing must now come forward to step up international pressure on iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
he thinks that efforts within the united nations aimed at imposing sanctions must be intensified . " it is now a matter of credibility for the united nations to impose sanctions , " he said .
" iran must be made to understand that it can not defy demands by the international community without punishment . " military actio n u n likely as the conflict is heating up , the prospect of a military confrontation is looming ever larger .
washington has n't ruled out the use of military force to stop iran building nuclear weapons . but ullrich klose , foreign policy spokesman of the social democrats said he believes this is just empty rhetoric .
he added that he is rather pessimistic about a positive outcome of the conflict . " people say the conflict will develop similar to what we saw in iraq , " klose said .
" i do n't think this will happen because the united states have had a bad time of it there and a war with iran would overstretch the country 's capabilities .
so in the end we 'll either have a political solution or face the situation that iran continues its nuclear program unfazed . " public anger in germany about the mullah regime in tehran has been fuelled recently after ahamadinejad said he wanted to visit germany to attend one of iran 's world cup soccer matches this summer .
german politicians such as csu leader edmund stoiber have vowed to do everything in their power to prevent that .

" we are constantly hearing about some threat of dependence on russia , that something must be done to limit the entry of russian companies into the european market , " putin said at a joint news conference with german chancellor angela merkel after two days of talks focused on energy . " what are we supposed to do when we hear the same thing every day ?
we start looking for other markets .
when we continually hear the same thing , we perceive this as a threat to limit our admittance to the market and we begin to look for other outlets , " the russian leader said . putin said russia had no wish to cut back on supplies of energy to countries in europe - they depend overall on russia for around one-fourth of their natural gas supplies and a large share of oil supplies - and stressed that moscow had always been a reliable supplier independent of politics . " we have worked well with you for many years , even when there was the cold war . ...
day after day , the soviet union delivered for its partners in europe .
what is the point of stoking fears about excessive dependence with regard to russia today ? "
putin asked . moscow 's threat to shift energy priorities east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin is looking at china and the far east for energy partners putin and other top russian officials have however stressed in recent weeks that china , japan and other huge markets in asia are increasingly hungry for russian energy supplies and have warned that moscow may shift its priority to serving those clients at the expense of european buyers . the european union , some of whose members felt disruption to their gas supplies from russia in january when moscow briefly cut shipments to ukraine amid a price dispute , has responded by telling moscow not to " politicize " energy trade . while russia 's state-run gas giant gazprom , for example , has complained of efforts to block its expansion plans in european markets , it has also flatly rejected european demands that it relax its own domestic monopoly and open excess gas pipeline capacity to foreign firms . tensions with west exacerbated by energy struggles putin 's comments were certain to heighten tensions on energy between russia - the world 's second-largest crude oil exporter and largest supplier of natural gas - and the west , which is anxious over linkage of kremlin energy strategy with political objectives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and merkel found little common ground on energy issues in comments to officials on wednesday shortly before he greeted merkel , putin complained that russia 's aims to expand in western energy markets were being systematically thwarted by " unfair competition " barriers . " we are being blocked to the north , the south and the west on any pretext .
we have to find outlets , to fit into the global development process , " putin said wednesday hours before greeting merkel . by way of example he cited reports that the british government had recently considered modifying anti-monopoly legislation in such a way as to prevent gazprom from buying centrica , britain 's biggest household gas supplier . british prime minister tony blair ruled out any move to block the takeover , the daily financial times reported wednesday , sparking a surge in centrica 's share price . putin said gazprom had never intended to buy the company anyway .
" we need to agree on the rules of the game " and those should be applied on an equal basis to all countries , he said . eu failing in bid to rein in russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to ensure the supply stays open the european union has ratcheted up pressure on russia to sign its energy charter , a document that regulates energy transport and would prohibit any signatory from disrupting contracted supplies for any reason . a top gazprom official , alexander medvedev , told participants at an economic forum in london earlier this week that the pact was " stillborn . " however , putin 's economic advisor referred to the prickly eu-russian relationship as a normal sign of a changing balance of power . " having this tension is okay , it 's a problem with any growth , " said igor shuvalov , who is also russia 's sherpa to the group of eight industrialized countries .

ahmadinejad and bush iran and the us need to tone down their rhetoric and start showing a willingness to compromise in order to resolve the nuclear crisis diplomatically , says janet kursawe of the german institute for middle east studies . when the un security council 's ultimatum calling on iran to halt its nuclear program expires on friday , a positive outcome in the form of iran giving in to the demands is highly unlikely .
that 's not very surprising , considering that chances of success were limited from the beginning .
and since the ultimatum was not issued in the form of a resolution that 's binding in terms of international law , sanctions are not going to follow . thirty days ago , at the time the ultimatum was given , the iranian government reacted quickly by saying that it would not give in to international pressure by giving up its right to peaceful use of nuclear power .
tehran 's announcement to withdraw from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and the international atomic energy agency in case of sanctions were also predictable . what 's surprising is the escalation of the last few months .
ever since iran 's sixth president , mahmoud ahmadinejad , took office , the dynamics of conflict that the us and iran engaged in via provocative statements have made it increasingly difficult to reach a diplomatic solution . both sides seem to have found a perfect match : ahmadinejad 's piety and self-presentation , combined with excessive nationalism and a readiness to sacrifice , is the logical response to george w. bush 's sense of mission . blow n out of proportio n the demands on iran that are unique in the non-proliferation treaty 's history are insulting and offending when one considers the country 's significant sense of national pride and the fact that iran has been a member of the treaty since 1968 . the situation has paved the way to turn the right to use nuclear power into a question of national self-determination , as happened since ahmadinejad took over .
his government and radical , conservative forces of other political organs have managed to preempt all domestic and foreign policy issues in the dispute over iran 's right to use nuclear power , limiting the power of the opposition even further as a result . no one helps iran 's leader more in this respect than the us government .
while opposition voices are increasingly calling for an end to the course of confrontation and back a compromise and even a temporary halt to uranium enrichment , their power and ability to act is extremely limited . a deteriorating political climate and increasing human rights abuses are a consequence of iran 's growing isolation .
should the isolation continue , the conservative , radical establishment will consolidate its political power even further and lead to a militarization of domestic and foreign policies . mutual suspicio n s preve n t solutio n iran is still a long way from being able to produce nuclear weapons .
should the conflict continue , the government is certain to increase its efforts in the field of nuclear research and will use them to raise its deterrent potential .
ahmadinejad 's propagandistic remarks during military exercises at the beginning of april served the same purpose . mutual suspicion and alternating threats between the us and iran are currently the biggest hindrances to a diplomatic solution .
iran feels threatened because of us military presence in its immediate vicinity and because of washington 's assurances that it wants to bring about a regime change in tehran .
the fact that israel feels threatened - and exercises pressure on the us - because of ahmadinejad 's anti-semitic remarks also contributes to the dynamics of escalation . the current insistence on refusing to compromise could lead to a decision to push the military option .
any military action - even a limited one that only aims to destroy nuclear plants - will have fatal security consequences for the region in the long run . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : janet kursawe instead , people should consider rethinking a russian proposal that was outright rejected by the us administration .
moscow suggested that the iranian nuclear program should continue outside the country with russia 's technological help .
in order for this to happen , however , all sides would have to work towards de-escalating the situation and the us government would have to be willing to sit down and negotiate with iran . janet kursawe is an ethnologist , political scientist and psychologist .

ahmadinejad and bush iran and the us need to tone down their rhetoric and start showing a willingness to compromise in order to resolve the nuclear crisis diplomatically , says janet kursawe of the german institute for middle east studies . when the un security council 's ultimatum calling on iran to halt its nuclear program expires on friday , a positive outcome in the form of iran giving in to the demands is highly unlikely .
that 's not very surprising , considering that chances of success were limited from the beginning .
and since the ultimatum was not issued in the form of a resolution that 's binding in terms of international law , sanctions are not going to follow . thirty days ago , at the time the ultimatum was given , the iranian government reacted quickly by saying that it would not give in to international pressure by giving up its right to peaceful use of nuclear power .
tehran 's announcement to withdraw from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and the international atomic energy agency in case of sanctions were also predictable . what 's surprising is the escalation of the last few months .
ever since iran 's sixth president , mahmoud ahmadinejad , took office , the dynamics of conflict that the us and iran engaged in via provocative statements have made it increasingly difficult to reach a diplomatic solution . both sides seem to have found a perfect match : ahmadinejad 's piety and self-presentation , combined with excessive nationalism and a readiness to sacrifice , is the logical response to george w. bush 's sense of mission . blow n out of proportio n the demands on iran that are unique in the non-proliferation treaty 's history are insulting and offending when one considers the country 's significant sense of national pride and the fact that iran has been a member of the treaty since 1968 . the situation has paved the way to turn the right to use nuclear power into a question of national self-determination , as happened since ahmadinejad took over .
his government and radical , conservative forces of other political organs have managed to preempt all domestic and foreign policy issues in the dispute over iran 's right to use nuclear power , limiting the power of the opposition even further as a result . no one helps iran 's leader more in this respect than the us government .
while opposition voices are increasingly calling for an end to the course of confrontation and back a compromise and even a temporary halt to uranium enrichment , their power and ability to act is extremely limited . a deteriorating political climate and increasing human rights abuses are a consequence of iran 's growing isolation .
should the isolation continue , the conservative , radical establishment will consolidate its political power even further and lead to a militarization of domestic and foreign policies . mutual suspicio n s preve n t solutio n iran is still a long way from being able to produce nuclear weapons .

tehran 's decision to ignore a un ultimatum to freeze its nuclear enrichment work was described as irresponsible and a slap in the face of the international community . in the search for solutions to the standoff , wolfgang gerhardt , a foreign policy expert from the opposition liberal free democrats , said russia and china must play a more pro-active role now . " we can only stop tehran if russia and china come to realize that they can no longer stand on the sidelines in this dispute , " he said .
" within the next few days it is crucial that these countries drive home to iran that it will definitely face punitive action if it continues down this path of confrontation . " ingo friedrich , a member of the conservative csu party also believes that moscow and beijing must now come forward to step up international pressure on iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
he thinks that efforts within the united nations aimed at imposing sanctions must be intensified . " it is now a matter of credibility for the united nations to impose sanctions , " he said .
" iran must be made to understand that it can not defy demands by the international community without punishment . " military actio n u n likely as the conflict is heating up , the prospect of a military confrontation is looming ever larger .
washington has n't ruled out the use of military force to stop iran building nuclear weapons . but ullrich klose , foreign policy spokesman of the social democrats said he believes this is just empty rhetoric .
he added that he is rather pessimistic about a positive outcome of the conflict . " people say the conflict will develop similar to what we saw in iraq , " klose said .
" i do n't think this will happen because the united states have had a bad time of it there and a war with iran would overstretch the country 's capabilities .
so in the end we 'll either have a political solution or face the situation that iran continues its nuclear program unfazed . " public anger in germany about the mullah regime in tehran has been fuelled recently after ahamadinejad said he wanted to visit germany to attend one of iran 's world cup soccer matches this summer .
german politicians such as csu leader edmund stoiber have vowed to do everything in their power to prevent that .

he has accused the cia of kidnapping him in late 2003 from macedonia and interrogating him in afghanistan . skopje has denied any involvement in the alleged operation by the us spy agency . upon arrival , the delegation met macedonian president branko crvenkovski and were due to meet deputy prime minister radmila secerinska and former foreign minister slobodan casule , the eu spokesman andrea angeli told afp news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giovanni claudio fava , european lawmaker leading cia flight probe " the target is the truth , just the truth , " the eu lawmaker leading the probe , claudio fava , told reporters after the meeting with crvenkovski . the eu deputies are scheduled to meet former interior minister siljan avramovski , his successor ljubomir mihajlovski and parliamentary speaker ljupco jordanovski on friday . earlier this year european deputies decided to set up a special committee to look into the allegations that the central intelligence agency secretly operated flights carrying prisoners it considered terror suspects which passed through eu territory . the parliament 's inquiry started in january and is expected to issue a first report next month . more than 1,000 secret cia flights have gone through european airspace and airports since 2001 without governments requesting information , fava said upon presenting a preliminary report .

for more than three months , the eu parliamentary inquiry has heard testimony from alleged victims and human rights groups - all saying that european states had handed over terrorism suspects to foreign agents , and ignoring hundreds of cia flights that had used their airports .
some former detainees provided detailed accounts of alleged torture carried out in secret prisons outside eu or us jurisdiction . the eu lawmakers investigating the khalid al-masri case in macedonia want to find out how the plane with al-masri on board could leave europe unchallenged . fava believes that there were hundreds of similar incidents .
" if we look at all the testimonies we have got , it becomes very clear that these incidents were n't sporadic , but that it was a common practice .
that 's the only conclusion i can draw , " fava said . the cia declined to comment on the eu parliamentarians ' findings .
the inquiry committee has no legal powers , but it will recommend what political action should be taken against any countries found to have been involved , including the united states .

tehran 's decision to ignore a un ultimatum to freeze its nuclear enrichment work was described as irresponsible and a slap in the face of the international community . in the search for solutions to the standoff , wolfgang gerhardt , a foreign policy expert from the opposition liberal free democrats , said russia and china must play a more pro-active role now . " we can only stop tehran if russia and china come to realize that they can no longer stand on the sidelines in this dispute , " he said .
" within the next few days it is crucial that these countries drive home to iran that it will definitely face punitive action if it continues down this path of confrontation . " ingo friedrich , a member of the conservative csu party also believes that moscow and beijing must now come forward to step up international pressure on iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
he thinks that efforts within the united nations aimed at imposing sanctions must be intensified . " it is now a matter of credibility for the united nations to impose sanctions , " he said .
" iran must be made to understand that it can not defy demands by the international community without punishment . " military actio n u n likely as the conflict is heating up , the prospect of a military confrontation is looming ever larger .
washington has n't ruled out the use of military force to stop iran building nuclear weapons . but ullrich klose , foreign policy spokesman of the social democrats said he believes this is just empty rhetoric .
he added that he is rather pessimistic about a positive outcome of the conflict . " people say the conflict will develop similar to what we saw in iraq , " klose said .
" i do n't think this will happen because the united states have had a bad time of it there and a war with iran would overstretch the country 's capabilities .
so in the end we 'll either have a political solution or face the situation that iran continues its nuclear program unfazed . " public anger in germany about the mullah regime in tehran has been fuelled recently after ahamadinejad said he wanted to visit germany to attend one of iran 's world cup soccer matches this summer .
german politicians such as csu leader edmund stoiber have vowed to do everything in their power to prevent that . " someone who denounces the holocaust as a lie and who rejects israel 's right to exist is certainly not welcome in germany , " he said . uwe hessler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un nuclear report expected to be bad news for iran , world un nuclear chief mohamed elbaradei is expected to report friday that iran has failed to meet a un deadline to stop enriching uranium , opening the door to possible sanctions against the islamic republic .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.04.2006 guest commentary : who 's afraid of a nuclear iran ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : letting iran pursue nuclear research would be devastating , gedmin says us senator john mccain says the only thing worse than a war to stop it would be iran actually getting a nuclear bomb .
why would this be so dangerous ?
the aspen 's institute jeffrey gedmin offers answers . the us and the european union share nearly identical views .
teheran says it wants nuclear power for peaceful purposes .
no one believes the mullahs .
iran should have enough oil and gas to take care of its energy needs for several hundred years .
there are other reasons to believe that the government in teheran is lying .
iran played cat and mouse with the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- for 18 years .
we expect the iaea to issue iran yet another rebuke this friday . still , why should iran not have the bomb ?
after all , india , pakistan and israel are all nuclear powers , right ?
if you follow this logic - and cast aside for a moment the fact that by signing the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- iran has pledged not to acquire nuclear weapons - then you had better ponder the following . setti n g off a n uclear arms race ? first , when iran gets the bomb , be prepared for a nuclear arms race .
saudi arabia , egypt and turkey -lrb- perhaps syria , algeria and eventually iraq -rrb- would all find it hard to understand that they do not enjoy the right to a nuclear option .
this is presumably a principal reason why -lrb- former german foreign minister -rrb- joschka fischer once described the thought of iran with the bomb as one of the worst imaginable nightmares . second , imagine an emboldened iran meddling to an even greater extent in iraq and afghanistan .
the mullahs may have an interest in stability in both countries ; but most surely not in democracy and pro-western governments .
expect more dead americans -lrb- and germans -rrb- in the short-term . third , bet on significantly higher oil prices , says henry sokolksi , director of the nonproliferation policy education center in washington .
a nuclear iran may feel tempted to intimidate saudi arabia -lrb- which has the world 's largest oil production capacity -rrb- , according to sokolski , or perhaps even threaten the freedom of the seas to manipulate oil prices dramatically upward . more terrorism to come ? fourth , get used to more terrorism .
iran remains a prominent supporter of palestinian terror , of course .
but the iranian regime has also struck targets in europe in the 1980s and 1990s .
there is evidence , moreover , that as recently as 2004 the iranians sought to assist terrorist groups in identify targets in the united states . one feeble excuse made on behalf of the iranian regime is that iran has legitimate security concerns : it feels threatened by the us presence in iraq and afghanistan .
but then iran had been busy pursuing its bomb long before the united states ever had troops in either country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeffrey gedmin iran 's leaders say ahmadineejad wants to wipe israel off the map .
the mullahs say they want to be a regional hegemonic power .
the iranian president also says iran wants more .
ahmadineejad talks of the rising islamic " superpower " and a coming " clash of civilizations . "
where insanity meets modern technology , there is surely reason for concern . jeffrey gedmi n is director of the aspe n i n stitute berli n send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel , putin hail gas deal , disagree on iran concluding their two-day summit in siberia , russian and german leaders saw the signing of a major joint venture between companies from both countries to develop a natural gas field .
they failed to agree on iran .
-lrb- april 27 , 2006 -rrb- un nuclear report expected to be bad news for iran , world un nuclear chief mohamed elbaradei is expected to report friday that iran has failed to meet a un deadline to stop enriching uranium , opening the door to possible sanctions against the islamic republic .
-lrb- april 28 , 2006 -rrb- guest commentary : it 's time to compromise iran and the us need to tone down their rhetoric and start showing a willingness to compromise in order to resolve the nuclear crisis diplomatically , says janet kursawe of the german institute for middle east studies .

" we will now be asking the security council to increase the pressure on iran , so that the international community can be assured that its nuclear program is not a threat to peace and security , " british foreign secretary jack straw said . the international atomic energy agency said in a report that iran had not met demands to freeze uranium enrichment , american , british and french diplomats said they expected to present a text in the security council next week . " after more than three years of agency efforts to seek clarity about all aspects of iran 's nuclear program , the existing gaps in knowledge continue to be a matter of concern , " the iaea report said .
" any progress in that regard requires full transparency and active cooperation by iran . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier called for " international unity " germany committed to peaceful solution german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called for the international community to close ranks in opposition to the iranian nuclear program and push for a peaceful solution . steinmeier said germany would be prepared to restart negotiations with iran , but only if teheran produced a solid basis for negotiations but remained cautious , adding " until now there have not been any signals of compromise . " french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy also called for iranian " gestures that will re-establish confidence about the goals of their nuclear program . " iran says its program is part of a peaceful civilian nuclear energy drive .
the united states and europe fear , however , that it is hiding secret atomic weapons development . iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad said friday that iran was being denied its right to atomic energy and issued another veiled threat to cut off ties with the un 's nuclear watchdog . " we still want to work within the framework of the agency and we are committed to its regulations , " ahmadinejad told the official iranian irna agency .
" but if these regulations that guarantee our rights are used against us , we will totally change our way of dealing with the organizations . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad said iran would offer a timetable to work with the iaea iran wants iaea , not security council , to organize inspections iran has , however , offered to provide a timetable for cooperation with un nuclear inspectors if the un nuclear agency , rather than the security council , oversees iranian compliance , according to the un agency . " iran will provide a timetable within the next three weeks " if " the iran nuclear dossier will remain , in full , in the framework of the iaea and under its safeguards , " according to friday 's iaea report . a chapter 7 resolution , under which efforts to enact sanctions would be taken , is invoked to take : " action with respect to threats to the peace , breaches of the peace , and acts of aggression . "
several security council resolutions against iraq were taken under chapter 7 , before the march 2003 us-led invasion . the resolutions are binding on all un member states , but before action can be taken , chapter 7 says , the council can first " call upon the parties concerned to comply with such provisional measures as it deems necessary or desirable .

" we will study this report very carefully with the aim of agreeing a position and possible future steps to resolve the issues surrounding the iranian nuclear problem , " deputy foreign minister sergei kislyak told interfax , saying any further comments at this point would be premature . un diplomats made clear that the new resolution would only be a first step that would be followed by another resolution mandating sanctions . under the charter , when the security council has noted the " failure to comply with such provisional measures " then it should move on to more serious measures . article 41 of the chapter allows for sanctions , including economic and transport measures or the severance of diplomatic relations . if the council decides that measures under article 41 have failed , then article 42 states " it may take such action by air , sea , or land forces as may be necessary to maintain or restore international peace and security .

ahmadinejad and bush iran and the us need to tone down their rhetoric and start showing a willingness to compromise in order to resolve the nuclear crisis diplomatically , says janet kursawe of the german institute for middle east studies . when the un security council 's ultimatum calling on iran to halt its nuclear program expires on friday , a positive outcome in the form of iran giving in to the demands is highly unlikely .
that 's not very surprising , considering that chances of success were limited from the beginning .
and since the ultimatum was not issued in the form of a resolution that 's binding in terms of international law , sanctions are not going to follow . thirty days ago , at the time the ultimatum was given , the iranian government reacted quickly by saying that it would not give in to international pressure by giving up its right to peaceful use of nuclear power .
tehran 's announcement to withdraw from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and the international atomic energy agency in case of sanctions were also predictable . what 's surprising is the escalation of the last few months .
ever since iran 's sixth president , mahmoud ahmadinejad , took office , the dynamics of conflict that the us and iran engaged in via provocative statements have made it increasingly difficult to reach a diplomatic solution . both sides seem to have found a perfect match : ahmadinejad 's piety and self-presentation , combined with excessive nationalism and a readiness to sacrifice , is the logical response to george w. bush 's sense of mission . blow n out of proportio n the demands on iran that are unique in the non-proliferation treaty 's history are insulting and offending when one considers the country 's significant sense of national pride and the fact that iran has been a member of the treaty since 1968 . the situation has paved the way to turn the right to use nuclear power into a question of national self-determination , as happened since ahmadinejad took over .
his government and radical , conservative forces of other political organs have managed to preempt all domestic and foreign policy issues in the dispute over iran 's right to use nuclear power , limiting the power of the opposition even further as a result . no one helps iran 's leader more in this respect than the us government .
while opposition voices are increasingly calling for an end to the course of confrontation and back a compromise and even a temporary halt to uranium enrichment , their power and ability to act is extremely limited . a deteriorating political climate and increasing human rights abuses are a consequence of iran 's growing isolation .
should the isolation continue , the conservative , radical establishment will consolidate its political power even further and lead to a militarization of domestic and foreign policies . mutual suspicio n s preve n t solutio n iran is still a long way from being able to produce nuclear weapons .
should the conflict continue , the government is certain to increase its efforts in the field of nuclear research and will use them to raise its deterrent potential .
ahmadinejad 's propagandistic remarks during military exercises at the beginning of april served the same purpose . mutual suspicion and alternating threats between the us and iran are currently the biggest hindrances to a diplomatic solution .
iran feels threatened because of us military presence in its immediate vicinity and because of washington 's assurances that it wants to bring about a regime change in tehran .
the fact that israel feels threatened - and exercises pressure on the us - because of ahmadinejad 's anti-semitic remarks also contributes to the dynamics of escalation . the current insistence on refusing to compromise could lead to a decision to push the military option .
any military action - even a limited one that only aims to destroy nuclear plants - will have fatal security consequences for the region in the long run . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : janet kursawe instead , people should consider rethinking a russian proposal that was outright rejected by the us administration .
moscow suggested that the iranian nuclear program should continue outside the country with russia 's technological help .
in order for this to happen , however , all sides would have to work towards de-escalating the situation and the us government would have to be willing to sit down and negotiate with iran . janet kursawe is an ethnologist , political scientist and psychologist .

ahmadinejad and bush iran and the us need to tone down their rhetoric and start showing a willingness to compromise in order to resolve the nuclear crisis diplomatically , says janet kursawe of the german institute for middle east studies . when the un security council 's ultimatum calling on iran to halt its nuclear program expires on friday , a positive outcome in the form of iran giving in to the demands is highly unlikely .
that 's not very surprising , considering that chances of success were limited from the beginning .
and since the ultimatum was not issued in the form of a resolution that 's binding in terms of international law , sanctions are not going to follow . thirty days ago , at the time the ultimatum was given , the iranian government reacted quickly by saying that it would not give in to international pressure by giving up its right to peaceful use of nuclear power .
tehran 's announcement to withdraw from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and the international atomic energy agency in case of sanctions were also predictable . what 's surprising is the escalation of the last few months .

ahmadinejad and bush iran and the us need to tone down their rhetoric and start showing a willingness to compromise in order to resolve the nuclear crisis diplomatically , says janet kursawe of the german institute for middle east studies . when the un security council 's ultimatum calling on iran to halt its nuclear program expires on friday , a positive outcome in the form of iran giving in to the demands is highly unlikely .
that 's not very surprising , considering that chances of success were limited from the beginning .
and since the ultimatum was not issued in the form of a resolution that 's binding in terms of international law , sanctions are not going to follow . thirty days ago , at the time the ultimatum was given , the iranian government reacted quickly by saying that it would not give in to international pressure by giving up its right to peaceful use of nuclear power .
tehran 's announcement to withdraw from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and the international atomic energy agency in case of sanctions were also predictable . what 's surprising is the escalation of the last few months .
ever since iran 's sixth president , mahmoud ahmadinejad , took office , the dynamics of conflict that the us and iran engaged in via provocative statements have made it increasingly difficult to reach a diplomatic solution . both sides seem to have found a perfect match : ahmadinejad 's piety and self-presentation , combined with excessive nationalism and a readiness to sacrifice , is the logical response to george w. bush 's sense of mission . blow n out of proportio n the demands on iran that are unique in the non-proliferation treaty 's history are insulting and offending when one considers the country 's significant sense of national pride and the fact that iran has been a member of the treaty since 1968 . the situation has paved the way to turn the right to use nuclear power into a question of national self-determination , as happened since ahmadinejad took over .
his government and radical , conservative forces of other political organs have managed to preempt all domestic and foreign policy issues in the dispute over iran 's right to use nuclear power , limiting the power of the opposition even further as a result . no one helps iran 's leader more in this respect than the us government .
while opposition voices are increasingly calling for an end to the course of confrontation and back a compromise and even a temporary halt to uranium enrichment , their power and ability to act is extremely limited . a deteriorating political climate and increasing human rights abuses are a consequence of iran 's growing isolation .
should the isolation continue , the conservative , radical establishment will consolidate its political power even further and lead to a militarization of domestic and foreign policies . mutual suspicio n s preve n t solutio n iran is still a long way from being able to produce nuclear weapons .
should the conflict continue , the government is certain to increase its efforts in the field of nuclear research and will use them to raise its deterrent potential .
ahmadinejad 's propagandistic remarks during military exercises at the beginning of april served the same purpose . mutual suspicion and alternating threats between the us and iran are currently the biggest hindrances to a diplomatic solution .
iran feels threatened because of us military presence in its immediate vicinity and because of washington 's assurances that it wants to bring about a regime change in tehran .
the fact that israel feels threatened - and exercises pressure on the us - because of ahmadinejad 's anti-semitic remarks also contributes to the dynamics of escalation . the current insistence on refusing to compromise could lead to a decision to push the military option .
any military action - even a limited one that only aims to destroy nuclear plants - will have fatal security consequences for the region in the long run . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : janet kursawe instead , people should consider rethinking a russian proposal that was outright rejected by the us administration .
moscow suggested that the iranian nuclear program should continue outside the country with russia 's technological help .
in order for this to happen , however , all sides would have to work towards de-escalating the situation and the us government would have to be willing to sit down and negotiate with iran . janet kursawe is an ethnologist , political scientist and psychologist .

ukraine reiterated friday its desire to join nato despite russian qualms , after the western alliance hinted heavily that the politically troubled ex-soviet state could soon win approval for membership . during the meeting of nato foreign ministers in the bulgarian capital sofia , ukrainian foreign minister borys tarasyuk said : " ukraine 's strategy towards joining nato is irreversible . " the sofia talks were the first such contact with nato since parliamentary elections on march 26 which were widely praised as free and fair , although they have left kiev in political limbo . nato officials at the sofia talks say there is widespread support for ukraine 's bid , despite its political problems .
speaking on thursday , nato head jaap de hoop scheffer hinted there could be an opening to aspiring members at a summit in the latvian capital in november . " i have no doubt that in riga , countries aspiring to nato membership will want a signal .
there will be a signal at riga , " de hoop scheffer said . " when they are ready , nato is ready , " he said in comments that referred also to georgia , another ex-soviet republic bidding to join nato . ukraine struggles with a turbulent past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : independence square in ukraine 's capital kiev addressing the political dispute that has dragged on in ukraine since march 26 parliamentary elections , u.s. secretary of state condoleezza rice said the country faced an uphill struggle to join nato . " the ukrainian government and the ukrainian people will have to decide whether or not this is something that they wish to pursue , " rice told reporters on the sidelines of the sofia meeting on thursday .
" and they will also have to work very hard , i think , to meet the criteria , " she added . ukrainian president viktor yushchenko has set out an ambitious pro-west agenda since coming to power in 2005 after a wave of popular protests known as the " orange revolution " that brought down a moscow-backed regime . but his party performed badly in march and has been forced into coalition talks that could bring to power either a government favoring links with europe and nato or one preferring a strong bond with russia . new dividing lines in europe ? moscow , which held sway over kiev in soviet times and maintains a strong influence over its western neighbor , meanwhile reasserted its opposition to ukraine 's nato hopes . " we are against the creation of new dividing lines in europe , " mikhail kamynin , russia 's foreign ministry spokesman , was quoted as saying in an interview with ria-novosti news agency on thursday . " today there are algorithms of cooperation with nato that allow states to cooperate in the widest security spectrum without formal accession to the alliance , " kamynin said . nato sending ukraine mixed signals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato foreign ministers meeting at the national palace of culture in sofia but nato on thursday appeared to play down reports that ukraine could be offered the alliance 's " membership action plan " , the key step before being invited to join . " ukraine 's aspirations to join the alliance are welcomed by all allies , " nato spokesman james appathurai told reporters in sofia .
" what i can not predict is timelines for membership action plans , " he added . albania , croatia and macedonia are currently in the membership action plan with the north atlantic treaty organisation -lrb- nato -rrb- . ten countries that were once allied with russia - bulgaria , czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , poland , romania , slovakia and slovenia - have joined nato since 1999 . also on friday , during a sideline meeting , u.s. secretary of state condoleezza rice signed a bilateral agreement with bulgarian officials to establish three military bases in the country as the u.s. shifts troops from old cold war positions to smaller units closer to the middle east and africa . nato boosts darfur aid moving from the european to the african continent during talks in sofia , nato has said it is ready to boost assistance in sudan 's violence-scarred darfur region .
the alliance has said it will increase logistical support , but said any presence should be limited and only in support of african or u.n. efforts . in nato 's first operation on the african continent , the alliance has provided training and transportation to african union troops trying to stem the violence there .

he has accused the cia of kidnapping him in late 2003 from macedonia and interrogating him in afghanistan . skopje has denied any involvement in the alleged operation by the us spy agency . upon arrival , the delegation met macedonian president branko crvenkovski and were due to meet deputy prime minister radmila secerinska and former foreign minister slobodan casule , the eu spokesman andrea angeli told afp news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giovanni claudio fava , european lawmaker leading cia flight probe " the target is the truth , just the truth , " the eu lawmaker leading the probe , claudio fava , told reporters after the meeting with crvenkovski . the eu deputies are scheduled to meet former interior minister siljan avramovski , his successor ljubomir mihajlovski and parliamentary speaker ljupco jordanovski on friday . earlier this year european deputies decided to set up a special committee to look into the allegations that the central intelligence agency secretly operated flights carrying prisoners it considered terror suspects which passed through eu territory . the parliament 's inquiry started in january and is expected to issue a first report next month . more than 1,000 secret cia flights have gone through european airspace and airports since 2001 without governments requesting information , fava said upon presenting a preliminary report . " it is hard to believe that the authorities and governments of certain countries were unaware of what was going on on their territory .
our probe shows that they must have known , " fava said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. col. steven f. dreyer at the air base near bucharest fava singled out sweden , italy and bosnia for particular criticism .
for more than three months , the eu parliamentary inquiry has heard testimony from alleged victims and human rights groups - all saying that european states had handed over terrorism suspects to foreign agents , and ignoring hundreds of cia flights that had used their airports .
some former detainees provided detailed accounts of alleged torture carried out in secret prisons outside eu or us jurisdiction . the eu lawmakers investigating the khalid al-masri case in macedonia want to find out how the plane with al-masri on board could leave europe unchallenged . fava believes that there were hundreds of similar incidents .
" if we look at all the testimonies we have got , it becomes very clear that these incidents were n't sporadic , but that it was a common practice .
that 's the only conclusion i can draw , " fava said . the cia declined to comment on the eu parliamentarians ' findings .
the inquiry committee has no legal powers , but it will recommend what political action should be taken against any countries found to have been involved , including the united states .
several eu lawmakers are expected to go to washington in early may to try to meet secretary of state condoleezza rice and cia chief porter goss . the european union has granted macedonia candidate status , but no date has been set to begin talks for membership in the bloc . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the cia affair and eu : who has responsiblity ?

why would this be so dangerous ?
the aspen 's institute jeffrey gedmin offers answers . the us and the european union share nearly identical views .
teheran says it wants nuclear power for peaceful purposes .
no one believes the mullahs .
iran should have enough oil and gas to take care of its energy needs for several hundred years .
there are other reasons to believe that the government in teheran is lying .
iran played cat and mouse with the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- for 18 years .
we expect the iaea to issue iran yet another rebuke this friday . still , why should iran not have the bomb ?
after all , india , pakistan and israel are all nuclear powers , right ?
if you follow this logic - and cast aside for a moment the fact that by signing the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- iran has pledged not to acquire nuclear weapons - then you had better ponder the following . setti n g off a n uclear arms race ? first , when iran gets the bomb , be prepared for a nuclear arms race .
saudi arabia , egypt and turkey -lrb- perhaps syria , algeria and eventually iraq -rrb- would all find it hard to understand that they do not enjoy the right to a nuclear option .
this is presumably a principal reason why -lrb- former german foreign minister -rrb- joschka fischer once described the thought of iran with the bomb as one of the worst imaginable nightmares . second , imagine an emboldened iran meddling to an even greater extent in iraq and afghanistan .
the mullahs may have an interest in stability in both countries ; but most surely not in democracy and pro-western governments .
expect more dead americans -lrb- and germans -rrb- in the short-term . third , bet on significantly higher oil prices , says henry sokolksi , director of the nonproliferation policy education center in washington .
a nuclear iran may feel tempted to intimidate saudi arabia -lrb- which has the world 's largest oil production capacity -rrb- , according to sokolski , or perhaps even threaten the freedom of the seas to manipulate oil prices dramatically upward . more terrorism to come ? fourth , get used to more terrorism .
iran remains a prominent supporter of palestinian terror , of course .
but the iranian regime has also struck targets in europe in the 1980s and 1990s .
there is evidence , moreover , that as recently as 2004 the iranians sought to assist terrorist groups in identify targets in the united states . one feeble excuse made on behalf of the iranian regime is that iran has legitimate security concerns : it feels threatened by the us presence in iraq and afghanistan .
but then iran had been busy pursuing its bomb long before the united states ever had troops in either country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeffrey gedmin iran 's leaders say ahmadineejad wants to wipe israel off the map .
the mullahs say they want to be a regional hegemonic power .
the iranian president also says iran wants more .
ahmadineejad talks of the rising islamic " superpower " and a coming " clash of civilizations . "
where insanity meets modern technology , there is surely reason for concern . jeffrey gedmi n is director of the aspe n i n stitute berli n send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel , putin hail gas deal , disagree on iran concluding their two-day summit in siberia , russian and german leaders saw the signing of a major joint venture between companies from both countries to develop a natural gas field .

tehran 's decision to ignore a un ultimatum to freeze its nuclear enrichment work was described as irresponsible and a slap in the face of the international community . in the search for solutions to the standoff , wolfgang gerhardt , a foreign policy expert from the opposition liberal free democrats , said russia and china must play a more pro-active role now . " we can only stop tehran if russia and china come to realize that they can no longer stand on the sidelines in this dispute , " he said .
" within the next few days it is crucial that these countries drive home to iran that it will definitely face punitive action if it continues down this path of confrontation . " ingo friedrich , a member of the conservative csu party also believes that moscow and beijing must now come forward to step up international pressure on iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
he thinks that efforts within the united nations aimed at imposing sanctions must be intensified . " it is now a matter of credibility for the united nations to impose sanctions , " he said .
" iran must be made to understand that it can not defy demands by the international community without punishment . " military actio n u n likely as the conflict is heating up , the prospect of a military confrontation is looming ever larger .
washington has n't ruled out the use of military force to stop iran building nuclear weapons . but ullrich klose , foreign policy spokesman of the social democrats said he believes this is just empty rhetoric .
he added that he is rather pessimistic about a positive outcome of the conflict . " people say the conflict will develop similar to what we saw in iraq , " klose said .
" i do n't think this will happen because the united states have had a bad time of it there and a war with iran would overstretch the country 's capabilities .
so in the end we 'll either have a political solution or face the situation that iran continues its nuclear program unfazed . " public anger in germany about the mullah regime in tehran has been fuelled recently after ahamadinejad said he wanted to visit germany to attend one of iran 's world cup soccer matches this summer .
german politicians such as csu leader edmund stoiber have vowed to do everything in their power to prevent that .

" we will now be asking the security council to increase the pressure on iran , so that the international community can be assured that its nuclear program is not a threat to peace and security , " british foreign secretary jack straw said . the international atomic energy agency said in a report that iran had not met demands to freeze uranium enrichment , american , british and french diplomats said they expected to present a text in the security council next week . " after more than three years of agency efforts to seek clarity about all aspects of iran 's nuclear program , the existing gaps in knowledge continue to be a matter of concern , " the iaea report said .
" any progress in that regard requires full transparency and active cooperation by iran . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier called for " international unity " germany committed to peaceful solution german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called for the international community to close ranks in opposition to the iranian nuclear program and push for a peaceful solution . steinmeier said germany would be prepared to restart negotiations with iran , but only if teheran produced a solid basis for negotiations but remained cautious , adding " until now there have not been any signals of compromise . " french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy also called for iranian " gestures that will re-establish confidence about the goals of their nuclear program . " iran says its program is part of a peaceful civilian nuclear energy drive .
the united states and europe fear , however , that it is hiding secret atomic weapons development . iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad said friday that iran was being denied its right to atomic energy and issued another veiled threat to cut off ties with the un 's nuclear watchdog . " we still want to work within the framework of the agency and we are committed to its regulations , " ahmadinejad told the official iranian irna agency .
" but if these regulations that guarantee our rights are used against us , we will totally change our way of dealing with the organizations . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad said iran would offer a timetable to work with the iaea iran wants iaea , not security council , to organize inspections iran has , however , offered to provide a timetable for cooperation with un nuclear inspectors if the un nuclear agency , rather than the security council , oversees iranian compliance , according to the un agency . " iran will provide a timetable within the next three weeks " if " the iran nuclear dossier will remain , in full , in the framework of the iaea and under its safeguards , " according to friday 's iaea report . a chapter 7 resolution , under which efforts to enact sanctions would be taken , is invoked to take : " action with respect to threats to the peace , breaches of the peace , and acts of aggression .

why would this be so dangerous ?
the aspen 's institute jeffrey gedmin offers answers . the us and the european union share nearly identical views .
teheran says it wants nuclear power for peaceful purposes .
no one believes the mullahs .
iran should have enough oil and gas to take care of its energy needs for several hundred years .
there are other reasons to believe that the government in teheran is lying .
iran played cat and mouse with the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- for 18 years .
we expect the iaea to issue iran yet another rebuke this friday . still , why should iran not have the bomb ?
after all , india , pakistan and israel are all nuclear powers , right ?
if you follow this logic - and cast aside for a moment the fact that by signing the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- iran has pledged not to acquire nuclear weapons - then you had better ponder the following . setti n g off a n uclear arms race ? first , when iran gets the bomb , be prepared for a nuclear arms race .
saudi arabia , egypt and turkey -lrb- perhaps syria , algeria and eventually iraq -rrb- would all find it hard to understand that they do not enjoy the right to a nuclear option .
this is presumably a principal reason why -lrb- former german foreign minister -rrb- joschka fischer once described the thought of iran with the bomb as one of the worst imaginable nightmares . second , imagine an emboldened iran meddling to an even greater extent in iraq and afghanistan .
the mullahs may have an interest in stability in both countries ; but most surely not in democracy and pro-western governments .
expect more dead americans -lrb- and germans -rrb- in the short-term . third , bet on significantly higher oil prices , says henry sokolksi , director of the nonproliferation policy education center in washington .
a nuclear iran may feel tempted to intimidate saudi arabia -lrb- which has the world 's largest oil production capacity -rrb- , according to sokolski , or perhaps even threaten the freedom of the seas to manipulate oil prices dramatically upward . more terrorism to come ? fourth , get used to more terrorism .
iran remains a prominent supporter of palestinian terror , of course .
but the iranian regime has also struck targets in europe in the 1980s and 1990s .
there is evidence , moreover , that as recently as 2004 the iranians sought to assist terrorist groups in identify targets in the united states . one feeble excuse made on behalf of the iranian regime is that iran has legitimate security concerns : it feels threatened by the us presence in iraq and afghanistan .
but then iran had been busy pursuing its bomb long before the united states ever had troops in either country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeffrey gedmin iran 's leaders say ahmadineejad wants to wipe israel off the map .
the mullahs say they want to be a regional hegemonic power .
the iranian president also says iran wants more .
ahmadineejad talks of the rising islamic " superpower " and a coming " clash of civilizations . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.04.2006 putin : russia threatened by europe 's energy demands großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin threatens to take his massive energy resources elsewhere russia feels threatened by european union moves to curtail its role in europe 's energy markets and has no choice but to seek other buyers , president vladimir putin said thursday . " we are constantly hearing about some threat of dependence on russia , that something must be done to limit the entry of russian companies into the european market , " putin said at a joint news conference with german chancellor angela merkel after two days of talks focused on energy . " what are we supposed to do when we hear the same thing every day ?
we start looking for other markets .
when we continually hear the same thing , we perceive this as a threat to limit our admittance to the market and we begin to look for other outlets , " the russian leader said . putin said russia had no wish to cut back on supplies of energy to countries in europe - they depend overall on russia for around one-fourth of their natural gas supplies and a large share of oil supplies - and stressed that moscow had always been a reliable supplier independent of politics . " we have worked well with you for many years , even when there was the cold war . ...
day after day , the soviet union delivered for its partners in europe .
what is the point of stoking fears about excessive dependence with regard to russia today ? "
putin asked . moscow 's threat to shift energy priorities east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin is looking at china and the far east for energy partners putin and other top russian officials have however stressed in recent weeks that china , japan and other huge markets in asia are increasingly hungry for russian energy supplies and have warned that moscow may shift its priority to serving those clients at the expense of european buyers . the european union , some of whose members felt disruption to their gas supplies from russia in january when moscow briefly cut shipments to ukraine amid a price dispute , has responded by telling moscow not to " politicize " energy trade . while russia 's state-run gas giant gazprom , for example , has complained of efforts to block its expansion plans in european markets , it has also flatly rejected european demands that it relax its own domestic monopoly and open excess gas pipeline capacity to foreign firms . tensions with west exacerbated by energy struggles putin 's comments were certain to heighten tensions on energy between russia - the world 's second-largest crude oil exporter and largest supplier of natural gas - and the west , which is anxious over linkage of kremlin energy strategy with political objectives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and merkel found little common ground on energy issues in comments to officials on wednesday shortly before he greeted merkel , putin complained that russia 's aims to expand in western energy markets were being systematically thwarted by " unfair competition " barriers . " we are being blocked to the north , the south and the west on any pretext .
we have to find outlets , to fit into the global development process , " putin said wednesday hours before greeting merkel . by way of example he cited reports that the british government had recently considered modifying anti-monopoly legislation in such a way as to prevent gazprom from buying centrica , britain 's biggest household gas supplier . british prime minister tony blair ruled out any move to block the takeover , the daily financial times reported wednesday , sparking a surge in centrica 's share price . putin said gazprom had never intended to buy the company anyway .
" we need to agree on the rules of the game " and those should be applied on an equal basis to all countries , he said . eu failing in bid to rein in russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to ensure the supply stays open the european union has ratcheted up pressure on russia to sign its energy charter , a document that regulates energy transport and would prohibit any signatory from disrupting contracted supplies for any reason . a top gazprom official , alexander medvedev , told participants at an economic forum in london earlier this week that the pact was " stillborn . " however , putin 's economic advisor referred to the prickly eu-russian relationship as a normal sign of a changing balance of power . " having this tension is okay , it 's a problem with any growth , " said igor shuvalov , who is also russia 's sherpa to the group of eight industrialized countries .
" russia is part of the family ; we were considered the small kid .
now we are growing and we raise our voice , " he added . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel , putin hail gas deal , disagree on iran concluding their two-day summit in siberia , russian and german leaders saw the signing of a major joint venture between companies from both countries to develop a natural gas field .

" we will now be asking the security council to increase the pressure on iran , so that the international community can be assured that its nuclear program is not a threat to peace and security , " british foreign secretary jack straw said . the international atomic energy agency said in a report that iran had not met demands to freeze uranium enrichment , american , british and french diplomats said they expected to present a text in the security council next week . " after more than three years of agency efforts to seek clarity about all aspects of iran 's nuclear program , the existing gaps in knowledge continue to be a matter of concern , " the iaea report said .
" any progress in that regard requires full transparency and active cooperation by iran . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier called for " international unity " germany committed to peaceful solution german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called for the international community to close ranks in opposition to the iranian nuclear program and push for a peaceful solution . steinmeier said germany would be prepared to restart negotiations with iran , but only if teheran produced a solid basis for negotiations but remained cautious , adding " until now there have not been any signals of compromise . " french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy also called for iranian " gestures that will re-establish confidence about the goals of their nuclear program . " iran says its program is part of a peaceful civilian nuclear energy drive .
the united states and europe fear , however , that it is hiding secret atomic weapons development . iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad said friday that iran was being denied its right to atomic energy and issued another veiled threat to cut off ties with the un 's nuclear watchdog . " we still want to work within the framework of the agency and we are committed to its regulations , " ahmadinejad told the official iranian irna agency .
" but if these regulations that guarantee our rights are used against us , we will totally change our way of dealing with the organizations . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad said iran would offer a timetable to work with the iaea iran wants iaea , not security council , to organize inspections iran has , however , offered to provide a timetable for cooperation with un nuclear inspectors if the un nuclear agency , rather than the security council , oversees iranian compliance , according to the un agency . " iran will provide a timetable within the next three weeks " if " the iran nuclear dossier will remain , in full , in the framework of the iaea and under its safeguards , " according to friday 's iaea report . a chapter 7 resolution , under which efforts to enact sanctions would be taken , is invoked to take : " action with respect to threats to the peace , breaches of the peace , and acts of aggression . "
several security council resolutions against iraq were taken under chapter 7 , before the march 2003 us-led invasion . the resolutions are binding on all un member states , but before action can be taken , chapter 7 says , the council can first " call upon the parties concerned to comply with such provisional measures as it deems necessary or desirable . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the security council still favor diplomacy in dealing with iran russian , chinese veto threat holds sanctions in check diplomats at the united nations said the upcoming resolution would not contain a threat of sanctions against iran , which are strenuously opposed by russia and china , two security council members with veto powers .
" we will study this report very carefully with the aim of agreeing a position and possible future steps to resolve the issues surrounding the iranian nuclear problem , " deputy foreign minister sergei kislyak told interfax , saying any further comments at this point would be premature . un diplomats made clear that the new resolution would only be a first step that would be followed by another resolution mandating sanctions . under the charter , when the security council has noted the " failure to comply with such provisional measures " then it should move on to more serious measures . article 41 of the chapter allows for sanctions , including economic and transport measures or the severance of diplomatic relations . if the council decides that measures under article 41 have failed , then article 42 states " it may take such action by air , sea , or land forces as may be necessary to maintain or restore international peace and security .

ukraine reiterated friday its desire to join nato despite russian qualms , after the western alliance hinted heavily that the politically troubled ex-soviet state could soon win approval for membership . during the meeting of nato foreign ministers in the bulgarian capital sofia , ukrainian foreign minister borys tarasyuk said : " ukraine 's strategy towards joining nato is irreversible . " the sofia talks were the first such contact with nato since parliamentary elections on march 26 which were widely praised as free and fair , although they have left kiev in political limbo . nato officials at the sofia talks say there is widespread support for ukraine 's bid , despite its political problems .
speaking on thursday , nato head jaap de hoop scheffer hinted there could be an opening to aspiring members at a summit in the latvian capital in november . " i have no doubt that in riga , countries aspiring to nato membership will want a signal .
there will be a signal at riga , " de hoop scheffer said . " when they are ready , nato is ready , " he said in comments that referred also to georgia , another ex-soviet republic bidding to join nato . ukraine struggles with a turbulent past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : independence square in ukraine 's capital kiev addressing the political dispute that has dragged on in ukraine since march 26 parliamentary elections , u.s. secretary of state condoleezza rice said the country faced an uphill struggle to join nato . " the ukrainian government and the ukrainian people will have to decide whether or not this is something that they wish to pursue , " rice told reporters on the sidelines of the sofia meeting on thursday .
" and they will also have to work very hard , i think , to meet the criteria , " she added . ukrainian president viktor yushchenko has set out an ambitious pro-west agenda since coming to power in 2005 after a wave of popular protests known as the " orange revolution " that brought down a moscow-backed regime . but his party performed badly in march and has been forced into coalition talks that could bring to power either a government favoring links with europe and nato or one preferring a strong bond with russia . new dividing lines in europe ? moscow , which held sway over kiev in soviet times and maintains a strong influence over its western neighbor , meanwhile reasserted its opposition to ukraine 's nato hopes . " we are against the creation of new dividing lines in europe , " mikhail kamynin , russia 's foreign ministry spokesman , was quoted as saying in an interview with ria-novosti news agency on thursday . " today there are algorithms of cooperation with nato that allow states to cooperate in the widest security spectrum without formal accession to the alliance , " kamynin said . nato sending ukraine mixed signals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato foreign ministers meeting at the national palace of culture in sofia but nato on thursday appeared to play down reports that ukraine could be offered the alliance 's " membership action plan " , the key step before being invited to join . " ukraine 's aspirations to join the alliance are welcomed by all allies , " nato spokesman james appathurai told reporters in sofia .
" what i can not predict is timelines for membership action plans , " he added . albania , croatia and macedonia are currently in the membership action plan with the north atlantic treaty organisation -lrb- nato -rrb- . ten countries that were once allied with russia - bulgaria , czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , poland , romania , slovakia and slovenia - have joined nato since 1999 . also on friday , during a sideline meeting , u.s. secretary of state condoleezza rice signed a bilateral agreement with bulgarian officials to establish three military bases in the country as the u.s. shifts troops from old cold war positions to smaller units closer to the middle east and africa . nato boosts darfur aid moving from the european to the african continent during talks in sofia , nato has said it is ready to boost assistance in sudan 's violence-scarred darfur region .
the alliance has said it will increase logistical support , but said any presence should be limited and only in support of african or u.n. efforts . in nato 's first operation on the african continent , the alliance has provided training and transportation to african union troops trying to stem the violence there .

with not a mao jacket or red scarf in sight , it showcases vintage chic straight out of " barbarella . "
realistic it is n't . " we thought everyone in the gdr walked around in drab , dismal clothes , but suddenly we found this incredible stuff which showed there was a thriving fashion industry , " said caz hildebrand , the british art director who put the collection together . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " sibylle " - the arty face of gdr fashion but was there really ?
the photos were taken by günter rubitzsch , a leipzig-based photographer who worked regularly for women 's weeklies such as pramo -lrb- abbreviated from " praktische mode " or " practical fashion " -rrb- and für dich -lrb- " for you " -rrb- , magazines which featured sewing or knitting patterns for women who liked to make their own clothes .
and most of them had to . " everyone looked the same , so if you wanted something special you had to make it yourself , " explained antje lond benn , who studied at the technical college for clothing design in east berlin in the 1980s .
" fabrics and patterns were really cheap , and everyone would improvize with them .
and if you were lucky , you could fit into the kids ' clothes , which were heavily subsidized . " honecker 's haute couture so the groovy gdr depicted in " off the wall " might , perhaps , be a little off the mark .
but at least it scuppers a few cliches . " it 's an acknowledgment of my work , and i 'm glad it shows a different side of the gdr , " said rubitzsch .

with not a mao jacket or red scarf in sight , it showcases vintage chic straight out of " barbarella . "
realistic it is n't . " we thought everyone in the gdr walked around in drab , dismal clothes , but suddenly we found this incredible stuff which showed there was a thriving fashion industry , " said caz hildebrand , the british art director who put the collection together . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " sibylle " - the arty face of gdr fashion but was there really ?
the photos were taken by günter rubitzsch , a leipzig-based photographer who worked regularly for women 's weeklies such as pramo -lrb- abbreviated from " praktische mode " or " practical fashion " -rrb- and für dich -lrb- " for you " -rrb- , magazines which featured sewing or knitting patterns for women who liked to make their own clothes .
and most of them had to . " everyone looked the same , so if you wanted something special you had to make it yourself , " explained antje lond benn , who studied at the technical college for clothing design in east berlin in the 1980s .
" fabrics and patterns were really cheap , and everyone would improvize with them .
and if you were lucky , you could fit into the kids ' clothes , which were heavily subsidized . " honecker 's haute couture so the groovy gdr depicted in " off the wall " might , perhaps , be a little off the mark .
but at least it scuppers a few cliches . " it 's an acknowledgment of my work , and i 'm glad it shows a different side of the gdr , " said rubitzsch .
" it proves that we were n't all impoverished and that it was possible to be creative despite the restrictions we worked with . " after the berlin wall fell , he sold the rights to his pictures to the international agency akg images - and never thought that one day , they 'd be rediscovered as high camp , communist-style . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fashion in ' sybille ' captured a mood - it did n't showcase clothes dating back to decades that taste forgot not just in east germany , what really sets his pictures apart are their unmistakably socialist backdrops .
one image features models reclining in vamped-up folksy frocks against a gleaming combine harvester , while others show girls posing in front of chemical plants , industrial sites and of course , the inevitable trabants . " i worked in leipzig , and there was a limit to the backdrops available , " explained rubitzsch .
" the city was very industrial and that 's why many of the pictures were taken in front of factories or agricultural cooperatives . " " in those days , fashion photography in the west was set in exotic locations like the caribbean and so on , " he pointed out .
" obviously , we could n't match that - we had to make do with what we had , and that meant being very inventive . " sibylle woman bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gdr style , circa 1985 meanwhile , at the more sophisticated end of the market was the magazine sibylle , which took its cues less from good housekeeping and more from french vogue .
the fashion conscious woman 's style bible , its editor was dorothea melis , who later compiled the only book on gdr fashion to have been published in germany since the demise of communism .
" sibylle - fashion photography from three decades of the gdr " appeared in 1998 and flew off the shelves . dorothea melis agrees with rubitzsch . " necessity is the mother of invention , " she said .
" everyone has this idea that women in the gdr went round in aprons , headscarves and flat shoes , so i thought : i 'll show you how stylish we really were !
back then women were so much more creative than are today , they 'd take the cotton we were getting from somewhere like uzbekistan and dye or embroider it to rework classic looks we 'd seen tourists wearing , on television or in magazines from the west . " like rubitzsch , she wholeheartedly rejects the idea that fashion was a thwarted industry in the gdr .
" back then , we 'd have one editor , one photographer and two models on an average photo shoot .
we had to do everything ourselves , there was no huge team like they have today .
we 'd all have to double up .
the editor would do the girls ' make-up , the photographer would also be the driver .
it was a very intense experience . " not so exquisite " exquisit " after leaving sibylle , melis went on to work in the publicity department of the gdr 's most upmarket store " exquisit , " where most of the clothes modeled in " off the wall " would have been sold . " exquisit opened in 1970 as a deliberate attempt on the part of the party to placate the masses and make them think the gdr was n't all bad , " she said . # b # it stocked western labels such as daniel hechter and georges rech , and until the end of communism , remained the first port-of-call for any east germans wanting to treat themselves - despite a minor upset in the mid-80s when customer complaints about a range of italian shirts that had been falling apart prompted the store to reveal they were actually made from shrouds . the rest of the time , people settled with cheap imitations of western styles , with the gdr even making a point of designing its own synthetics , such as the nylon-like " dederon , " the frotte-esque " malimo , " and its piece de resistance , the extraordinarily static " präsent 20 , " specially developed for the 20th anniversary of the gdr in 1969 . " there was no scope to actually design , " said antje lond benn .

tehran 's decision to ignore a un ultimatum to freeze its nuclear enrichment work was described as irresponsible and a slap in the face of the international community . in the search for solutions to the standoff , wolfgang gerhardt , a foreign policy expert from the opposition liberal free democrats , said russia and china must play a more pro-active role now . " we can only stop tehran if russia and china come to realize that they can no longer stand on the sidelines in this dispute , " he said .
" within the next few days it is crucial that these countries drive home to iran that it will definitely face punitive action if it continues down this path of confrontation . " ingo friedrich , a member of the conservative csu party also believes that moscow and beijing must now come forward to step up international pressure on iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
he thinks that efforts within the united nations aimed at imposing sanctions must be intensified . " it is now a matter of credibility for the united nations to impose sanctions , " he said .
" iran must be made to understand that it can not defy demands by the international community without punishment . " military actio n u n likely as the conflict is heating up , the prospect of a military confrontation is looming ever larger .
washington has n't ruled out the use of military force to stop iran building nuclear weapons . but ullrich klose , foreign policy spokesman of the social democrats said he believes this is just empty rhetoric .

" i do n't think this will happen because the united states have had a bad time of it there and a war with iran would overstretch the country 's capabilities .

" public anger in germany about the mullah regime in tehran has been fuelled recently after ahamadinejad said he wanted to visit germany to attend one of iran 's world cup soccer matches this summer .
german politicians such as csu leader edmund stoiber have vowed to do everything in their power to prevent that .

why would this be so dangerous ?
the aspen 's institute jeffrey gedmin offers answers . the us and the european union share nearly identical views .
teheran says it wants nuclear power for peaceful purposes .
no one believes the mullahs .
iran should have enough oil and gas to take care of its energy needs for several hundred years .
there are other reasons to believe that the government in teheran is lying .
iran played cat and mouse with the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- for 18 years .
we expect the iaea to issue iran yet another rebuke this friday . still , why should iran not have the bomb ?
after all , india , pakistan and israel are all nuclear powers , right ?
if you follow this logic - and cast aside for a moment the fact that by signing the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- iran has pledged not to acquire nuclear weapons - then you had better ponder the following . setti n g off a n uclear arms race ? first , when iran gets the bomb , be prepared for a nuclear arms race .
saudi arabia , egypt and turkey -lrb- perhaps syria , algeria and eventually iraq -rrb- would all find it hard to understand that they do not enjoy the right to a nuclear option .
this is presumably a principal reason why -lrb- former german foreign minister -rrb- joschka fischer once described the thought of iran with the bomb as one of the worst imaginable nightmares . second , imagine an emboldened iran meddling to an even greater extent in iraq and afghanistan .
the mullahs may have an interest in stability in both countries ; but most surely not in democracy and pro-western governments .
expect more dead americans -lrb- and germans -rrb- in the short-term . third , bet on significantly higher oil prices , says henry sokolksi , director of the nonproliferation policy education center in washington .
a nuclear iran may feel tempted to intimidate saudi arabia -lrb- which has the world 's largest oil production capacity -rrb- , according to sokolski , or perhaps even threaten the freedom of the seas to manipulate oil prices dramatically upward . more terrorism to come ? fourth , get used to more terrorism .
iran remains a prominent supporter of palestinian terror , of course .
but the iranian regime has also struck targets in europe in the 1980s and 1990s .
there is evidence , moreover , that as recently as 2004 the iranians sought to assist terrorist groups in identify targets in the united states . one feeble excuse made on behalf of the iranian regime is that iran has legitimate security concerns : it feels threatened by the us presence in iraq and afghanistan .
but then iran had been busy pursuing its bomb long before the united states ever had troops in either country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeffrey gedmin iran 's leaders say ahmadineejad wants to wipe israel off the map .

ukraine reiterated friday its desire to join nato despite russian qualms , after the western alliance hinted heavily that the politically troubled ex-soviet state could soon win approval for membership . during the meeting of nato foreign ministers in the bulgarian capital sofia , ukrainian foreign minister borys tarasyuk said : " ukraine 's strategy towards joining nato is irreversible . " the sofia talks were the first such contact with nato since parliamentary elections on march 26 which were widely praised as free and fair , although they have left kiev in political limbo . nato officials at the sofia talks say there is widespread support for ukraine 's bid , despite its political problems .
speaking on thursday , nato head jaap de hoop scheffer hinted there could be an opening to aspiring members at a summit in the latvian capital in november . " i have no doubt that in riga , countries aspiring to nato membership will want a signal .
there will be a signal at riga , " de hoop scheffer said . " when they are ready , nato is ready , " he said in comments that referred also to georgia , another ex-soviet republic bidding to join nato . ukraine struggles with a turbulent past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : independence square in ukraine 's capital kiev addressing the political dispute that has dragged on in ukraine since march 26 parliamentary elections , u.s. secretary of state condoleezza rice said the country faced an uphill struggle to join nato . " the ukrainian government and the ukrainian people will have to decide whether or not this is something that they wish to pursue , " rice told reporters on the sidelines of the sofia meeting on thursday .
" and they will also have to work very hard , i think , to meet the criteria , " she added . ukrainian president viktor yushchenko has set out an ambitious pro-west agenda since coming to power in 2005 after a wave of popular protests known as the " orange revolution " that brought down a moscow-backed regime . but his party performed badly in march and has been forced into coalition talks that could bring to power either a government favoring links with europe and nato or one preferring a strong bond with russia . new dividing lines in europe ? moscow , which held sway over kiev in soviet times and maintains a strong influence over its western neighbor , meanwhile reasserted its opposition to ukraine 's nato hopes . " we are against the creation of new dividing lines in europe , " mikhail kamynin , russia 's foreign ministry spokesman , was quoted as saying in an interview with ria-novosti news agency on thursday . " today there are algorithms of cooperation with nato that allow states to cooperate in the widest security spectrum without formal accession to the alliance , " kamynin said . nato sending ukraine mixed signals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato foreign ministers meeting at the national palace of culture in sofia but nato on thursday appeared to play down reports that ukraine could be offered the alliance 's " membership action plan " , the key step before being invited to join . " ukraine 's aspirations to join the alliance are welcomed by all allies , " nato spokesman james appathurai told reporters in sofia .
" what i can not predict is timelines for membership action plans , " he added . albania , croatia and macedonia are currently in the membership action plan with the north atlantic treaty organisation -lrb- nato -rrb- . ten countries that were once allied with russia - bulgaria , czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , poland , romania , slovakia and slovenia - have joined nato since 1999 . also on friday , during a sideline meeting , u.s. secretary of state condoleezza rice signed a bilateral agreement with bulgarian officials to establish three military bases in the country as the u.s. shifts troops from old cold war positions to smaller units closer to the middle east and africa . nato boosts darfur aid moving from the european to the african continent during talks in sofia , nato has said it is ready to boost assistance in sudan 's violence-scarred darfur region .
the alliance has said it will increase logistical support , but said any presence should be limited and only in support of african or u.n. efforts . in nato 's first operation on the african continent , the alliance has provided training and transportation to african union troops trying to stem the violence there .

tehran 's decision to ignore a un ultimatum to freeze its nuclear enrichment work was described as irresponsible and a slap in the face of the international community . in the search for solutions to the standoff , wolfgang gerhardt , a foreign policy expert from the opposition liberal free democrats , said russia and china must play a more pro-active role now . " we can only stop tehran if russia and china come to realize that they can no longer stand on the sidelines in this dispute , " he said .
" within the next few days it is crucial that these countries drive home to iran that it will definitely face punitive action if it continues down this path of confrontation . " ingo friedrich , a member of the conservative csu party also believes that moscow and beijing must now come forward to step up international pressure on iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
he thinks that efforts within the united nations aimed at imposing sanctions must be intensified . " it is now a matter of credibility for the united nations to impose sanctions , " he said .
" iran must be made to understand that it can not defy demands by the international community without punishment . " military actio n u n likely as the conflict is heating up , the prospect of a military confrontation is looming ever larger .
washington has n't ruled out the use of military force to stop iran building nuclear weapons . but ullrich klose , foreign policy spokesman of the social democrats said he believes this is just empty rhetoric .
he added that he is rather pessimistic about a positive outcome of the conflict . " people say the conflict will develop similar to what we saw in iraq , " klose said .
" i do n't think this will happen because the united states have had a bad time of it there and a war with iran would overstretch the country 's capabilities .
so in the end we 'll either have a political solution or face the situation that iran continues its nuclear program unfazed . " public anger in germany about the mullah regime in tehran has been fuelled recently after ahamadinejad said he wanted to visit germany to attend one of iran 's world cup soccer matches this summer .
german politicians such as csu leader edmund stoiber have vowed to do everything in their power to prevent that .

" we will now be asking the security council to increase the pressure on iran , so that the international community can be assured that its nuclear program is not a threat to peace and security , " british foreign secretary jack straw said . the international atomic energy agency said in a report that iran had not met demands to freeze uranium enrichment , american , british and french diplomats said they expected to present a text in the security council next week . " after more than three years of agency efforts to seek clarity about all aspects of iran 's nuclear program , the existing gaps in knowledge continue to be a matter of concern , " the iaea report said .
" any progress in that regard requires full transparency and active cooperation by iran . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier called for " international unity " germany committed to peaceful solution german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called for the international community to close ranks in opposition to the iranian nuclear program and push for a peaceful solution . steinmeier said germany would be prepared to restart negotiations with iran , but only if teheran produced a solid basis for negotiations but remained cautious , adding " until now there have not been any signals of compromise . " french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy also called for iranian " gestures that will re-establish confidence about the goals of their nuclear program . " iran says its program is part of a peaceful civilian nuclear energy drive .
the united states and europe fear , however , that it is hiding secret atomic weapons development . iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad said friday that iran was being denied its right to atomic energy and issued another veiled threat to cut off ties with the un 's nuclear watchdog . " we still want to work within the framework of the agency and we are committed to its regulations , " ahmadinejad told the official iranian irna agency .
" but if these regulations that guarantee our rights are used against us , we will totally change our way of dealing with the organizations . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad said iran would offer a timetable to work with the iaea iran wants iaea , not security council , to organize inspections iran has , however , offered to provide a timetable for cooperation with un nuclear inspectors if the un nuclear agency , rather than the security council , oversees iranian compliance , according to the un agency . " iran will provide a timetable within the next three weeks " if " the iran nuclear dossier will remain , in full , in the framework of the iaea and under its safeguards , " according to friday 's iaea report . a chapter 7 resolution , under which efforts to enact sanctions would be taken , is invoked to take : " action with respect to threats to the peace , breaches of the peace , and acts of aggression . "
several security council resolutions against iraq were taken under chapter 7 , before the march 2003 us-led invasion . the resolutions are binding on all un member states , but before action can be taken , chapter 7 says , the council can first " call upon the parties concerned to comply with such provisional measures as it deems necessary or desirable .

" we will study this report very carefully with the aim of agreeing a position and possible future steps to resolve the issues surrounding the iranian nuclear problem , " deputy foreign minister sergei kislyak told interfax , saying any further comments at this point would be premature . un diplomats made clear that the new resolution would only be a first step that would be followed by another resolution mandating sanctions . under the charter , when the security council has noted the " failure to comply with such provisional measures " then it should move on to more serious measures . article 41 of the chapter allows for sanctions , including economic and transport measures or the severance of diplomatic relations . if the council decides that measures under article 41 have failed , then article 42 states " it may take such action by air , sea , or land forces as may be necessary to maintain or restore international peace and security .

tehran 's decision to ignore a un ultimatum to freeze its nuclear enrichment work was described as irresponsible and a slap in the face of the international community . in the search for solutions to the standoff , wolfgang gerhardt , a foreign policy expert from the opposition liberal free democrats , said russia and china must play a more pro-active role now .

" we will now be asking the security council to increase the pressure on iran , so that the international community can be assured that its nuclear program is not a threat to peace and security , " british foreign secretary jack straw said . the international atomic energy agency said in a report that iran had not met demands to freeze uranium enrichment , american , british and french diplomats said they expected to present a text in the security council next week . " after more than three years of agency efforts to seek clarity about all aspects of iran 's nuclear program , the existing gaps in knowledge continue to be a matter of concern , " the iaea report said .
" any progress in that regard requires full transparency and active cooperation by iran . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier called for " international unity " germany committed to peaceful solution german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called for the international community to close ranks in opposition to the iranian nuclear program and push for a peaceful solution . steinmeier said germany would be prepared to restart negotiations with iran , but only if teheran produced a solid basis for negotiations but remained cautious , adding " until now there have not been any signals of compromise . " french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy also called for iranian " gestures that will re-establish confidence about the goals of their nuclear program . " iran says its program is part of a peaceful civilian nuclear energy drive .
the united states and europe fear , however , that it is hiding secret atomic weapons development . iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad said friday that iran was being denied its right to atomic energy and issued another veiled threat to cut off ties with the un 's nuclear watchdog . " we still want to work within the framework of the agency and we are committed to its regulations , " ahmadinejad told the official iranian irna agency .
" but if these regulations that guarantee our rights are used against us , we will totally change our way of dealing with the organizations . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad said iran would offer a timetable to work with the iaea iran wants iaea , not security council , to organize inspections iran has , however , offered to provide a timetable for cooperation with un nuclear inspectors if the un nuclear agency , rather than the security council , oversees iranian compliance , according to the un agency . " iran will provide a timetable within the next three weeks " if " the iran nuclear dossier will remain , in full , in the framework of the iaea and under its safeguards , " according to friday 's iaea report . a chapter 7 resolution , under which efforts to enact sanctions would be taken , is invoked to take : " action with respect to threats to the peace , breaches of the peace , and acts of aggression . "
several security council resolutions against iraq were taken under chapter 7 , before the march 2003 us-led invasion . the resolutions are binding on all un member states , but before action can be taken , chapter 7 says , the council can first " call upon the parties concerned to comply with such provisional measures as it deems necessary or desirable . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the security council still favor diplomacy in dealing with iran russian , chinese veto threat holds sanctions in check diplomats at the united nations said the upcoming resolution would not contain a threat of sanctions against iran , which are strenuously opposed by russia and china , two security council members with veto powers .
" we will study this report very carefully with the aim of agreeing a position and possible future steps to resolve the issues surrounding the iranian nuclear problem , " deputy foreign minister sergei kislyak told interfax , saying any further comments at this point would be premature . un diplomats made clear that the new resolution would only be a first step that would be followed by another resolution mandating sanctions . under the charter , when the security council has noted the " failure to comply with such provisional measures " then it should move on to more serious measures . article 41 of the chapter allows for sanctions , including economic and transport measures or the severance of diplomatic relations . if the council decides that measures under article 41 have failed , then article 42 states " it may take such action by air , sea , or land forces as may be necessary to maintain or restore international peace and security .

" we will now be asking the security council to increase the pressure on iran , so that the international community can be assured that its nuclear program is not a threat to peace and security , " british foreign secretary jack straw said . the international atomic energy agency said in a report that iran had not met demands to freeze uranium enrichment , american , british and french diplomats said they expected to present a text in the security council next week . " after more than three years of agency efforts to seek clarity about all aspects of iran 's nuclear program , the existing gaps in knowledge continue to be a matter of concern , " the iaea report said .
" any progress in that regard requires full transparency and active cooperation by iran . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier called for " international unity " germany committed to peaceful solution german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called for the international community to close ranks in opposition to the iranian nuclear program and push for a peaceful solution . steinmeier said germany would be prepared to restart negotiations with iran , but only if teheran produced a solid basis for negotiations but remained cautious , adding " until now there have not been any signals of compromise . " french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy also called for iranian " gestures that will re-establish confidence about the goals of their nuclear program . " iran says its program is part of a peaceful civilian nuclear energy drive .
the united states and europe fear , however , that it is hiding secret atomic weapons development . iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad said friday that iran was being denied its right to atomic energy and issued another veiled threat to cut off ties with the un 's nuclear watchdog . " we still want to work within the framework of the agency and we are committed to its regulations , " ahmadinejad told the official iranian irna agency .
" but if these regulations that guarantee our rights are used against us , we will totally change our way of dealing with the organizations . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad said iran would offer a timetable to work with the iaea iran wants iaea , not security council , to organize inspections iran has , however , offered to provide a timetable for cooperation with un nuclear inspectors if the un nuclear agency , rather than the security council , oversees iranian compliance , according to the un agency . " iran will provide a timetable within the next three weeks " if " the iran nuclear dossier will remain , in full , in the framework of the iaea and under its safeguards , " according to friday 's iaea report . a chapter 7 resolution , under which efforts to enact sanctions would be taken , is invoked to take : " action with respect to threats to the peace , breaches of the peace , and acts of aggression . "
several security council resolutions against iraq were taken under chapter 7 , before the march 2003 us-led invasion . the resolutions are binding on all un member states , but before action can be taken , chapter 7 says , the council can first " call upon the parties concerned to comply with such provisional measures as it deems necessary or desirable . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the security council still favor diplomacy in dealing with iran russian , chinese veto threat holds sanctions in check diplomats at the united nations said the upcoming resolution would not contain a threat of sanctions against iran , which are strenuously opposed by russia and china , two security council members with veto powers .
" we will study this report very carefully with the aim of agreeing a position and possible future steps to resolve the issues surrounding the iranian nuclear problem , " deputy foreign minister sergei kislyak told interfax , saying any further comments at this point would be premature . un diplomats made clear that the new resolution would only be a first step that would be followed by another resolution mandating sanctions . under the charter , when the security council has noted the " failure to comply with such provisional measures " then it should move on to more serious measures . article 41 of the chapter allows for sanctions , including economic and transport measures or the severance of diplomatic relations . if the council decides that measures under article 41 have failed , then article 42 states " it may take such action by air , sea , or land forces as may be necessary to maintain or restore international peace and security .

" we are constantly hearing about some threat of dependence on russia , that something must be done to limit the entry of russian companies into the european market , " putin said at a joint news conference with german chancellor angela merkel after two days of talks focused on energy . " what are we supposed to do when we hear the same thing every day ?
we start looking for other markets .
when we continually hear the same thing , we perceive this as a threat to limit our admittance to the market and we begin to look for other outlets , " the russian leader said . putin said russia had no wish to cut back on supplies of energy to countries in europe - they depend overall on russia for around one-fourth of their natural gas supplies and a large share of oil supplies - and stressed that moscow had always been a reliable supplier independent of politics . " we have worked well with you for many years , even when there was the cold war . ...
day after day , the soviet union delivered for its partners in europe .
what is the point of stoking fears about excessive dependence with regard to russia today ? "
putin asked . moscow 's threat to shift energy priorities east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin is looking at china and the far east for energy partners putin and other top russian officials have however stressed in recent weeks that china , japan and other huge markets in asia are increasingly hungry for russian energy supplies and have warned that moscow may shift its priority to serving those clients at the expense of european buyers . the european union , some of whose members felt disruption to their gas supplies from russia in january when moscow briefly cut shipments to ukraine amid a price dispute , has responded by telling moscow not to " politicize " energy trade . while russia 's state-run gas giant gazprom , for example , has complained of efforts to block its expansion plans in european markets , it has also flatly rejected european demands that it relax its own domestic monopoly and open excess gas pipeline capacity to foreign firms . tensions with west exacerbated by energy struggles putin 's comments were certain to heighten tensions on energy between russia - the world 's second-largest crude oil exporter and largest supplier of natural gas - and the west , which is anxious over linkage of kremlin energy strategy with political objectives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and merkel found little common ground on energy issues in comments to officials on wednesday shortly before he greeted merkel , putin complained that russia 's aims to expand in western energy markets were being systematically thwarted by " unfair competition " barriers . " we are being blocked to the north , the south and the west on any pretext .
we have to find outlets , to fit into the global development process , " putin said wednesday hours before greeting merkel . by way of example he cited reports that the british government had recently considered modifying anti-monopoly legislation in such a way as to prevent gazprom from buying centrica , britain 's biggest household gas supplier . british prime minister tony blair ruled out any move to block the takeover , the daily financial times reported wednesday , sparking a surge in centrica 's share price . putin said gazprom had never intended to buy the company anyway .
" we need to agree on the rules of the game " and those should be applied on an equal basis to all countries , he said . eu failing in bid to rein in russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to ensure the supply stays open the european union has ratcheted up pressure on russia to sign its energy charter , a document that regulates energy transport and would prohibit any signatory from disrupting contracted supplies for any reason . a top gazprom official , alexander medvedev , told participants at an economic forum in london earlier this week that the pact was " stillborn . " however , putin 's economic advisor referred to the prickly eu-russian relationship as a normal sign of a changing balance of power . " having this tension is okay , it 's a problem with any growth , " said igor shuvalov , who is also russia 's sherpa to the group of eight industrialized countries .
" russia is part of the family ; we were considered the small kid .
now we are growing and we raise our voice , " he added . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel , putin hail gas deal , disagree on iran concluding their two-day summit in siberia , russian and german leaders saw the signing of a major joint venture between companies from both countries to develop a natural gas field .
they failed to agree on iran .
-lrb- april 27 , 2006 -rrb- russia to repay debt early despite german resistance meeting with germany 's chancellor for a second day in russia , president putin said thursday that russia was prepared to reimburse all of its debt to the paris club by the end of the year .

-lrb- april 27 , 2006 -rrb- eu seeks new energy partnership with russia european ministers called tuesday for a " new partnership " with russia to secure eu energy imports , after moscow 's natural gas war with ukraine hit the bloc 's supplies in january .

" we will now be asking the security council to increase the pressure on iran , so that the international community can be assured that its nuclear program is not a threat to peace and security , " british foreign secretary jack straw said . the international atomic energy agency said in a report that iran had not met demands to freeze uranium enrichment , american , british and french diplomats said they expected to present a text in the security council next week . " after more than three years of agency efforts to seek clarity about all aspects of iran 's nuclear program , the existing gaps in knowledge continue to be a matter of concern , " the iaea report said .
" any progress in that regard requires full transparency and active cooperation by iran . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier called for " international unity " germany committed to peaceful solution german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called for the international community to close ranks in opposition to the iranian nuclear program and push for a peaceful solution . steinmeier said germany would be prepared to restart negotiations with iran , but only if teheran produced a solid basis for negotiations but remained cautious , adding " until now there have not been any signals of compromise .

" iran will provide a timetable within the next three weeks " if " the iran nuclear dossier will remain , in full , in the framework of the iaea and under its safeguards , " according to friday 's iaea report . a chapter 7 resolution , under which efforts to enact sanctions would be taken , is invoked to take : " action with respect to threats to the peace , breaches of the peace , and acts of aggression .

" we will now be asking the security council to increase the pressure on iran , so that the international community can be assured that its nuclear program is not a threat to peace and security , " british foreign secretary jack straw said . the international atomic energy agency said in a report that iran had not met demands to freeze uranium enrichment , american , british and french diplomats said they expected to present a text in the security council next week . " after more than three years of agency efforts to seek clarity about all aspects of iran 's nuclear program , the existing gaps in knowledge continue to be a matter of concern , " the iaea report said .
" any progress in that regard requires full transparency and active cooperation by iran . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier called for " international unity " germany committed to peaceful solution german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called for the international community to close ranks in opposition to the iranian nuclear program and push for a peaceful solution . steinmeier said germany would be prepared to restart negotiations with iran , but only if teheran produced a solid basis for negotiations but remained cautious , adding " until now there have not been any signals of compromise . " french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy also called for iranian " gestures that will re-establish confidence about the goals of their nuclear program . " iran says its program is part of a peaceful civilian nuclear energy drive .
the united states and europe fear , however , that it is hiding secret atomic weapons development . iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad said friday that iran was being denied its right to atomic energy and issued another veiled threat to cut off ties with the un 's nuclear watchdog . " we still want to work within the framework of the agency and we are committed to its regulations , " ahmadinejad told the official iranian irna agency .
" but if these regulations that guarantee our rights are used against us , we will totally change our way of dealing with the organizations . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad said iran would offer a timetable to work with the iaea iran wants iaea , not security council , to organize inspections iran has , however , offered to provide a timetable for cooperation with un nuclear inspectors if the un nuclear agency , rather than the security council , oversees iranian compliance , according to the un agency . " iran will provide a timetable within the next three weeks " if " the iran nuclear dossier will remain , in full , in the framework of the iaea and under its safeguards , " according to friday 's iaea report . a chapter 7 resolution , under which efforts to enact sanctions would be taken , is invoked to take : " action with respect to threats to the peace , breaches of the peace , and acts of aggression . "

with not a mao jacket or red scarf in sight , it showcases vintage chic straight out of " barbarella . "
realistic it is n't . " we thought everyone in the gdr walked around in drab , dismal clothes , but suddenly we found this incredible stuff which showed there was a thriving fashion industry , " said caz hildebrand , the british art director who put the collection together . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " sibylle " - the arty face of gdr fashion but was there really ?
the photos were taken by günter rubitzsch , a leipzig-based photographer who worked regularly for women 's weeklies such as pramo -lrb- abbreviated from " praktische mode " or " practical fashion " -rrb- and für dich -lrb- " for you " -rrb- , magazines which featured sewing or knitting patterns for women who liked to make their own clothes .
and most of them had to . " everyone looked the same , so if you wanted something special you had to make it yourself , " explained antje lond benn , who studied at the technical college for clothing design in east berlin in the 1980s .
" fabrics and patterns were really cheap , and everyone would improvize with them .
and if you were lucky , you could fit into the kids ' clothes , which were heavily subsidized . " honecker 's haute couture so the groovy gdr depicted in " off the wall " might , perhaps , be a little off the mark .
but at least it scuppers a few cliches . " it 's an acknowledgment of my work , and i 'm glad it shows a different side of the gdr , " said rubitzsch .
" it proves that we were n't all impoverished and that it was possible to be creative despite the restrictions we worked with . " after the berlin wall fell , he sold the rights to his pictures to the international agency akg images - and never thought that one day , they 'd be rediscovered as high camp , communist-style . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fashion in ' sybille ' captured a mood - it did n't showcase clothes dating back to decades that taste forgot not just in east germany , what really sets his pictures apart are their unmistakably socialist backdrops .
one image features models reclining in vamped-up folksy frocks against a gleaming combine harvester , while others show girls posing in front of chemical plants , industrial sites and of course , the inevitable trabants . " i worked in leipzig , and there was a limit to the backdrops available , " explained rubitzsch .
" the city was very industrial and that 's why many of the pictures were taken in front of factories or agricultural cooperatives . " " in those days , fashion photography in the west was set in exotic locations like the caribbean and so on , " he pointed out .
" obviously , we could n't match that - we had to make do with what we had , and that meant being very inventive . " sibylle woman bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gdr style , circa 1985 meanwhile , at the more sophisticated end of the market was the magazine sibylle , which took its cues less from good housekeeping and more from french vogue .
the fashion conscious woman 's style bible , its editor was dorothea melis , who later compiled the only book on gdr fashion to have been published in germany since the demise of communism .
" sibylle - fashion photography from three decades of the gdr " appeared in 1998 and flew off the shelves . dorothea melis agrees with rubitzsch . " necessity is the mother of invention , " she said .
" everyone has this idea that women in the gdr went round in aprons , headscarves and flat shoes , so i thought : i 'll show you how stylish we really were !
back then women were so much more creative than are today , they 'd take the cotton we were getting from somewhere like uzbekistan and dye or embroider it to rework classic looks we 'd seen tourists wearing , on television or in magazines from the west . " like rubitzsch , she wholeheartedly rejects the idea that fashion was a thwarted industry in the gdr .
" back then , we 'd have one editor , one photographer and two models on an average photo shoot .
we had to do everything ourselves , there was no huge team like they have today .
we 'd all have to double up .
the editor would do the girls ' make-up , the photographer would also be the driver .
it was a very intense experience . " not so exquisite " exquisit " after leaving sibylle , melis went on to work in the publicity department of the gdr 's most upmarket store " exquisit , " where most of the clothes modeled in " off the wall " would have been sold . " exquisit opened in 1970 as a deliberate attempt on the part of the party to placate the masses and make them think the gdr was n't all bad , " she said . # b # it stocked western labels such as daniel hechter and georges rech , and until the end of communism , remained the first port-of-call for any east germans wanting to treat themselves - despite a minor upset in the mid-80s when customer complaints about a range of italian shirts that had been falling apart prompted the store to reveal they were actually made from shrouds . the rest of the time , people settled with cheap imitations of western styles , with the gdr even making a point of designing its own synthetics , such as the nylon-like " dederon , " the frotte-esque " malimo , " and its piece de resistance , the extraordinarily static " präsent 20 , " specially developed for the 20th anniversary of the gdr in 1969 . " there was no scope to actually design , " said antje lond benn .
" if you wanted to put in two extra seams , add a couple of buttons or use a different fabric , you 'd always be told it was too expensive - and the best stuff was always exported to west germany anyway .

and most of them had to . " everyone looked the same , so if you wanted something special you had to make it yourself , " explained antje lond benn , who studied at the technical college for clothing design in east berlin in the 1980s .
" fabrics and patterns were really cheap , and everyone would improvize with them .
and if you were lucky , you could fit into the kids ' clothes , which were heavily subsidized . " honecker 's haute couture so the groovy gdr depicted in " off the wall " might , perhaps , be a little off the mark .
but at least it scuppers a few cliches . " it 's an acknowledgment of my work , and i 'm glad it shows a different side of the gdr , " said rubitzsch .
" it proves that we were n't all impoverished and that it was possible to be creative despite the restrictions we worked with . " after the berlin wall fell , he sold the rights to his pictures to the international agency akg images - and never thought that one day , they 'd be rediscovered as high camp , communist-style . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fashion in ' sybille ' captured a mood - it did n't showcase clothes dating back to decades that taste forgot not just in east germany , what really sets his pictures apart are their unmistakably socialist backdrops .
one image features models reclining in vamped-up folksy frocks against a gleaming combine harvester , while others show girls posing in front of chemical plants , industrial sites and of course , the inevitable trabants . " i worked in leipzig , and there was a limit to the backdrops available , " explained rubitzsch .
" the city was very industrial and that 's why many of the pictures were taken in front of factories or agricultural cooperatives . " " in those days , fashion photography in the west was set in exotic locations like the caribbean and so on , " he pointed out .
" obviously , we could n't match that - we had to make do with what we had , and that meant being very inventive . " sibylle woman bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gdr style , circa 1985 meanwhile , at the more sophisticated end of the market was the magazine sibylle , which took its cues less from good housekeeping and more from french vogue .
the fashion conscious woman 's style bible , its editor was dorothea melis , who later compiled the only book on gdr fashion to have been published in germany since the demise of communism .
" sibylle - fashion photography from three decades of the gdr " appeared in 1998 and flew off the shelves . dorothea melis agrees with rubitzsch . " necessity is the mother of invention , " she said .
" everyone has this idea that women in the gdr went round in aprons , headscarves and flat shoes , so i thought : i 'll show you how stylish we really were !
back then women were so much more creative than are today , they 'd take the cotton we were getting from somewhere like uzbekistan and dye or embroider it to rework classic looks we 'd seen tourists wearing , on television or in magazines from the west . " like rubitzsch , she wholeheartedly rejects the idea that fashion was a thwarted industry in the gdr .
" back then , we 'd have one editor , one photographer and two models on an average photo shoot .
we had to do everything ourselves , there was no huge team like they have today .
we 'd all have to double up .
the editor would do the girls ' make-up , the photographer would also be the driver .
it was a very intense experience . " not so exquisite " exquisit " after leaving sibylle , melis went on to work in the publicity department of the gdr 's most upmarket store " exquisit , " where most of the clothes modeled in " off the wall " would have been sold . " exquisit opened in 1970 as a deliberate attempt on the part of the party to placate the masses and make them think the gdr was n't all bad , " she said . # b # it stocked western labels such as daniel hechter and georges rech , and until the end of communism , remained the first port-of-call for any east germans wanting to treat themselves - despite a minor upset in the mid-80s when customer complaints about a range of italian shirts that had been falling apart prompted the store to reveal they were actually made from shrouds . the rest of the time , people settled with cheap imitations of western styles , with the gdr even making a point of designing its own synthetics , such as the nylon-like " dederon , " the frotte-esque " malimo , " and its piece de resistance , the extraordinarily static " präsent 20 , " specially developed for the 20th anniversary of the gdr in 1969 . " there was no scope to actually design , " said antje lond benn .
" if you wanted to put in two extra seams , add a couple of buttons or use a different fabric , you 'd always be told it was too expensive - and the best stuff was always exported to west germany anyway . " " basically , there was no fashion industry , " she added . " there were just clothes .

with not a mao jacket or red scarf in sight , it showcases vintage chic straight out of " barbarella . "
realistic it is n't . " we thought everyone in the gdr walked around in drab , dismal clothes , but suddenly we found this incredible stuff which showed there was a thriving fashion industry , " said caz hildebrand , the british art director who put the collection together . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " sibylle " - the arty face of gdr fashion but was there really ?
the photos were taken by günter rubitzsch , a leipzig-based photographer who worked regularly for women 's weeklies such as pramo -lrb- abbreviated from " praktische mode " or " practical fashion " -rrb- and für dich -lrb- " for you " -rrb- , magazines which featured sewing or knitting patterns for women who liked to make their own clothes .
and most of them had to . " everyone looked the same , so if you wanted something special you had to make it yourself , " explained antje lond benn , who studied at the technical college for clothing design in east berlin in the 1980s .
" fabrics and patterns were really cheap , and everyone would improvize with them .
and if you were lucky , you could fit into the kids ' clothes , which were heavily subsidized . " honecker 's haute couture so the groovy gdr depicted in " off the wall " might , perhaps , be a little off the mark .
but at least it scuppers a few cliches . " it 's an acknowledgment of my work , and i 'm glad it shows a different side of the gdr , " said rubitzsch .
" it proves that we were n't all impoverished and that it was possible to be creative despite the restrictions we worked with . " after the berlin wall fell , he sold the rights to his pictures to the international agency akg images - and never thought that one day , they 'd be rediscovered as high camp , communist-style . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fashion in ' sybille ' captured a mood - it did n't showcase clothes dating back to decades that taste forgot not just in east germany , what really sets his pictures apart are their unmistakably socialist backdrops .
one image features models reclining in vamped-up folksy frocks against a gleaming combine harvester , while others show girls posing in front of chemical plants , industrial sites and of course , the inevitable trabants . " i worked in leipzig , and there was a limit to the backdrops available , " explained rubitzsch .
" the city was very industrial and that 's why many of the pictures were taken in front of factories or agricultural cooperatives . " " in those days , fashion photography in the west was set in exotic locations like the caribbean and so on , " he pointed out .
" obviously , we could n't match that - we had to make do with what we had , and that meant being very inventive . " sibylle woman bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gdr style , circa 1985 meanwhile , at the more sophisticated end of the market was the magazine sibylle , which took its cues less from good housekeeping and more from french vogue .
the fashion conscious woman 's style bible , its editor was dorothea melis , who later compiled the only book on gdr fashion to have been published in germany since the demise of communism .
" sibylle - fashion photography from three decades of the gdr " appeared in 1998 and flew off the shelves . dorothea melis agrees with rubitzsch . " necessity is the mother of invention , " she said .
" everyone has this idea that women in the gdr went round in aprons , headscarves and flat shoes , so i thought : i 'll show you how stylish we really were !
back then women were so much more creative than are today , they 'd take the cotton we were getting from somewhere like uzbekistan and dye or embroider it to rework classic looks we 'd seen tourists wearing , on television or in magazines from the west . " like rubitzsch , she wholeheartedly rejects the idea that fashion was a thwarted industry in the gdr .
" back then , we 'd have one editor , one photographer and two models on an average photo shoot .
we had to do everything ourselves , there was no huge team like they have today .
we 'd all have to double up .
the editor would do the girls ' make-up , the photographer would also be the driver .
it was a very intense experience . " not so exquisite " exquisit " after leaving sibylle , melis went on to work in the publicity department of the gdr 's most upmarket store " exquisit , " where most of the clothes modeled in " off the wall " would have been sold . " exquisit opened in 1970 as a deliberate attempt on the part of the party to placate the masses and make them think the gdr was n't all bad , " she said . # b # it stocked western labels such as daniel hechter and georges rech , and until the end of communism , remained the first port-of-call for any east germans wanting to treat themselves - despite a minor upset in the mid-80s when customer complaints about a range of italian shirts that had been falling apart prompted the store to reveal they were actually made from shrouds . the rest of the time , people settled with cheap imitations of western styles , with the gdr even making a point of designing its own synthetics , such as the nylon-like " dederon , " the frotte-esque " malimo , " and its piece de resistance , the extraordinarily static " präsent 20 , " specially developed for the 20th anniversary of the gdr in 1969 . " there was no scope to actually design , " said antje lond benn .
" if you wanted to put in two extra seams , add a couple of buttons or use a different fabric , you 'd always be told it was too expensive - and the best stuff was always exported to west germany anyway .

" the city was very industrial and that 's why many of the pictures were taken in front of factories or agricultural cooperatives . " " in those days , fashion photography in the west was set in exotic locations like the caribbean and so on , " he pointed out .
" obviously , we could n't match that - we had to make do with what we had , and that meant being very inventive . " sibylle woman bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gdr style , circa 1985 meanwhile , at the more sophisticated end of the market was the magazine sibylle , which took its cues less from good housekeeping and more from french vogue .
the fashion conscious woman 's style bible , its editor was dorothea melis , who later compiled the only book on gdr fashion to have been published in germany since the demise of communism .
" sibylle - fashion photography from three decades of the gdr " appeared in 1998 and flew off the shelves . dorothea melis agrees with rubitzsch . " necessity is the mother of invention , " she said .
" everyone has this idea that women in the gdr went round in aprons , headscarves and flat shoes , so i thought : i 'll show you how stylish we really were !
back then women were so much more creative than are today , they 'd take the cotton we were getting from somewhere like uzbekistan and dye or embroider it to rework classic looks we 'd seen tourists wearing , on television or in magazines from the west . " like rubitzsch , she wholeheartedly rejects the idea that fashion was a thwarted industry in the gdr .
" back then , we 'd have one editor , one photographer and two models on an average photo shoot .
we had to do everything ourselves , there was no huge team like they have today .
we 'd all have to double up .
the editor would do the girls ' make-up , the photographer would also be the driver .
it was a very intense experience . " not so exquisite " exquisit " after leaving sibylle , melis went on to work in the publicity department of the gdr 's most upmarket store " exquisit , " where most of the clothes modeled in " off the wall " would have been sold . " exquisit opened in 1970 as a deliberate attempt on the part of the party to placate the masses and make them think the gdr was n't all bad , " she said . # b # it stocked western labels such as daniel hechter and georges rech , and until the end of communism , remained the first port-of-call for any east germans wanting to treat themselves - despite a minor upset in the mid-80s when customer complaints about a range of italian shirts that had been falling apart prompted the store to reveal they were actually made from shrouds . the rest of the time , people settled with cheap imitations of western styles , with the gdr even making a point of designing its own synthetics , such as the nylon-like " dederon , " the frotte-esque " malimo , " and its piece de resistance , the extraordinarily static " präsent 20 , " specially developed for the 20th anniversary of the gdr in 1969 . " there was no scope to actually design , " said antje lond benn .
" if you wanted to put in two extra seams , add a couple of buttons or use a different fabric , you 'd always be told it was too expensive - and the best stuff was always exported to west germany anyway .

with not a mao jacket or red scarf in sight , it showcases vintage chic straight out of " barbarella . "
realistic it is n't . " we thought everyone in the gdr walked around in drab , dismal clothes , but suddenly we found this incredible stuff which showed there was a thriving fashion industry , " said caz hildebrand , the british art director who put the collection together . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " sibylle " - the arty face of gdr fashion but was there really ?
the photos were taken by günter rubitzsch , a leipzig-based photographer who worked regularly for women 's weeklies such as pramo -lrb- abbreviated from " praktische mode " or " practical fashion " -rrb- and für dich -lrb- " for you " -rrb- , magazines which featured sewing or knitting patterns for women who liked to make their own clothes .
and most of them had to . " everyone looked the same , so if you wanted something special you had to make it yourself , " explained antje lond benn , who studied at the technical college for clothing design in east berlin in the 1980s .
" fabrics and patterns were really cheap , and everyone would improvize with them .
and if you were lucky , you could fit into the kids ' clothes , which were heavily subsidized . " honecker 's haute couture so the groovy gdr depicted in " off the wall " might , perhaps , be a little off the mark .
but at least it scuppers a few cliches . " it 's an acknowledgment of my work , and i 'm glad it shows a different side of the gdr , " said rubitzsch .
" it proves that we were n't all impoverished and that it was possible to be creative despite the restrictions we worked with . " after the berlin wall fell , he sold the rights to his pictures to the international agency akg images - and never thought that one day , they 'd be rediscovered as high camp , communist-style . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fashion in ' sybille ' captured a mood - it did n't showcase clothes dating back to decades that taste forgot not just in east germany , what really sets his pictures apart are their unmistakably socialist backdrops .
one image features models reclining in vamped-up folksy frocks against a gleaming combine harvester , while others show girls posing in front of chemical plants , industrial sites and of course , the inevitable trabants . " i worked in leipzig , and there was a limit to the backdrops available , " explained rubitzsch .

ahmadinejad and bush iran and the us need to tone down their rhetoric and start showing a willingness to compromise in order to resolve the nuclear crisis diplomatically , says janet kursawe of the german institute for middle east studies . when the un security council 's ultimatum calling on iran to halt its nuclear program expires on friday , a positive outcome in the form of iran giving in to the demands is highly unlikely .
that 's not very surprising , considering that chances of success were limited from the beginning .
and since the ultimatum was not issued in the form of a resolution that 's binding in terms of international law , sanctions are not going to follow . thirty days ago , at the time the ultimatum was given , the iranian government reacted quickly by saying that it would not give in to international pressure by giving up its right to peaceful use of nuclear power .
tehran 's announcement to withdraw from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and the international atomic energy agency in case of sanctions were also predictable . what 's surprising is the escalation of the last few months .
ever since iran 's sixth president , mahmoud ahmadinejad , took office , the dynamics of conflict that the us and iran engaged in via provocative statements have made it increasingly difficult to reach a diplomatic solution . both sides seem to have found a perfect match : ahmadinejad 's piety and self-presentation , combined with excessive nationalism and a readiness to sacrifice , is the logical response to george w. bush 's sense of mission . blow n out of proportio n the demands on iran that are unique in the non-proliferation treaty 's history are insulting and offending when one considers the country 's significant sense of national pride and the fact that iran has been a member of the treaty since 1968 . the situation has paved the way to turn the right to use nuclear power into a question of national self-determination , as happened since ahmadinejad took over .
his government and radical , conservative forces of other political organs have managed to preempt all domestic and foreign policy issues in the dispute over iran 's right to use nuclear power , limiting the power of the opposition even further as a result . no one helps iran 's leader more in this respect than the us government .
while opposition voices are increasingly calling for an end to the course of confrontation and back a compromise and even a temporary halt to uranium enrichment , their power and ability to act is extremely limited . a deteriorating political climate and increasing human rights abuses are a consequence of iran 's growing isolation .
should the isolation continue , the conservative , radical establishment will consolidate its political power even further and lead to a militarization of domestic and foreign policies . mutual suspicio n s preve n t solutio n iran is still a long way from being able to produce nuclear weapons .
should the conflict continue , the government is certain to increase its efforts in the field of nuclear research and will use them to raise its deterrent potential .
ahmadinejad 's propagandistic remarks during military exercises at the beginning of april served the same purpose . mutual suspicion and alternating threats between the us and iran are currently the biggest hindrances to a diplomatic solution .
iran feels threatened because of us military presence in its immediate vicinity and because of washington 's assurances that it wants to bring about a regime change in tehran .
the fact that israel feels threatened - and exercises pressure on the us - because of ahmadinejad 's anti-semitic remarks also contributes to the dynamics of escalation . the current insistence on refusing to compromise could lead to a decision to push the military option .
any military action - even a limited one that only aims to destroy nuclear plants - will have fatal security consequences for the region in the long run . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : janet kursawe instead , people should consider rethinking a russian proposal that was outright rejected by the us administration .
moscow suggested that the iranian nuclear program should continue outside the country with russia 's technological help .
in order for this to happen , however , all sides would have to work towards de-escalating the situation and the us government would have to be willing to sit down and negotiate with iran . janet kursawe is an ethnologist , political scientist and psychologist .

ever since iran 's sixth president , mahmoud ahmadinejad , took office , the dynamics of conflict that the us and iran engaged in via provocative statements have made it increasingly difficult to reach a diplomatic solution . both sides seem to have found a perfect match : ahmadinejad 's piety and self-presentation , combined with excessive nationalism and a readiness to sacrifice , is the logical response to george w. bush 's sense of mission . blow n out of proportio n the demands on iran that are unique in the non-proliferation treaty 's history are insulting and offending when one considers the country 's significant sense of national pride and the fact that iran has been a member of the treaty since 1968 . the situation has paved the way to turn the right to use nuclear power into a question of national self-determination , as happened since ahmadinejad took over .
his government and radical , conservative forces of other political organs have managed to preempt all domestic and foreign policy issues in the dispute over iran 's right to use nuclear power , limiting the power of the opposition even further as a result . no one helps iran 's leader more in this respect than the us government .
while opposition voices are increasingly calling for an end to the course of confrontation and back a compromise and even a temporary halt to uranium enrichment , their power and ability to act is extremely limited . a deteriorating political climate and increasing human rights abuses are a consequence of iran 's growing isolation .
should the isolation continue , the conservative , radical establishment will consolidate its political power even further and lead to a militarization of domestic and foreign policies . mutual suspicio n s preve n t solutio n iran is still a long way from being able to produce nuclear weapons .
should the conflict continue , the government is certain to increase its efforts in the field of nuclear research and will use them to raise its deterrent potential .
ahmadinejad 's propagandistic remarks during military exercises at the beginning of april served the same purpose . mutual suspicion and alternating threats between the us and iran are currently the biggest hindrances to a diplomatic solution .
iran feels threatened because of us military presence in its immediate vicinity and because of washington 's assurances that it wants to bring about a regime change in tehran .
the fact that israel feels threatened - and exercises pressure on the us - because of ahmadinejad 's anti-semitic remarks also contributes to the dynamics of escalation . the current insistence on refusing to compromise could lead to a decision to push the military option .

ahmadinejad and bush iran and the us need to tone down their rhetoric and start showing a willingness to compromise in order to resolve the nuclear crisis diplomatically , says janet kursawe of the german institute for middle east studies . when the un security council 's ultimatum calling on iran to halt its nuclear program expires on friday , a positive outcome in the form of iran giving in to the demands is highly unlikely .
that 's not very surprising , considering that chances of success were limited from the beginning .
and since the ultimatum was not issued in the form of a resolution that 's binding in terms of international law , sanctions are not going to follow . thirty days ago , at the time the ultimatum was given , the iranian government reacted quickly by saying that it would not give in to international pressure by giving up its right to peaceful use of nuclear power .

why would this be so dangerous ?
the aspen 's institute jeffrey gedmin offers answers . the us and the european union share nearly identical views .
teheran says it wants nuclear power for peaceful purposes .
no one believes the mullahs .
iran should have enough oil and gas to take care of its energy needs for several hundred years .
there are other reasons to believe that the government in teheran is lying .
iran played cat and mouse with the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- for 18 years .
we expect the iaea to issue iran yet another rebuke this friday . still , why should iran not have the bomb ?
after all , india , pakistan and israel are all nuclear powers , right ?
if you follow this logic - and cast aside for a moment the fact that by signing the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- iran has pledged not to acquire nuclear weapons - then you had better ponder the following . setti n g off a n uclear arms race ? first , when iran gets the bomb , be prepared for a nuclear arms race .
saudi arabia , egypt and turkey -lrb- perhaps syria , algeria and eventually iraq -rrb- would all find it hard to understand that they do not enjoy the right to a nuclear option .
this is presumably a principal reason why -lrb- former german foreign minister -rrb- joschka fischer once described the thought of iran with the bomb as one of the worst imaginable nightmares . second , imagine an emboldened iran meddling to an even greater extent in iraq and afghanistan .
the mullahs may have an interest in stability in both countries ; but most surely not in democracy and pro-western governments .
expect more dead americans -lrb- and germans -rrb- in the short-term . third , bet on significantly higher oil prices , says henry sokolksi , director of the nonproliferation policy education center in washington .
a nuclear iran may feel tempted to intimidate saudi arabia -lrb- which has the world 's largest oil production capacity -rrb- , according to sokolski , or perhaps even threaten the freedom of the seas to manipulate oil prices dramatically upward . more terrorism to come ? fourth , get used to more terrorism .
iran remains a prominent supporter of palestinian terror , of course .
but the iranian regime has also struck targets in europe in the 1980s and 1990s .
there is evidence , moreover , that as recently as 2004 the iranians sought to assist terrorist groups in identify targets in the united states . one feeble excuse made on behalf of the iranian regime is that iran has legitimate security concerns : it feels threatened by the us presence in iraq and afghanistan .
but then iran had been busy pursuing its bomb long before the united states ever had troops in either country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeffrey gedmin iran 's leaders say ahmadineejad wants to wipe israel off the map .

he has accused the cia of kidnapping him in late 2003 from macedonia and interrogating him in afghanistan . skopje has denied any involvement in the alleged operation by the us spy agency . upon arrival , the delegation met macedonian president branko crvenkovski and were due to meet deputy prime minister radmila secerinska and former foreign minister slobodan casule , the eu spokesman andrea angeli told afp news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giovanni claudio fava , european lawmaker leading cia flight probe " the target is the truth , just the truth , " the eu lawmaker leading the probe , claudio fava , told reporters after the meeting with crvenkovski . the eu deputies are scheduled to meet former interior minister siljan avramovski , his successor ljubomir mihajlovski and parliamentary speaker ljupco jordanovski on friday . earlier this year european deputies decided to set up a special committee to look into the allegations that the central intelligence agency secretly operated flights carrying prisoners it considered terror suspects which passed through eu territory . the parliament 's inquiry started in january and is expected to issue a first report next month . more than 1,000 secret cia flights have gone through european airspace and airports since 2001 without governments requesting information , fava said upon presenting a preliminary report . " it is hard to believe that the authorities and governments of certain countries were unaware of what was going on on their territory .
our probe shows that they must have known , " fava said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. col. steven f. dreyer at the air base near bucharest fava singled out sweden , italy and bosnia for particular criticism .
for more than three months , the eu parliamentary inquiry has heard testimony from alleged victims and human rights groups - all saying that european states had handed over terrorism suspects to foreign agents , and ignoring hundreds of cia flights that had used their airports .
some former detainees provided detailed accounts of alleged torture carried out in secret prisons outside eu or us jurisdiction . the eu lawmakers investigating the khalid al-masri case in macedonia want to find out how the plane with al-masri on board could leave europe unchallenged . fava believes that there were hundreds of similar incidents .
" if we look at all the testimonies we have got , it becomes very clear that these incidents were n't sporadic , but that it was a common practice .
that 's the only conclusion i can draw , " fava said . the cia declined to comment on the eu parliamentarians ' findings .
the inquiry committee has no legal powers , but it will recommend what political action should be taken against any countries found to have been involved , including the united states .
several eu lawmakers are expected to go to washington in early may to try to meet secretary of state condoleezza rice and cia chief porter goss . the european union has granted macedonia candidate status , but no date has been set to begin talks for membership in the bloc . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the cia affair and eu : who has responsiblity ?

" we are constantly hearing about some threat of dependence on russia , that something must be done to limit the entry of russian companies into the european market , " putin said at a joint news conference with german chancellor angela merkel after two days of talks focused on energy . " what are we supposed to do when we hear the same thing every day ?
we start looking for other markets .
when we continually hear the same thing , we perceive this as a threat to limit our admittance to the market and we begin to look for other outlets , " the russian leader said . putin said russia had no wish to cut back on supplies of energy to countries in europe - they depend overall on russia for around one-fourth of their natural gas supplies and a large share of oil supplies - and stressed that moscow had always been a reliable supplier independent of politics . " we have worked well with you for many years , even when there was the cold war . ...
day after day , the soviet union delivered for its partners in europe .
what is the point of stoking fears about excessive dependence with regard to russia today ? "
putin asked . moscow 's threat to shift energy priorities east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin is looking at china and the far east for energy partners putin and other top russian officials have however stressed in recent weeks that china , japan and other huge markets in asia are increasingly hungry for russian energy supplies and have warned that moscow may shift its priority to serving those clients at the expense of european buyers . the european union , some of whose members felt disruption to their gas supplies from russia in january when moscow briefly cut shipments to ukraine amid a price dispute , has responded by telling moscow not to " politicize " energy trade . while russia 's state-run gas giant gazprom , for example , has complained of efforts to block its expansion plans in european markets , it has also flatly rejected european demands that it relax its own domestic monopoly and open excess gas pipeline capacity to foreign firms . tensions with west exacerbated by energy struggles putin 's comments were certain to heighten tensions on energy between russia - the world 's second-largest crude oil exporter and largest supplier of natural gas - and the west , which is anxious over linkage of kremlin energy strategy with political objectives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and merkel found little common ground on energy issues in comments to officials on wednesday shortly before he greeted merkel , putin complained that russia 's aims to expand in western energy markets were being systematically thwarted by " unfair competition " barriers . " we are being blocked to the north , the south and the west on any pretext .
we have to find outlets , to fit into the global development process , " putin said wednesday hours before greeting merkel . by way of example he cited reports that the british government had recently considered modifying anti-monopoly legislation in such a way as to prevent gazprom from buying centrica , britain 's biggest household gas supplier . british prime minister tony blair ruled out any move to block the takeover , the daily financial times reported wednesday , sparking a surge in centrica 's share price . putin said gazprom had never intended to buy the company anyway .
" we need to agree on the rules of the game " and those should be applied on an equal basis to all countries , he said . eu failing in bid to rein in russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to ensure the supply stays open the european union has ratcheted up pressure on russia to sign its energy charter , a document that regulates energy transport and would prohibit any signatory from disrupting contracted supplies for any reason . a top gazprom official , alexander medvedev , told participants at an economic forum in london earlier this week that the pact was " stillborn . " however , putin 's economic advisor referred to the prickly eu-russian relationship as a normal sign of a changing balance of power . " having this tension is okay , it 's a problem with any growth , " said igor shuvalov , who is also russia 's sherpa to the group of eight industrialized countries .
" russia is part of the family ; we were considered the small kid .
now we are growing and we raise our voice , " he added . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel , putin hail gas deal , disagree on iran concluding their two-day summit in siberia , russian and german leaders saw the signing of a major joint venture between companies from both countries to develop a natural gas field .

" we are constantly hearing about some threat of dependence on russia , that something must be done to limit the entry of russian companies into the european market , " putin said at a joint news conference with german chancellor angela merkel after two days of talks focused on energy . " what are we supposed to do when we hear the same thing every day ?
we start looking for other markets .
when we continually hear the same thing , we perceive this as a threat to limit our admittance to the market and we begin to look for other outlets , " the russian leader said . putin said russia had no wish to cut back on supplies of energy to countries in europe - they depend overall on russia for around one-fourth of their natural gas supplies and a large share of oil supplies - and stressed that moscow had always been a reliable supplier independent of politics . " we have worked well with you for many years , even when there was the cold war . ...
day after day , the soviet union delivered for its partners in europe .
what is the point of stoking fears about excessive dependence with regard to russia today ? "
putin asked . moscow 's threat to shift energy priorities east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin is looking at china and the far east for energy partners putin and other top russian officials have however stressed in recent weeks that china , japan and other huge markets in asia are increasingly hungry for russian energy supplies and have warned that moscow may shift its priority to serving those clients at the expense of european buyers . the european union , some of whose members felt disruption to their gas supplies from russia in january when moscow briefly cut shipments to ukraine amid a price dispute , has responded by telling moscow not to " politicize " energy trade . while russia 's state-run gas giant gazprom , for example , has complained of efforts to block its expansion plans in european markets , it has also flatly rejected european demands that it relax its own domestic monopoly and open excess gas pipeline capacity to foreign firms . tensions with west exacerbated by energy struggles putin 's comments were certain to heighten tensions on energy between russia - the world 's second-largest crude oil exporter and largest supplier of natural gas - and the west , which is anxious over linkage of kremlin energy strategy with political objectives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and merkel found little common ground on energy issues in comments to officials on wednesday shortly before he greeted merkel , putin complained that russia 's aims to expand in western energy markets were being systematically thwarted by " unfair competition " barriers . " we are being blocked to the north , the south and the west on any pretext .
we have to find outlets , to fit into the global development process , " putin said wednesday hours before greeting merkel . by way of example he cited reports that the british government had recently considered modifying anti-monopoly legislation in such a way as to prevent gazprom from buying centrica , britain 's biggest household gas supplier . british prime minister tony blair ruled out any move to block the takeover , the daily financial times reported wednesday , sparking a surge in centrica 's share price . putin said gazprom had never intended to buy the company anyway .
" we need to agree on the rules of the game " and those should be applied on an equal basis to all countries , he said . eu failing in bid to rein in russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to ensure the supply stays open the european union has ratcheted up pressure on russia to sign its energy charter , a document that regulates energy transport and would prohibit any signatory from disrupting contracted supplies for any reason . a top gazprom official , alexander medvedev , told participants at an economic forum in london earlier this week that the pact was " stillborn . " however , putin 's economic advisor referred to the prickly eu-russian relationship as a normal sign of a changing balance of power . " having this tension is okay , it 's a problem with any growth , " said igor shuvalov , who is also russia 's sherpa to the group of eight industrialized countries .
" russia is part of the family ; we were considered the small kid .
now we are growing and we raise our voice , " he added . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel , putin hail gas deal , disagree on iran concluding their two-day summit in siberia , russian and german leaders saw the signing of a major joint venture between companies from both countries to develop a natural gas field .

" our aim is to limit the cost of each kilometer of maglev line to approximately 200 million yuan -lrb- $ 25 million -rrb- , " the paper quoted zhang as saying . that means the unit cost will be cut by one-third , the china daily said .
the current line cost 310 million yuan -lrb- $ 39 million -rrb- per kilometer to build . " lowering the cost of a maglev system is a significant issue in the study and construction of the shanghai-hangzhou maglev railway .
we are now confident we can achieve that , " zhang was quoted as saying . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a station worker guides a passenger near a maglev train in shanghai china currently operates the world 's only commercial maglev line , which runs 30 kilometers from shanghai 's airport to the financial center in the pudong district . the shanghai-hangzhou maglev line should be completed ahead of the 2010 world expo in shanghai , according to earlier state press reports .
planners expect to construct four stations along the route that will whisk passengers from shanghai 's international airport to hangzhou in just 26 minutes , the reports said . original designer germany 's transrapid international , a consortium between german industrial giants thyssenkrupp and siemens , is the original designer and builder of the maglev trains , which travel at up to 430 kilometers -lrb- 270 miles -rrb- per hour . transrapid has already signed a deal to be involved in the new line to hangzhou , but thursday 's report indicates its role will be scaled back compared with the service between shanghai and the airport . as in many other high-tech industries such as aerospace and autos , china is intent on developing its own technologies so as not to be reliant on foreign companies and to ensure it can cut costs . the china daily said the state council , china 's cabinet , was encouraging engineers to " learn and absorb foreign advanced technologies while making further innovations . " technology theft ? but some in germany are concerned about copyright protection , and accuse the chinese of copying technology from countries doing business there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the transrapid is the world 's only commercial magnetic-levitation train , but not for long " what 's happening in china smells suspiciously like technology theft , " said bavarian premier edmund stoiber after he learned of china 's plans to build its own maglev train .
he has suggested putting the issue of chinese development and intellectual property protections on the agenda of the next g8 meeting . the head of thyssenkrupp , ekkehard schulz , was somewhat more diplomatic .
" it appears that some chinese patents overlap quite a bit with our own , " he said . there are similar worries about technology and china being voiced across the atlantic .
former us commerce secretary donald evans made us concerns official in beijing .
he cited the example the qq mini car from china 's chery automobile co .
american carmaker general motors claims the qq is a copy of its chevrolet spark model . the chinese deny any technology plagiarism in both cases .
the china aviation industry corporation has said the new chinese " zhui feng " magnetic train is not dependent on foreign technology .
it is much lighter than the transrapid product , the company said , and features a much more advanced design . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german foreign minister to walk diplomatic tightrope in china stressing germany 's stance against lifting the eu arms embargo , talking tough on human rights and deepening business ties - foreign minister steinmeier will have his hands full when he visits china wednesday .

" thanks to god , we are a nuclear state , " he said in a speech in the west of iran . no good n ews this leaves little room for elbaradei to do anything other than state the obvious in a report the head of the vienna-based international atomic energy agency is to file friday to mark the expiry of the deadline , diplomats said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a reactor building of iran 's bushehr nuclear power plant elbaradei will also be reporting on whether iran has met security council demands for iran to cooperate with iaea inspectors , who have not been able to conclude after over three years of investigation whether the iranian program is peaceful , as tehran claims . on this topic also little progress is believed to have taken place . " it is not going to be a good report , " said a senior european diplomat , who requested anonymity .

this could lead , if iran still refuses to comply , to punishing economic sanctions and even military action against iran , although tehran 's allies and major trading partners russia and china oppose such a move . us secretary of state condoleezza rice said thursday that the security council " has to act " in response to iran 's defiance . but speaking on the sidelines of a nato meeting in sofia , rice played down talk of military action , saying : " we are committed to a diplomatic course .

" our aim is to limit the cost of each kilometer of maglev line to approximately 200 million yuan -lrb- $ 25 million -rrb- , " the paper quoted zhang as saying . that means the unit cost will be cut by one-third , the china daily said .
the current line cost 310 million yuan -lrb- $ 39 million -rrb- per kilometer to build . " lowering the cost of a maglev system is a significant issue in the study and construction of the shanghai-hangzhou maglev railway .
we are now confident we can achieve that , " zhang was quoted as saying . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a station worker guides a passenger near a maglev train in shanghai china currently operates the world 's only commercial maglev line , which runs 30 kilometers from shanghai 's airport to the financial center in the pudong district . the shanghai-hangzhou maglev line should be completed ahead of the 2010 world expo in shanghai , according to earlier state press reports .
planners expect to construct four stations along the route that will whisk passengers from shanghai 's international airport to hangzhou in just 26 minutes , the reports said . original designer germany 's transrapid international , a consortium between german industrial giants thyssenkrupp and siemens , is the original designer and builder of the maglev trains , which travel at up to 430 kilometers -lrb- 270 miles -rrb- per hour . transrapid has already signed a deal to be involved in the new line to hangzhou , but thursday 's report indicates its role will be scaled back compared with the service between shanghai and the airport . as in many other high-tech industries such as aerospace and autos , china is intent on developing its own technologies so as not to be reliant on foreign companies and to ensure it can cut costs . the china daily said the state council , china 's cabinet , was encouraging engineers to " learn and absorb foreign advanced technologies while making further innovations . " technology theft ? but some in germany are concerned about copyright protection , and accuse the chinese of copying technology from countries doing business there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the transrapid is the world 's only commercial magnetic-levitation train , but not for long " what 's happening in china smells suspiciously like technology theft , " said bavarian premier edmund stoiber after he learned of china 's plans to build its own maglev train .
he has suggested putting the issue of chinese development and intellectual property protections on the agenda of the next g8 meeting . the head of thyssenkrupp , ekkehard schulz , was somewhat more diplomatic .
" it appears that some chinese patents overlap quite a bit with our own , " he said . there are similar worries about technology and china being voiced across the atlantic .
former us commerce secretary donald evans made us concerns official in beijing .
he cited the example the qq mini car from china 's chery automobile co .
american carmaker general motors claims the qq is a copy of its chevrolet spark model . the chinese deny any technology plagiarism in both cases .
the china aviation industry corporation has said the new chinese " zhui feng " magnetic train is not dependent on foreign technology .
it is much lighter than the transrapid product , the company said , and features a much more advanced design . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german foreign minister to walk diplomatic tightrope in china stressing germany 's stance against lifting the eu arms embargo , talking tough on human rights and deepening business ties - foreign minister steinmeier will have his hands full when he visits china wednesday .

" thanks to god , we are a nuclear state , " he said in a speech in the west of iran . no good n ews this leaves little room for elbaradei to do anything other than state the obvious in a report the head of the vienna-based international atomic energy agency is to file friday to mark the expiry of the deadline , diplomats said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a reactor building of iran 's bushehr nuclear power plant elbaradei will also be reporting on whether iran has met security council demands for iran to cooperate with iaea inspectors , who have not been able to conclude after over three years of investigation whether the iranian program is peaceful , as tehran claims . on this topic also little progress is believed to have taken place .

what is there positive to report ? " new phase of diplomacy the report is thus almost certain to open the door to a new phase of diplomacy over an iranian nuclear program which the united states charges hides the development of atomic weapons . washington wants the security council to adopt a " chapter 7 " resolution which would legally oblige iran to meet the iaea 's calls . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the security council take action ?
this could lead , if iran still refuses to comply , to punishing economic sanctions and even military action against iran , although tehran 's allies and major trading partners russia and china oppose such a move . us secretary of state condoleezza rice said thursday that the security council " has to act " in response to iran 's defiance . but speaking on the sidelines of a nato meeting in sofia , rice played down talk of military action , saying : " we are committed to a diplomatic course . " elbaradei 's report will be released friday afternoon " both to member states of the iaea board of governors and to the un security council " in new york , iaea spokeswoman melissa fleming said . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran shuns un on eve of nuclear deadline iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad vowed thursday that his country " will not bow to injustice and pressure , " the day before a un deadline to stop sensitive nuclear work expires .

tehran 's decision to ignore a un ultimatum to freeze its nuclear enrichment work was described as irresponsible and a slap in the face of the international community . in the search for solutions to the standoff , wolfgang gerhardt , a foreign policy expert from the opposition liberal free democrats , said russia and china must play a more pro-active role now . " we can only stop tehran if russia and china come to realize that they can no longer stand on the sidelines in this dispute , " he said .
" within the next few days it is crucial that these countries drive home to iran that it will definitely face punitive action if it continues down this path of confrontation . " ingo friedrich , a member of the conservative csu party also believes that moscow and beijing must now come forward to step up international pressure on iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
he thinks that efforts within the united nations aimed at imposing sanctions must be intensified . " it is now a matter of credibility for the united nations to impose sanctions , " he said .
" iran must be made to understand that it can not defy demands by the international community without punishment . " military actio n u n likely as the conflict is heating up , the prospect of a military confrontation is looming ever larger .
washington has n't ruled out the use of military force to stop iran building nuclear weapons . but ullrich klose , foreign policy spokesman of the social democrats said he believes this is just empty rhetoric .
he added that he is rather pessimistic about a positive outcome of the conflict . " people say the conflict will develop similar to what we saw in iraq , " klose said .
" i do n't think this will happen because the united states have had a bad time of it there and a war with iran would overstretch the country 's capabilities .
so in the end we 'll either have a political solution or face the situation that iran continues its nuclear program unfazed .

in a tribute to the late princess of wales , killed in a paris car crash nine years ago , harry , 21 , will call it sentebale , which means " forget me not " .
he has vowed to continue diana 's work in the fight against aids .
the charity , to be run by clarence house , will be launched at the mants 'ase children 's home near mohale 's hoek , in the southern african kingdom .
he returned to lesotho this week for the launch where he was reunited with six-year-old aids orphan mutsu potsane , whom he first met at the children 's home two years ago .
' eye-opener ' this is his fourth trip to the kingdom - he visited twice in his gap year and last year met mutsu privately after his first term at sandhurst .
the prince co-founded the charity with the country 's prince seeiso , whose own mother queen mamohato died in 2003 .
" both our mothers were hugely connected with aids , especially the orphaned children .
harry visited the country twice in his 2004 gap year " i wanted to carry on as best i could what she -lsb- diana -rsb- started and what better place than to do it than here ? " he said .
he hoped his mother would be proud , he added .
every day about 70 people in lesotho die from aids .
the charity plans to offer long-term support to small and new projects that might not attract large-scale international funding .
" this is our place .
we are starting with small projects .
most other charities are concentrating on other areas .
there is no one else .
it is only us , " said prince harry .
" when you are back in england you just get on with life . but then you come to a place like this and it makes you realise how lucky you actually are .
" when i was here for the first time , i actually found myself thanking the press for the first time - and the last time ever probably - for the amount of awareness they made of this place by putting it in the papers . "

staff at the lamby way depot , which has more than 400 people visiting daily to dump rubbish , have learned how to use equipment to restart a heart .
binmen and office staff at the site have been trained how to use a defibrillator on anyone who suffers a cardiac arrest on site .
so far 20 of the 200 people based at the depot have been trained .
alan mccoy , a performance manager at the site , one of those trained to use the equipment , said : " there are a group of us who have trained from the office and the manual workforce .
" it all came about because one of the staff members is a first responder and trained to use the equipment and he suggested it to our managers .
" they thought it was a good idea and we had the training .
" god forbid , we have n't had to use the training yet but there are a number of us now who can do so .
" and if a member of the public came and took ill we could react quickly , " he said .
the equipment , which costs £ 1,500 , checks itself daily and even talks the user through the process when it is being used .
it works by shocking the body , to allow the heart to restart itself naturally and records the shocks given to the patient which can be passed onto medical staff .
the staff have been trained by tony rossetti , the first responder officer for the welsh ambulance service .
" the key to the operation is early access , early cpr -lrb- cardiopulmonary resuscitation -rrb- , early defibrillation and early advance care , " he said .
" the machine is very easy to use and gives the operative voice prompts to tell them what to do .

the festival runs from 22 to 30 july and the money from arts council england will be spent on commissions and projects , canterbury council said .
festival organisers said many " old favourites " already have a place in the programme , which is yet to be unveiled .
one of the events will be circus , fire and pyrotechnics on tankerton slopes .
the programme begins on 22 july with the landing of the oysters - the day of the oyster parade with hundreds of school children in costume - and ends with the blessing of the waters on 27 july .
festival history promised regular features include crab-catching , walks and talks , petanque , and a tug of war .
the extra funding will also pay for festival advisers who will be drawn from the whitstable community , the council added .
festival co-ordinator art hewitt , who is still appealing for sponsorship and ideas , said the funds would allow the organisers " to do so much more " .
the festival is said to date back to norman times when whitstable was established as a fishing port and it was the custom for fishers and dredgers to celebrate with an annual ceremony of thanksgiving .
it is also said to coincide with the feast day of st james of compostella , the patron saint of oysters , which falls on 25 july .

chris lloyd , from ogwen valley mountain rescue in north wales , said the misuse of mobile phones was leading to dozens of needless call-outs for rescue teams .
mr lloyd has estimated 30 % of the calls to his team could be avoided .
last weekend , the ogwen and llanberis teams had their busiest two days of the year , with six rescues between them .
both teams also report a higher than average number of rescues this year .
ian henderson , from llanberis mountain rescue team , said they were attending more incidents every year , mainly because of the increasing numbers of people taking up outdoor sports .
he said his members had been called out 36 times this year , against a total of 70 incidents last year .
the ogwen team has had 32 call-outs this year .
the team was called out a total of 64 times in 2005 .
weekend of rescues friday 21 april 1000 bst a 55-year-old man is found by walkers in devil 's kitchen area , collapsed .
1600 bst 53-year-old man has a heart attack on summit of tryfan .
1900 bst policeman flown to hospital after he slipped and injured himself in cwm idwal .
saturday 22 april 1300 bst climber stranded on crib goch .
1310 bst woman breaks ankle while walking up snowdon via the pyg track .
1420 bst walker dies after falling about 200ft near snowdon summit .
mr lloyd told the bbc news website : " people rely on mobile phones these days .
in days gone by , they would sort themselves out .
" now people just jump to the mobile phone rather than think about their situation and how to sort themselves out .
" rather than spending a wet night out or using some proper navigation and finding their own way down safely , they just press the button and call us out , " he said .
" people are depending on them as the first line of defence .
they will go out with no map and no compass and no whistle - but they have a mobile phone . "
mr lloyd said every time volunteers were called out on a rescue it cost them money in fuel and often lost work time .
he said team members had joined mountain rescue to help out fellow mountaineers , but added it could be " tiresome " when people called them out " without thinking " .
but mr lloyd said mobiles could be " invaluable " in some situations .
" they have reduced call-out time and i think they do improve the casualty survival , " he said .
instructions on how to treat injuries are often given by rescue teams over the phone before they reach the patient .
more and more people are taking up outdoor sports team members can also talk people down off the mountain if they become lost in poor weather or after dark .
mr henderson estimates mobile phones have " significantly " reduced call-out time for the llanberis team .
" we can get called out much quicker .
before , it would take people three or four hours to walk down before we knew about it . "
but he warned carrying a mobile was " no substitute " for climbers and walkers " being prepared , taking the right equipment and knowing how to use it " .

chris lloyd , from ogwen valley mountain rescue in north wales , said the misuse of mobile phones was leading to dozens of needless call-outs for rescue teams .
mr lloyd has estimated 30 % of the calls to his team could be avoided .
last weekend , the ogwen and llanberis teams had their busiest two days of the year , with six rescues between them .
both teams also report a higher than average number of rescues this year .
ian henderson , from llanberis mountain rescue team , said they were attending more incidents every year , mainly because of the increasing numbers of people taking up outdoor sports .
he said his members had been called out 36 times this year , against a total of 70 incidents last year .
the ogwen team has had 32 call-outs this year .
the team was called out a total of 64 times in 2005 .
weekend of rescues friday 21 april 1000 bst a 55-year-old man is found by walkers in devil 's kitchen area , collapsed .
1600 bst 53-year-old man has a heart attack on summit of tryfan .
1900 bst policeman flown to hospital after he slipped and injured himself in cwm idwal .
saturday 22 april 1300 bst climber stranded on crib goch .
1310 bst woman breaks ankle while walking up snowdon via the pyg track .
1420 bst walker dies after falling about 200ft near snowdon summit .
mr lloyd told the bbc news website : " people rely on mobile phones these days .
in days gone by , they would sort themselves out .
" now people just jump to the mobile phone rather than think about their situation and how to sort themselves out .
" rather than spending a wet night out or using some proper navigation and finding their own way down safely , they just press the button and call us out , " he said .
" people are depending on them as the first line of defence .
they will go out with no map and no compass and no whistle - but they have a mobile phone . "
mr lloyd said every time volunteers were called out on a rescue it cost them money in fuel and often lost work time .
he said team members had joined mountain rescue to help out fellow mountaineers , but added it could be " tiresome " when people called them out " without thinking " .
but mr lloyd said mobiles could be " invaluable " in some situations .
" they have reduced call-out time and i think they do improve the casualty survival , " he said .
instructions on how to treat injuries are often given by rescue teams over the phone before they reach the patient .
more and more people are taking up outdoor sports team members can also talk people down off the mountain if they become lost in poor weather or after dark .
mr henderson estimates mobile phones have " significantly " reduced call-out time for the llanberis team .
" we can get called out much quicker .
before , it would take people three or four hours to walk down before we knew about it . "
but he warned carrying a mobile was " no substitute " for climbers and walkers " being prepared , taking the right equipment and knowing how to use it " .
