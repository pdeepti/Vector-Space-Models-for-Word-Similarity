it is a hesitation that is fundamentally positive and beneficial as nothing offers better protection from all sorts of the disastrous , overboard patriotism of the past . additionally , germany is interwoven in a thick mesh of international connections that make the country an equal partner in the political landscape .
but this role brings responsibilities with it that the country with europe 's largest population after russia can not avoid . this also applies to the possible and foreseeable deployment of bundeswehr soldiers in lebanon as part of the united nations ' peacekeeping force .
its mission would be to prevent hostilities in southern lebanon by making use of the relevant un resolution .
the positioning of troops and the direct involvement of israel in the conflict mean this would be new territory for germany , since its relationship with israel requires a special course of action due to the effects of history . it is simply intolerable to imagine that a situation could arise in which a german solider could shoot an israeli solider .
the deployment of only the navy to israeli and lebanese waters and a lightly armed police force on the lebanese-syrian border could provide a certain degree of assurance that it does not come to such a confrontation .
legitimate concerns of course , there are also legitimate objections in germany to a german deployment to lebanon .
pragmatic objectionss that point out the bundeswehr 's stretched capabilities , and , more fundamentally , that the middle east has been declared a downright taboo area for german soldiers . a deployment to lebanon does indeed lie within the bundeswehr 's capabilities .
at least that is what people who know are saying while pointing out that there were times when more than 7,700 bundeswehr soldiers were deployed in foreign countries at once .
and calling the middle east a taboo area is also out of the question .
the agreement of the israeli and lebanese governments on a un resolution as well as the expressed wish of ehud olmert that germany participate in a peacekeeping force make a case against the taboo argument .
furthermore , the middle east is one of europe 's neighboring regions .
that germany has interests in peaceful conditions there is at least as important as in other regions of the world where the bundeswehr is already stationed . it is true that the deployment of a peacekeeping force is not a replacement for a political concept that would clarify the role of the radical islamic hezbollah in southern lebanon and secure israel 's right to existence .
that contribution is germany 's larger foreign policy challenge . heinz dylong is one of deutsche welle 's chief political editors . -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un peacekeeper search continues as eu hesitates as the lebanese army drove into the country 's southern region for the first time in 38 years , the eu stalled in giving firm troop pledges for the un peacekeeping force to be deployed to the region .

" unfortunately , we must assume that the danger of a repeat of these attempted attacks . "
the discovery of the two bombed sparked a series of scares at railway stations across germany with parts of the central station in düsseldorf sealed off friday after a suspicious suitcase was found .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 19.08.2006 kirchner painting at heart of restitution dispute großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this work , not a kirchner , was returned to its owner after being stolen by the nazis when the berlin senate unexpectedly returned a kirchner painting to the heirs of its original jewish owner , critics protested that it 's not a world war ii restitution case .
the work is now awaiting auction at christie 's . two elegant women , brightly dressed , walk along a crowded street .
ernst ludwig kirchner used this scene to capture the german capital in his painting " berlin street scene " from 1913 . this painting is now the object of a fierce restitution dispute involving the berlin state senate , a berlin museum , the ernst-ludwig-kirchner archive and the heirs of the painting 's original jewish owner . it is currently scheduled to go under the hammer at christie 's auction house in new york , where it could bring in between 14 and 19.5 million euros -lrb- $ 18 to 25 million -rrb- .
such a selling price would make it the artist 's most expensive work . kirchner and painting owner rejected by nazis kirchner , a master of german impressionism , created the work in the same year his artist group die brücke broke up .
many big-name impressionists - like emil nolde , edvard munch and henri matisse - were part of the group , whose name " the bridge " symbolized the links its members sought to establish between artistic styles . kirchner and the other members of die brücke were denounced by the nazis after hitler came to power in 1933 because their work conflicted with the party 's rejection of modernity , particularly in art . now a flurry of controversy has arisen over whether the purchase of the painting from the jewish family of the deceased original owner alfred hess in the early years of the third reich by a german art collector may have been forced because of anti-semitism and the price set artificially low .
if so , the work could qualify for restitution . painting returned to hess heir bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirchner 's " group of artists " depicts members of the " die brücke " group in late july , berlin 's senate , which had been in possession of kirchner 's 1913 painting , unexpectedly returned it to hess ' heir in england .
though the move came as a surprise , secret negotiations had been underway for almost two years already . barbara kisseler , berlin 's state secretary of culture told the daily newspaper frankfurt allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- that the masterpiece was returned because it had come to their attention that the hess family had been unfairly treated during the nazi dictatorship . " moral considerations " played a significant role in the decision , she said . shortly after the restitution of the piece was made public , the new york auction house christie 's announced it had purchased the kirchner work and planned to auction it on november 8 . critics claim restitution not legitimate in a joint statement , the ernst ludwig kirchner archive near bern , the brücke museum and the berlin auction house villa grisebach have publicly protested the return of the kirchner painting , claiming it had been legally purchased . they wrote that the berlin senate had been " dilettantish " in dealing with " german museum property . " alfred hess was an avid art collector and successful shoe factory owner , but plunged into insolvency during the global economic crisis in the late 1920 's .
when he died in 1931 his family brought the kirchner work to switzerland . in 1936 or 1937 - the exact date is unknown - the painting was sold to collector carl hagemann in cologne , allegedly for a sum of 3,000 reich marks , and brought to what was then nazi germany . until recently , the legitimacy of the sale had not been questioned . details of sale remain unclear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : debate rages on who should get the " berlin street scene " in the end the berlin senate now contends that carl hagemann 's purchase price was either so low that it took advantage of the anti-semitic policies of the nazi regime , or that the money never made it into their hands at all . " as in many similar cases , the family fortune mainly consisted of works of art , which were sold in order to make a living , " wolfgang henze , art historian and administrator of the ernst ludwig kirchner archive , wrote the berlin senate , as reported by faz .
" fortunately , the hess family managed in time to get their collection abroad . " the open letter from the kirchner archive , the brücke museum and the berlin auction house also pointed out that the hess family sold paintings on a regular basis over an extended period of time , which could indicate they were not coerced into selling the " berlin street scene . " christie 's had a part in the restitution while it has not yet been firmly established if the transaction between carl hagemann and the hess family in the mid-1930s was fair , christie 's speedy acquisition of the painting has raised eyebrows . ludwig von pufendorf , chairmen of the brücke museum board and berlin 's former state culture secretary , told german radio broadcaster deutschlandradio kultur that christie 's financed the entire restitution process . christoph stölzl , another former state culture secretary in berlin and the general director of the german historical museum for over 10 years , told the online news site netzeitung.de : " the kirchner case sets a dangerous precedent for germany 's cultural heritage in the classical modern field . " he added that " the ernst ludwig kirchner archive estimates that the return of 80 to 100 paintings could be demanded " if the restitution of the kirchner piece is not repealed . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a tale of two cities - tokyo and berlin an art exhibition showcases more than a century of german-japanese artistic exchange opened last week at berlin 's national gallery .

the work is now awaiting auction at christie 's . two elegant women , brightly dressed , walk along a crowded street .
ernst ludwig kirchner used this scene to capture the german capital in his painting " berlin street scene " from 1913 . this painting is now the object of a fierce restitution dispute involving the berlin state senate , a berlin museum , the ernst-ludwig-kirchner archive and the heirs of the painting 's original jewish owner . it is currently scheduled to go under the hammer at christie 's auction house in new york , where it could bring in between 14 and 19.5 million euros -lrb- $ 18 to 25 million -rrb- .
such a selling price would make it the artist 's most expensive work . kirchner and painting owner rejected by nazis kirchner , a master of german impressionism , created the work in the same year his artist group die brücke broke up .

the move is related to a wider probe into the doping of athletes , including star german cyclist jan ullrich . the raids by german police were carried out on thursday and were prompted by findings in connection with the investigation into a spanish doctor suspected of suppling performance-enhancing drugs to top athletes including german cyclist jan ullrich . prosecutors and police in the german town of göttingen said the premises belonging to a man identified only as dr. markus c. in the states of lower saxony and thuringia were searched . german doc allegedly supplied spanish counterpart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doping allegations continue to dogs sports hans hugo heimgärtner , spokesman for the prosecutor ’ s office said that a significant amount of evidence was seized and is currently being analyzed .
the operation , he said , was initiated because of recent findings by spanish authorities who are investigating a sports doping ring allegedly run by spanish doctor eufemiano fuentes . " the german doctor is suspected of violating german laws by making drugs available for illegal purposes such as performance-enhancing in sports , " heimgärtner said .
" there are indications that he provided these drugs to a doctor in spain who stands accused of selling them to the athletes . " dr markus c is said to have delivered large quantities of synacten - a drug that raises pain endurance levels in humans .
the trail to germany , authorities say , came to light after spanish officials in may raided offices belonging to dr fuentes . there they found among other things anabolic steroids , equipment used for blood transfusions and more than 100 bags of frozen blood .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan ullrich still protests his innocence meanwhile german anti-doping campaigners have called on jan ullrich to come forward and testify on his drug-taking past .
germany ’ s leading expert on doping , werner franke said that with the international cycling union discussing disciplinary action against ullrich , the star cyclist should come clean . " i can only recommend to jan ullrich and all the other cyclists accused of doping to make a clean slate now , " franke said .
" the cycling union , i ’ m sure will certainly respect that in their ruling . " so far however , jan ullrich has continued to protest his innocence and denies the doping allegations . but the noose around his neck is getting tighter .

in all , the 21-year-old striker found the net three times , and equalled the scoresheets of greats like ronaldo and thierry henry .
two of podolski 's goals came against the group of 16 game against sweden in munich on june 24 . the former fc cologne idol hoped that he could repeat his tournament performance against the swedes in a friendly at gelsenkirchen on wednesday if for no other reason than to make bayern coach felix magath aware of his prowess in front of the net .
germany again demolished their helpless opponents , winning 3-0 , but sweden took podolski , who is not in top physical form at the moment , out of the game . and to boot , his defender , anders svensson , who had a run-in with podolski during the friendly , had some choice words for the youngster afterwards . " podolski was crying the whole time .
i went to him and told him he should stop .
that 's when he took a swipe at me , " the if elfsborg fullback said .
" he 's a good player , but damn whiny . " patience and confidence needed at moment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miroslav klose -lrb- left -rrb- tried anything to transfer his goalscoring talent to podolski despite the failed attempt to prove his true worth to magath with a strong match on the national squad , podolski has to make do with quiet patience at the moment . " there 's no reason for me to be in doubt .
i always knew that i would sometimes sit on the bench at bayern , particularly after the short amount of time i 've had to prepare after the world cup , " he told soccer magazine kicker this week . the overflowing pool of talent in munich makes it easier for magath to have a physically unfit prince poldi .
currently in front of the heir apparent in german soccer are ex-dutch national player roy makaay and paraguayan forward roque santa cruz . spared the energy-sapping world cup , makaay played inspiring soccer in bayern 's 2006/07 debut last friday , scoring once and taking on a greater leadership role after the departure of former midfield playmaker michael ballack .
santa cruz was in germany this summer , but paraguay were knocked out unceremoniously in the first round , leaving him plenty of time to recuperate . not everything this week was bad until he is 100 percent in shape , the 11 million euro transfer to bayern , however will have to listen to his coach repeatedly explain his decisions to the german press about why he is not starting .
even if magath would prefer not to . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski was undoubtedly the man at fc cologne " the situation has n't changed . -lrb- … -rrb- particularly with lukas , the players are n't so familiar with his timing and how he moves on the pitch .
we had too little time to get used to it , " magath said . the 21-year-old podolski also faced another setback recently when he failed to stop a satirical show on the star on german public radio , wdr , called " lukas ' diary . "
podolski 's lawyer called it " tasteless and without any standard . "
a court in munich however recently ruled that the comedy show in no way denigrated podolski . yet podolski could be happy about one event this past week .
his former and still beloved club fc cologne started their campaign to exit the second division with a 2-0 victory .
a reason for the prince to smile .
still , the season is just one week old and podolski 's permanent place will eventually be on the field and not on the bench . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de miroslav klose : ' best the bundesliga has to offer ' long stuck in the shadow of german soccer star michael ballack , miroslav klose came out into the spotlight during the world cup and will be essential in werder bremen 's german title bid .

on saturday , the shaky truce suffered a blow when helicopter-borne israeli commandos raided a hezbollah bastion , allegedly aimed to disrupt weapons supplies to hezbollah from syria and iran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boxes of humanitarian aid arrive in lebanon french navy commandos were the first to disembark from the force-projection and command ship mistral anchored off naqura , which is about three kilometers -lrb- two miles -rrb- from the israeli border . france 's reinforcements arrived under a united nations resolution that ended a 34-day war between israel and the shiite hezbollah militia which killed 1,150 people , mostly civilians , in lebanon .
hezbollah killed 160 israelis , mostly soldiers . " important that europe steps forward " france 's contribution however has fallen far short of the major commanding role that many had foreseen for the former colonial power in lebanon . the united nations has been urging european countries to provide troops to the peacekeeping force , as the beirut government moved ahead with the deployment of the lebanese army in the south of the country . on saturday french president jacques chirac held talks with several eu leaders stressing the need to swiftly agree the make-up and mandate of a peacekeeping force in lebanon , his office said . the french leader spoke by phone to italy 's prime minister romano prodi , turkish prime minister recep erdogan and finish prime minister matti vanhanen , whose country holds the eu presidency , it said .
all three countries have agreed in principle to send soldiers but want more details on the precise mandate of the force charged with policing a ceasefire between israel and hezbollah .
chirac highlighted " the need to very quickly specify the missions , the rules of engagement and the chain of command " of the un interim force in lebanon -lrb- unifil -rrb- , it said . he also insisted on the need for balance in the distribution of contingents " which must reflect the commitment of all the international community and , in particular european countries " , it added .

denmark said it was ready to send three warships into the region . though the german government has ruled out sending any ground troops , chancellor angela merkel said germany could send a " maritime protection component " and provide logistics , air transport and reconnaissance , depending on the rules of engagement . un mandate too vague one of the main reasons for the reluctance of european nations to contribute troops remains the vagueness of the un peacekeeping force 's mandate . in germany , where the idea of sending german soldiers for a deployment which might involve turning their guns on israelis remains highly sensitive , politicians say the un mandate remains too ambiguous .

the company faces a tough fight in the highly competitve sector - but it 's a fight telekom is prepared for . deutsche telekom is the latest telecommunications company to feel the pressure of intensifying competition in europe .
the german firm , europe 's largest communications group , recently announced a 4 percent fall in half-year profits .
shares in deutsche telekom - which owns t-mobile - nose dived by 11 percent after the announcement earlier in august . the firm says the profit shortfall is due to a poor performance in germany and has pledged to take aggressive action to win back customers .
but will this be enough to halt the company 's slide ? deutsche telekom anticipates its operating profit for the year could be more than a billion euros -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- lower than previously anticipated .
the company said in a statement last week that its bottom-line net profit declined by 14 percent to 1.01 billion euros in the period from april to june , despite a three-percent rise in revenues to 15.13 billion euros . in germany , deutsche telekom 's overall sales have fallen by 4 percent in the past six months .
first half sales of its german mobile arm dropped by 3 percent in the first half of the year and its fixed-line business lost a million customers over that period . cuts in earning and sales forecasts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ricke will reverse the trend of high sales forecasts because of these results , deutsche telekom has been forced to issue a profit warning .
and deutsche telekom 's chairman , kai-uwe ricke , said the company will cut its earnings and sales forecasts for this year and next year . " deutsche telekom is transforming in a telecommunication market , a worldwide telecommunication market , which is ever-changing , " ricke said .
" and this transformation is huge .
it 's a challenge .
it 's a marathon . " ricke said he and his team are ready to take on the challenge .
the company 's strategy is to take a much more aggressive approach to competition in its key domestic markets in the second half of this year . many customers have switched to cheaper phone and internet providers , and deutsche telekom wants to win them back .
ricke said costs and prices will be slashed in order to defend the company 's domestic market share . attack is the best form of defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom 's near-monopoly is under threat " deutsche telekom has to do its homework in the german marketplace , " ricke said .
" that means we must rigorously defend our market share .
it has to do with pricing , it has to do with products , it has to do with service , it has to do with things we have in our pipeline , and what we are going to roll out over the next few weeks . " that means offering simpler packages with lower prices .
for example , new bundled offers from t-mobile in germany will soon cost less than 10 euro cents per minute , regardless of which network people call . deutsche telekom has also started marketing a merged fixed-line and mobile service to try to stop people canceling their deutsche telekom traditional phone lines . the company also plans to invest differently to increase its cash flow .
and it will spend an extra 1.2 billion euros on marketing and products this year .
that 's in addition to a 3-billion-euro investment in a fiber-optic network to broadcast live tv programs , such as germany 's bundesliga soccer league matches , over the internet .
ricke is hopeful that all this will stave off competition from vodafone and other competitors . foreign stability remains key deutsche telekom 's international business units have been more successful than its domestic market and are solely responsible for the company 's sales growth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : t-mobile is proving popular in the uk t-mobile in the uk , for example , added more than 360 thousand subscribers over the second quarter .
and revenues generated outside of germany have risen by a total of 4 percent to 3.6 billion euros . but telecommunications analyst ovum said deutsche telekom has underestimated its competition for too long , that it ca n't hide behind its overseas growth now , and that there 's certainly no " quick fix " for its domestic problems . so is this program of price cuts and innovations coming too late ?
and will competitors such as vodafone follow suit ?

the company faces a tough fight in the highly competitve sector - but it 's a fight telekom is prepared for . deutsche telekom is the latest telecommunications company to feel the pressure of intensifying competition in europe .
the german firm , europe 's largest communications group , recently announced a 4 percent fall in half-year profits .
shares in deutsche telekom - which owns t-mobile - nose dived by 11 percent after the announcement earlier in august . the firm says the profit shortfall is due to a poor performance in germany and has pledged to take aggressive action to win back customers .
but will this be enough to halt the company 's slide ? deutsche telekom anticipates its operating profit for the year could be more than a billion euros -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- lower than previously anticipated .
the company said in a statement last week that its bottom-line net profit declined by 14 percent to 1.01 billion euros in the period from april to june , despite a three-percent rise in revenues to 15.13 billion euros . in germany , deutsche telekom 's overall sales have fallen by 4 percent in the past six months .
first half sales of its german mobile arm dropped by 3 percent in the first half of the year and its fixed-line business lost a million customers over that period . cuts in earning and sales forecasts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ricke will reverse the trend of high sales forecasts because of these results , deutsche telekom has been forced to issue a profit warning .
and deutsche telekom 's chairman , kai-uwe ricke , said the company will cut its earnings and sales forecasts for this year and next year . " deutsche telekom is transforming in a telecommunication market , a worldwide telecommunication market , which is ever-changing , " ricke said .
" and this transformation is huge .
it 's a challenge .
it 's a marathon . " ricke said he and his team are ready to take on the challenge .
the company 's strategy is to take a much more aggressive approach to competition in its key domestic markets in the second half of this year . many customers have switched to cheaper phone and internet providers , and deutsche telekom wants to win them back .
ricke said costs and prices will be slashed in order to defend the company 's domestic market share . attack is the best form of defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom 's near-monopoly is under threat " deutsche telekom has to do its homework in the german marketplace , " ricke said .
" that means we must rigorously defend our market share .
it has to do with pricing , it has to do with products , it has to do with service , it has to do with things we have in our pipeline , and what we are going to roll out over the next few weeks . " that means offering simpler packages with lower prices .
for example , new bundled offers from t-mobile in germany will soon cost less than 10 euro cents per minute , regardless of which network people call . deutsche telekom has also started marketing a merged fixed-line and mobile service to try to stop people canceling their deutsche telekom traditional phone lines . the company also plans to invest differently to increase its cash flow .
and it will spend an extra 1.2 billion euros on marketing and products this year .
that 's in addition to a 3-billion-euro investment in a fiber-optic network to broadcast live tv programs , such as germany 's bundesliga soccer league matches , over the internet .
ricke is hopeful that all this will stave off competition from vodafone and other competitors . foreign stability remains key deutsche telekom 's international business units have been more successful than its domestic market and are solely responsible for the company 's sales growth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : t-mobile is proving popular in the uk t-mobile in the uk , for example , added more than 360 thousand subscribers over the second quarter .
and revenues generated outside of germany have risen by a total of 4 percent to 3.6 billion euros . but telecommunications analyst ovum said deutsche telekom has underestimated its competition for too long , that it ca n't hide behind its overseas growth now , and that there 's certainly no " quick fix " for its domestic problems . so is this program of price cuts and innovations coming too late ?
and will competitors such as vodafone follow suit ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : violence in the middle east steinmeier cancels talks with syrian president propaganda wars fight for headlines in the middle east " germany should take part in lebanon peace-keeping mission " eu takes charge in cleaning oil spill on lebanese coast germany -pipe- 19.08.2006 opinion : german troops in lebanon - an unavoidable decision großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are no good reasons why germany should not be involved in the un 's peacekeeping mission to the middle east , but it should not send ground troops to a buffer zone between the fronts , according to dw 's heinz dylong . even 10 or 15 years ago , sending the bundeswehr to foreign countries was a touchy topic , and the public only hesitantly got used to german soldiers being deployed away from home .
it is a hesitation that is fundamentally positive and beneficial as nothing offers better protection from all sorts of the disastrous , overboard patriotism of the past . additionally , germany is interwoven in a thick mesh of international connections that make the country an equal partner in the political landscape .
but this role brings responsibilities with it that the country with europe 's largest population after russia can not avoid . this also applies to the possible and foreseeable deployment of bundeswehr soldiers in lebanon as part of the united nations ' peacekeeping force .
its mission would be to prevent hostilities in southern lebanon by making use of the relevant un resolution .
the positioning of troops and the direct involvement of israel in the conflict mean this would be new territory for germany , since its relationship with israel requires a special course of action due to the effects of history . it is simply intolerable to imagine that a situation could arise in which a german solider could shoot an israeli solider .
the deployment of only the navy to israeli and lebanese waters and a lightly armed police force on the lebanese-syrian border could provide a certain degree of assurance that it does not come to such a confrontation .
legitimate concerns of course , there are also legitimate objections in germany to a german deployment to lebanon .
pragmatic objectionss that point out the bundeswehr 's stretched capabilities , and , more fundamentally , that the middle east has been declared a downright taboo area for german soldiers . a deployment to lebanon does indeed lie within the bundeswehr 's capabilities .
at least that is what people who know are saying while pointing out that there were times when more than 7,700 bundeswehr soldiers were deployed in foreign countries at once .
and calling the middle east a taboo area is also out of the question .
the agreement of the israeli and lebanese governments on a un resolution as well as the expressed wish of ehud olmert that germany participate in a peacekeeping force make a case against the taboo argument .
furthermore , the middle east is one of europe 's neighboring regions .
that germany has interests in peaceful conditions there is at least as important as in other regions of the world where the bundeswehr is already stationed . it is true that the deployment of a peacekeeping force is not a replacement for a political concept that would clarify the role of the radical islamic hezbollah in southern lebanon and secure israel 's right to existence .
that contribution is germany 's larger foreign policy challenge . heinz dylong is one of deutsche welle 's chief political editors . -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un peacekeeper search continues as eu hesitates as the lebanese army drove into the country 's southern region for the first time in 38 years , the eu stalled in giving firm troop pledges for the un peacekeeping force to be deployed to the region .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 19.08.2006 telekom streamlines as germany 's giant feels the pinch großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche telekom is facing new and serious challenges deutsche telekom has been rocked by recent financial results and the loss of a million fixed-line customers .
the company faces a tough fight in the highly competitve sector - but it 's a fight telekom is prepared for . deutsche telekom is the latest telecommunications company to feel the pressure of intensifying competition in europe .
the german firm , europe 's largest communications group , recently announced a 4 percent fall in half-year profits .
shares in deutsche telekom - which owns t-mobile - nose dived by 11 percent after the announcement earlier in august . the firm says the profit shortfall is due to a poor performance in germany and has pledged to take aggressive action to win back customers .
but will this be enough to halt the company 's slide ? deutsche telekom anticipates its operating profit for the year could be more than a billion euros -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- lower than previously anticipated .
the company said in a statement last week that its bottom-line net profit declined by 14 percent to 1.01 billion euros in the period from april to june , despite a three-percent rise in revenues to 15.13 billion euros . in germany , deutsche telekom 's overall sales have fallen by 4 percent in the past six months .
first half sales of its german mobile arm dropped by 3 percent in the first half of the year and its fixed-line business lost a million customers over that period . cuts in earning and sales forecasts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ricke will reverse the trend of high sales forecasts because of these results , deutsche telekom has been forced to issue a profit warning .
and deutsche telekom 's chairman , kai-uwe ricke , said the company will cut its earnings and sales forecasts for this year and next year . " deutsche telekom is transforming in a telecommunication market , a worldwide telecommunication market , which is ever-changing , " ricke said .
" and this transformation is huge .
it 's a challenge .
it 's a marathon . " ricke said he and his team are ready to take on the challenge .
the company 's strategy is to take a much more aggressive approach to competition in its key domestic markets in the second half of this year . many customers have switched to cheaper phone and internet providers , and deutsche telekom wants to win them back .
ricke said costs and prices will be slashed in order to defend the company 's domestic market share . attack is the best form of defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom 's near-monopoly is under threat " deutsche telekom has to do its homework in the german marketplace , " ricke said .
" that means we must rigorously defend our market share .
it has to do with pricing , it has to do with products , it has to do with service , it has to do with things we have in our pipeline , and what we are going to roll out over the next few weeks . " that means offering simpler packages with lower prices .
for example , new bundled offers from t-mobile in germany will soon cost less than 10 euro cents per minute , regardless of which network people call . deutsche telekom has also started marketing a merged fixed-line and mobile service to try to stop people canceling their deutsche telekom traditional phone lines . the company also plans to invest differently to increase its cash flow .
and it will spend an extra 1.2 billion euros on marketing and products this year .
that 's in addition to a 3-billion-euro investment in a fiber-optic network to broadcast live tv programs , such as germany 's bundesliga soccer league matches , over the internet .
ricke is hopeful that all this will stave off competition from vodafone and other competitors . foreign stability remains key deutsche telekom 's international business units have been more successful than its domestic market and are solely responsible for the company 's sales growth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : t-mobile is proving popular in the uk t-mobile in the uk , for example , added more than 360 thousand subscribers over the second quarter .
and revenues generated outside of germany have risen by a total of 4 percent to 3.6 billion euros . but telecommunications analyst ovum said deutsche telekom has underestimated its competition for too long , that it ca n't hide behind its overseas growth now , and that there 's certainly no " quick fix " for its domestic problems . so is this program of price cuts and innovations coming too late ?
and will competitors such as vodafone follow suit ?
it may well signify the beginning of a telecommunications price war in germany - which for customers at least , would be great news . laura stevens -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche telekom changes strategy after customer exodus deutsche telekom , europe 's biggest telecommunications group , has dramatically lost net income and customers to competitors in germany .

in all , the 21-year-old striker found the net three times , and equalled the scoresheets of greats like ronaldo and thierry henry .
two of podolski 's goals came against the group of 16 game against sweden in munich on june 24 . the former fc cologne idol hoped that he could repeat his tournament performance against the swedes in a friendly at gelsenkirchen on wednesday if for no other reason than to make bayern coach felix magath aware of his prowess in front of the net .
germany again demolished their helpless opponents , winning 3-0 , but sweden took podolski , who is not in top physical form at the moment , out of the game . and to boot , his defender , anders svensson , who had a run-in with podolski during the friendly , had some choice words for the youngster afterwards . " podolski was crying the whole time .
i went to him and told him he should stop .
that 's when he took a swipe at me , " the if elfsborg fullback said .
" he 's a good player , but damn whiny . " patience and confidence needed at moment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miroslav klose -lrb- left -rrb- tried anything to transfer his goalscoring talent to podolski despite the failed attempt to prove his true worth to magath with a strong match on the national squad , podolski has to make do with quiet patience at the moment . " there 's no reason for me to be in doubt .
i always knew that i would sometimes sit on the bench at bayern , particularly after the short amount of time i 've had to prepare after the world cup , " he told soccer magazine kicker this week . the overflowing pool of talent in munich makes it easier for magath to have a physically unfit prince poldi .
currently in front of the heir apparent in german soccer are ex-dutch national player roy makaay and paraguayan forward roque santa cruz . spared the energy-sapping world cup , makaay played inspiring soccer in bayern 's 2006/07 debut last friday , scoring once and taking on a greater leadership role after the departure of former midfield playmaker michael ballack .
santa cruz was in germany this summer , but paraguay were knocked out unceremoniously in the first round , leaving him plenty of time to recuperate . not everything this week was bad until he is 100 percent in shape , the 11 million euro transfer to bayern , however will have to listen to his coach repeatedly explain his decisions to the german press about why he is not starting .
even if magath would prefer not to . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski was undoubtedly the man at fc cologne " the situation has n't changed . -lrb- … -rrb- particularly with lukas , the players are n't so familiar with his timing and how he moves on the pitch .
we had too little time to get used to it , " magath said . the 21-year-old podolski also faced another setback recently when he failed to stop a satirical show on the star on german public radio , wdr , called " lukas ' diary . "
podolski 's lawyer called it " tasteless and without any standard . "
a court in munich however recently ruled that the comedy show in no way denigrated podolski . yet podolski could be happy about one event this past week .
his former and still beloved club fc cologne started their campaign to exit the second division with a 2-0 victory .
a reason for the prince to smile .
still , the season is just one week old and podolski 's permanent place will eventually be on the field and not on the bench . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de miroslav klose : ' best the bundesliga has to offer ' long stuck in the shadow of german soccer star michael ballack , miroslav klose came out into the spotlight during the world cup and will be essential in werder bremen 's german title bid .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 19.08.2006 kirchner painting at heart of restitution dispute großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this work , not a kirchner , was returned to its owner after being stolen by the nazis when the berlin senate unexpectedly returned a kirchner painting to the heirs of its original jewish owner , critics protested that it 's not a world war ii restitution case .
the work is now awaiting auction at christie 's . two elegant women , brightly dressed , walk along a crowded street .
ernst ludwig kirchner used this scene to capture the german capital in his painting " berlin street scene " from 1913 . this painting is now the object of a fierce restitution dispute involving the berlin state senate , a berlin museum , the ernst-ludwig-kirchner archive and the heirs of the painting 's original jewish owner . it is currently scheduled to go under the hammer at christie 's auction house in new york , where it could bring in between 14 and 19.5 million euros -lrb- $ 18 to 25 million -rrb- .
such a selling price would make it the artist 's most expensive work . kirchner and painting owner rejected by nazis kirchner , a master of german impressionism , created the work in the same year his artist group die brücke broke up .
many big-name impressionists - like emil nolde , edvard munch and henri matisse - were part of the group , whose name " the bridge " symbolized the links its members sought to establish between artistic styles . kirchner and the other members of die brücke were denounced by the nazis after hitler came to power in 1933 because their work conflicted with the party 's rejection of modernity , particularly in art . now a flurry of controversy has arisen over whether the purchase of the painting from the jewish family of the deceased original owner alfred hess in the early years of the third reich by a german art collector may have been forced because of anti-semitism and the price set artificially low .
if so , the work could qualify for restitution . painting returned to hess heir bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirchner 's " group of artists " depicts members of the " die brücke " group in late july , berlin 's senate , which had been in possession of kirchner 's 1913 painting , unexpectedly returned it to hess ' heir in england .
though the move came as a surprise , secret negotiations had been underway for almost two years already . barbara kisseler , berlin 's state secretary of culture told the daily newspaper frankfurt allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- that the masterpiece was returned because it had come to their attention that the hess family had been unfairly treated during the nazi dictatorship . " moral considerations " played a significant role in the decision , she said . shortly after the restitution of the piece was made public , the new york auction house christie 's announced it had purchased the kirchner work and planned to auction it on november 8 . critics claim restitution not legitimate in a joint statement , the ernst ludwig kirchner archive near bern , the brücke museum and the berlin auction house villa grisebach have publicly protested the return of the kirchner painting , claiming it had been legally purchased . they wrote that the berlin senate had been " dilettantish " in dealing with " german museum property . " alfred hess was an avid art collector and successful shoe factory owner , but plunged into insolvency during the global economic crisis in the late 1920 's .
when he died in 1931 his family brought the kirchner work to switzerland . in 1936 or 1937 - the exact date is unknown - the painting was sold to collector carl hagemann in cologne , allegedly for a sum of 3,000 reich marks , and brought to what was then nazi germany . until recently , the legitimacy of the sale had not been questioned . details of sale remain unclear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : debate rages on who should get the " berlin street scene " in the end the berlin senate now contends that carl hagemann 's purchase price was either so low that it took advantage of the anti-semitic policies of the nazi regime , or that the money never made it into their hands at all . " as in many similar cases , the family fortune mainly consisted of works of art , which were sold in order to make a living , " wolfgang henze , art historian and administrator of the ernst ludwig kirchner archive , wrote the berlin senate , as reported by faz .
" fortunately , the hess family managed in time to get their collection abroad . " the open letter from the kirchner archive , the brücke museum and the berlin auction house also pointed out that the hess family sold paintings on a regular basis over an extended period of time , which could indicate they were not coerced into selling the " berlin street scene . " christie 's had a part in the restitution while it has not yet been firmly established if the transaction between carl hagemann and the hess family in the mid-1930s was fair , christie 's speedy acquisition of the painting has raised eyebrows . ludwig von pufendorf , chairmen of the brücke museum board and berlin 's former state culture secretary , told german radio broadcaster deutschlandradio kultur that christie 's financed the entire restitution process . christoph stölzl , another former state culture secretary in berlin and the general director of the german historical museum for over 10 years , told the online news site netzeitung.de : " the kirchner case sets a dangerous precedent for germany 's cultural heritage in the classical modern field .

the work is now awaiting auction at christie 's . two elegant women , brightly dressed , walk along a crowded street .
ernst ludwig kirchner used this scene to capture the german capital in his painting " berlin street scene " from 1913 . this painting is now the object of a fierce restitution dispute involving the berlin state senate , a berlin museum , the ernst-ludwig-kirchner archive and the heirs of the painting 's original jewish owner . it is currently scheduled to go under the hammer at christie 's auction house in new york , where it could bring in between 14 and 19.5 million euros -lrb- $ 18 to 25 million -rrb- .
such a selling price would make it the artist 's most expensive work . kirchner and painting owner rejected by nazis kirchner , a master of german impressionism , created the work in the same year his artist group die brücke broke up .
many big-name impressionists - like emil nolde , edvard munch and henri matisse - were part of the group , whose name " the bridge " symbolized the links its members sought to establish between artistic styles . kirchner and the other members of die brücke were denounced by the nazis after hitler came to power in 1933 because their work conflicted with the party 's rejection of modernity , particularly in art . now a flurry of controversy has arisen over whether the purchase of the painting from the jewish family of the deceased original owner alfred hess in the early years of the third reich by a german art collector may have been forced because of anti-semitism and the price set artificially low .
if so , the work could qualify for restitution . painting returned to hess heir bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirchner 's " group of artists " depicts members of the " die brücke " group in late july , berlin 's senate , which had been in possession of kirchner 's 1913 painting , unexpectedly returned it to hess ' heir in england .

" moral considerations " played a significant role in the decision , she said . shortly after the restitution of the piece was made public , the new york auction house christie 's announced it had purchased the kirchner work and planned to auction it on november 8 . critics claim restitution not legitimate in a joint statement , the ernst ludwig kirchner archive near bern , the brücke museum and the berlin auction house villa grisebach have publicly protested the return of the kirchner painting , claiming it had been legally purchased . they wrote that the berlin senate had been " dilettantish " in dealing with " german museum property . " alfred hess was an avid art collector and successful shoe factory owner , but plunged into insolvency during the global economic crisis in the late 1920 's .
when he died in 1931 his family brought the kirchner work to switzerland . in 1936 or 1937 - the exact date is unknown - the painting was sold to collector carl hagemann in cologne , allegedly for a sum of 3,000 reich marks , and brought to what was then nazi germany . until recently , the legitimacy of the sale had not been questioned . details of sale remain unclear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : debate rages on who should get the " berlin street scene " in the end the berlin senate now contends that carl hagemann 's purchase price was either so low that it took advantage of the anti-semitic policies of the nazi regime , or that the money never made it into their hands at all .

" moral considerations " played a significant role in the decision , she said . shortly after the restitution of the piece was made public , the new york auction house christie 's announced it had purchased the kirchner work and planned to auction it on november 8 . critics claim restitution not legitimate in a joint statement , the ernst ludwig kirchner archive near bern , the brücke museum and the berlin auction house villa grisebach have publicly protested the return of the kirchner painting , claiming it had been legally purchased . they wrote that the berlin senate had been " dilettantish " in dealing with " german museum property . " alfred hess was an avid art collector and successful shoe factory owner , but plunged into insolvency during the global economic crisis in the late 1920 's .
when he died in 1931 his family brought the kirchner work to switzerland . in 1936 or 1937 - the exact date is unknown - the painting was sold to collector carl hagemann in cologne , allegedly for a sum of 3,000 reich marks , and brought to what was then nazi germany . until recently , the legitimacy of the sale had not been questioned . details of sale remain unclear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : debate rages on who should get the " berlin street scene " in the end the berlin senate now contends that carl hagemann 's purchase price was either so low that it took advantage of the anti-semitic policies of the nazi regime , or that the money never made it into their hands at all . " as in many similar cases , the family fortune mainly consisted of works of art , which were sold in order to make a living , " wolfgang henze , art historian and administrator of the ernst ludwig kirchner archive , wrote the berlin senate , as reported by faz .
" fortunately , the hess family managed in time to get their collection abroad . " the open letter from the kirchner archive , the brücke museum and the berlin auction house also pointed out that the hess family sold paintings on a regular basis over an extended period of time , which could indicate they were not coerced into selling the " berlin street scene . " christie 's had a part in the restitution while it has not yet been firmly established if the transaction between carl hagemann and the hess family in the mid-1930s was fair , christie 's speedy acquisition of the painting has raised eyebrows . ludwig von pufendorf , chairmen of the brücke museum board and berlin 's former state culture secretary , told german radio broadcaster deutschlandradio kultur that christie 's financed the entire restitution process . christoph stölzl , another former state culture secretary in berlin and the general director of the german historical museum for over 10 years , told the online news site netzeitung.de : " the kirchner case sets a dangerous precedent for germany 's cultural heritage in the classical modern field . " he added that " the ernst ludwig kirchner archive estimates that the return of 80 to 100 paintings could be demanded " if the restitution of the kirchner piece is not repealed . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a tale of two cities - tokyo and berlin an art exhibition showcases more than a century of german-japanese artistic exchange opened last week at berlin 's national gallery .

at least that is what people who know are saying while pointing out that there were times when more than 7,700 bundeswehr soldiers were deployed in foreign countries at once .
and calling the middle east a taboo area is also out of the question .
the agreement of the israeli and lebanese governments on a un resolution as well as the expressed wish of ehud olmert that germany participate in a peacekeeping force make a case against the taboo argument .
furthermore , the middle east is one of europe 's neighboring regions .
that germany has interests in peaceful conditions there is at least as important as in other regions of the world where the bundeswehr is already stationed . it is true that the deployment of a peacekeeping force is not a replacement for a political concept that would clarify the role of the radical islamic hezbollah in southern lebanon and secure israel 's right to existence .
that contribution is germany 's larger foreign policy challenge . heinz dylong is one of deutsche welle 's chief political editors . -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un peacekeeper search continues as eu hesitates as the lebanese army drove into the country 's southern region for the first time in 38 years , the eu stalled in giving firm troop pledges for the un peacekeeping force to be deployed to the region .

the company faces a tough fight in the highly competitve sector - but it 's a fight telekom is prepared for . deutsche telekom is the latest telecommunications company to feel the pressure of intensifying competition in europe .
the german firm , europe 's largest communications group , recently announced a 4 percent fall in half-year profits .
shares in deutsche telekom - which owns t-mobile - nose dived by 11 percent after the announcement earlier in august . the firm says the profit shortfall is due to a poor performance in germany and has pledged to take aggressive action to win back customers .
but will this be enough to halt the company 's slide ? deutsche telekom anticipates its operating profit for the year could be more than a billion euros -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- lower than previously anticipated .
the company said in a statement last week that its bottom-line net profit declined by 14 percent to 1.01 billion euros in the period from april to june , despite a three-percent rise in revenues to 15.13 billion euros . in germany , deutsche telekom 's overall sales have fallen by 4 percent in the past six months .
first half sales of its german mobile arm dropped by 3 percent in the first half of the year and its fixed-line business lost a million customers over that period . cuts in earning and sales forecasts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ricke will reverse the trend of high sales forecasts because of these results , deutsche telekom has been forced to issue a profit warning .
and deutsche telekom 's chairman , kai-uwe ricke , said the company will cut its earnings and sales forecasts for this year and next year . " deutsche telekom is transforming in a telecommunication market , a worldwide telecommunication market , which is ever-changing , " ricke said .
" and this transformation is huge .
it 's a challenge .
it 's a marathon . " ricke said he and his team are ready to take on the challenge .
the company 's strategy is to take a much more aggressive approach to competition in its key domestic markets in the second half of this year . many customers have switched to cheaper phone and internet providers , and deutsche telekom wants to win them back .
ricke said costs and prices will be slashed in order to defend the company 's domestic market share . attack is the best form of defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom 's near-monopoly is under threat " deutsche telekom has to do its homework in the german marketplace , " ricke said .
" that means we must rigorously defend our market share .
it has to do with pricing , it has to do with products , it has to do with service , it has to do with things we have in our pipeline , and what we are going to roll out over the next few weeks . " that means offering simpler packages with lower prices .
for example , new bundled offers from t-mobile in germany will soon cost less than 10 euro cents per minute , regardless of which network people call . deutsche telekom has also started marketing a merged fixed-line and mobile service to try to stop people canceling their deutsche telekom traditional phone lines . the company also plans to invest differently to increase its cash flow .
and it will spend an extra 1.2 billion euros on marketing and products this year .
that 's in addition to a 3-billion-euro investment in a fiber-optic network to broadcast live tv programs , such as germany 's bundesliga soccer league matches , over the internet .
ricke is hopeful that all this will stave off competition from vodafone and other competitors . foreign stability remains key deutsche telekom 's international business units have been more successful than its domestic market and are solely responsible for the company 's sales growth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : t-mobile is proving popular in the uk t-mobile in the uk , for example , added more than 360 thousand subscribers over the second quarter .
and revenues generated outside of germany have risen by a total of 4 percent to 3.6 billion euros . but telecommunications analyst ovum said deutsche telekom has underestimated its competition for too long , that it ca n't hide behind its overseas growth now , and that there 's certainly no " quick fix " for its domestic problems . so is this program of price cuts and innovations coming too late ?
and will competitors such as vodafone follow suit ?
it may well signify the beginning of a telecommunications price war in germany - which for customers at least , would be great news . laura stevens -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche telekom changes strategy after customer exodus deutsche telekom , europe 's biggest telecommunications group , has dramatically lost net income and customers to competitors in germany .

the company faces a tough fight in the highly competitve sector - but it 's a fight telekom is prepared for . deutsche telekom is the latest telecommunications company to feel the pressure of intensifying competition in europe .
the german firm , europe 's largest communications group , recently announced a 4 percent fall in half-year profits .
shares in deutsche telekom - which owns t-mobile - nose dived by 11 percent after the announcement earlier in august . the firm says the profit shortfall is due to a poor performance in germany and has pledged to take aggressive action to win back customers .
but will this be enough to halt the company 's slide ? deutsche telekom anticipates its operating profit for the year could be more than a billion euros -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- lower than previously anticipated .
the company said in a statement last week that its bottom-line net profit declined by 14 percent to 1.01 billion euros in the period from april to june , despite a three-percent rise in revenues to 15.13 billion euros . in germany , deutsche telekom 's overall sales have fallen by 4 percent in the past six months .
first half sales of its german mobile arm dropped by 3 percent in the first half of the year and its fixed-line business lost a million customers over that period . cuts in earning and sales forecasts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ricke will reverse the trend of high sales forecasts because of these results , deutsche telekom has been forced to issue a profit warning .
and deutsche telekom 's chairman , kai-uwe ricke , said the company will cut its earnings and sales forecasts for this year and next year . " deutsche telekom is transforming in a telecommunication market , a worldwide telecommunication market , which is ever-changing , " ricke said .
" and this transformation is huge .
it 's a challenge .
it 's a marathon . " ricke said he and his team are ready to take on the challenge .
the company 's strategy is to take a much more aggressive approach to competition in its key domestic markets in the second half of this year . many customers have switched to cheaper phone and internet providers , and deutsche telekom wants to win them back .
ricke said costs and prices will be slashed in order to defend the company 's domestic market share . attack is the best form of defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom 's near-monopoly is under threat " deutsche telekom has to do its homework in the german marketplace , " ricke said .
" that means we must rigorously defend our market share .
it has to do with pricing , it has to do with products , it has to do with service , it has to do with things we have in our pipeline , and what we are going to roll out over the next few weeks . " that means offering simpler packages with lower prices .
for example , new bundled offers from t-mobile in germany will soon cost less than 10 euro cents per minute , regardless of which network people call . deutsche telekom has also started marketing a merged fixed-line and mobile service to try to stop people canceling their deutsche telekom traditional phone lines . the company also plans to invest differently to increase its cash flow .
and it will spend an extra 1.2 billion euros on marketing and products this year .
that 's in addition to a 3-billion-euro investment in a fiber-optic network to broadcast live tv programs , such as germany 's bundesliga soccer league matches , over the internet .
ricke is hopeful that all this will stave off competition from vodafone and other competitors . foreign stability remains key deutsche telekom 's international business units have been more successful than its domestic market and are solely responsible for the company 's sales growth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : t-mobile is proving popular in the uk t-mobile in the uk , for example , added more than 360 thousand subscribers over the second quarter .
and revenues generated outside of germany have risen by a total of 4 percent to 3.6 billion euros . but telecommunications analyst ovum said deutsche telekom has underestimated its competition for too long , that it ca n't hide behind its overseas growth now , and that there 's certainly no " quick fix " for its domestic problems . so is this program of price cuts and innovations coming too late ?
and will competitors such as vodafone follow suit ?
it may well signify the beginning of a telecommunications price war in germany - which for customers at least , would be great news . laura stevens -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche telekom changes strategy after customer exodus deutsche telekom , europe 's biggest telecommunications group , has dramatically lost net income and customers to competitors in germany .
foreign business , however , is up .

on saturday , the shaky truce suffered a blow when helicopter-borne israeli commandos raided a hezbollah bastion , allegedly aimed to disrupt weapons supplies to hezbollah from syria and iran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boxes of humanitarian aid arrive in lebanon french navy commandos were the first to disembark from the force-projection and command ship mistral anchored off naqura , which is about three kilometers -lrb- two miles -rrb- from the israeli border . france 's reinforcements arrived under a united nations resolution that ended a 34-day war between israel and the shiite hezbollah militia which killed 1,150 people , mostly civilians , in lebanon .
hezbollah killed 160 israelis , mostly soldiers . " important that europe steps forward " france 's contribution however has fallen far short of the major commanding role that many had foreseen for the former colonial power in lebanon . the united nations has been urging european countries to provide troops to the peacekeeping force , as the beirut government moved ahead with the deployment of the lebanese army in the south of the country . on saturday french president jacques chirac held talks with several eu leaders stressing the need to swiftly agree the make-up and mandate of a peacekeeping force in lebanon , his office said . the french leader spoke by phone to italy 's prime minister romano prodi , turkish prime minister recep erdogan and finish prime minister matti vanhanen , whose country holds the eu presidency , it said .
all three countries have agreed in principle to send soldiers but want more details on the precise mandate of the force charged with policing a ceasefire between israel and hezbollah .
chirac highlighted " the need to very quickly specify the missions , the rules of engagement and the chain of command " of the un interim force in lebanon -lrb- unifil -rrb- , it said . he also insisted on the need for balance in the distribution of contingents " which must reflect the commitment of all the international community and , in particular european countries " , it added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac has urged european countries to act swiftly earlier , un deputy secretary general mark malloch brown too pleaded with european nations to pitch in . " the particular appeal i want to make today is that europe comes forward with troops for this first wave , " malloch brown told journalists .
" it 's very important that europe now steps forward . " un security council resolution 1701 , which governs the ceasefire , calls for israeli troops to withdraw from south lebanon in tandem with deployment of lebanese troops and a beefed-up un peacekeeping force in the area . italy , finland considering troops the un also issued a detailed list friday of its troop requirements for the vanguard force of 3,500 , including eight mechanized infantry battalions , three light reconnaissance battalions , three engineering battalions and five observation helicopters . a logistical battalion , a military hospital along with communications units and military policy will also be needed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reconstructing beirut is likely to take time italy 's government and both houses of parliament approved a motion friday to contribute troops to the un interim force which , under un security council resolution 1701 , is to be expanded from its existing 1,990 members to 15,000 . also on friday , the finnish government said it might send 250 troops , but that no firm decision would be taken until the end of the month .
denmark said it was ready to send three warships into the region . though the german government has ruled out sending any ground troops , chancellor angela merkel said germany could send a " maritime protection component " and provide logistics , air transport and reconnaissance , depending on the rules of engagement . un mandate too vague one of the main reasons for the reluctance of european nations to contribute troops remains the vagueness of the un peacekeeping force 's mandate . in germany , where the idea of sending german soldiers for a deployment which might involve turning their guns on israelis remains highly sensitive , politicians say the un mandate remains too ambiguous . " what we 're missing is a plan of operation , " said gert weisskirchen , foreign policy expert of the social democratic party .
" the rules of engagement are not clear and the un has to finally decide on that . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier with chancellor merkel even german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has called for clarification . " we do n't know whether the german navy for instance will have the right to enter aboard suspicious vessels , " steinmeier said .
" i hope that we manage to make decisive progress over the weekend . " german defence minister franz josef jung called on the united nations to give the troops deployed in lebanon an " unequivocal mandate " for the use of force . in an interview to be published on monday , jung said the german navy would have to be able to use armed force to prevent the transport of arms to hezbollah . such use of force would require a un mandate , and that the matter would have to be cleared up before germany could commit its troops , jung told the german magazine focus .

on saturday , the shaky truce suffered a blow when helicopter-borne israeli commandos raided a hezbollah bastion , allegedly aimed to disrupt weapons supplies to hezbollah from syria and iran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boxes of humanitarian aid arrive in lebanon french navy commandos were the first to disembark from the force-projection and command ship mistral anchored off naqura , which is about three kilometers -lrb- two miles -rrb- from the israeli border . france 's reinforcements arrived under a united nations resolution that ended a 34-day war between israel and the shiite hezbollah militia which killed 1,150 people , mostly civilians , in lebanon .
hezbollah killed 160 israelis , mostly soldiers .

in all , the 21-year-old striker found the net three times , and equalled the scoresheets of greats like ronaldo and thierry henry .
two of podolski 's goals came against the group of 16 game against sweden in munich on june 24 . the former fc cologne idol hoped that he could repeat his tournament performance against the swedes in a friendly at gelsenkirchen on wednesday if for no other reason than to make bayern coach felix magath aware of his prowess in front of the net .
germany again demolished their helpless opponents , winning 3-0 , but sweden took podolski , who is not in top physical form at the moment , out of the game . and to boot , his defender , anders svensson , who had a run-in with podolski during the friendly , had some choice words for the youngster afterwards . " podolski was crying the whole time .
i went to him and told him he should stop .
that 's when he took a swipe at me , " the if elfsborg fullback said .
" he 's a good player , but damn whiny . " patience and confidence needed at moment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miroslav klose -lrb- left -rrb- tried anything to transfer his goalscoring talent to podolski despite the failed attempt to prove his true worth to magath with a strong match on the national squad , podolski has to make do with quiet patience at the moment . " there 's no reason for me to be in doubt .
i always knew that i would sometimes sit on the bench at bayern , particularly after the short amount of time i 've had to prepare after the world cup , " he told soccer magazine kicker this week . the overflowing pool of talent in munich makes it easier for magath to have a physically unfit prince poldi .
currently in front of the heir apparent in german soccer are ex-dutch national player roy makaay and paraguayan forward roque santa cruz . spared the energy-sapping world cup , makaay played inspiring soccer in bayern 's 2006/07 debut last friday , scoring once and taking on a greater leadership role after the departure of former midfield playmaker michael ballack .
santa cruz was in germany this summer , but paraguay were knocked out unceremoniously in the first round , leaving him plenty of time to recuperate . not everything this week was bad until he is 100 percent in shape , the 11 million euro transfer to bayern , however will have to listen to his coach repeatedly explain his decisions to the german press about why he is not starting .
even if magath would prefer not to . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski was undoubtedly the man at fc cologne " the situation has n't changed . -lrb- … -rrb- particularly with lukas , the players are n't so familiar with his timing and how he moves on the pitch .
we had too little time to get used to it , " magath said . the 21-year-old podolski also faced another setback recently when he failed to stop a satirical show on the star on german public radio , wdr , called " lukas ' diary . "
podolski 's lawyer called it " tasteless and without any standard . "
a court in munich however recently ruled that the comedy show in no way denigrated podolski . yet podolski could be happy about one event this past week .
his former and still beloved club fc cologne started their campaign to exit the second division with a 2-0 victory .
a reason for the prince to smile .

the company faces a tough fight in the highly competitve sector - but it 's a fight telekom is prepared for . deutsche telekom is the latest telecommunications company to feel the pressure of intensifying competition in europe .
the german firm , europe 's largest communications group , recently announced a 4 percent fall in half-year profits .
shares in deutsche telekom - which owns t-mobile - nose dived by 11 percent after the announcement earlier in august . the firm says the profit shortfall is due to a poor performance in germany and has pledged to take aggressive action to win back customers .
but will this be enough to halt the company 's slide ? deutsche telekom anticipates its operating profit for the year could be more than a billion euros -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- lower than previously anticipated .
the company said in a statement last week that its bottom-line net profit declined by 14 percent to 1.01 billion euros in the period from april to june , despite a three-percent rise in revenues to 15.13 billion euros . in germany , deutsche telekom 's overall sales have fallen by 4 percent in the past six months .
first half sales of its german mobile arm dropped by 3 percent in the first half of the year and its fixed-line business lost a million customers over that period . cuts in earning and sales forecasts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ricke will reverse the trend of high sales forecasts because of these results , deutsche telekom has been forced to issue a profit warning .
and deutsche telekom 's chairman , kai-uwe ricke , said the company will cut its earnings and sales forecasts for this year and next year . " deutsche telekom is transforming in a telecommunication market , a worldwide telecommunication market , which is ever-changing , " ricke said .
" and this transformation is huge .
it 's a challenge .
it 's a marathon . " ricke said he and his team are ready to take on the challenge .
the company 's strategy is to take a much more aggressive approach to competition in its key domestic markets in the second half of this year . many customers have switched to cheaper phone and internet providers , and deutsche telekom wants to win them back .
ricke said costs and prices will be slashed in order to defend the company 's domestic market share . attack is the best form of defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom 's near-monopoly is under threat " deutsche telekom has to do its homework in the german marketplace , " ricke said .

the company faces a tough fight in the highly competitve sector - but it 's a fight telekom is prepared for . deutsche telekom is the latest telecommunications company to feel the pressure of intensifying competition in europe .
the german firm , europe 's largest communications group , recently announced a 4 percent fall in half-year profits .
shares in deutsche telekom - which owns t-mobile - nose dived by 11 percent after the announcement earlier in august . the firm says the profit shortfall is due to a poor performance in germany and has pledged to take aggressive action to win back customers .
but will this be enough to halt the company 's slide ? deutsche telekom anticipates its operating profit for the year could be more than a billion euros -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- lower than previously anticipated .
the company said in a statement last week that its bottom-line net profit declined by 14 percent to 1.01 billion euros in the period from april to june , despite a three-percent rise in revenues to 15.13 billion euros . in germany , deutsche telekom 's overall sales have fallen by 4 percent in the past six months .
first half sales of its german mobile arm dropped by 3 percent in the first half of the year and its fixed-line business lost a million customers over that period . cuts in earning and sales forecasts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ricke will reverse the trend of high sales forecasts because of these results , deutsche telekom has been forced to issue a profit warning .

" and this transformation is huge .
it 's a challenge .
it 's a marathon . " ricke said he and his team are ready to take on the challenge .
the company 's strategy is to take a much more aggressive approach to competition in its key domestic markets in the second half of this year . many customers have switched to cheaper phone and internet providers , and deutsche telekom wants to win them back .
ricke said costs and prices will be slashed in order to defend the company 's domestic market share . attack is the best form of defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom 's near-monopoly is under threat " deutsche telekom has to do its homework in the german marketplace , " ricke said .

" i can only recommend to jan ullrich and all the other cyclists accused of doping to make a clean slate now , " franke said .
" the cycling union , i ’ m sure will certainly respect that in their ruling . " so far however , jan ullrich has continued to protest his innocence and denies the doping allegations . but the noose around his neck is getting tighter .

the authorities also found explosives at the station , according to german public broadcaster ard . " the person appears to be one of the two suspects that have been sought since yesterday with the help of video footage that was made public , " the federal prosecutor 's office said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german police are searching for these two men german police are hunting for two men suspected of planting two homemade bombs packed into suitcases on july 31 in trains in the western cities of dortmund and koblenz .
the bombs however failed to detonate . investigators first thought that the devices were a blackmail attempt , but analysis of the contents revealed a possible link to lebanon . " we are now working on the basis that this was the work of a terrorist group based in germany and that it was an attempt to kill a large number of people , " rainer griesbaum , a federal prosecutor , told a press conference friday . rail traffic was suspended in kiel on saturday morning as " a measure in the current investigation by the federal police , " a spokesman for the regional police said .
he gave no further details . bombs would have created " a fireball " the head of the federal crime office , joerg ziercke , said the bombs were packed into identical black cases and consisted of gas canisters , alarm clocks , wires and batteries and soft drink bottles filled with a flammable liquid . " the cases had been supposed to explode 10 minutes before the trains arrived at the stations , " ziercke said . " it 's more likely than unlikely that there was a terrorist background , " he said . if the around 25-kilo -lrb- 55-lb . -rrb- suitcase bombs had exploded they would have lead to " a fireball " in the train carriages and an " indeterminate number of injured and possible deaths , " ziercke said . he added that a 100-strong team of investigators was still trying to establish why the devices failed to explode . a note in the case found in koblenz contained arabic writing and a telephone number in lebanon , and packets of starch with labels in arabic and english were also found . 50,000 euro reward the cases containing the bombs were unaccompanied when they were discovered , but closed circuit television cameras recorded pictures of two dark-haired young men , one wearing a germany football shirt , carrying rucksacks and wheeling the suitcases on to platforms at the cologne railway station . the two men seen on the grainy images have been described as being from " southern countries . " investigators are offering a reward of 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 64,000 -rrb- for any information leading to the arrest of the men . speaking in berlin friday , german interior minister wolfgang schäuble also warned that germany should brace itself for similar attempts .
" unfortunately , we must assume that the danger of a repeat of these attempted attacks . "
the discovery of the two bombed sparked a series of scares at railway stations across germany with parts of the central station in düsseldorf sealed off friday after a suspicious suitcase was found .
officials in düsseldorf later gave the all-clear , saying it had been a false alarm . terror plot " highly likely " the bka suggested that germany was being targeted for attacks possibly by a terrorist organization operating in the country .
if the explosive devices had been detonated , their size and construction would have created devastation and death on a scale reminiscent of the july 7 , 2005 attacks on the london transport system , according to a report in the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper . both of the suitcases discovered on july 31 contained gas cylinders rigged up to an ignition mechanism and had been left in two regional trains which usually run at the height of the commuter rush hour .
the suitcases were discovered by rail staff when the trains terminated at the two hub stations .
the construction of the devices and the potential impact the explosions would have had suggests a sophisticated plot . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german security official with one of the canisters investigations by bka engineers revealed that the bombs were designed so that simultaneous detonation would have been possible and that they would generate " an explosive force so big that the explosion would have reached the dimension of the subway attack on london in the summer of 2005 , " a high-ranking security source told the newspaper . in the london attacks , 52 people were killed and over 700 were injured when suicide bombers struck on three underground trains and a bus . debate rages on increased surveillance the investigation has fired an intense debate in germany regarding the expansion of video surveillance in railway stations and in trains .
some german states have already taken steps to increase their " big brother " security systems . the conservative-controlled hamburg state government wants to add more cameras to streets and public places , not just railway stations and trains . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opinions differ on what measures should be taken in brandenburg , interior minister jörg schönbohm of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- said that the state was considering limiting surveillance to people getting on and off trains in an attempt to dodge the controversial topic of data protection . however , federal data protection czar peter schaar has pleaded for more to be done , with extra staff and cameras placed at all railway stations and on trains to increase security . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de homemade bombs found on german railway german federal prosecutors are investigating a possible terrorist link to two unexploded bombs discovered in dortmund and koblenz .

hezbollah killed 160 israelis , mostly soldiers .

all three countries have agreed in principle to send soldiers but want more details on the precise mandate of the force charged with policing a ceasefire between israel and hezbollah .

denmark said it was ready to send three warships into the region . though the german government has ruled out sending any ground troops , chancellor angela merkel said germany could send a " maritime protection component " and provide logistics , air transport and reconnaissance , depending on the rules of engagement . un mandate too vague one of the main reasons for the reluctance of european nations to contribute troops remains the vagueness of the un peacekeeping force 's mandate . in germany , where the idea of sending german soldiers for a deployment which might involve turning their guns on israelis remains highly sensitive , politicians say the un mandate remains too ambiguous .

the work is now awaiting auction at christie 's . two elegant women , brightly dressed , walk along a crowded street .
ernst ludwig kirchner used this scene to capture the german capital in his painting " berlin street scene " from 1913 . this painting is now the object of a fierce restitution dispute involving the berlin state senate , a berlin museum , the ernst-ludwig-kirchner archive and the heirs of the painting 's original jewish owner . it is currently scheduled to go under the hammer at christie 's auction house in new york , where it could bring in between 14 and 19.5 million euros -lrb- $ 18 to 25 million -rrb- .
such a selling price would make it the artist 's most expensive work . kirchner and painting owner rejected by nazis kirchner , a master of german impressionism , created the work in the same year his artist group die brücke broke up .
many big-name impressionists - like emil nolde , edvard munch and henri matisse - were part of the group , whose name " the bridge " symbolized the links its members sought to establish between artistic styles . kirchner and the other members of die brücke were denounced by the nazis after hitler came to power in 1933 because their work conflicted with the party 's rejection of modernity , particularly in art . now a flurry of controversy has arisen over whether the purchase of the painting from the jewish family of the deceased original owner alfred hess in the early years of the third reich by a german art collector may have been forced because of anti-semitism and the price set artificially low .
if so , the work could qualify for restitution . painting returned to hess heir bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirchner 's " group of artists " depicts members of the " die brücke " group in late july , berlin 's senate , which had been in possession of kirchner 's 1913 painting , unexpectedly returned it to hess ' heir in england .
though the move came as a surprise , secret negotiations had been underway for almost two years already . barbara kisseler , berlin 's state secretary of culture told the daily newspaper frankfurt allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- that the masterpiece was returned because it had come to their attention that the hess family had been unfairly treated during the nazi dictatorship . " moral considerations " played a significant role in the decision , she said . shortly after the restitution of the piece was made public , the new york auction house christie 's announced it had purchased the kirchner work and planned to auction it on november 8 . critics claim restitution not legitimate in a joint statement , the ernst ludwig kirchner archive near bern , the brücke museum and the berlin auction house villa grisebach have publicly protested the return of the kirchner painting , claiming it had been legally purchased . they wrote that the berlin senate had been " dilettantish " in dealing with " german museum property . " alfred hess was an avid art collector and successful shoe factory owner , but plunged into insolvency during the global economic crisis in the late 1920 's .
when he died in 1931 his family brought the kirchner work to switzerland . in 1936 or 1937 - the exact date is unknown - the painting was sold to collector carl hagemann in cologne , allegedly for a sum of 3,000 reich marks , and brought to what was then nazi germany . until recently , the legitimacy of the sale had not been questioned . details of sale remain unclear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : debate rages on who should get the " berlin street scene " in the end the berlin senate now contends that carl hagemann 's purchase price was either so low that it took advantage of the anti-semitic policies of the nazi regime , or that the money never made it into their hands at all . " as in many similar cases , the family fortune mainly consisted of works of art , which were sold in order to make a living , " wolfgang henze , art historian and administrator of the ernst ludwig kirchner archive , wrote the berlin senate , as reported by faz .
" fortunately , the hess family managed in time to get their collection abroad . " the open letter from the kirchner archive , the brücke museum and the berlin auction house also pointed out that the hess family sold paintings on a regular basis over an extended period of time , which could indicate they were not coerced into selling the " berlin street scene . " christie 's had a part in the restitution while it has not yet been firmly established if the transaction between carl hagemann and the hess family in the mid-1930s was fair , christie 's speedy acquisition of the painting has raised eyebrows . ludwig von pufendorf , chairmen of the brücke museum board and berlin 's former state culture secretary , told german radio broadcaster deutschlandradio kultur that christie 's financed the entire restitution process . christoph stölzl , another former state culture secretary in berlin and the general director of the german historical museum for over 10 years , told the online news site netzeitung.de : " the kirchner case sets a dangerous precedent for germany 's cultural heritage in the classical modern field . " he added that " the ernst ludwig kirchner archive estimates that the return of 80 to 100 paintings could be demanded " if the restitution of the kirchner piece is not repealed . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a tale of two cities - tokyo and berlin an art exhibition showcases more than a century of german-japanese artistic exchange opened last week at berlin 's national gallery .

it is a hesitation that is fundamentally positive and beneficial as nothing offers better protection from all sorts of the disastrous , overboard patriotism of the past . additionally , germany is interwoven in a thick mesh of international connections that make the country an equal partner in the political landscape .
but this role brings responsibilities with it that the country with europe 's largest population after russia can not avoid . this also applies to the possible and foreseeable deployment of bundeswehr soldiers in lebanon as part of the united nations ' peacekeeping force .
its mission would be to prevent hostilities in southern lebanon by making use of the relevant un resolution .
the positioning of troops and the direct involvement of israel in the conflict mean this would be new territory for germany , since its relationship with israel requires a special course of action due to the effects of history . it is simply intolerable to imagine that a situation could arise in which a german solider could shoot an israeli solider .
the deployment of only the navy to israeli and lebanese waters and a lightly armed police force on the lebanese-syrian border could provide a certain degree of assurance that it does not come to such a confrontation .
legitimate concerns of course , there are also legitimate objections in germany to a german deployment to lebanon .
pragmatic objectionss that point out the bundeswehr 's stretched capabilities , and , more fundamentally , that the middle east has been declared a downright taboo area for german soldiers . a deployment to lebanon does indeed lie within the bundeswehr 's capabilities .
at least that is what people who know are saying while pointing out that there were times when more than 7,700 bundeswehr soldiers were deployed in foreign countries at once .
and calling the middle east a taboo area is also out of the question .
the agreement of the israeli and lebanese governments on a un resolution as well as the expressed wish of ehud olmert that germany participate in a peacekeeping force make a case against the taboo argument .
furthermore , the middle east is one of europe 's neighboring regions .
that germany has interests in peaceful conditions there is at least as important as in other regions of the world where the bundeswehr is already stationed . it is true that the deployment of a peacekeeping force is not a replacement for a political concept that would clarify the role of the radical islamic hezbollah in southern lebanon and secure israel 's right to existence .

it is a hesitation that is fundamentally positive and beneficial as nothing offers better protection from all sorts of the disastrous , overboard patriotism of the past . additionally , germany is interwoven in a thick mesh of international connections that make the country an equal partner in the political landscape .
but this role brings responsibilities with it that the country with europe 's largest population after russia can not avoid . this also applies to the possible and foreseeable deployment of bundeswehr soldiers in lebanon as part of the united nations ' peacekeeping force .
its mission would be to prevent hostilities in southern lebanon by making use of the relevant un resolution .
the positioning of troops and the direct involvement of israel in the conflict mean this would be new territory for germany , since its relationship with israel requires a special course of action due to the effects of history . it is simply intolerable to imagine that a situation could arise in which a german solider could shoot an israeli solider .
the deployment of only the navy to israeli and lebanese waters and a lightly armed police force on the lebanese-syrian border could provide a certain degree of assurance that it does not come to such a confrontation .
legitimate concerns of course , there are also legitimate objections in germany to a german deployment to lebanon .
pragmatic objectionss that point out the bundeswehr 's stretched capabilities , and , more fundamentally , that the middle east has been declared a downright taboo area for german soldiers . a deployment to lebanon does indeed lie within the bundeswehr 's capabilities .
at least that is what people who know are saying while pointing out that there were times when more than 7,700 bundeswehr soldiers were deployed in foreign countries at once .
and calling the middle east a taboo area is also out of the question .
the agreement of the israeli and lebanese governments on a un resolution as well as the expressed wish of ehud olmert that germany participate in a peacekeeping force make a case against the taboo argument .
furthermore , the middle east is one of europe 's neighboring regions .
that germany has interests in peaceful conditions there is at least as important as in other regions of the world where the bundeswehr is already stationed . it is true that the deployment of a peacekeeping force is not a replacement for a political concept that would clarify the role of the radical islamic hezbollah in southern lebanon and secure israel 's right to existence .
that contribution is germany 's larger foreign policy challenge . heinz dylong is one of deutsche welle 's chief political editors . -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un peacekeeper search continues as eu hesitates as the lebanese army drove into the country 's southern region for the first time in 38 years , the eu stalled in giving firm troop pledges for the un peacekeeping force to be deployed to the region .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 19.08.2006 kirchner painting at heart of restitution dispute großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this work , not a kirchner , was returned to its owner after being stolen by the nazis when the berlin senate unexpectedly returned a kirchner painting to the heirs of its original jewish owner , critics protested that it 's not a world war ii restitution case .
the work is now awaiting auction at christie 's . two elegant women , brightly dressed , walk along a crowded street .
ernst ludwig kirchner used this scene to capture the german capital in his painting " berlin street scene " from 1913 . this painting is now the object of a fierce restitution dispute involving the berlin state senate , a berlin museum , the ernst-ludwig-kirchner archive and the heirs of the painting 's original jewish owner . it is currently scheduled to go under the hammer at christie 's auction house in new york , where it could bring in between 14 and 19.5 million euros -lrb- $ 18 to 25 million -rrb- .
such a selling price would make it the artist 's most expensive work . kirchner and painting owner rejected by nazis kirchner , a master of german impressionism , created the work in the same year his artist group die brücke broke up .
many big-name impressionists - like emil nolde , edvard munch and henri matisse - were part of the group , whose name " the bridge " symbolized the links its members sought to establish between artistic styles . kirchner and the other members of die brücke were denounced by the nazis after hitler came to power in 1933 because their work conflicted with the party 's rejection of modernity , particularly in art . now a flurry of controversy has arisen over whether the purchase of the painting from the jewish family of the deceased original owner alfred hess in the early years of the third reich by a german art collector may have been forced because of anti-semitism and the price set artificially low .
if so , the work could qualify for restitution . painting returned to hess heir bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirchner 's " group of artists " depicts members of the " die brücke " group in late july , berlin 's senate , which had been in possession of kirchner 's 1913 painting , unexpectedly returned it to hess ' heir in england .
though the move came as a surprise , secret negotiations had been underway for almost two years already . barbara kisseler , berlin 's state secretary of culture told the daily newspaper frankfurt allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- that the masterpiece was returned because it had come to their attention that the hess family had been unfairly treated during the nazi dictatorship . " moral considerations " played a significant role in the decision , she said . shortly after the restitution of the piece was made public , the new york auction house christie 's announced it had purchased the kirchner work and planned to auction it on november 8 . critics claim restitution not legitimate in a joint statement , the ernst ludwig kirchner archive near bern , the brücke museum and the berlin auction house villa grisebach have publicly protested the return of the kirchner painting , claiming it had been legally purchased . they wrote that the berlin senate had been " dilettantish " in dealing with " german museum property . " alfred hess was an avid art collector and successful shoe factory owner , but plunged into insolvency during the global economic crisis in the late 1920 's .
when he died in 1931 his family brought the kirchner work to switzerland . in 1936 or 1937 - the exact date is unknown - the painting was sold to collector carl hagemann in cologne , allegedly for a sum of 3,000 reich marks , and brought to what was then nazi germany . until recently , the legitimacy of the sale had not been questioned . details of sale remain unclear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : debate rages on who should get the " berlin street scene " in the end the berlin senate now contends that carl hagemann 's purchase price was either so low that it took advantage of the anti-semitic policies of the nazi regime , or that the money never made it into their hands at all . " as in many similar cases , the family fortune mainly consisted of works of art , which were sold in order to make a living , " wolfgang henze , art historian and administrator of the ernst ludwig kirchner archive , wrote the berlin senate , as reported by faz .
" fortunately , the hess family managed in time to get their collection abroad . " the open letter from the kirchner archive , the brücke museum and the berlin auction house also pointed out that the hess family sold paintings on a regular basis over an extended period of time , which could indicate they were not coerced into selling the " berlin street scene . " christie 's had a part in the restitution while it has not yet been firmly established if the transaction between carl hagemann and the hess family in the mid-1930s was fair , christie 's speedy acquisition of the painting has raised eyebrows . ludwig von pufendorf , chairmen of the brücke museum board and berlin 's former state culture secretary , told german radio broadcaster deutschlandradio kultur that christie 's financed the entire restitution process . christoph stölzl , another former state culture secretary in berlin and the general director of the german historical museum for over 10 years , told the online news site netzeitung.de : " the kirchner case sets a dangerous precedent for germany 's cultural heritage in the classical modern field . " he added that " the ernst ludwig kirchner archive estimates that the return of 80 to 100 paintings could be demanded " if the restitution of the kirchner piece is not repealed . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a tale of two cities - tokyo and berlin an art exhibition showcases more than a century of german-japanese artistic exchange opened last week at berlin 's national gallery .

the authorities also found explosives at the station , according to german public broadcaster ard . " the person appears to be one of the two suspects that have been sought since yesterday with the help of video footage that was made public , " the federal prosecutor 's office said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german police are searching for these two men german police are hunting for two men suspected of planting two homemade bombs packed into suitcases on july 31 in trains in the western cities of dortmund and koblenz .
the bombs however failed to detonate . investigators first thought that the devices were a blackmail attempt , but analysis of the contents revealed a possible link to lebanon . " we are now working on the basis that this was the work of a terrorist group based in germany and that it was an attempt to kill a large number of people , " rainer griesbaum , a federal prosecutor , told a press conference friday . rail traffic was suspended in kiel on saturday morning as " a measure in the current investigation by the federal police , " a spokesman for the regional police said .
he gave no further details . bombs would have created " a fireball " the head of the federal crime office , joerg ziercke , said the bombs were packed into identical black cases and consisted of gas canisters , alarm clocks , wires and batteries and soft drink bottles filled with a flammable liquid . " the cases had been supposed to explode 10 minutes before the trains arrived at the stations , " ziercke said . " it 's more likely than unlikely that there was a terrorist background , " he said . if the around 25-kilo -lrb- 55-lb . -rrb- suitcase bombs had exploded they would have lead to " a fireball " in the train carriages and an " indeterminate number of injured and possible deaths , " ziercke said . he added that a 100-strong team of investigators was still trying to establish why the devices failed to explode . a note in the case found in koblenz contained arabic writing and a telephone number in lebanon , and packets of starch with labels in arabic and english were also found . 50,000 euro reward the cases containing the bombs were unaccompanied when they were discovered , but closed circuit television cameras recorded pictures of two dark-haired young men , one wearing a germany football shirt , carrying rucksacks and wheeling the suitcases on to platforms at the cologne railway station . the two men seen on the grainy images have been described as being from " southern countries . " investigators are offering a reward of 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 64,000 -rrb- for any information leading to the arrest of the men . speaking in berlin friday , german interior minister wolfgang schäuble also warned that germany should brace itself for similar attempts .
" unfortunately , we must assume that the danger of a repeat of these attempted attacks . "
the discovery of the two bombed sparked a series of scares at railway stations across germany with parts of the central station in düsseldorf sealed off friday after a suspicious suitcase was found .
officials in düsseldorf later gave the all-clear , saying it had been a false alarm . terror plot " highly likely " the bka suggested that germany was being targeted for attacks possibly by a terrorist organization operating in the country .
if the explosive devices had been detonated , their size and construction would have created devastation and death on a scale reminiscent of the july 7 , 2005 attacks on the london transport system , according to a report in the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper . both of the suitcases discovered on july 31 contained gas cylinders rigged up to an ignition mechanism and had been left in two regional trains which usually run at the height of the commuter rush hour .
the suitcases were discovered by rail staff when the trains terminated at the two hub stations .
the construction of the devices and the potential impact the explosions would have had suggests a sophisticated plot . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german security official with one of the canisters investigations by bka engineers revealed that the bombs were designed so that simultaneous detonation would have been possible and that they would generate " an explosive force so big that the explosion would have reached the dimension of the subway attack on london in the summer of 2005 , " a high-ranking security source told the newspaper . in the london attacks , 52 people were killed and over 700 were injured when suicide bombers struck on three underground trains and a bus . debate rages on increased surveillance the investigation has fired an intense debate in germany regarding the expansion of video surveillance in railway stations and in trains .
some german states have already taken steps to increase their " big brother " security systems . the conservative-controlled hamburg state government wants to add more cameras to streets and public places , not just railway stations and trains . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opinions differ on what measures should be taken in brandenburg , interior minister jörg schönbohm of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- said that the state was considering limiting surveillance to people getting on and off trains in an attempt to dodge the controversial topic of data protection . however , federal data protection czar peter schaar has pleaded for more to be done , with extra staff and cameras placed at all railway stations and on trains to increase security . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de homemade bombs found on german railway german federal prosecutors are investigating a possible terrorist link to two unexploded bombs discovered in dortmund and koblenz .

in all , the 21-year-old striker found the net three times , and equalled the scoresheets of greats like ronaldo and thierry henry .
two of podolski 's goals came against the group of 16 game against sweden in munich on june 24 . the former fc cologne idol hoped that he could repeat his tournament performance against the swedes in a friendly at gelsenkirchen on wednesday if for no other reason than to make bayern coach felix magath aware of his prowess in front of the net .
germany again demolished their helpless opponents , winning 3-0 , but sweden took podolski , who is not in top physical form at the moment , out of the game . and to boot , his defender , anders svensson , who had a run-in with podolski during the friendly , had some choice words for the youngster afterwards . " podolski was crying the whole time .

" there 's no reason for me to be in doubt .
i always knew that i would sometimes sit on the bench at bayern , particularly after the short amount of time i 've had to prepare after the world cup , " he told soccer magazine kicker this week . the overflowing pool of talent in munich makes it easier for magath to have a physically unfit prince poldi .
currently in front of the heir apparent in german soccer are ex-dutch national player roy makaay and paraguayan forward roque santa cruz . spared the energy-sapping world cup , makaay played inspiring soccer in bayern 's 2006/07 debut last friday , scoring once and taking on a greater leadership role after the departure of former midfield playmaker michael ballack .
santa cruz was in germany this summer , but paraguay were knocked out unceremoniously in the first round , leaving him plenty of time to recuperate . not everything this week was bad until he is 100 percent in shape , the 11 million euro transfer to bayern , however will have to listen to his coach repeatedly explain his decisions to the german press about why he is not starting .
even if magath would prefer not to . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski was undoubtedly the man at fc cologne " the situation has n't changed . -lrb- … -rrb- particularly with lukas , the players are n't so familiar with his timing and how he moves on the pitch .
we had too little time to get used to it , " magath said . the 21-year-old podolski also faced another setback recently when he failed to stop a satirical show on the star on german public radio , wdr , called " lukas ' diary . "
podolski 's lawyer called it " tasteless and without any standard . "
a court in munich however recently ruled that the comedy show in no way denigrated podolski . yet podolski could be happy about one event this past week .
his former and still beloved club fc cologne started their campaign to exit the second division with a 2-0 victory .

the authorities also found explosives at the station , according to german public broadcaster ard . " the person appears to be one of the two suspects that have been sought since yesterday with the help of video footage that was made public , " the federal prosecutor 's office said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german police are searching for these two men german police are hunting for two men suspected of planting two homemade bombs packed into suitcases on july 31 in trains in the western cities of dortmund and koblenz .
the bombs however failed to detonate . investigators first thought that the devices were a blackmail attempt , but analysis of the contents revealed a possible link to lebanon . " we are now working on the basis that this was the work of a terrorist group based in germany and that it was an attempt to kill a large number of people , " rainer griesbaum , a federal prosecutor , told a press conference friday . rail traffic was suspended in kiel on saturday morning as " a measure in the current investigation by the federal police , " a spokesman for the regional police said .
he gave no further details . bombs would have created " a fireball " the head of the federal crime office , joerg ziercke , said the bombs were packed into identical black cases and consisted of gas canisters , alarm clocks , wires and batteries and soft drink bottles filled with a flammable liquid . " the cases had been supposed to explode 10 minutes before the trains arrived at the stations , " ziercke said . " it 's more likely than unlikely that there was a terrorist background , " he said . if the around 25-kilo -lrb- 55-lb . -rrb- suitcase bombs had exploded they would have lead to " a fireball " in the train carriages and an " indeterminate number of injured and possible deaths , " ziercke said . he added that a 100-strong team of investigators was still trying to establish why the devices failed to explode . a note in the case found in koblenz contained arabic writing and a telephone number in lebanon , and packets of starch with labels in arabic and english were also found . 50,000 euro reward the cases containing the bombs were unaccompanied when they were discovered , but closed circuit television cameras recorded pictures of two dark-haired young men , one wearing a germany football shirt , carrying rucksacks and wheeling the suitcases on to platforms at the cologne railway station . the two men seen on the grainy images have been described as being from " southern countries . " investigators are offering a reward of 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 64,000 -rrb- for any information leading to the arrest of the men . speaking in berlin friday , german interior minister wolfgang schäuble also warned that germany should brace itself for similar attempts .
" unfortunately , we must assume that the danger of a repeat of these attempted attacks . "
the discovery of the two bombed sparked a series of scares at railway stations across germany with parts of the central station in düsseldorf sealed off friday after a suspicious suitcase was found .
officials in düsseldorf later gave the all-clear , saying it had been a false alarm . terror plot " highly likely " the bka suggested that germany was being targeted for attacks possibly by a terrorist organization operating in the country .
if the explosive devices had been detonated , their size and construction would have created devastation and death on a scale reminiscent of the july 7 , 2005 attacks on the london transport system , according to a report in the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper . both of the suitcases discovered on july 31 contained gas cylinders rigged up to an ignition mechanism and had been left in two regional trains which usually run at the height of the commuter rush hour .
the suitcases were discovered by rail staff when the trains terminated at the two hub stations .
the construction of the devices and the potential impact the explosions would have had suggests a sophisticated plot . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german security official with one of the canisters investigations by bka engineers revealed that the bombs were designed so that simultaneous detonation would have been possible and that they would generate " an explosive force so big that the explosion would have reached the dimension of the subway attack on london in the summer of 2005 , " a high-ranking security source told the newspaper . in the london attacks , 52 people were killed and over 700 were injured when suicide bombers struck on three underground trains and a bus . debate rages on increased surveillance the investigation has fired an intense debate in germany regarding the expansion of video surveillance in railway stations and in trains .
some german states have already taken steps to increase their " big brother " security systems . the conservative-controlled hamburg state government wants to add more cameras to streets and public places , not just railway stations and trains . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opinions differ on what measures should be taken in brandenburg , interior minister jörg schönbohm of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- said that the state was considering limiting surveillance to people getting on and off trains in an attempt to dodge the controversial topic of data protection . however , federal data protection czar peter schaar has pleaded for more to be done , with extra staff and cameras placed at all railway stations and on trains to increase security . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de homemade bombs found on german railway german federal prosecutors are investigating a possible terrorist link to two unexploded bombs discovered in dortmund and koblenz .

the move is related to a wider probe into the doping of athletes , including star german cyclist jan ullrich . the raids by german police were carried out on thursday and were prompted by findings in connection with the investigation into a spanish doctor suspected of suppling performance-enhancing drugs to top athletes including german cyclist jan ullrich . prosecutors and police in the german town of göttingen said the premises belonging to a man identified only as dr. markus c. in the states of lower saxony and thuringia were searched . german doc allegedly supplied spanish counterpart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doping allegations continue to dogs sports hans hugo heimgärtner , spokesman for the prosecutor ’ s office said that a significant amount of evidence was seized and is currently being analyzed .
the operation , he said , was initiated because of recent findings by spanish authorities who are investigating a sports doping ring allegedly run by spanish doctor eufemiano fuentes . " the german doctor is suspected of violating german laws by making drugs available for illegal purposes such as performance-enhancing in sports , " heimgärtner said .
" there are indications that he provided these drugs to a doctor in spain who stands accused of selling them to the athletes . " dr markus c is said to have delivered large quantities of synacten - a drug that raises pain endurance levels in humans .
the trail to germany , authorities say , came to light after spanish officials in may raided offices belonging to dr fuentes . there they found among other things anabolic steroids , equipment used for blood transfusions and more than 100 bags of frozen blood .
in an official probe that ensued , more than 50 professional cyclists were implicated in the doping scandal including tour de france favourites jan ullrich and ivan basso .
they both withdrew on the eve of the race in july . calls for ullrich to come clean german sports federation president thomas bach now welcomes the crackdown on such doping practices as an essential move towards drug-free sports . " these investigations are crucial in our campaign for clean sports , " bach said .
" quite obviously there are entire doping networks operating in the background of athletes and we must do everything to destroy these rings . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan ullrich still protests his innocence meanwhile german anti-doping campaigners have called on jan ullrich to come forward and testify on his drug-taking past .

" i can only recommend to jan ullrich and all the other cyclists accused of doping to make a clean slate now , " franke said .
" the cycling union , i ’ m sure will certainly respect that in their ruling . " so far however , jan ullrich has continued to protest his innocence and denies the doping allegations . but the noose around his neck is getting tighter .

it is a hesitation that is fundamentally positive and beneficial as nothing offers better protection from all sorts of the disastrous , overboard patriotism of the past . additionally , germany is interwoven in a thick mesh of international connections that make the country an equal partner in the political landscape .
but this role brings responsibilities with it that the country with europe 's largest population after russia can not avoid . this also applies to the possible and foreseeable deployment of bundeswehr soldiers in lebanon as part of the united nations ' peacekeeping force .
its mission would be to prevent hostilities in southern lebanon by making use of the relevant un resolution .
the positioning of troops and the direct involvement of israel in the conflict mean this would be new territory for germany , since its relationship with israel requires a special course of action due to the effects of history . it is simply intolerable to imagine that a situation could arise in which a german solider could shoot an israeli solider .
the deployment of only the navy to israeli and lebanese waters and a lightly armed police force on the lebanese-syrian border could provide a certain degree of assurance that it does not come to such a confrontation .
legitimate concerns of course , there are also legitimate objections in germany to a german deployment to lebanon .
pragmatic objectionss that point out the bundeswehr 's stretched capabilities , and , more fundamentally , that the middle east has been declared a downright taboo area for german soldiers . a deployment to lebanon does indeed lie within the bundeswehr 's capabilities .
at least that is what people who know are saying while pointing out that there were times when more than 7,700 bundeswehr soldiers were deployed in foreign countries at once .
and calling the middle east a taboo area is also out of the question .
the agreement of the israeli and lebanese governments on a un resolution as well as the expressed wish of ehud olmert that germany participate in a peacekeeping force make a case against the taboo argument .
furthermore , the middle east is one of europe 's neighboring regions .
that germany has interests in peaceful conditions there is at least as important as in other regions of the world where the bundeswehr is already stationed . it is true that the deployment of a peacekeeping force is not a replacement for a political concept that would clarify the role of the radical islamic hezbollah in southern lebanon and secure israel 's right to existence .
that contribution is germany 's larger foreign policy challenge . heinz dylong is one of deutsche welle 's chief political editors . -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un peacekeeper search continues as eu hesitates as the lebanese army drove into the country 's southern region for the first time in 38 years , the eu stalled in giving firm troop pledges for the un peacekeeping force to be deployed to the region .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : violence in the middle east steinmeier cancels talks with syrian president propaganda wars fight for headlines in the middle east " germany should take part in lebanon peace-keeping mission " eu takes charge in cleaning oil spill on lebanese coast germany -pipe- 19.08.2006 opinion : german troops in lebanon - an unavoidable decision großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are no good reasons why germany should not be involved in the un 's peacekeeping mission to the middle east , but it should not send ground troops to a buffer zone between the fronts , according to dw 's heinz dylong . even 10 or 15 years ago , sending the bundeswehr to foreign countries was a touchy topic , and the public only hesitantly got used to german soldiers being deployed away from home .
it is a hesitation that is fundamentally positive and beneficial as nothing offers better protection from all sorts of the disastrous , overboard patriotism of the past . additionally , germany is interwoven in a thick mesh of international connections that make the country an equal partner in the political landscape .
but this role brings responsibilities with it that the country with europe 's largest population after russia can not avoid . this also applies to the possible and foreseeable deployment of bundeswehr soldiers in lebanon as part of the united nations ' peacekeeping force .
its mission would be to prevent hostilities in southern lebanon by making use of the relevant un resolution .
the positioning of troops and the direct involvement of israel in the conflict mean this would be new territory for germany , since its relationship with israel requires a special course of action due to the effects of history . it is simply intolerable to imagine that a situation could arise in which a german solider could shoot an israeli solider .
the deployment of only the navy to israeli and lebanese waters and a lightly armed police force on the lebanese-syrian border could provide a certain degree of assurance that it does not come to such a confrontation .
legitimate concerns of course , there are also legitimate objections in germany to a german deployment to lebanon .
pragmatic objectionss that point out the bundeswehr 's stretched capabilities , and , more fundamentally , that the middle east has been declared a downright taboo area for german soldiers . a deployment to lebanon does indeed lie within the bundeswehr 's capabilities .
at least that is what people who know are saying while pointing out that there were times when more than 7,700 bundeswehr soldiers were deployed in foreign countries at once .
and calling the middle east a taboo area is also out of the question .
the agreement of the israeli and lebanese governments on a un resolution as well as the expressed wish of ehud olmert that germany participate in a peacekeeping force make a case against the taboo argument .
furthermore , the middle east is one of europe 's neighboring regions .
that germany has interests in peaceful conditions there is at least as important as in other regions of the world where the bundeswehr is already stationed . it is true that the deployment of a peacekeeping force is not a replacement for a political concept that would clarify the role of the radical islamic hezbollah in southern lebanon and secure israel 's right to existence .
that contribution is germany 's larger foreign policy challenge . heinz dylong is one of deutsche welle 's chief political editors . -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un peacekeeper search continues as eu hesitates as the lebanese army drove into the country 's southern region for the first time in 38 years , the eu stalled in giving firm troop pledges for the un peacekeeping force to be deployed to the region .

the move is related to a wider probe into the doping of athletes , including star german cyclist jan ullrich . the raids by german police were carried out on thursday and were prompted by findings in connection with the investigation into a spanish doctor suspected of suppling performance-enhancing drugs to top athletes including german cyclist jan ullrich . prosecutors and police in the german town of göttingen said the premises belonging to a man identified only as dr. markus c. in the states of lower saxony and thuringia were searched . german doc allegedly supplied spanish counterpart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doping allegations continue to dogs sports hans hugo heimgärtner , spokesman for the prosecutor ’ s office said that a significant amount of evidence was seized and is currently being analyzed .
the operation , he said , was initiated because of recent findings by spanish authorities who are investigating a sports doping ring allegedly run by spanish doctor eufemiano fuentes . " the german doctor is suspected of violating german laws by making drugs available for illegal purposes such as performance-enhancing in sports , " heimgärtner said .
" there are indications that he provided these drugs to a doctor in spain who stands accused of selling them to the athletes . " dr markus c is said to have delivered large quantities of synacten - a drug that raises pain endurance levels in humans .
the trail to germany , authorities say , came to light after spanish officials in may raided offices belonging to dr fuentes . there they found among other things anabolic steroids , equipment used for blood transfusions and more than 100 bags of frozen blood .
in an official probe that ensued , more than 50 professional cyclists were implicated in the doping scandal including tour de france favourites jan ullrich and ivan basso .
they both withdrew on the eve of the race in july . calls for ullrich to come clean german sports federation president thomas bach now welcomes the crackdown on such doping practices as an essential move towards drug-free sports . " these investigations are crucial in our campaign for clean sports , " bach said .
" quite obviously there are entire doping networks operating in the background of athletes and we must do everything to destroy these rings . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan ullrich still protests his innocence meanwhile german anti-doping campaigners have called on jan ullrich to come forward and testify on his drug-taking past .
germany ’ s leading expert on doping , werner franke said that with the international cycling union discussing disciplinary action against ullrich , the star cyclist should come clean . " i can only recommend to jan ullrich and all the other cyclists accused of doping to make a clean slate now , " franke said .
" the cycling union , i ’ m sure will certainly respect that in their ruling . " so far however , jan ullrich has continued to protest his innocence and denies the doping allegations . but the noose around his neck is getting tighter .
a fax found recently in documents confiscated from dr fuentes , for the first time shows the german cyclist ’ s full name on a list of athletes who had received drugs . uwe hessler -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new blow to cycling as tour winner landis tests positive tour de france winner floyd landis is set to become the first victor of the race to be stripped of his title after his b sample confirmed he had abnormal levels of testosterone on saturday .

the company faces a tough fight in the highly competitve sector - but it 's a fight telekom is prepared for . deutsche telekom is the latest telecommunications company to feel the pressure of intensifying competition in europe .
the german firm , europe 's largest communications group , recently announced a 4 percent fall in half-year profits .
shares in deutsche telekom - which owns t-mobile - nose dived by 11 percent after the announcement earlier in august . the firm says the profit shortfall is due to a poor performance in germany and has pledged to take aggressive action to win back customers .
but will this be enough to halt the company 's slide ? deutsche telekom anticipates its operating profit for the year could be more than a billion euros -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- lower than previously anticipated .
the company said in a statement last week that its bottom-line net profit declined by 14 percent to 1.01 billion euros in the period from april to june , despite a three-percent rise in revenues to 15.13 billion euros . in germany , deutsche telekom 's overall sales have fallen by 4 percent in the past six months .
first half sales of its german mobile arm dropped by 3 percent in the first half of the year and its fixed-line business lost a million customers over that period . cuts in earning and sales forecasts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ricke will reverse the trend of high sales forecasts because of these results , deutsche telekom has been forced to issue a profit warning .
and deutsche telekom 's chairman , kai-uwe ricke , said the company will cut its earnings and sales forecasts for this year and next year . " deutsche telekom is transforming in a telecommunication market , a worldwide telecommunication market , which is ever-changing , " ricke said .
" and this transformation is huge .
it 's a challenge .
it 's a marathon . " ricke said he and his team are ready to take on the challenge .
the company 's strategy is to take a much more aggressive approach to competition in its key domestic markets in the second half of this year . many customers have switched to cheaper phone and internet providers , and deutsche telekom wants to win them back .
ricke said costs and prices will be slashed in order to defend the company 's domestic market share . attack is the best form of defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom 's near-monopoly is under threat " deutsche telekom has to do its homework in the german marketplace , " ricke said .
" that means we must rigorously defend our market share .
it has to do with pricing , it has to do with products , it has to do with service , it has to do with things we have in our pipeline , and what we are going to roll out over the next few weeks . " that means offering simpler packages with lower prices .
for example , new bundled offers from t-mobile in germany will soon cost less than 10 euro cents per minute , regardless of which network people call . deutsche telekom has also started marketing a merged fixed-line and mobile service to try to stop people canceling their deutsche telekom traditional phone lines . the company also plans to invest differently to increase its cash flow .
and it will spend an extra 1.2 billion euros on marketing and products this year .
that 's in addition to a 3-billion-euro investment in a fiber-optic network to broadcast live tv programs , such as germany 's bundesliga soccer league matches , over the internet .
ricke is hopeful that all this will stave off competition from vodafone and other competitors . foreign stability remains key deutsche telekom 's international business units have been more successful than its domestic market and are solely responsible for the company 's sales growth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : t-mobile is proving popular in the uk t-mobile in the uk , for example , added more than 360 thousand subscribers over the second quarter .
and revenues generated outside of germany have risen by a total of 4 percent to 3.6 billion euros . but telecommunications analyst ovum said deutsche telekom has underestimated its competition for too long , that it ca n't hide behind its overseas growth now , and that there 's certainly no " quick fix " for its domestic problems . so is this program of price cuts and innovations coming too late ?
and will competitors such as vodafone follow suit ?

the company faces a tough fight in the highly competitve sector - but it 's a fight telekom is prepared for . deutsche telekom is the latest telecommunications company to feel the pressure of intensifying competition in europe .
the german firm , europe 's largest communications group , recently announced a 4 percent fall in half-year profits .
shares in deutsche telekom - which owns t-mobile - nose dived by 11 percent after the announcement earlier in august . the firm says the profit shortfall is due to a poor performance in germany and has pledged to take aggressive action to win back customers .
but will this be enough to halt the company 's slide ? deutsche telekom anticipates its operating profit for the year could be more than a billion euros -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- lower than previously anticipated .
the company said in a statement last week that its bottom-line net profit declined by 14 percent to 1.01 billion euros in the period from april to june , despite a three-percent rise in revenues to 15.13 billion euros . in germany , deutsche telekom 's overall sales have fallen by 4 percent in the past six months .
first half sales of its german mobile arm dropped by 3 percent in the first half of the year and its fixed-line business lost a million customers over that period . cuts in earning and sales forecasts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ricke will reverse the trend of high sales forecasts because of these results , deutsche telekom has been forced to issue a profit warning .
and deutsche telekom 's chairman , kai-uwe ricke , said the company will cut its earnings and sales forecasts for this year and next year . " deutsche telekom is transforming in a telecommunication market , a worldwide telecommunication market , which is ever-changing , " ricke said .
" and this transformation is huge .
it 's a challenge .
it 's a marathon . " ricke said he and his team are ready to take on the challenge .
the company 's strategy is to take a much more aggressive approach to competition in its key domestic markets in the second half of this year . many customers have switched to cheaper phone and internet providers , and deutsche telekom wants to win them back .
ricke said costs and prices will be slashed in order to defend the company 's domestic market share . attack is the best form of defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom 's near-monopoly is under threat " deutsche telekom has to do its homework in the german marketplace , " ricke said .
" that means we must rigorously defend our market share .

on saturday , the shaky truce suffered a blow when helicopter-borne israeli commandos raided a hezbollah bastion , allegedly aimed to disrupt weapons supplies to hezbollah from syria and iran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boxes of humanitarian aid arrive in lebanon french navy commandos were the first to disembark from the force-projection and command ship mistral anchored off naqura , which is about three kilometers -lrb- two miles -rrb- from the israeli border . france 's reinforcements arrived under a united nations resolution that ended a 34-day war between israel and the shiite hezbollah militia which killed 1,150 people , mostly civilians , in lebanon .
hezbollah killed 160 israelis , mostly soldiers . " important that europe steps forward " france 's contribution however has fallen far short of the major commanding role that many had foreseen for the former colonial power in lebanon . the united nations has been urging european countries to provide troops to the peacekeeping force , as the beirut government moved ahead with the deployment of the lebanese army in the south of the country . on saturday french president jacques chirac held talks with several eu leaders stressing the need to swiftly agree the make-up and mandate of a peacekeeping force in lebanon , his office said . the french leader spoke by phone to italy 's prime minister romano prodi , turkish prime minister recep erdogan and finish prime minister matti vanhanen , whose country holds the eu presidency , it said .
all three countries have agreed in principle to send soldiers but want more details on the precise mandate of the force charged with policing a ceasefire between israel and hezbollah .
chirac highlighted " the need to very quickly specify the missions , the rules of engagement and the chain of command " of the un interim force in lebanon -lrb- unifil -rrb- , it said . he also insisted on the need for balance in the distribution of contingents " which must reflect the commitment of all the international community and , in particular european countries " , it added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac has urged european countries to act swiftly earlier , un deputy secretary general mark malloch brown too pleaded with european nations to pitch in . " the particular appeal i want to make today is that europe comes forward with troops for this first wave , " malloch brown told journalists .
" it 's very important that europe now steps forward . " un security council resolution 1701 , which governs the ceasefire , calls for israeli troops to withdraw from south lebanon in tandem with deployment of lebanese troops and a beefed-up un peacekeeping force in the area . italy , finland considering troops the un also issued a detailed list friday of its troop requirements for the vanguard force of 3,500 , including eight mechanized infantry battalions , three light reconnaissance battalions , three engineering battalions and five observation helicopters . a logistical battalion , a military hospital along with communications units and military policy will also be needed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reconstructing beirut is likely to take time italy 's government and both houses of parliament approved a motion friday to contribute troops to the un interim force which , under un security council resolution 1701 , is to be expanded from its existing 1,990 members to 15,000 . also on friday , the finnish government said it might send 250 troops , but that no firm decision would be taken until the end of the month .
denmark said it was ready to send three warships into the region . though the german government has ruled out sending any ground troops , chancellor angela merkel said germany could send a " maritime protection component " and provide logistics , air transport and reconnaissance , depending on the rules of engagement . un mandate too vague one of the main reasons for the reluctance of european nations to contribute troops remains the vagueness of the un peacekeeping force 's mandate . in germany , where the idea of sending german soldiers for a deployment which might involve turning their guns on israelis remains highly sensitive , politicians say the un mandate remains too ambiguous . " what we 're missing is a plan of operation , " said gert weisskirchen , foreign policy expert of the social democratic party .
" the rules of engagement are not clear and the un has to finally decide on that . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier with chancellor merkel even german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has called for clarification . " we do n't know whether the german navy for instance will have the right to enter aboard suspicious vessels , " steinmeier said .
" i hope that we manage to make decisive progress over the weekend . " german defence minister franz josef jung called on the united nations to give the troops deployed in lebanon an " unequivocal mandate " for the use of force . in an interview to be published on monday , jung said the german navy would have to be able to use armed force to prevent the transport of arms to hezbollah . such use of force would require a un mandate , and that the matter would have to be cleared up before germany could commit its troops , jung told the german magazine focus . " we are not about to send ships to the lebanese coast just to observe , " he said . " our soldiers must have a mandate to prevent the smuggling of weapons and guarantee a lasting ceasefire .

it is a hesitation that is fundamentally positive and beneficial as nothing offers better protection from all sorts of the disastrous , overboard patriotism of the past . additionally , germany is interwoven in a thick mesh of international connections that make the country an equal partner in the political landscape .
but this role brings responsibilities with it that the country with europe 's largest population after russia can not avoid . this also applies to the possible and foreseeable deployment of bundeswehr soldiers in lebanon as part of the united nations ' peacekeeping force .
its mission would be to prevent hostilities in southern lebanon by making use of the relevant un resolution .
the positioning of troops and the direct involvement of israel in the conflict mean this would be new territory for germany , since its relationship with israel requires a special course of action due to the effects of history . it is simply intolerable to imagine that a situation could arise in which a german solider could shoot an israeli solider .
the deployment of only the navy to israeli and lebanese waters and a lightly armed police force on the lebanese-syrian border could provide a certain degree of assurance that it does not come to such a confrontation .
legitimate concerns of course , there are also legitimate objections in germany to a german deployment to lebanon .
pragmatic objectionss that point out the bundeswehr 's stretched capabilities , and , more fundamentally , that the middle east has been declared a downright taboo area for german soldiers . a deployment to lebanon does indeed lie within the bundeswehr 's capabilities .
at least that is what people who know are saying while pointing out that there were times when more than 7,700 bundeswehr soldiers were deployed in foreign countries at once .
and calling the middle east a taboo area is also out of the question .

furthermore , the middle east is one of europe 's neighboring regions .

the authorities also found explosives at the station , according to german public broadcaster ard . " the person appears to be one of the two suspects that have been sought since yesterday with the help of video footage that was made public , " the federal prosecutor 's office said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german police are searching for these two men german police are hunting for two men suspected of planting two homemade bombs packed into suitcases on july 31 in trains in the western cities of dortmund and koblenz .
the bombs however failed to detonate . investigators first thought that the devices were a blackmail attempt , but analysis of the contents revealed a possible link to lebanon . " we are now working on the basis that this was the work of a terrorist group based in germany and that it was an attempt to kill a large number of people , " rainer griesbaum , a federal prosecutor , told a press conference friday . rail traffic was suspended in kiel on saturday morning as " a measure in the current investigation by the federal police , " a spokesman for the regional police said .
he gave no further details . bombs would have created " a fireball " the head of the federal crime office , joerg ziercke , said the bombs were packed into identical black cases and consisted of gas canisters , alarm clocks , wires and batteries and soft drink bottles filled with a flammable liquid . " the cases had been supposed to explode 10 minutes before the trains arrived at the stations , " ziercke said . " it 's more likely than unlikely that there was a terrorist background , " he said . if the around 25-kilo -lrb- 55-lb . -rrb- suitcase bombs had exploded they would have lead to " a fireball " in the train carriages and an " indeterminate number of injured and possible deaths , " ziercke said . he added that a 100-strong team of investigators was still trying to establish why the devices failed to explode . a note in the case found in koblenz contained arabic writing and a telephone number in lebanon , and packets of starch with labels in arabic and english were also found . 50,000 euro reward the cases containing the bombs were unaccompanied when they were discovered , but closed circuit television cameras recorded pictures of two dark-haired young men , one wearing a germany football shirt , carrying rucksacks and wheeling the suitcases on to platforms at the cologne railway station . the two men seen on the grainy images have been described as being from " southern countries . " investigators are offering a reward of 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 64,000 -rrb- for any information leading to the arrest of the men . speaking in berlin friday , german interior minister wolfgang schäuble also warned that germany should brace itself for similar attempts .
" unfortunately , we must assume that the danger of a repeat of these attempted attacks . "
the discovery of the two bombed sparked a series of scares at railway stations across germany with parts of the central station in düsseldorf sealed off friday after a suspicious suitcase was found .
officials in düsseldorf later gave the all-clear , saying it had been a false alarm . terror plot " highly likely " the bka suggested that germany was being targeted for attacks possibly by a terrorist organization operating in the country .
if the explosive devices had been detonated , their size and construction would have created devastation and death on a scale reminiscent of the july 7 , 2005 attacks on the london transport system , according to a report in the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper . both of the suitcases discovered on july 31 contained gas cylinders rigged up to an ignition mechanism and had been left in two regional trains which usually run at the height of the commuter rush hour .
the suitcases were discovered by rail staff when the trains terminated at the two hub stations .
the construction of the devices and the potential impact the explosions would have had suggests a sophisticated plot . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german security official with one of the canisters investigations by bka engineers revealed that the bombs were designed so that simultaneous detonation would have been possible and that they would generate " an explosive force so big that the explosion would have reached the dimension of the subway attack on london in the summer of 2005 , " a high-ranking security source told the newspaper . in the london attacks , 52 people were killed and over 700 were injured when suicide bombers struck on three underground trains and a bus . debate rages on increased surveillance the investigation has fired an intense debate in germany regarding the expansion of video surveillance in railway stations and in trains .
some german states have already taken steps to increase their " big brother " security systems . the conservative-controlled hamburg state government wants to add more cameras to streets and public places , not just railway stations and trains . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opinions differ on what measures should be taken in brandenburg , interior minister jörg schönbohm of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- said that the state was considering limiting surveillance to people getting on and off trains in an attempt to dodge the controversial topic of data protection . however , federal data protection czar peter schaar has pleaded for more to be done , with extra staff and cameras placed at all railway stations and on trains to increase security . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de homemade bombs found on german railway german federal prosecutors are investigating a possible terrorist link to two unexploded bombs discovered in dortmund and koblenz .

" we are now working on the basis that this was the work of a terrorist group based in germany and that it was an attempt to kill a large number of people , " rainer griesbaum , a federal prosecutor , told a press conference friday . rail traffic was suspended in kiel on saturday morning as " a measure in the current investigation by the federal police , " a spokesman for the regional police said .
he gave no further details . bombs would have created " a fireball " the head of the federal crime office , joerg ziercke , said the bombs were packed into identical black cases and consisted of gas canisters , alarm clocks , wires and batteries and soft drink bottles filled with a flammable liquid . " the cases had been supposed to explode 10 minutes before the trains arrived at the stations , " ziercke said . " it 's more likely than unlikely that there was a terrorist background , " he said . if the around 25-kilo -lrb- 55-lb . -rrb- suitcase bombs had exploded they would have lead to " a fireball " in the train carriages and an " indeterminate number of injured and possible deaths , " ziercke said . he added that a 100-strong team of investigators was still trying to establish why the devices failed to explode . a note in the case found in koblenz contained arabic writing and a telephone number in lebanon , and packets of starch with labels in arabic and english were also found . 50,000 euro reward the cases containing the bombs were unaccompanied when they were discovered , but closed circuit television cameras recorded pictures of two dark-haired young men , one wearing a germany football shirt , carrying rucksacks and wheeling the suitcases on to platforms at the cologne railway station . the two men seen on the grainy images have been described as being from " southern countries . " investigators are offering a reward of 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 64,000 -rrb- for any information leading to the arrest of the men . speaking in berlin friday , german interior minister wolfgang schäuble also warned that germany should brace itself for similar attempts .
" unfortunately , we must assume that the danger of a repeat of these attempted attacks . "
the discovery of the two bombed sparked a series of scares at railway stations across germany with parts of the central station in düsseldorf sealed off friday after a suspicious suitcase was found .
officials in düsseldorf later gave the all-clear , saying it had been a false alarm . terror plot " highly likely " the bka suggested that germany was being targeted for attacks possibly by a terrorist organization operating in the country .
if the explosive devices had been detonated , their size and construction would have created devastation and death on a scale reminiscent of the july 7 , 2005 attacks on the london transport system , according to a report in the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper . both of the suitcases discovered on july 31 contained gas cylinders rigged up to an ignition mechanism and had been left in two regional trains which usually run at the height of the commuter rush hour .
the suitcases were discovered by rail staff when the trains terminated at the two hub stations .
the construction of the devices and the potential impact the explosions would have had suggests a sophisticated plot . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german security official with one of the canisters investigations by bka engineers revealed that the bombs were designed so that simultaneous detonation would have been possible and that they would generate " an explosive force so big that the explosion would have reached the dimension of the subway attack on london in the summer of 2005 , " a high-ranking security source told the newspaper . in the london attacks , 52 people were killed and over 700 were injured when suicide bombers struck on three underground trains and a bus . debate rages on increased surveillance the investigation has fired an intense debate in germany regarding the expansion of video surveillance in railway stations and in trains .
some german states have already taken steps to increase their " big brother " security systems . the conservative-controlled hamburg state government wants to add more cameras to streets and public places , not just railway stations and trains . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opinions differ on what measures should be taken in brandenburg , interior minister jörg schönbohm of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- said that the state was considering limiting surveillance to people getting on and off trains in an attempt to dodge the controversial topic of data protection . however , federal data protection czar peter schaar has pleaded for more to be done , with extra staff and cameras placed at all railway stations and on trains to increase security . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de homemade bombs found on german railway german federal prosecutors are investigating a possible terrorist link to two unexploded bombs discovered in dortmund and koblenz .

the work is now awaiting auction at christie 's . two elegant women , brightly dressed , walk along a crowded street .
ernst ludwig kirchner used this scene to capture the german capital in his painting " berlin street scene " from 1913 . this painting is now the object of a fierce restitution dispute involving the berlin state senate , a berlin museum , the ernst-ludwig-kirchner archive and the heirs of the painting 's original jewish owner . it is currently scheduled to go under the hammer at christie 's auction house in new york , where it could bring in between 14 and 19.5 million euros -lrb- $ 18 to 25 million -rrb- .
such a selling price would make it the artist 's most expensive work . kirchner and painting owner rejected by nazis kirchner , a master of german impressionism , created the work in the same year his artist group die brücke broke up .
many big-name impressionists - like emil nolde , edvard munch and henri matisse - were part of the group , whose name " the bridge " symbolized the links its members sought to establish between artistic styles . kirchner and the other members of die brücke were denounced by the nazis after hitler came to power in 1933 because their work conflicted with the party 's rejection of modernity , particularly in art . now a flurry of controversy has arisen over whether the purchase of the painting from the jewish family of the deceased original owner alfred hess in the early years of the third reich by a german art collector may have been forced because of anti-semitism and the price set artificially low .
if so , the work could qualify for restitution . painting returned to hess heir bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirchner 's " group of artists " depicts members of the " die brücke " group in late july , berlin 's senate , which had been in possession of kirchner 's 1913 painting , unexpectedly returned it to hess ' heir in england .
though the move came as a surprise , secret negotiations had been underway for almost two years already . barbara kisseler , berlin 's state secretary of culture told the daily newspaper frankfurt allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- that the masterpiece was returned because it had come to their attention that the hess family had been unfairly treated during the nazi dictatorship . " moral considerations " played a significant role in the decision , she said . shortly after the restitution of the piece was made public , the new york auction house christie 's announced it had purchased the kirchner work and planned to auction it on november 8 . critics claim restitution not legitimate in a joint statement , the ernst ludwig kirchner archive near bern , the brücke museum and the berlin auction house villa grisebach have publicly protested the return of the kirchner painting , claiming it had been legally purchased . they wrote that the berlin senate had been " dilettantish " in dealing with " german museum property . " alfred hess was an avid art collector and successful shoe factory owner , but plunged into insolvency during the global economic crisis in the late 1920 's .
when he died in 1931 his family brought the kirchner work to switzerland . in 1936 or 1937 - the exact date is unknown - the painting was sold to collector carl hagemann in cologne , allegedly for a sum of 3,000 reich marks , and brought to what was then nazi germany . until recently , the legitimacy of the sale had not been questioned . details of sale remain unclear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : debate rages on who should get the " berlin street scene " in the end the berlin senate now contends that carl hagemann 's purchase price was either so low that it took advantage of the anti-semitic policies of the nazi regime , or that the money never made it into their hands at all . " as in many similar cases , the family fortune mainly consisted of works of art , which were sold in order to make a living , " wolfgang henze , art historian and administrator of the ernst ludwig kirchner archive , wrote the berlin senate , as reported by faz .
" fortunately , the hess family managed in time to get their collection abroad . " the open letter from the kirchner archive , the brücke museum and the berlin auction house also pointed out that the hess family sold paintings on a regular basis over an extended period of time , which could indicate they were not coerced into selling the " berlin street scene . " christie 's had a part in the restitution while it has not yet been firmly established if the transaction between carl hagemann and the hess family in the mid-1930s was fair , christie 's speedy acquisition of the painting has raised eyebrows . ludwig von pufendorf , chairmen of the brücke museum board and berlin 's former state culture secretary , told german radio broadcaster deutschlandradio kultur that christie 's financed the entire restitution process . christoph stölzl , another former state culture secretary in berlin and the general director of the german historical museum for over 10 years , told the online news site netzeitung.de : " the kirchner case sets a dangerous precedent for germany 's cultural heritage in the classical modern field . " he added that " the ernst ludwig kirchner archive estimates that the return of 80 to 100 paintings could be demanded " if the restitution of the kirchner piece is not repealed . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a tale of two cities - tokyo and berlin an art exhibition showcases more than a century of german-japanese artistic exchange opened last week at berlin 's national gallery .

the work is now awaiting auction at christie 's . two elegant women , brightly dressed , walk along a crowded street .
ernst ludwig kirchner used this scene to capture the german capital in his painting " berlin street scene " from 1913 . this painting is now the object of a fierce restitution dispute involving the berlin state senate , a berlin museum , the ernst-ludwig-kirchner archive and the heirs of the painting 's original jewish owner . it is currently scheduled to go under the hammer at christie 's auction house in new york , where it could bring in between 14 and 19.5 million euros -lrb- $ 18 to 25 million -rrb- .
such a selling price would make it the artist 's most expensive work . kirchner and painting owner rejected by nazis kirchner , a master of german impressionism , created the work in the same year his artist group die brücke broke up .
many big-name impressionists - like emil nolde , edvard munch and henri matisse - were part of the group , whose name " the bridge " symbolized the links its members sought to establish between artistic styles . kirchner and the other members of die brücke were denounced by the nazis after hitler came to power in 1933 because their work conflicted with the party 's rejection of modernity , particularly in art . now a flurry of controversy has arisen over whether the purchase of the painting from the jewish family of the deceased original owner alfred hess in the early years of the third reich by a german art collector may have been forced because of anti-semitism and the price set artificially low .
if so , the work could qualify for restitution . painting returned to hess heir bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirchner 's " group of artists " depicts members of the " die brücke " group in late july , berlin 's senate , which had been in possession of kirchner 's 1913 painting , unexpectedly returned it to hess ' heir in england .
though the move came as a surprise , secret negotiations had been underway for almost two years already . barbara kisseler , berlin 's state secretary of culture told the daily newspaper frankfurt allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- that the masterpiece was returned because it had come to their attention that the hess family had been unfairly treated during the nazi dictatorship . " moral considerations " played a significant role in the decision , she said . shortly after the restitution of the piece was made public , the new york auction house christie 's announced it had purchased the kirchner work and planned to auction it on november 8 . critics claim restitution not legitimate in a joint statement , the ernst ludwig kirchner archive near bern , the brücke museum and the berlin auction house villa grisebach have publicly protested the return of the kirchner painting , claiming it had been legally purchased . they wrote that the berlin senate had been " dilettantish " in dealing with " german museum property . " alfred hess was an avid art collector and successful shoe factory owner , but plunged into insolvency during the global economic crisis in the late 1920 's .
when he died in 1931 his family brought the kirchner work to switzerland . in 1936 or 1937 - the exact date is unknown - the painting was sold to collector carl hagemann in cologne , allegedly for a sum of 3,000 reich marks , and brought to what was then nazi germany . until recently , the legitimacy of the sale had not been questioned . details of sale remain unclear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : debate rages on who should get the " berlin street scene " in the end the berlin senate now contends that carl hagemann 's purchase price was either so low that it took advantage of the anti-semitic policies of the nazi regime , or that the money never made it into their hands at all . " as in many similar cases , the family fortune mainly consisted of works of art , which were sold in order to make a living , " wolfgang henze , art historian and administrator of the ernst ludwig kirchner archive , wrote the berlin senate , as reported by faz .
" fortunately , the hess family managed in time to get their collection abroad . " the open letter from the kirchner archive , the brücke museum and the berlin auction house also pointed out that the hess family sold paintings on a regular basis over an extended period of time , which could indicate they were not coerced into selling the " berlin street scene . " christie 's had a part in the restitution while it has not yet been firmly established if the transaction between carl hagemann and the hess family in the mid-1930s was fair , christie 's speedy acquisition of the painting has raised eyebrows . ludwig von pufendorf , chairmen of the brücke museum board and berlin 's former state culture secretary , told german radio broadcaster deutschlandradio kultur that christie 's financed the entire restitution process . christoph stölzl , another former state culture secretary in berlin and the general director of the german historical museum for over 10 years , told the online news site netzeitung.de : " the kirchner case sets a dangerous precedent for germany 's cultural heritage in the classical modern field . " he added that " the ernst ludwig kirchner archive estimates that the return of 80 to 100 paintings could be demanded " if the restitution of the kirchner piece is not repealed . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a tale of two cities - tokyo and berlin an art exhibition showcases more than a century of german-japanese artistic exchange opened last week at berlin 's national gallery .

the move is related to a wider probe into the doping of athletes , including star german cyclist jan ullrich . the raids by german police were carried out on thursday and were prompted by findings in connection with the investigation into a spanish doctor suspected of suppling performance-enhancing drugs to top athletes including german cyclist jan ullrich . prosecutors and police in the german town of göttingen said the premises belonging to a man identified only as dr. markus c. in the states of lower saxony and thuringia were searched . german doc allegedly supplied spanish counterpart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doping allegations continue to dogs sports hans hugo heimgärtner , spokesman for the prosecutor ’ s office said that a significant amount of evidence was seized and is currently being analyzed .
the operation , he said , was initiated because of recent findings by spanish authorities who are investigating a sports doping ring allegedly run by spanish doctor eufemiano fuentes . " the german doctor is suspected of violating german laws by making drugs available for illegal purposes such as performance-enhancing in sports , " heimgärtner said .
" there are indications that he provided these drugs to a doctor in spain who stands accused of selling them to the athletes . " dr markus c is said to have delivered large quantities of synacten - a drug that raises pain endurance levels in humans .
the trail to germany , authorities say , came to light after spanish officials in may raided offices belonging to dr fuentes . there they found among other things anabolic steroids , equipment used for blood transfusions and more than 100 bags of frozen blood .

on saturday , the shaky truce suffered a blow when helicopter-borne israeli commandos raided a hezbollah bastion , allegedly aimed to disrupt weapons supplies to hezbollah from syria and iran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boxes of humanitarian aid arrive in lebanon french navy commandos were the first to disembark from the force-projection and command ship mistral anchored off naqura , which is about three kilometers -lrb- two miles -rrb- from the israeli border . france 's reinforcements arrived under a united nations resolution that ended a 34-day war between israel and the shiite hezbollah militia which killed 1,150 people , mostly civilians , in lebanon .
hezbollah killed 160 israelis , mostly soldiers . " important that europe steps forward " france 's contribution however has fallen far short of the major commanding role that many had foreseen for the former colonial power in lebanon . the united nations has been urging european countries to provide troops to the peacekeeping force , as the beirut government moved ahead with the deployment of the lebanese army in the south of the country . on saturday french president jacques chirac held talks with several eu leaders stressing the need to swiftly agree the make-up and mandate of a peacekeeping force in lebanon , his office said . the french leader spoke by phone to italy 's prime minister romano prodi , turkish prime minister recep erdogan and finish prime minister matti vanhanen , whose country holds the eu presidency , it said .
all three countries have agreed in principle to send soldiers but want more details on the precise mandate of the force charged with policing a ceasefire between israel and hezbollah .
chirac highlighted " the need to very quickly specify the missions , the rules of engagement and the chain of command " of the un interim force in lebanon -lrb- unifil -rrb- , it said . he also insisted on the need for balance in the distribution of contingents " which must reflect the commitment of all the international community and , in particular european countries " , it added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac has urged european countries to act swiftly earlier , un deputy secretary general mark malloch brown too pleaded with european nations to pitch in . " the particular appeal i want to make today is that europe comes forward with troops for this first wave , " malloch brown told journalists .
" it 's very important that europe now steps forward . " un security council resolution 1701 , which governs the ceasefire , calls for israeli troops to withdraw from south lebanon in tandem with deployment of lebanese troops and a beefed-up un peacekeeping force in the area . italy , finland considering troops the un also issued a detailed list friday of its troop requirements for the vanguard force of 3,500 , including eight mechanized infantry battalions , three light reconnaissance battalions , three engineering battalions and five observation helicopters . a logistical battalion , a military hospital along with communications units and military policy will also be needed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reconstructing beirut is likely to take time italy 's government and both houses of parliament approved a motion friday to contribute troops to the un interim force which , under un security council resolution 1701 , is to be expanded from its existing 1,990 members to 15,000 . also on friday , the finnish government said it might send 250 troops , but that no firm decision would be taken until the end of the month .
denmark said it was ready to send three warships into the region . though the german government has ruled out sending any ground troops , chancellor angela merkel said germany could send a " maritime protection component " and provide logistics , air transport and reconnaissance , depending on the rules of engagement . un mandate too vague one of the main reasons for the reluctance of european nations to contribute troops remains the vagueness of the un peacekeeping force 's mandate . in germany , where the idea of sending german soldiers for a deployment which might involve turning their guns on israelis remains highly sensitive , politicians say the un mandate remains too ambiguous . " what we 're missing is a plan of operation , " said gert weisskirchen , foreign policy expert of the social democratic party .

" i hope that we manage to make decisive progress over the weekend . " german defence minister franz josef jung called on the united nations to give the troops deployed in lebanon an " unequivocal mandate " for the use of force . in an interview to be published on monday , jung said the german navy would have to be able to use armed force to prevent the transport of arms to hezbollah . such use of force would require a un mandate , and that the matter would have to be cleared up before germany could commit its troops , jung told the german magazine focus .

on saturday , the shaky truce suffered a blow when helicopter-borne israeli commandos raided a hezbollah bastion , allegedly aimed to disrupt weapons supplies to hezbollah from syria and iran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boxes of humanitarian aid arrive in lebanon french navy commandos were the first to disembark from the force-projection and command ship mistral anchored off naqura , which is about three kilometers -lrb- two miles -rrb- from the israeli border . france 's reinforcements arrived under a united nations resolution that ended a 34-day war between israel and the shiite hezbollah militia which killed 1,150 people , mostly civilians , in lebanon .
hezbollah killed 160 israelis , mostly soldiers . " important that europe steps forward " france 's contribution however has fallen far short of the major commanding role that many had foreseen for the former colonial power in lebanon . the united nations has been urging european countries to provide troops to the peacekeeping force , as the beirut government moved ahead with the deployment of the lebanese army in the south of the country . on saturday french president jacques chirac held talks with several eu leaders stressing the need to swiftly agree the make-up and mandate of a peacekeeping force in lebanon , his office said . the french leader spoke by phone to italy 's prime minister romano prodi , turkish prime minister recep erdogan and finish prime minister matti vanhanen , whose country holds the eu presidency , it said .
all three countries have agreed in principle to send soldiers but want more details on the precise mandate of the force charged with policing a ceasefire between israel and hezbollah .
chirac highlighted " the need to very quickly specify the missions , the rules of engagement and the chain of command " of the un interim force in lebanon -lrb- unifil -rrb- , it said . he also insisted on the need for balance in the distribution of contingents " which must reflect the commitment of all the international community and , in particular european countries " , it added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac has urged european countries to act swiftly earlier , un deputy secretary general mark malloch brown too pleaded with european nations to pitch in .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 19.08.2006 telekom streamlines as germany 's giant feels the pinch großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche telekom is facing new and serious challenges deutsche telekom has been rocked by recent financial results and the loss of a million fixed-line customers .
the company faces a tough fight in the highly competitve sector - but it 's a fight telekom is prepared for . deutsche telekom is the latest telecommunications company to feel the pressure of intensifying competition in europe .
the german firm , europe 's largest communications group , recently announced a 4 percent fall in half-year profits .
shares in deutsche telekom - which owns t-mobile - nose dived by 11 percent after the announcement earlier in august . the firm says the profit shortfall is due to a poor performance in germany and has pledged to take aggressive action to win back customers .
but will this be enough to halt the company 's slide ? deutsche telekom anticipates its operating profit for the year could be more than a billion euros -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- lower than previously anticipated .
the company said in a statement last week that its bottom-line net profit declined by 14 percent to 1.01 billion euros in the period from april to june , despite a three-percent rise in revenues to 15.13 billion euros . in germany , deutsche telekom 's overall sales have fallen by 4 percent in the past six months .
first half sales of its german mobile arm dropped by 3 percent in the first half of the year and its fixed-line business lost a million customers over that period . cuts in earning and sales forecasts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ricke will reverse the trend of high sales forecasts because of these results , deutsche telekom has been forced to issue a profit warning .
and deutsche telekom 's chairman , kai-uwe ricke , said the company will cut its earnings and sales forecasts for this year and next year . " deutsche telekom is transforming in a telecommunication market , a worldwide telecommunication market , which is ever-changing , " ricke said .
" and this transformation is huge .
it 's a challenge .
it 's a marathon . " ricke said he and his team are ready to take on the challenge .
the company 's strategy is to take a much more aggressive approach to competition in its key domestic markets in the second half of this year . many customers have switched to cheaper phone and internet providers , and deutsche telekom wants to win them back .
ricke said costs and prices will be slashed in order to defend the company 's domestic market share . attack is the best form of defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom 's near-monopoly is under threat " deutsche telekom has to do its homework in the german marketplace , " ricke said .
" that means we must rigorously defend our market share .
it has to do with pricing , it has to do with products , it has to do with service , it has to do with things we have in our pipeline , and what we are going to roll out over the next few weeks . " that means offering simpler packages with lower prices .
for example , new bundled offers from t-mobile in germany will soon cost less than 10 euro cents per minute , regardless of which network people call . deutsche telekom has also started marketing a merged fixed-line and mobile service to try to stop people canceling their deutsche telekom traditional phone lines . the company also plans to invest differently to increase its cash flow .
and it will spend an extra 1.2 billion euros on marketing and products this year .
that 's in addition to a 3-billion-euro investment in a fiber-optic network to broadcast live tv programs , such as germany 's bundesliga soccer league matches , over the internet .
ricke is hopeful that all this will stave off competition from vodafone and other competitors . foreign stability remains key deutsche telekom 's international business units have been more successful than its domestic market and are solely responsible for the company 's sales growth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : t-mobile is proving popular in the uk t-mobile in the uk , for example , added more than 360 thousand subscribers over the second quarter .
and revenues generated outside of germany have risen by a total of 4 percent to 3.6 billion euros . but telecommunications analyst ovum said deutsche telekom has underestimated its competition for too long , that it ca n't hide behind its overseas growth now , and that there 's certainly no " quick fix " for its domestic problems . so is this program of price cuts and innovations coming too late ?
and will competitors such as vodafone follow suit ?
it may well signify the beginning of a telecommunications price war in germany - which for customers at least , would be great news . laura stevens -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche telekom changes strategy after customer exodus deutsche telekom , europe 's biggest telecommunications group , has dramatically lost net income and customers to competitors in germany .

the authorities also found explosives at the station , according to german public broadcaster ard . " the person appears to be one of the two suspects that have been sought since yesterday with the help of video footage that was made public , " the federal prosecutor 's office said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german police are searching for these two men german police are hunting for two men suspected of planting two homemade bombs packed into suitcases on july 31 in trains in the western cities of dortmund and koblenz .
the bombs however failed to detonate . investigators first thought that the devices were a blackmail attempt , but analysis of the contents revealed a possible link to lebanon . " we are now working on the basis that this was the work of a terrorist group based in germany and that it was an attempt to kill a large number of people , " rainer griesbaum , a federal prosecutor , told a press conference friday . rail traffic was suspended in kiel on saturday morning as " a measure in the current investigation by the federal police , " a spokesman for the regional police said .
he gave no further details . bombs would have created " a fireball " the head of the federal crime office , joerg ziercke , said the bombs were packed into identical black cases and consisted of gas canisters , alarm clocks , wires and batteries and soft drink bottles filled with a flammable liquid . " the cases had been supposed to explode 10 minutes before the trains arrived at the stations , " ziercke said . " it 's more likely than unlikely that there was a terrorist background , " he said . if the around 25-kilo -lrb- 55-lb . -rrb- suitcase bombs had exploded they would have lead to " a fireball " in the train carriages and an " indeterminate number of injured and possible deaths , " ziercke said . he added that a 100-strong team of investigators was still trying to establish why the devices failed to explode . a note in the case found in koblenz contained arabic writing and a telephone number in lebanon , and packets of starch with labels in arabic and english were also found . 50,000 euro reward the cases containing the bombs were unaccompanied when they were discovered , but closed circuit television cameras recorded pictures of two dark-haired young men , one wearing a germany football shirt , carrying rucksacks and wheeling the suitcases on to platforms at the cologne railway station . the two men seen on the grainy images have been described as being from " southern countries . " investigators are offering a reward of 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 64,000 -rrb- for any information leading to the arrest of the men . speaking in berlin friday , german interior minister wolfgang schäuble also warned that germany should brace itself for similar attempts .
" unfortunately , we must assume that the danger of a repeat of these attempted attacks . "
the discovery of the two bombed sparked a series of scares at railway stations across germany with parts of the central station in düsseldorf sealed off friday after a suspicious suitcase was found .
officials in düsseldorf later gave the all-clear , saying it had been a false alarm . terror plot " highly likely " the bka suggested that germany was being targeted for attacks possibly by a terrorist organization operating in the country .
if the explosive devices had been detonated , their size and construction would have created devastation and death on a scale reminiscent of the july 7 , 2005 attacks on the london transport system , according to a report in the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper . both of the suitcases discovered on july 31 contained gas cylinders rigged up to an ignition mechanism and had been left in two regional trains which usually run at the height of the commuter rush hour .
the suitcases were discovered by rail staff when the trains terminated at the two hub stations .
the construction of the devices and the potential impact the explosions would have had suggests a sophisticated plot . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german security official with one of the canisters investigations by bka engineers revealed that the bombs were designed so that simultaneous detonation would have been possible and that they would generate " an explosive force so big that the explosion would have reached the dimension of the subway attack on london in the summer of 2005 , " a high-ranking security source told the newspaper . in the london attacks , 52 people were killed and over 700 were injured when suicide bombers struck on three underground trains and a bus . debate rages on increased surveillance the investigation has fired an intense debate in germany regarding the expansion of video surveillance in railway stations and in trains .
some german states have already taken steps to increase their " big brother " security systems . the conservative-controlled hamburg state government wants to add more cameras to streets and public places , not just railway stations and trains . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opinions differ on what measures should be taken in brandenburg , interior minister jörg schönbohm of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- said that the state was considering limiting surveillance to people getting on and off trains in an attempt to dodge the controversial topic of data protection . however , federal data protection czar peter schaar has pleaded for more to be done , with extra staff and cameras placed at all railway stations and on trains to increase security . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de homemade bombs found on german railway german federal prosecutors are investigating a possible terrorist link to two unexploded bombs discovered in dortmund and koblenz .

" israel has allowed humanitarian corridors since monday , " lebanon 's environment minister yacoub sarraf told a news conference after the meeting .
" the embargo has not totally been lifted , airspace and waters remain sealed , but they have free movement on the shore for the international assistance to go in . " threat to economy and wildlife bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the oil spill is expected to have serious consequences for the fishing industry the unep said the spill will have humanitarian and economic implications , by robbing fishermen of their livelihoods and discouraging tourism .
the oil also continues to threaten already decimated animal populations including green turtles and tuna . limited cleanup work has already begun , according to barbara helfferich , a spokeswoman for the european commission . " the norwegians have spent equipment to fight the oil spill at sea , " she said .
" the pumping and cleaning has begun . " officials said they believed about 80 percent of the oil is on the coastline , 20 percent has evaporated and less than one percent is at sea . though an exact timetable can not be set due to the precarious ceasefire in the region , a un action plan envisions about 300 people working at 30 cleaning sites that would deal with the waste by either burning it in refineries or possibly using some in public works such as road construction . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no german combat troops on lebanese soil but navy will go the german government has ruled out sending ground troops equipped for combat as part of a peacekeeping force in south lebanon , german chancellor angela merkel announced late thursday .

hezbollah killed 160 israelis , mostly soldiers . " important that europe steps forward " france 's contribution however has fallen far short of the major commanding role that many had foreseen for the former colonial power in lebanon . the united nations has been urging european countries to provide troops to the peacekeeping force , as the beirut government moved ahead with the deployment of the lebanese army in the south of the country . on saturday french president jacques chirac held talks with several eu leaders stressing the need to swiftly agree the make-up and mandate of a peacekeeping force in lebanon , his office said . the french leader spoke by phone to italy 's prime minister romano prodi , turkish prime minister recep erdogan and finish prime minister matti vanhanen , whose country holds the eu presidency , it said .

denmark said it was ready to send three warships into the region . though the german government has ruled out sending any ground troops , chancellor angela merkel said germany could send a " maritime protection component " and provide logistics , air transport and reconnaissance , depending on the rules of engagement . un mandate too vague one of the main reasons for the reluctance of european nations to contribute troops remains the vagueness of the un peacekeeping force 's mandate . in germany , where the idea of sending german soldiers for a deployment which might involve turning their guns on israelis remains highly sensitive , politicians say the un mandate remains too ambiguous .

on saturday , the shaky truce suffered a blow when helicopter-borne israeli commandos raided a hezbollah bastion , allegedly aimed to disrupt weapons supplies to hezbollah from syria and iran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boxes of humanitarian aid arrive in lebanon french navy commandos were the first to disembark from the force-projection and command ship mistral anchored off naqura , which is about three kilometers -lrb- two miles -rrb- from the israeli border . france 's reinforcements arrived under a united nations resolution that ended a 34-day war between israel and the shiite hezbollah militia which killed 1,150 people , mostly civilians , in lebanon .
hezbollah killed 160 israelis , mostly soldiers . " important that europe steps forward " france 's contribution however has fallen far short of the major commanding role that many had foreseen for the former colonial power in lebanon . the united nations has been urging european countries to provide troops to the peacekeeping force , as the beirut government moved ahead with the deployment of the lebanese army in the south of the country . on saturday french president jacques chirac held talks with several eu leaders stressing the need to swiftly agree the make-up and mandate of a peacekeeping force in lebanon , his office said . the french leader spoke by phone to italy 's prime minister romano prodi , turkish prime minister recep erdogan and finish prime minister matti vanhanen , whose country holds the eu presidency , it said .
all three countries have agreed in principle to send soldiers but want more details on the precise mandate of the force charged with policing a ceasefire between israel and hezbollah .
chirac highlighted " the need to very quickly specify the missions , the rules of engagement and the chain of command " of the un interim force in lebanon -lrb- unifil -rrb- , it said . he also insisted on the need for balance in the distribution of contingents " which must reflect the commitment of all the international community and , in particular european countries " , it added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac has urged european countries to act swiftly earlier , un deputy secretary general mark malloch brown too pleaded with european nations to pitch in . " the particular appeal i want to make today is that europe comes forward with troops for this first wave , " malloch brown told journalists .
" it 's very important that europe now steps forward . " un security council resolution 1701 , which governs the ceasefire , calls for israeli troops to withdraw from south lebanon in tandem with deployment of lebanese troops and a beefed-up un peacekeeping force in the area . italy , finland considering troops the un also issued a detailed list friday of its troop requirements for the vanguard force of 3,500 , including eight mechanized infantry battalions , three light reconnaissance battalions , three engineering battalions and five observation helicopters . a logistical battalion , a military hospital along with communications units and military policy will also be needed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reconstructing beirut is likely to take time italy 's government and both houses of parliament approved a motion friday to contribute troops to the un interim force which , under un security council resolution 1701 , is to be expanded from its existing 1,990 members to 15,000 . also on friday , the finnish government said it might send 250 troops , but that no firm decision would be taken until the end of the month .
denmark said it was ready to send three warships into the region . though the german government has ruled out sending any ground troops , chancellor angela merkel said germany could send a " maritime protection component " and provide logistics , air transport and reconnaissance , depending on the rules of engagement . un mandate too vague one of the main reasons for the reluctance of european nations to contribute troops remains the vagueness of the un peacekeeping force 's mandate . in germany , where the idea of sending german soldiers for a deployment which might involve turning their guns on israelis remains highly sensitive , politicians say the un mandate remains too ambiguous . " what we 're missing is a plan of operation , " said gert weisskirchen , foreign policy expert of the social democratic party .
" the rules of engagement are not clear and the un has to finally decide on that . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier with chancellor merkel even german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has called for clarification . " we do n't know whether the german navy for instance will have the right to enter aboard suspicious vessels , " steinmeier said .
" i hope that we manage to make decisive progress over the weekend . " german defence minister franz josef jung called on the united nations to give the troops deployed in lebanon an " unequivocal mandate " for the use of force . in an interview to be published on monday , jung said the german navy would have to be able to use armed force to prevent the transport of arms to hezbollah . such use of force would require a un mandate , and that the matter would have to be cleared up before germany could commit its troops , jung told the german magazine focus . " we are not about to send ships to the lebanese coast just to observe , " he said . " our soldiers must have a mandate to prevent the smuggling of weapons and guarantee a lasting ceasefire .

in all , the 21-year-old striker found the net three times , and equalled the scoresheets of greats like ronaldo and thierry henry .
two of podolski 's goals came against the group of 16 game against sweden in munich on june 24 . the former fc cologne idol hoped that he could repeat his tournament performance against the swedes in a friendly at gelsenkirchen on wednesday if for no other reason than to make bayern coach felix magath aware of his prowess in front of the net .

the company faces a tough fight in the highly competitve sector - but it 's a fight telekom is prepared for . deutsche telekom is the latest telecommunications company to feel the pressure of intensifying competition in europe .
the german firm , europe 's largest communications group , recently announced a 4 percent fall in half-year profits .
shares in deutsche telekom - which owns t-mobile - nose dived by 11 percent after the announcement earlier in august . the firm says the profit shortfall is due to a poor performance in germany and has pledged to take aggressive action to win back customers .
but will this be enough to halt the company 's slide ? deutsche telekom anticipates its operating profit for the year could be more than a billion euros -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- lower than previously anticipated .
the company said in a statement last week that its bottom-line net profit declined by 14 percent to 1.01 billion euros in the period from april to june , despite a three-percent rise in revenues to 15.13 billion euros . in germany , deutsche telekom 's overall sales have fallen by 4 percent in the past six months .
first half sales of its german mobile arm dropped by 3 percent in the first half of the year and its fixed-line business lost a million customers over that period . cuts in earning and sales forecasts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ricke will reverse the trend of high sales forecasts because of these results , deutsche telekom has been forced to issue a profit warning .
and deutsche telekom 's chairman , kai-uwe ricke , said the company will cut its earnings and sales forecasts for this year and next year . " deutsche telekom is transforming in a telecommunication market , a worldwide telecommunication market , which is ever-changing , " ricke said .
" and this transformation is huge .
it 's a challenge .
it 's a marathon . " ricke said he and his team are ready to take on the challenge .
the company 's strategy is to take a much more aggressive approach to competition in its key domestic markets in the second half of this year . many customers have switched to cheaper phone and internet providers , and deutsche telekom wants to win them back .
ricke said costs and prices will be slashed in order to defend the company 's domestic market share . attack is the best form of defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom 's near-monopoly is under threat " deutsche telekom has to do its homework in the german marketplace , " ricke said .
" that means we must rigorously defend our market share .
it has to do with pricing , it has to do with products , it has to do with service , it has to do with things we have in our pipeline , and what we are going to roll out over the next few weeks . " that means offering simpler packages with lower prices .
for example , new bundled offers from t-mobile in germany will soon cost less than 10 euro cents per minute , regardless of which network people call . deutsche telekom has also started marketing a merged fixed-line and mobile service to try to stop people canceling their deutsche telekom traditional phone lines . the company also plans to invest differently to increase its cash flow .
and it will spend an extra 1.2 billion euros on marketing and products this year .
that 's in addition to a 3-billion-euro investment in a fiber-optic network to broadcast live tv programs , such as germany 's bundesliga soccer league matches , over the internet .
ricke is hopeful that all this will stave off competition from vodafone and other competitors . foreign stability remains key deutsche telekom 's international business units have been more successful than its domestic market and are solely responsible for the company 's sales growth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : t-mobile is proving popular in the uk t-mobile in the uk , for example , added more than 360 thousand subscribers over the second quarter .
and revenues generated outside of germany have risen by a total of 4 percent to 3.6 billion euros . but telecommunications analyst ovum said deutsche telekom has underestimated its competition for too long , that it ca n't hide behind its overseas growth now , and that there 's certainly no " quick fix " for its domestic problems . so is this program of price cuts and innovations coming too late ?
and will competitors such as vodafone follow suit ?

the company faces a tough fight in the highly competitve sector - but it 's a fight telekom is prepared for . deutsche telekom is the latest telecommunications company to feel the pressure of intensifying competition in europe .
the german firm , europe 's largest communications group , recently announced a 4 percent fall in half-year profits .
shares in deutsche telekom - which owns t-mobile - nose dived by 11 percent after the announcement earlier in august . the firm says the profit shortfall is due to a poor performance in germany and has pledged to take aggressive action to win back customers .
but will this be enough to halt the company 's slide ? deutsche telekom anticipates its operating profit for the year could be more than a billion euros -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- lower than previously anticipated .
the company said in a statement last week that its bottom-line net profit declined by 14 percent to 1.01 billion euros in the period from april to june , despite a three-percent rise in revenues to 15.13 billion euros . in germany , deutsche telekom 's overall sales have fallen by 4 percent in the past six months .
first half sales of its german mobile arm dropped by 3 percent in the first half of the year and its fixed-line business lost a million customers over that period . cuts in earning and sales forecasts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ricke will reverse the trend of high sales forecasts because of these results , deutsche telekom has been forced to issue a profit warning .
and deutsche telekom 's chairman , kai-uwe ricke , said the company will cut its earnings and sales forecasts for this year and next year . " deutsche telekom is transforming in a telecommunication market , a worldwide telecommunication market , which is ever-changing , " ricke said .
" and this transformation is huge .
it 's a challenge .
it 's a marathon . " ricke said he and his team are ready to take on the challenge .
the company 's strategy is to take a much more aggressive approach to competition in its key domestic markets in the second half of this year . many customers have switched to cheaper phone and internet providers , and deutsche telekom wants to win them back .
ricke said costs and prices will be slashed in order to defend the company 's domestic market share . attack is the best form of defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom 's near-monopoly is under threat " deutsche telekom has to do its homework in the german marketplace , " ricke said .
" that means we must rigorously defend our market share .
it has to do with pricing , it has to do with products , it has to do with service , it has to do with things we have in our pipeline , and what we are going to roll out over the next few weeks . " that means offering simpler packages with lower prices .
for example , new bundled offers from t-mobile in germany will soon cost less than 10 euro cents per minute , regardless of which network people call . deutsche telekom has also started marketing a merged fixed-line and mobile service to try to stop people canceling their deutsche telekom traditional phone lines . the company also plans to invest differently to increase its cash flow .
and it will spend an extra 1.2 billion euros on marketing and products this year .
that 's in addition to a 3-billion-euro investment in a fiber-optic network to broadcast live tv programs , such as germany 's bundesliga soccer league matches , over the internet .
ricke is hopeful that all this will stave off competition from vodafone and other competitors . foreign stability remains key deutsche telekom 's international business units have been more successful than its domestic market and are solely responsible for the company 's sales growth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : t-mobile is proving popular in the uk t-mobile in the uk , for example , added more than 360 thousand subscribers over the second quarter .
and revenues generated outside of germany have risen by a total of 4 percent to 3.6 billion euros . but telecommunications analyst ovum said deutsche telekom has underestimated its competition for too long , that it ca n't hide behind its overseas growth now , and that there 's certainly no " quick fix " for its domestic problems . so is this program of price cuts and innovations coming too late ?
and will competitors such as vodafone follow suit ?

in all , the 21-year-old striker found the net three times , and equalled the scoresheets of greats like ronaldo and thierry henry .
two of podolski 's goals came against the group of 16 game against sweden in munich on june 24 . the former fc cologne idol hoped that he could repeat his tournament performance against the swedes in a friendly at gelsenkirchen on wednesday if for no other reason than to make bayern coach felix magath aware of his prowess in front of the net .
germany again demolished their helpless opponents , winning 3-0 , but sweden took podolski , who is not in top physical form at the moment , out of the game . and to boot , his defender , anders svensson , who had a run-in with podolski during the friendly , had some choice words for the youngster afterwards . " podolski was crying the whole time .
i went to him and told him he should stop .
that 's when he took a swipe at me , " the if elfsborg fullback said .

" there 's no reason for me to be in doubt .
i always knew that i would sometimes sit on the bench at bayern , particularly after the short amount of time i 've had to prepare after the world cup , " he told soccer magazine kicker this week . the overflowing pool of talent in munich makes it easier for magath to have a physically unfit prince poldi .
currently in front of the heir apparent in german soccer are ex-dutch national player roy makaay and paraguayan forward roque santa cruz . spared the energy-sapping world cup , makaay played inspiring soccer in bayern 's 2006/07 debut last friday , scoring once and taking on a greater leadership role after the departure of former midfield playmaker michael ballack .
santa cruz was in germany this summer , but paraguay were knocked out unceremoniously in the first round , leaving him plenty of time to recuperate . not everything this week was bad until he is 100 percent in shape , the 11 million euro transfer to bayern , however will have to listen to his coach repeatedly explain his decisions to the german press about why he is not starting .
even if magath would prefer not to . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski was undoubtedly the man at fc cologne " the situation has n't changed . -lrb- … -rrb- particularly with lukas , the players are n't so familiar with his timing and how he moves on the pitch .
we had too little time to get used to it , " magath said . the 21-year-old podolski also faced another setback recently when he failed to stop a satirical show on the star on german public radio , wdr , called " lukas ' diary . "
podolski 's lawyer called it " tasteless and without any standard . "
a court in munich however recently ruled that the comedy show in no way denigrated podolski . yet podolski could be happy about one event this past week .
his former and still beloved club fc cologne started their campaign to exit the second division with a 2-0 victory .
a reason for the prince to smile .

the authorities also found explosives at the station , according to german public broadcaster ard . " the person appears to be one of the two suspects that have been sought since yesterday with the help of video footage that was made public , " the federal prosecutor 's office said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german police are searching for these two men german police are hunting for two men suspected of planting two homemade bombs packed into suitcases on july 31 in trains in the western cities of dortmund and koblenz .
the bombs however failed to detonate . investigators first thought that the devices were a blackmail attempt , but analysis of the contents revealed a possible link to lebanon . " we are now working on the basis that this was the work of a terrorist group based in germany and that it was an attempt to kill a large number of people , " rainer griesbaum , a federal prosecutor , told a press conference friday . rail traffic was suspended in kiel on saturday morning as " a measure in the current investigation by the federal police , " a spokesman for the regional police said .
he gave no further details . bombs would have created " a fireball " the head of the federal crime office , joerg ziercke , said the bombs were packed into identical black cases and consisted of gas canisters , alarm clocks , wires and batteries and soft drink bottles filled with a flammable liquid . " the cases had been supposed to explode 10 minutes before the trains arrived at the stations , " ziercke said . " it 's more likely than unlikely that there was a terrorist background , " he said . if the around 25-kilo -lrb- 55-lb . -rrb- suitcase bombs had exploded they would have lead to " a fireball " in the train carriages and an " indeterminate number of injured and possible deaths , " ziercke said . he added that a 100-strong team of investigators was still trying to establish why the devices failed to explode . a note in the case found in koblenz contained arabic writing and a telephone number in lebanon , and packets of starch with labels in arabic and english were also found . 50,000 euro reward the cases containing the bombs were unaccompanied when they were discovered , but closed circuit television cameras recorded pictures of two dark-haired young men , one wearing a germany football shirt , carrying rucksacks and wheeling the suitcases on to platforms at the cologne railway station . the two men seen on the grainy images have been described as being from " southern countries . " investigators are offering a reward of 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 64,000 -rrb- for any information leading to the arrest of the men . speaking in berlin friday , german interior minister wolfgang schäuble also warned that germany should brace itself for similar attempts .
" unfortunately , we must assume that the danger of a repeat of these attempted attacks . "
the discovery of the two bombed sparked a series of scares at railway stations across germany with parts of the central station in düsseldorf sealed off friday after a suspicious suitcase was found .
officials in düsseldorf later gave the all-clear , saying it had been a false alarm . terror plot " highly likely " the bka suggested that germany was being targeted for attacks possibly by a terrorist organization operating in the country .
if the explosive devices had been detonated , their size and construction would have created devastation and death on a scale reminiscent of the july 7 , 2005 attacks on the london transport system , according to a report in the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper . both of the suitcases discovered on july 31 contained gas cylinders rigged up to an ignition mechanism and had been left in two regional trains which usually run at the height of the commuter rush hour .
the suitcases were discovered by rail staff when the trains terminated at the two hub stations .
the construction of the devices and the potential impact the explosions would have had suggests a sophisticated plot . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german security official with one of the canisters investigations by bka engineers revealed that the bombs were designed so that simultaneous detonation would have been possible and that they would generate " an explosive force so big that the explosion would have reached the dimension of the subway attack on london in the summer of 2005 , " a high-ranking security source told the newspaper . in the london attacks , 52 people were killed and over 700 were injured when suicide bombers struck on three underground trains and a bus . debate rages on increased surveillance the investigation has fired an intense debate in germany regarding the expansion of video surveillance in railway stations and in trains .
some german states have already taken steps to increase their " big brother " security systems . the conservative-controlled hamburg state government wants to add more cameras to streets and public places , not just railway stations and trains . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opinions differ on what measures should be taken in brandenburg , interior minister jörg schönbohm of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- said that the state was considering limiting surveillance to people getting on and off trains in an attempt to dodge the controversial topic of data protection . however , federal data protection czar peter schaar has pleaded for more to be done , with extra staff and cameras placed at all railway stations and on trains to increase security . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de homemade bombs found on german railway german federal prosecutors are investigating a possible terrorist link to two unexploded bombs discovered in dortmund and koblenz .

the work is now awaiting auction at christie 's . two elegant women , brightly dressed , walk along a crowded street .
ernst ludwig kirchner used this scene to capture the german capital in his painting " berlin street scene " from 1913 . this painting is now the object of a fierce restitution dispute involving the berlin state senate , a berlin museum , the ernst-ludwig-kirchner archive and the heirs of the painting 's original jewish owner . it is currently scheduled to go under the hammer at christie 's auction house in new york , where it could bring in between 14 and 19.5 million euros -lrb- $ 18 to 25 million -rrb- .
such a selling price would make it the artist 's most expensive work . kirchner and painting owner rejected by nazis kirchner , a master of german impressionism , created the work in the same year his artist group die brücke broke up .
many big-name impressionists - like emil nolde , edvard munch and henri matisse - were part of the group , whose name " the bridge " symbolized the links its members sought to establish between artistic styles . kirchner and the other members of die brücke were denounced by the nazis after hitler came to power in 1933 because their work conflicted with the party 's rejection of modernity , particularly in art . now a flurry of controversy has arisen over whether the purchase of the painting from the jewish family of the deceased original owner alfred hess in the early years of the third reich by a german art collector may have been forced because of anti-semitism and the price set artificially low .
if so , the work could qualify for restitution . painting returned to hess heir bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirchner 's " group of artists " depicts members of the " die brücke " group in late july , berlin 's senate , which had been in possession of kirchner 's 1913 painting , unexpectedly returned it to hess ' heir in england .
though the move came as a surprise , secret negotiations had been underway for almost two years already . barbara kisseler , berlin 's state secretary of culture told the daily newspaper frankfurt allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- that the masterpiece was returned because it had come to their attention that the hess family had been unfairly treated during the nazi dictatorship . " moral considerations " played a significant role in the decision , she said . shortly after the restitution of the piece was made public , the new york auction house christie 's announced it had purchased the kirchner work and planned to auction it on november 8 . critics claim restitution not legitimate in a joint statement , the ernst ludwig kirchner archive near bern , the brücke museum and the berlin auction house villa grisebach have publicly protested the return of the kirchner painting , claiming it had been legally purchased . they wrote that the berlin senate had been " dilettantish " in dealing with " german museum property .

it is a hesitation that is fundamentally positive and beneficial as nothing offers better protection from all sorts of the disastrous , overboard patriotism of the past . additionally , germany is interwoven in a thick mesh of international connections that make the country an equal partner in the political landscape .

the deployment of only the navy to israeli and lebanese waters and a lightly armed police force on the lebanese-syrian border could provide a certain degree of assurance that it does not come to such a confrontation .

the move is related to a wider probe into the doping of athletes , including star german cyclist jan ullrich . the raids by german police were carried out on thursday and were prompted by findings in connection with the investigation into a spanish doctor suspected of suppling performance-enhancing drugs to top athletes including german cyclist jan ullrich . prosecutors and police in the german town of göttingen said the premises belonging to a man identified only as dr. markus c. in the states of lower saxony and thuringia were searched . german doc allegedly supplied spanish counterpart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doping allegations continue to dogs sports hans hugo heimgärtner , spokesman for the prosecutor ’ s office said that a significant amount of evidence was seized and is currently being analyzed .
the operation , he said , was initiated because of recent findings by spanish authorities who are investigating a sports doping ring allegedly run by spanish doctor eufemiano fuentes . " the german doctor is suspected of violating german laws by making drugs available for illegal purposes such as performance-enhancing in sports , " heimgärtner said .
" there are indications that he provided these drugs to a doctor in spain who stands accused of selling them to the athletes . " dr markus c is said to have delivered large quantities of synacten - a drug that raises pain endurance levels in humans .
the trail to germany , authorities say , came to light after spanish officials in may raided offices belonging to dr fuentes . there they found among other things anabolic steroids , equipment used for blood transfusions and more than 100 bags of frozen blood .
in an official probe that ensued , more than 50 professional cyclists were implicated in the doping scandal including tour de france favourites jan ullrich and ivan basso .
they both withdrew on the eve of the race in july . calls for ullrich to come clean german sports federation president thomas bach now welcomes the crackdown on such doping practices as an essential move towards drug-free sports . " these investigations are crucial in our campaign for clean sports , " bach said .
" quite obviously there are entire doping networks operating in the background of athletes and we must do everything to destroy these rings . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan ullrich still protests his innocence meanwhile german anti-doping campaigners have called on jan ullrich to come forward and testify on his drug-taking past .
germany ’ s leading expert on doping , werner franke said that with the international cycling union discussing disciplinary action against ullrich , the star cyclist should come clean . " i can only recommend to jan ullrich and all the other cyclists accused of doping to make a clean slate now , " franke said .
" the cycling union , i ’ m sure will certainly respect that in their ruling . " so far however , jan ullrich has continued to protest his innocence and denies the doping allegations . but the noose around his neck is getting tighter .
a fax found recently in documents confiscated from dr fuentes , for the first time shows the german cyclist ’ s full name on a list of athletes who had received drugs . uwe hessler -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new blow to cycling as tour winner landis tests positive tour de france winner floyd landis is set to become the first victor of the race to be stripped of his title after his b sample confirmed he had abnormal levels of testosterone on saturday .

two of podolski 's goals came against the group of 16 game against sweden in munich on june 24 . the former fc cologne idol hoped that he could repeat his tournament performance against the swedes in a friendly at gelsenkirchen on wednesday if for no other reason than to make bayern coach felix magath aware of his prowess in front of the net .

the move is related to a wider probe into the doping of athletes , including star german cyclist jan ullrich . the raids by german police were carried out on thursday and were prompted by findings in connection with the investigation into a spanish doctor suspected of suppling performance-enhancing drugs to top athletes including german cyclist jan ullrich . prosecutors and police in the german town of göttingen said the premises belonging to a man identified only as dr. markus c. in the states of lower saxony and thuringia were searched . german doc allegedly supplied spanish counterpart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doping allegations continue to dogs sports hans hugo heimgärtner , spokesman for the prosecutor ’ s office said that a significant amount of evidence was seized and is currently being analyzed .
the operation , he said , was initiated because of recent findings by spanish authorities who are investigating a sports doping ring allegedly run by spanish doctor eufemiano fuentes . " the german doctor is suspected of violating german laws by making drugs available for illegal purposes such as performance-enhancing in sports , " heimgärtner said .
" there are indications that he provided these drugs to a doctor in spain who stands accused of selling them to the athletes . " dr markus c is said to have delivered large quantities of synacten - a drug that raises pain endurance levels in humans .
the trail to germany , authorities say , came to light after spanish officials in may raided offices belonging to dr fuentes . there they found among other things anabolic steroids , equipment used for blood transfusions and more than 100 bags of frozen blood .
in an official probe that ensued , more than 50 professional cyclists were implicated in the doping scandal including tour de france favourites jan ullrich and ivan basso .
they both withdrew on the eve of the race in july . calls for ullrich to come clean german sports federation president thomas bach now welcomes the crackdown on such doping practices as an essential move towards drug-free sports . " these investigations are crucial in our campaign for clean sports , " bach said .
" quite obviously there are entire doping networks operating in the background of athletes and we must do everything to destroy these rings . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan ullrich still protests his innocence meanwhile german anti-doping campaigners have called on jan ullrich to come forward and testify on his drug-taking past .

on saturday , the shaky truce suffered a blow when helicopter-borne israeli commandos raided a hezbollah bastion , allegedly aimed to disrupt weapons supplies to hezbollah from syria and iran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boxes of humanitarian aid arrive in lebanon french navy commandos were the first to disembark from the force-projection and command ship mistral anchored off naqura , which is about three kilometers -lrb- two miles -rrb- from the israeli border . france 's reinforcements arrived under a united nations resolution that ended a 34-day war between israel and the shiite hezbollah militia which killed 1,150 people , mostly civilians , in lebanon .
hezbollah killed 160 israelis , mostly soldiers . " important that europe steps forward " france 's contribution however has fallen far short of the major commanding role that many had foreseen for the former colonial power in lebanon . the united nations has been urging european countries to provide troops to the peacekeeping force , as the beirut government moved ahead with the deployment of the lebanese army in the south of the country . on saturday french president jacques chirac held talks with several eu leaders stressing the need to swiftly agree the make-up and mandate of a peacekeeping force in lebanon , his office said . the french leader spoke by phone to italy 's prime minister romano prodi , turkish prime minister recep erdogan and finish prime minister matti vanhanen , whose country holds the eu presidency , it said .
all three countries have agreed in principle to send soldiers but want more details on the precise mandate of the force charged with policing a ceasefire between israel and hezbollah .
chirac highlighted " the need to very quickly specify the missions , the rules of engagement and the chain of command " of the un interim force in lebanon -lrb- unifil -rrb- , it said . he also insisted on the need for balance in the distribution of contingents " which must reflect the commitment of all the international community and , in particular european countries " , it added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac has urged european countries to act swiftly earlier , un deputy secretary general mark malloch brown too pleaded with european nations to pitch in . " the particular appeal i want to make today is that europe comes forward with troops for this first wave , " malloch brown told journalists .
" it 's very important that europe now steps forward . " un security council resolution 1701 , which governs the ceasefire , calls for israeli troops to withdraw from south lebanon in tandem with deployment of lebanese troops and a beefed-up un peacekeeping force in the area . italy , finland considering troops the un also issued a detailed list friday of its troop requirements for the vanguard force of 3,500 , including eight mechanized infantry battalions , three light reconnaissance battalions , three engineering battalions and five observation helicopters . a logistical battalion , a military hospital along with communications units and military policy will also be needed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reconstructing beirut is likely to take time italy 's government and both houses of parliament approved a motion friday to contribute troops to the un interim force which , under un security council resolution 1701 , is to be expanded from its existing 1,990 members to 15,000 . also on friday , the finnish government said it might send 250 troops , but that no firm decision would be taken until the end of the month .
denmark said it was ready to send three warships into the region . though the german government has ruled out sending any ground troops , chancellor angela merkel said germany could send a " maritime protection component " and provide logistics , air transport and reconnaissance , depending on the rules of engagement . un mandate too vague one of the main reasons for the reluctance of european nations to contribute troops remains the vagueness of the un peacekeeping force 's mandate . in germany , where the idea of sending german soldiers for a deployment which might involve turning their guns on israelis remains highly sensitive , politicians say the un mandate remains too ambiguous . " what we 're missing is a plan of operation , " said gert weisskirchen , foreign policy expert of the social democratic party .
" the rules of engagement are not clear and the un has to finally decide on that . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier with chancellor merkel even german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has called for clarification .

the move is related to a wider probe into the doping of athletes , including star german cyclist jan ullrich . the raids by german police were carried out on thursday and were prompted by findings in connection with the investigation into a spanish doctor suspected of suppling performance-enhancing drugs to top athletes including german cyclist jan ullrich . prosecutors and police in the german town of göttingen said the premises belonging to a man identified only as dr. markus c. in the states of lower saxony and thuringia were searched . german doc allegedly supplied spanish counterpart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doping allegations continue to dogs sports hans hugo heimgärtner , spokesman for the prosecutor ’ s office said that a significant amount of evidence was seized and is currently being analyzed .

on saturday , the shaky truce suffered a blow when helicopter-borne israeli commandos raided a hezbollah bastion , allegedly aimed to disrupt weapons supplies to hezbollah from syria and iran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boxes of humanitarian aid arrive in lebanon french navy commandos were the first to disembark from the force-projection and command ship mistral anchored off naqura , which is about three kilometers -lrb- two miles -rrb- from the israeli border . france 's reinforcements arrived under a united nations resolution that ended a 34-day war between israel and the shiite hezbollah militia which killed 1,150 people , mostly civilians , in lebanon .
hezbollah killed 160 israelis , mostly soldiers . " important that europe steps forward " france 's contribution however has fallen far short of the major commanding role that many had foreseen for the former colonial power in lebanon . the united nations has been urging european countries to provide troops to the peacekeeping force , as the beirut government moved ahead with the deployment of the lebanese army in the south of the country . on saturday french president jacques chirac held talks with several eu leaders stressing the need to swiftly agree the make-up and mandate of a peacekeeping force in lebanon , his office said . the french leader spoke by phone to italy 's prime minister romano prodi , turkish prime minister recep erdogan and finish prime minister matti vanhanen , whose country holds the eu presidency , it said .
all three countries have agreed in principle to send soldiers but want more details on the precise mandate of the force charged with policing a ceasefire between israel and hezbollah .
chirac highlighted " the need to very quickly specify the missions , the rules of engagement and the chain of command " of the un interim force in lebanon -lrb- unifil -rrb- , it said . he also insisted on the need for balance in the distribution of contingents " which must reflect the commitment of all the international community and , in particular european countries " , it added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac has urged european countries to act swiftly earlier , un deputy secretary general mark malloch brown too pleaded with european nations to pitch in . " the particular appeal i want to make today is that europe comes forward with troops for this first wave , " malloch brown told journalists .
" it 's very important that europe now steps forward . " un security council resolution 1701 , which governs the ceasefire , calls for israeli troops to withdraw from south lebanon in tandem with deployment of lebanese troops and a beefed-up un peacekeeping force in the area . italy , finland considering troops the un also issued a detailed list friday of its troop requirements for the vanguard force of 3,500 , including eight mechanized infantry battalions , three light reconnaissance battalions , three engineering battalions and five observation helicopters . a logistical battalion , a military hospital along with communications units and military policy will also be needed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reconstructing beirut is likely to take time italy 's government and both houses of parliament approved a motion friday to contribute troops to the un interim force which , under un security council resolution 1701 , is to be expanded from its existing 1,990 members to 15,000 . also on friday , the finnish government said it might send 250 troops , but that no firm decision would be taken until the end of the month .
denmark said it was ready to send three warships into the region . though the german government has ruled out sending any ground troops , chancellor angela merkel said germany could send a " maritime protection component " and provide logistics , air transport and reconnaissance , depending on the rules of engagement . un mandate too vague one of the main reasons for the reluctance of european nations to contribute troops remains the vagueness of the un peacekeeping force 's mandate . in germany , where the idea of sending german soldiers for a deployment which might involve turning their guns on israelis remains highly sensitive , politicians say the un mandate remains too ambiguous . " what we 're missing is a plan of operation , " said gert weisskirchen , foreign policy expert of the social democratic party .
" the rules of engagement are not clear and the un has to finally decide on that . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier with chancellor merkel even german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has called for clarification . " we do n't know whether the german navy for instance will have the right to enter aboard suspicious vessels , " steinmeier said .
" i hope that we manage to make decisive progress over the weekend . " german defence minister franz josef jung called on the united nations to give the troops deployed in lebanon an " unequivocal mandate " for the use of force . in an interview to be published on monday , jung said the german navy would have to be able to use armed force to prevent the transport of arms to hezbollah . such use of force would require a un mandate , and that the matter would have to be cleared up before germany could commit its troops , jung told the german magazine focus . " we are not about to send ships to the lebanese coast just to observe , " he said . " our soldiers must have a mandate to prevent the smuggling of weapons and guarantee a lasting ceasefire .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 19.08.2006 telekom streamlines as germany 's giant feels the pinch großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche telekom is facing new and serious challenges deutsche telekom has been rocked by recent financial results and the loss of a million fixed-line customers .
the company faces a tough fight in the highly competitve sector - but it 's a fight telekom is prepared for . deutsche telekom is the latest telecommunications company to feel the pressure of intensifying competition in europe .
the german firm , europe 's largest communications group , recently announced a 4 percent fall in half-year profits .
shares in deutsche telekom - which owns t-mobile - nose dived by 11 percent after the announcement earlier in august . the firm says the profit shortfall is due to a poor performance in germany and has pledged to take aggressive action to win back customers .
but will this be enough to halt the company 's slide ? deutsche telekom anticipates its operating profit for the year could be more than a billion euros -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- lower than previously anticipated .
the company said in a statement last week that its bottom-line net profit declined by 14 percent to 1.01 billion euros in the period from april to june , despite a three-percent rise in revenues to 15.13 billion euros . in germany , deutsche telekom 's overall sales have fallen by 4 percent in the past six months .
first half sales of its german mobile arm dropped by 3 percent in the first half of the year and its fixed-line business lost a million customers over that period . cuts in earning and sales forecasts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ricke will reverse the trend of high sales forecasts because of these results , deutsche telekom has been forced to issue a profit warning .
and deutsche telekom 's chairman , kai-uwe ricke , said the company will cut its earnings and sales forecasts for this year and next year . " deutsche telekom is transforming in a telecommunication market , a worldwide telecommunication market , which is ever-changing , " ricke said .
" and this transformation is huge .
it 's a challenge .
it 's a marathon . " ricke said he and his team are ready to take on the challenge .
the company 's strategy is to take a much more aggressive approach to competition in its key domestic markets in the second half of this year . many customers have switched to cheaper phone and internet providers , and deutsche telekom wants to win them back .
ricke said costs and prices will be slashed in order to defend the company 's domestic market share . attack is the best form of defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom 's near-monopoly is under threat " deutsche telekom has to do its homework in the german marketplace , " ricke said .
" that means we must rigorously defend our market share .
it has to do with pricing , it has to do with products , it has to do with service , it has to do with things we have in our pipeline , and what we are going to roll out over the next few weeks . " that means offering simpler packages with lower prices .
for example , new bundled offers from t-mobile in germany will soon cost less than 10 euro cents per minute , regardless of which network people call . deutsche telekom has also started marketing a merged fixed-line and mobile service to try to stop people canceling their deutsche telekom traditional phone lines . the company also plans to invest differently to increase its cash flow .
and it will spend an extra 1.2 billion euros on marketing and products this year .
that 's in addition to a 3-billion-euro investment in a fiber-optic network to broadcast live tv programs , such as germany 's bundesliga soccer league matches , over the internet .
ricke is hopeful that all this will stave off competition from vodafone and other competitors . foreign stability remains key deutsche telekom 's international business units have been more successful than its domestic market and are solely responsible for the company 's sales growth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : t-mobile is proving popular in the uk t-mobile in the uk , for example , added more than 360 thousand subscribers over the second quarter .
and revenues generated outside of germany have risen by a total of 4 percent to 3.6 billion euros . but telecommunications analyst ovum said deutsche telekom has underestimated its competition for too long , that it ca n't hide behind its overseas growth now , and that there 's certainly no " quick fix " for its domestic problems . so is this program of price cuts and innovations coming too late ?
and will competitors such as vodafone follow suit ?
it may well signify the beginning of a telecommunications price war in germany - which for customers at least , would be great news . laura stevens -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche telekom changes strategy after customer exodus deutsche telekom , europe 's biggest telecommunications group , has dramatically lost net income and customers to competitors in germany .

the company faces a tough fight in the highly competitve sector - but it 's a fight telekom is prepared for . deutsche telekom is the latest telecommunications company to feel the pressure of intensifying competition in europe .
the german firm , europe 's largest communications group , recently announced a 4 percent fall in half-year profits .
shares in deutsche telekom - which owns t-mobile - nose dived by 11 percent after the announcement earlier in august . the firm says the profit shortfall is due to a poor performance in germany and has pledged to take aggressive action to win back customers .
but will this be enough to halt the company 's slide ? deutsche telekom anticipates its operating profit for the year could be more than a billion euros -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- lower than previously anticipated .
the company said in a statement last week that its bottom-line net profit declined by 14 percent to 1.01 billion euros in the period from april to june , despite a three-percent rise in revenues to 15.13 billion euros . in germany , deutsche telekom 's overall sales have fallen by 4 percent in the past six months .
first half sales of its german mobile arm dropped by 3 percent in the first half of the year and its fixed-line business lost a million customers over that period . cuts in earning and sales forecasts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ricke will reverse the trend of high sales forecasts because of these results , deutsche telekom has been forced to issue a profit warning .
and deutsche telekom 's chairman , kai-uwe ricke , said the company will cut its earnings and sales forecasts for this year and next year . " deutsche telekom is transforming in a telecommunication market , a worldwide telecommunication market , which is ever-changing , " ricke said .
" and this transformation is huge .
it 's a challenge .
it 's a marathon . " ricke said he and his team are ready to take on the challenge .
the company 's strategy is to take a much more aggressive approach to competition in its key domestic markets in the second half of this year . many customers have switched to cheaper phone and internet providers , and deutsche telekom wants to win them back .
ricke said costs and prices will be slashed in order to defend the company 's domestic market share . attack is the best form of defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom 's near-monopoly is under threat " deutsche telekom has to do its homework in the german marketplace , " ricke said .
" that means we must rigorously defend our market share .
it has to do with pricing , it has to do with products , it has to do with service , it has to do with things we have in our pipeline , and what we are going to roll out over the next few weeks . " that means offering simpler packages with lower prices .
for example , new bundled offers from t-mobile in germany will soon cost less than 10 euro cents per minute , regardless of which network people call . deutsche telekom has also started marketing a merged fixed-line and mobile service to try to stop people canceling their deutsche telekom traditional phone lines . the company also plans to invest differently to increase its cash flow .
and it will spend an extra 1.2 billion euros on marketing and products this year .
that 's in addition to a 3-billion-euro investment in a fiber-optic network to broadcast live tv programs , such as germany 's bundesliga soccer league matches , over the internet .
ricke is hopeful that all this will stave off competition from vodafone and other competitors . foreign stability remains key deutsche telekom 's international business units have been more successful than its domestic market and are solely responsible for the company 's sales growth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : t-mobile is proving popular in the uk t-mobile in the uk , for example , added more than 360 thousand subscribers over the second quarter .
and revenues generated outside of germany have risen by a total of 4 percent to 3.6 billion euros . but telecommunications analyst ovum said deutsche telekom has underestimated its competition for too long , that it ca n't hide behind its overseas growth now , and that there 's certainly no " quick fix " for its domestic problems . so is this program of price cuts and innovations coming too late ?
and will competitors such as vodafone follow suit ?

the work is now awaiting auction at christie 's . two elegant women , brightly dressed , walk along a crowded street .
ernst ludwig kirchner used this scene to capture the german capital in his painting " berlin street scene " from 1913 . this painting is now the object of a fierce restitution dispute involving the berlin state senate , a berlin museum , the ernst-ludwig-kirchner archive and the heirs of the painting 's original jewish owner . it is currently scheduled to go under the hammer at christie 's auction house in new york , where it could bring in between 14 and 19.5 million euros -lrb- $ 18 to 25 million -rrb- .
such a selling price would make it the artist 's most expensive work . kirchner and painting owner rejected by nazis kirchner , a master of german impressionism , created the work in the same year his artist group die brücke broke up .
many big-name impressionists - like emil nolde , edvard munch and henri matisse - were part of the group , whose name " the bridge " symbolized the links its members sought to establish between artistic styles . kirchner and the other members of die brücke were denounced by the nazis after hitler came to power in 1933 because their work conflicted with the party 's rejection of modernity , particularly in art . now a flurry of controversy has arisen over whether the purchase of the painting from the jewish family of the deceased original owner alfred hess in the early years of the third reich by a german art collector may have been forced because of anti-semitism and the price set artificially low .
if so , the work could qualify for restitution . painting returned to hess heir bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirchner 's " group of artists " depicts members of the " die brücke " group in late july , berlin 's senate , which had been in possession of kirchner 's 1913 painting , unexpectedly returned it to hess ' heir in england .
though the move came as a surprise , secret negotiations had been underway for almost two years already . barbara kisseler , berlin 's state secretary of culture told the daily newspaper frankfurt allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- that the masterpiece was returned because it had come to their attention that the hess family had been unfairly treated during the nazi dictatorship . " moral considerations " played a significant role in the decision , she said . shortly after the restitution of the piece was made public , the new york auction house christie 's announced it had purchased the kirchner work and planned to auction it on november 8 . critics claim restitution not legitimate in a joint statement , the ernst ludwig kirchner archive near bern , the brücke museum and the berlin auction house villa grisebach have publicly protested the return of the kirchner painting , claiming it had been legally purchased . they wrote that the berlin senate had been " dilettantish " in dealing with " german museum property . " alfred hess was an avid art collector and successful shoe factory owner , but plunged into insolvency during the global economic crisis in the late 1920 's .
when he died in 1931 his family brought the kirchner work to switzerland . in 1936 or 1937 - the exact date is unknown - the painting was sold to collector carl hagemann in cologne , allegedly for a sum of 3,000 reich marks , and brought to what was then nazi germany . until recently , the legitimacy of the sale had not been questioned . details of sale remain unclear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : debate rages on who should get the " berlin street scene " in the end the berlin senate now contends that carl hagemann 's purchase price was either so low that it took advantage of the anti-semitic policies of the nazi regime , or that the money never made it into their hands at all . " as in many similar cases , the family fortune mainly consisted of works of art , which were sold in order to make a living , " wolfgang henze , art historian and administrator of the ernst ludwig kirchner archive , wrote the berlin senate , as reported by faz .
" fortunately , the hess family managed in time to get their collection abroad . " the open letter from the kirchner archive , the brücke museum and the berlin auction house also pointed out that the hess family sold paintings on a regular basis over an extended period of time , which could indicate they were not coerced into selling the " berlin street scene . " christie 's had a part in the restitution while it has not yet been firmly established if the transaction between carl hagemann and the hess family in the mid-1930s was fair , christie 's speedy acquisition of the painting has raised eyebrows . ludwig von pufendorf , chairmen of the brücke museum board and berlin 's former state culture secretary , told german radio broadcaster deutschlandradio kultur that christie 's financed the entire restitution process . christoph stölzl , another former state culture secretary in berlin and the general director of the german historical museum for over 10 years , told the online news site netzeitung.de : " the kirchner case sets a dangerous precedent for germany 's cultural heritage in the classical modern field . " he added that " the ernst ludwig kirchner archive estimates that the return of 80 to 100 paintings could be demanded " if the restitution of the kirchner piece is not repealed . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a tale of two cities - tokyo and berlin an art exhibition showcases more than a century of german-japanese artistic exchange opened last week at berlin 's national gallery .

it is a hesitation that is fundamentally positive and beneficial as nothing offers better protection from all sorts of the disastrous , overboard patriotism of the past . additionally , germany is interwoven in a thick mesh of international connections that make the country an equal partner in the political landscape .
but this role brings responsibilities with it that the country with europe 's largest population after russia can not avoid . this also applies to the possible and foreseeable deployment of bundeswehr soldiers in lebanon as part of the united nations ' peacekeeping force .
its mission would be to prevent hostilities in southern lebanon by making use of the relevant un resolution .
the positioning of troops and the direct involvement of israel in the conflict mean this would be new territory for germany , since its relationship with israel requires a special course of action due to the effects of history . it is simply intolerable to imagine that a situation could arise in which a german solider could shoot an israeli solider .
the deployment of only the navy to israeli and lebanese waters and a lightly armed police force on the lebanese-syrian border could provide a certain degree of assurance that it does not come to such a confrontation .
legitimate concerns of course , there are also legitimate objections in germany to a german deployment to lebanon .
pragmatic objectionss that point out the bundeswehr 's stretched capabilities , and , more fundamentally , that the middle east has been declared a downright taboo area for german soldiers . a deployment to lebanon does indeed lie within the bundeswehr 's capabilities .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 19.08.2006 kirchner painting at heart of restitution dispute großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this work , not a kirchner , was returned to its owner after being stolen by the nazis when the berlin senate unexpectedly returned a kirchner painting to the heirs of its original jewish owner , critics protested that it 's not a world war ii restitution case .
the work is now awaiting auction at christie 's . two elegant women , brightly dressed , walk along a crowded street .
ernst ludwig kirchner used this scene to capture the german capital in his painting " berlin street scene " from 1913 . this painting is now the object of a fierce restitution dispute involving the berlin state senate , a berlin museum , the ernst-ludwig-kirchner archive and the heirs of the painting 's original jewish owner . it is currently scheduled to go under the hammer at christie 's auction house in new york , where it could bring in between 14 and 19.5 million euros -lrb- $ 18 to 25 million -rrb- .
such a selling price would make it the artist 's most expensive work . kirchner and painting owner rejected by nazis kirchner , a master of german impressionism , created the work in the same year his artist group die brücke broke up .
many big-name impressionists - like emil nolde , edvard munch and henri matisse - were part of the group , whose name " the bridge " symbolized the links its members sought to establish between artistic styles . kirchner and the other members of die brücke were denounced by the nazis after hitler came to power in 1933 because their work conflicted with the party 's rejection of modernity , particularly in art . now a flurry of controversy has arisen over whether the purchase of the painting from the jewish family of the deceased original owner alfred hess in the early years of the third reich by a german art collector may have been forced because of anti-semitism and the price set artificially low .
if so , the work could qualify for restitution . painting returned to hess heir bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirchner 's " group of artists " depicts members of the " die brücke " group in late july , berlin 's senate , which had been in possession of kirchner 's 1913 painting , unexpectedly returned it to hess ' heir in england .
though the move came as a surprise , secret negotiations had been underway for almost two years already . barbara kisseler , berlin 's state secretary of culture told the daily newspaper frankfurt allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- that the masterpiece was returned because it had come to their attention that the hess family had been unfairly treated during the nazi dictatorship . " moral considerations " played a significant role in the decision , she said . shortly after the restitution of the piece was made public , the new york auction house christie 's announced it had purchased the kirchner work and planned to auction it on november 8 . critics claim restitution not legitimate in a joint statement , the ernst ludwig kirchner archive near bern , the brücke museum and the berlin auction house villa grisebach have publicly protested the return of the kirchner painting , claiming it had been legally purchased . they wrote that the berlin senate had been " dilettantish " in dealing with " german museum property . " alfred hess was an avid art collector and successful shoe factory owner , but plunged into insolvency during the global economic crisis in the late 1920 's .
when he died in 1931 his family brought the kirchner work to switzerland . in 1936 or 1937 - the exact date is unknown - the painting was sold to collector carl hagemann in cologne , allegedly for a sum of 3,000 reich marks , and brought to what was then nazi germany . until recently , the legitimacy of the sale had not been questioned . details of sale remain unclear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : debate rages on who should get the " berlin street scene " in the end the berlin senate now contends that carl hagemann 's purchase price was either so low that it took advantage of the anti-semitic policies of the nazi regime , or that the money never made it into their hands at all . " as in many similar cases , the family fortune mainly consisted of works of art , which were sold in order to make a living , " wolfgang henze , art historian and administrator of the ernst ludwig kirchner archive , wrote the berlin senate , as reported by faz .
" fortunately , the hess family managed in time to get their collection abroad .

the work is now awaiting auction at christie 's . two elegant women , brightly dressed , walk along a crowded street .
ernst ludwig kirchner used this scene to capture the german capital in his painting " berlin street scene " from 1913 . this painting is now the object of a fierce restitution dispute involving the berlin state senate , a berlin museum , the ernst-ludwig-kirchner archive and the heirs of the painting 's original jewish owner . it is currently scheduled to go under the hammer at christie 's auction house in new york , where it could bring in between 14 and 19.5 million euros -lrb- $ 18 to 25 million -rrb- .
such a selling price would make it the artist 's most expensive work . kirchner and painting owner rejected by nazis kirchner , a master of german impressionism , created the work in the same year his artist group die brücke broke up .
many big-name impressionists - like emil nolde , edvard munch and henri matisse - were part of the group , whose name " the bridge " symbolized the links its members sought to establish between artistic styles . kirchner and the other members of die brücke were denounced by the nazis after hitler came to power in 1933 because their work conflicted with the party 's rejection of modernity , particularly in art . now a flurry of controversy has arisen over whether the purchase of the painting from the jewish family of the deceased original owner alfred hess in the early years of the third reich by a german art collector may have been forced because of anti-semitism and the price set artificially low .
if so , the work could qualify for restitution . painting returned to hess heir bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirchner 's " group of artists " depicts members of the " die brücke " group in late july , berlin 's senate , which had been in possession of kirchner 's 1913 painting , unexpectedly returned it to hess ' heir in england .

" moral considerations " played a significant role in the decision , she said . shortly after the restitution of the piece was made public , the new york auction house christie 's announced it had purchased the kirchner work and planned to auction it on november 8 . critics claim restitution not legitimate in a joint statement , the ernst ludwig kirchner archive near bern , the brücke museum and the berlin auction house villa grisebach have publicly protested the return of the kirchner painting , claiming it had been legally purchased . they wrote that the berlin senate had been " dilettantish " in dealing with " german museum property . " alfred hess was an avid art collector and successful shoe factory owner , but plunged into insolvency during the global economic crisis in the late 1920 's .
when he died in 1931 his family brought the kirchner work to switzerland . in 1936 or 1937 - the exact date is unknown - the painting was sold to collector carl hagemann in cologne , allegedly for a sum of 3,000 reich marks , and brought to what was then nazi germany . until recently , the legitimacy of the sale had not been questioned . details of sale remain unclear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : debate rages on who should get the " berlin street scene " in the end the berlin senate now contends that carl hagemann 's purchase price was either so low that it took advantage of the anti-semitic policies of the nazi regime , or that the money never made it into their hands at all .

" moral considerations " played a significant role in the decision , she said . shortly after the restitution of the piece was made public , the new york auction house christie 's announced it had purchased the kirchner work and planned to auction it on november 8 . critics claim restitution not legitimate in a joint statement , the ernst ludwig kirchner archive near bern , the brücke museum and the berlin auction house villa grisebach have publicly protested the return of the kirchner painting , claiming it had been legally purchased . they wrote that the berlin senate had been " dilettantish " in dealing with " german museum property . " alfred hess was an avid art collector and successful shoe factory owner , but plunged into insolvency during the global economic crisis in the late 1920 's .
when he died in 1931 his family brought the kirchner work to switzerland . in 1936 or 1937 - the exact date is unknown - the painting was sold to collector carl hagemann in cologne , allegedly for a sum of 3,000 reich marks , and brought to what was then nazi germany . until recently , the legitimacy of the sale had not been questioned . details of sale remain unclear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : debate rages on who should get the " berlin street scene " in the end the berlin senate now contends that carl hagemann 's purchase price was either so low that it took advantage of the anti-semitic policies of the nazi regime , or that the money never made it into their hands at all . " as in many similar cases , the family fortune mainly consisted of works of art , which were sold in order to make a living , " wolfgang henze , art historian and administrator of the ernst ludwig kirchner archive , wrote the berlin senate , as reported by faz .
" fortunately , the hess family managed in time to get their collection abroad . " the open letter from the kirchner archive , the brücke museum and the berlin auction house also pointed out that the hess family sold paintings on a regular basis over an extended period of time , which could indicate they were not coerced into selling the " berlin street scene . " christie 's had a part in the restitution while it has not yet been firmly established if the transaction between carl hagemann and the hess family in the mid-1930s was fair , christie 's speedy acquisition of the painting has raised eyebrows . ludwig von pufendorf , chairmen of the brücke museum board and berlin 's former state culture secretary , told german radio broadcaster deutschlandradio kultur that christie 's financed the entire restitution process . christoph stölzl , another former state culture secretary in berlin and the general director of the german historical museum for over 10 years , told the online news site netzeitung.de : " the kirchner case sets a dangerous precedent for germany 's cultural heritage in the classical modern field . " he added that " the ernst ludwig kirchner archive estimates that the return of 80 to 100 paintings could be demanded " if the restitution of the kirchner piece is not repealed . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a tale of two cities - tokyo and berlin an art exhibition showcases more than a century of german-japanese artistic exchange opened last week at berlin 's national gallery .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 19.08.2006 telekom streamlines as germany 's giant feels the pinch großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche telekom is facing new and serious challenges deutsche telekom has been rocked by recent financial results and the loss of a million fixed-line customers .
the company faces a tough fight in the highly competitve sector - but it 's a fight telekom is prepared for . deutsche telekom is the latest telecommunications company to feel the pressure of intensifying competition in europe .
the german firm , europe 's largest communications group , recently announced a 4 percent fall in half-year profits .
shares in deutsche telekom - which owns t-mobile - nose dived by 11 percent after the announcement earlier in august . the firm says the profit shortfall is due to a poor performance in germany and has pledged to take aggressive action to win back customers .
but will this be enough to halt the company 's slide ? deutsche telekom anticipates its operating profit for the year could be more than a billion euros -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- lower than previously anticipated .
the company said in a statement last week that its bottom-line net profit declined by 14 percent to 1.01 billion euros in the period from april to june , despite a three-percent rise in revenues to 15.13 billion euros . in germany , deutsche telekom 's overall sales have fallen by 4 percent in the past six months .
first half sales of its german mobile arm dropped by 3 percent in the first half of the year and its fixed-line business lost a million customers over that period . cuts in earning and sales forecasts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ricke will reverse the trend of high sales forecasts because of these results , deutsche telekom has been forced to issue a profit warning .
and deutsche telekom 's chairman , kai-uwe ricke , said the company will cut its earnings and sales forecasts for this year and next year . " deutsche telekom is transforming in a telecommunication market , a worldwide telecommunication market , which is ever-changing , " ricke said .
" and this transformation is huge .
it 's a challenge .
it 's a marathon . " ricke said he and his team are ready to take on the challenge .
the company 's strategy is to take a much more aggressive approach to competition in its key domestic markets in the second half of this year . many customers have switched to cheaper phone and internet providers , and deutsche telekom wants to win them back .
ricke said costs and prices will be slashed in order to defend the company 's domestic market share . attack is the best form of defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom 's near-monopoly is under threat " deutsche telekom has to do its homework in the german marketplace , " ricke said .
" that means we must rigorously defend our market share .
it has to do with pricing , it has to do with products , it has to do with service , it has to do with things we have in our pipeline , and what we are going to roll out over the next few weeks . " that means offering simpler packages with lower prices .
for example , new bundled offers from t-mobile in germany will soon cost less than 10 euro cents per minute , regardless of which network people call . deutsche telekom has also started marketing a merged fixed-line and mobile service to try to stop people canceling their deutsche telekom traditional phone lines . the company also plans to invest differently to increase its cash flow .
and it will spend an extra 1.2 billion euros on marketing and products this year .
that 's in addition to a 3-billion-euro investment in a fiber-optic network to broadcast live tv programs , such as germany 's bundesliga soccer league matches , over the internet .
ricke is hopeful that all this will stave off competition from vodafone and other competitors . foreign stability remains key deutsche telekom 's international business units have been more successful than its domestic market and are solely responsible for the company 's sales growth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : t-mobile is proving popular in the uk t-mobile in the uk , for example , added more than 360 thousand subscribers over the second quarter .
and revenues generated outside of germany have risen by a total of 4 percent to 3.6 billion euros . but telecommunications analyst ovum said deutsche telekom has underestimated its competition for too long , that it ca n't hide behind its overseas growth now , and that there 's certainly no " quick fix " for its domestic problems . so is this program of price cuts and innovations coming too late ?
and will competitors such as vodafone follow suit ?
it may well signify the beginning of a telecommunications price war in germany - which for customers at least , would be great news . laura stevens -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche telekom changes strategy after customer exodus deutsche telekom , europe 's biggest telecommunications group , has dramatically lost net income and customers to competitors in germany .

" the norwegians have spent equipment to fight the oil spill at sea , " she said .
" the pumping and cleaning has begun . " officials said they believed about 80 percent of the oil is on the coastline , 20 percent has evaporated and less than one percent is at sea . though an exact timetable can not be set due to the precarious ceasefire in the region , a un action plan envisions about 300 people working at 30 cleaning sites that would deal with the waste by either burning it in refineries or possibly using some in public works such as road construction . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no german combat troops on lebanese soil but navy will go the german government has ruled out sending ground troops equipped for combat as part of a peacekeeping force in south lebanon , german chancellor angela merkel announced late thursday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 19.08.2006 telekom streamlines as germany 's giant feels the pinch großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche telekom is facing new and serious challenges deutsche telekom has been rocked by recent financial results and the loss of a million fixed-line customers .
the company faces a tough fight in the highly competitve sector - but it 's a fight telekom is prepared for . deutsche telekom is the latest telecommunications company to feel the pressure of intensifying competition in europe .
the german firm , europe 's largest communications group , recently announced a 4 percent fall in half-year profits .
shares in deutsche telekom - which owns t-mobile - nose dived by 11 percent after the announcement earlier in august . the firm says the profit shortfall is due to a poor performance in germany and has pledged to take aggressive action to win back customers .
but will this be enough to halt the company 's slide ? deutsche telekom anticipates its operating profit for the year could be more than a billion euros -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- lower than previously anticipated .
the company said in a statement last week that its bottom-line net profit declined by 14 percent to 1.01 billion euros in the period from april to june , despite a three-percent rise in revenues to 15.13 billion euros . in germany , deutsche telekom 's overall sales have fallen by 4 percent in the past six months .
first half sales of its german mobile arm dropped by 3 percent in the first half of the year and its fixed-line business lost a million customers over that period . cuts in earning and sales forecasts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ricke will reverse the trend of high sales forecasts because of these results , deutsche telekom has been forced to issue a profit warning .
and deutsche telekom 's chairman , kai-uwe ricke , said the company will cut its earnings and sales forecasts for this year and next year . " deutsche telekom is transforming in a telecommunication market , a worldwide telecommunication market , which is ever-changing , " ricke said .
" and this transformation is huge .
it 's a challenge .
it 's a marathon . " ricke said he and his team are ready to take on the challenge .
the company 's strategy is to take a much more aggressive approach to competition in its key domestic markets in the second half of this year . many customers have switched to cheaper phone and internet providers , and deutsche telekom wants to win them back .
ricke said costs and prices will be slashed in order to defend the company 's domestic market share . attack is the best form of defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom 's near-monopoly is under threat " deutsche telekom has to do its homework in the german marketplace , " ricke said .
" that means we must rigorously defend our market share .
it has to do with pricing , it has to do with products , it has to do with service , it has to do with things we have in our pipeline , and what we are going to roll out over the next few weeks . " that means offering simpler packages with lower prices .
for example , new bundled offers from t-mobile in germany will soon cost less than 10 euro cents per minute , regardless of which network people call . deutsche telekom has also started marketing a merged fixed-line and mobile service to try to stop people canceling their deutsche telekom traditional phone lines . the company also plans to invest differently to increase its cash flow .
and it will spend an extra 1.2 billion euros on marketing and products this year .
that 's in addition to a 3-billion-euro investment in a fiber-optic network to broadcast live tv programs , such as germany 's bundesliga soccer league matches , over the internet .
ricke is hopeful that all this will stave off competition from vodafone and other competitors . foreign stability remains key deutsche telekom 's international business units have been more successful than its domestic market and are solely responsible for the company 's sales growth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : t-mobile is proving popular in the uk t-mobile in the uk , for example , added more than 360 thousand subscribers over the second quarter .
and revenues generated outside of germany have risen by a total of 4 percent to 3.6 billion euros . but telecommunications analyst ovum said deutsche telekom has underestimated its competition for too long , that it ca n't hide behind its overseas growth now , and that there 's certainly no " quick fix " for its domestic problems . so is this program of price cuts and innovations coming too late ?
and will competitors such as vodafone follow suit ?
it may well signify the beginning of a telecommunications price war in germany - which for customers at least , would be great news . laura stevens -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche telekom changes strategy after customer exodus deutsche telekom , europe 's biggest telecommunications group , has dramatically lost net income and customers to competitors in germany .
foreign business , however , is up .
-lrb- aug .
11 , 2006 -rrb- bundesliga to help kick internet-tv into the future media experts in germany are predicting that the start of the new bundesliga season on friday will herald a breakthrough in internet-tv , thanks to deutsche telekom 's deal to broadcast the games online .
-lrb- aug .
9 , 2006 -rrb- eu urges german regulator to step up telecoms competition the european commission has told germany that it must do more to shield consumers from high prices and bolster competition in the country 's fixed-line telecoms market , in which deutsche telekom has a 94 percent share .

deputy secretary general mark malloch brown thanked asian nations for their firm commitment but added the force had to be " multilateral " in character .
the call came after israel said it might be " inconceivable " to accept nations that denied its right to exist , such as malaysia and indonesia .
a 15,000-strong un force is planned to police the truce in southern lebanon .
under the terms of the un ceasefire resolution which ended the month-long conflict between israel and hezbollah , the expanded un force should work alongside about 15,000 lebanese troops to keep the peace .
france has agreed to lead the force if its mandate concerns are but its immediate pledge of only 200 extra troops is far smaller than expected .
" there 's been different signals coming out of france , " us president george w bush said .
" we hope they send more . "
two senior un envoys , vijay nambiar and terje roed-larsen , have arrived in beirut for talks on how the un-brokered truce is being implemented .
heavy israeli air activity over hezbollah 's bekaa valley heartland early on saturday has been reported by lebanese sources .
it was not immediately clear if any air strikes had been made .
' prudent ' force mr malloch brown said the commitment of troops by indonesia , malaysia , bangladesh and nepal among others was " enormously helpful and a major contribution " .
un troop pledges france - leadership and 200 troops bangladesh - two battalions -lrb- up to 2,000 troops -rrb- malaysia - one battalion -lrb- up to 1,000 troops -rrb- indonesia - one battalion , an engineering company nepal - one battalion denmark - at least two ships germany - maritime and border patrols sources : un diplomats but he said the force should have a " multilateral character so that it enjoys the confidence of both sides " .
french defence minister michele alliot-marie warned that soldiers could not be told : " look what 's going on but you do n't have the right to defend yourself or to shoot " .
mr malloch brown said the new force would not be " offensive " , nor would it be asked to " attempt large-scale disarmament " .
" rather it is going to police the political agreement which triggers disarmament called for under the resolution , " he said .
use of force would only be exercised if combatants forcefully resisted a demand to disarm , mr malloch brown said .
a 3,500-strong vanguard is planned to be in place in the next 10 days .
european powers have so far been reluctant to sign up but italy on friday confirmed it was approving sending troops to lebanon .
germany has offered a maritime task force .
the uk and the us say they will provide logistical support .
israeli un envoy dan gillerman said earlier it would be " difficult if not inconceivable " to accept nations that did not recognise israel 's right to exist .
mr gillerman said israel would be " very happy " to accept troops from muslim countries they have friendly relations with .
israel says it has now withdrawn from two-thirds of its positions in southern lebanon , including the port city of tyre and villages of qana , hadatha and beit yahoun .
refugees return lebanese troops have reached the southern border with israel - a vehicle carrying a lebanese flag made a symbolic pass a few metres from the border at kfar kila .
the un says 400,000 people have returned to homes in the south and in the heavily bombed southern suburbs of beirut .
lebanese president emile lahoud has praised what he called the victory of hezbollah against israel in a televised address to the nation .
he said he saluted hezbollah leader sheikh hassan nasrallah " who willed this victory to be a victory for all lebanese and all the arab peoples " .
at his presidential retreat in camp david , mr bush again condemned hezbollah as a " force of instability " .
" sometimes it takes people awhile to come to the sober realisation of what forces create stability and what do n't , " he said .

a 15,000-strong un force is planned to police the truce in southern lebanon .
under the terms of the un ceasefire resolution which ended the month-long conflict between israel and hezbollah , the expanded un force should work alongside about 15,000 lebanese troops to keep the peace .
france has agreed to lead the force if its mandate concerns are but its immediate pledge of only 200 extra troops is far smaller than expected .

french defence minister michele alliot-marie warned that soldiers could not be told : " look what 's going on but you do n't have the right to defend yourself or to shoot " .
mr malloch brown said the new force would not be " offensive " , nor would it be asked to " attempt large-scale disarmament " .
" rather it is going to police the political agreement which triggers disarmament called for under the resolution , " he said .
use of force would only be exercised if combatants forcefully resisted a demand to disarm , mr malloch brown said .

deputy secretary general mark malloch brown thanked asian nations for their firm commitment but added the force had to be " multilateral " in character .
the call came after israel said it might be " inconceivable " to accept nations that denied its right to exist , such as malaysia and indonesia .
a 15,000-strong un force is planned to police the truce in southern lebanon .
under the terms of the un ceasefire resolution which ended the month-long conflict between israel and hezbollah , the expanded un force should work alongside about 15,000 lebanese troops to keep the peace .
france has agreed to lead the force if its mandate concerns are but its immediate pledge of only 200 extra troops is far smaller than expected .
" there 's been different signals coming out of france , " us president george w bush said .
" we hope they send more . "
two senior un envoys , vijay nambiar and terje roed-larsen , have arrived in beirut for talks on how the un-brokered truce is being implemented .

french defence minister michele alliot-marie warned that soldiers could not be told : " look what 's going on but you do n't have the right to defend yourself or to shoot " .
mr malloch brown said the new force would not be " offensive " , nor would it be asked to " attempt large-scale disarmament " .
" rather it is going to police the political agreement which triggers disarmament called for under the resolution , " he said .
use of force would only be exercised if combatants forcefully resisted a demand to disarm , mr malloch brown said .

lg blamed falling prices and rising costs for the closure of the plant , which assembles computer monitors .
when lg announced it was setting up two factories on the site 10 years ago , it was hailed as the largest single inward investment in europe .
but economist brian morgan said the project was " doomed from the start " . "
it 's been on its death bed for the last five years " brian morgan , cardiff business school in july 1996 lg promised to create 6,100 jobs directly on the site , with thousands more in related industries .
but while the electronics factory went into operation , the neighbouring semiconductor plant remained empty .
in 2003 , production of colour tubes for monitors and televisions closed with 870 job losses .
lg continued to assemble computer monitors on the site , but announced on friday that production would cease at the end of 2006 .
enterprise minister andrew davies said he was " disappointed " by the announcement , but the welsh assembly government would work to " find new alternative and quality employment opportunities for those affected by this decision " .
plaid cymru am jocelyn davies called for a " comprehensive package of retraining and advice to those affected " .
she added : " we need more stable jobs based on investment in small local firms " . "
there have been jobs , there will be jobs in the future .
this is a magnificent plant and a wonderful site " conservative william graham liberal democrat kirsty williams said : " it is another knock to manufacturing in wales , at a time when unemployment figures are starting to head in the wrong direction " .
conservative william graham said : " there have been jobs , there will be jobs in the future .
this is a magnificent plant and a wonderful site .
it 's a question of identifying the right manufacturer to take it " .
unions representing workers at the plant also expressed their disappointment .
amicus regional secretary for wales cath speight said : " this is the second time lg have closed sites , which is devastating for the people involved and their families who know that the redundancies will take place just before christmas . "
' learning curve ' the original investment by lg in south wales was secured with the help of more than £ 87m in grant money .
the company has since repaid £ 34m .
brian morgan , of cardiff business school , chief economist for inward investment body the welsh development agency when the factory was set up , said the project was " a big learning curve for everyone involved " .
he said : " it was the last big inward investment of its type and it was an investment too far .
" the whole thing was supposed to be the jewel in the crown but it was under pressure from the time it was set up .
" the initial plan was far too ambitious .
it was doomed from the start . "
mr morgan said the project " never got off the ground " when the whole site failed to open .
he added : " the writing was on the wall when the semiconductor plant did n't take off .
" electronics was declining in wales at the time and sony and hitachi were under pressure here .
" it seemed as if production could have lasted 10 or 20 years , but we could n't have predicted china or eastern europe coming out of the blocks so quickly .

householders from aston on deeside had their say on the a494 development between ewloe and queensferry .
councillor george hardcastle said residents were worried about noise , pollution and traffic dangers .
work on improving the trunk road , a link between the a55 , the m56 and the m53 , is expected to start next august .
four lanes will be created for traffic travelling towards ewloe with three in the opposite direction and hard shoulders will be created on both carriageways .
mr hardcastle , said : " there 's particular concern that once this scheme is completed , the speed limit will go up from 50 mph to 70 mph .
residents are worried over noise and pollution issue , says councillor " there 've been countless accidents on this stretch of road and we do n't want the situation to get worse .
" you do n't need to improve the road .
one of the main concerns was vehicles breaking down .
all they needed was a drag lane -lsb- hard shoulder -rsb- to let the traffic continue .
" all they 're doing now is pushing the bottleneck further field .
they could have spent the money elsewhere . "
he said residents were also opposing plans to build a feeder road and provide a new subway , which they feared would become a haven for drugs users and troublemakers .
the multi-million pound scheme will involve demolishing a number of homes which were bought by the authorities when the plans were drawn up 14 years ago .

tgwu negotiators are included because they also represent staff involved in the dispute at stansted airport .
' public suffered enough ' the gmb union has predicted that flights at the airport would be " severely disrupted " if the 500 workers walked out .
on saturday , gary pearce , gmb organiser , said : " gmb hopes that swissport are serious about this meeting and have prepared a suitable and acceptable pay offer that will settle the dispute .
" if not then the two days of strike action will unfortunately go ahead as scheduled . "
a swissport spokesman said on friday : " swissport as a responsible organisation believes that the travelling public have faced enough disruption and suffered enough difficulty throughout the past week with the security threats .
" they have therefore called on the unions to join them at acas , to try and find a quick and agreeable resolution to this dispute . "
the gmb said it submitted a pay claim in april , including calls for a premium rate for sunday working in addition to a " substantial " pay review .
the union said swissport had not met the claim for sunday premiums and the pay offer they had put on the table included " unacceptable " strings attached .
