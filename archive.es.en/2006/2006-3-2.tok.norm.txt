on wednesday , the european commission warned it expected results by the end of 2007 . germany 's public deficit has breached the eu 's limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product since 2002 .
last year , berlin convinced its eu partners to freeze excessive deficit procedures - including financial penalties - against it , following a long struggle with brussels . now though , the european commission has warned germany that it has until the end of 2007 to reduce its budget deficit , or face the possibility of sanctions . the german finance ministry was quick to respond , saying it planned to meet the eu requirement to bring its deficit below the 3 percent level specified in the stability and growth pact . " germany will achieve an underlying structural deficit improvement of about 1 percentage point in the next two years , thus meeting the commission 's guidelines , " the ministry said in a statement . the ministry added that it would release a 2007 draft budget in july that will show its ability to meet the eu deficit limits . the commission , which polices member states ' public finances , said that germany was set to breach the limit again this year but welcomed belt-tightening measures to bring it below the threshold next year . " although the -lrb- european -rrb- commission welcomes the renewed priority attached by the german government to budgetary consolidation , it is clear that the procedure needs to be stepped up to guarantee a lasting correction of the deficit , " economic affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said . huge fi n es in theory , berlin could face huge fines if it fails to rein in its deficit although that would be unlikely if the government sticks to its promises to improve the public accounts . german finance minister peer steinbrück supported the commission 's action , which he saw as boosting the credibility of the eu 's public finances pact . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister peer steinbrück supported the commission 's action " for germany , it is of the highest importance that the credibility of the stability and growth pact be protected in the long-term , " he said in a statement .
" that is why the government agrees with the eu decision . " berlin and paris , whose deficit has also breached eu limits for years , won a formal suspension of disciplinary measures against them at the beginning of last year . damage to stability pact suspension of the measures came only after a lengthy battle with brussels which resulted in the eu rewriting the public finances pact last year and , in effect , watering it down . " after the revision last year , i think from the political point of view the commission and the ministers have learned a lot about the importance of establishing good dialogue channels to avoid these kinds of conflicts , " almunia said . in a recent review of french public finances , paris was let off the hook for further measures on account of efforts to cut its deficit . germany , worried that other euro members would be less disciplined about their public finances , was the main author behind the fiscal rulebook when it was drawn up in 1997 . the revision of the pact was met with scorn from many private and even some public economists , who believed that it no longer had any credibility because member states would have too much leeway to avoid disciplinary measures . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu commission to supervise german spending germany 's new finance minister peer steinbrück is making waves by suggesting an unusual way of avoiding eu sanctions which brussels could impose over berlin 's non-compliance with the stability pact .

producers say the outlook for 2006 is good , citing rising demand and increased investment . the german gas and oil industry is small , but german gas production in particular makes up a significant chunk of the country 's energy supply . with sales on the rise in 2005 , german oil and gas producers pumped money into investment .
the federation of the german gas and oil industry , or weg , said at its annual press conference that german energy firms boosted investment by more than a third last year , to approximately 1.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : limited resources mean gas will remain expensive , although stable georg schöning , head of german energy and water company rwe dea ag is also head of the weg .
he chalked the good results up to the world 's seemingly unquenchable thirst for oil , especially in china . " we saw already a year ago , that huge demand exists in china .
it was admittedly slightly lower in 2004 , but in general , global demand has kept growing . " industry expects price stability the oil and gas companies and their subcontractors are counting on continued strong demand for oil .
although high demand has led to sharp oil and gas price increases in the past , the weg predicts this trend is waning . the weg also said it expects less price fluctuation than in the last year , although no price decrease is expected .
this is mainly a question of supply and demand : in the short term , output can not be increased . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rwe headquarters in essen , germany " we 've seen global demand grow in the last couple of years and we have to say that the possibility of increasing output further is limited .
that means … extremely limited availability of extra supplies , " schöning said no one at the weg is keen to talk about a future when oil reserves run out .
they stress , instead , the projection that currently known oil reserves will last for another 50 years , and gas reserves should last another 60 years . political stability is key " the oil and gas reserves are predominantly located in the middle- and far east .
that means areas that we , as a western industry , do n't always have easy access to -lrb- the reserves -rrb- , neither do we have any influence on these countries ' political stability , " schöning said . this supply could be damaged by political instability , such as recent developments in nigeria , where local regions have been fighting over their share of oil wealth .
german oil producers hope transparency is the answer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a refinery in the state of sachsen anhalt schöning said his company rwe is an example .
" our activities in egypt … are clearly regulated through production-sharing agreements .
that means contractual agreements exist with the countries stating exactly what is due to the state and what belongs to the oil companies . " despite the turbulence in world markets and increasing tensions in the major oil-producing nations , weg claims germany 's oil supply is secure .
the fact that the country produces even a fraction of its own oil supply adds an element of stability , schöning said . germany cites balanced supply " here in germany , we have a fairly balanced supply structure .
this applies to both the oil and gas markets , " said schöning .
" if we take the uk as an example , we can see that local oil production will in the future no longer be possible , and they 'll have to rely on the global market for all their energy needs .
this in turn means that price volatility is likely to increase . " one fifth of germany 's gas supply comes from national sources , although its gas production has been decreasing for several years .
moreover , technologically , it is becoming increasingly difficult for germany to exploit its own gas resources in an economically viable manner . schöning discounted the effects political conflicts could have on energy supplies , saying , " i 'm really not that greatly concerned about oil supplies for europe as a whole , as the past has proven .

why are germany 's immigrants so reluctant to become cops ? it may be a magnet for foreigners and home to people from over 180 countries as its tourism officials love to point out .
but walk into a public administrative building in berlin and chances are you 'll be hard pressed to find any sign of its ethnic diversity among the employees . less than 2 percent of its ethnic minorities are estimated to work in the public service sector despite making up 13 percent of berlin 's 3-million-strong population .
studies show the pattern is reflected across all of germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish police officer aspirants try out some police gear in berlin now , one institution has decided to turn the tide .
the berlin police force wants to try to fill in some 10 percent of the 200 new recruits they accept this year with ethnic minorities , particularly those who speak fluent turkish , arabic , polish , serbo-croatian and russian . " berlin is a multicultural city and the police force certainly does n't reflect that , " said rainer gerlach , head of the personnel department of the berlin police .
" officers from ethnic minorities are n't just valuable when it comes to overcoming language barriers ; they bring in a whole new dimension of sensitivity towards other cultures . " uphill task but recruiting ethnic minority police officers may be easier said than done . ever since the early 1990s , following a tweaking of the law to pave the way for non-germans in the police force , successive german states including berlin have tried poster campaigns , information seminars , informal chats and television ads among other things to lure immigrants into their police forces - without success . ethnic minorities still make up only around 1 percent of the entire german police force , according to rafael behr , a former police officer in the state of hesse and sociologist and author . " in some eastern states like saxony and thuringia , they 're almost non-existent , " he said . educatio n the biggest stumbli n g block bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's police force has a tough time finding ethnic minority officers so why does germany have such few ethnic minorities in the police force at a time when their presence there would largely be seen as asserting multicultural credentials and being more representative of the country 's racial mix ? the most frequently cited reason is that immigrants simply do n't pass the grueling police entrance tests which require high fitness levels as well as a good high school degree . " the entry bar is very high in germany , " behr said .
" that 's where most immigrants who are neither fluent in german nor in their own mother tongue stumble .
and those who are well educated do n't go to the police but go on to study law , medicine or engineering . " in addition , it 's not always easy for an immigrant to choose to be a cop - a profession that 's often treated with high levels of mistrust by families and friends who have bad memories of the police from the countries they come from . " it 's amazing for instance what some officers of turkish origin have to go through when they are on patrol , " said klaus eisenreich , head of the police union in berlin .
" they 're often labeled as ' traitors ' by their own communities . " " psychological barriers " omid nouripour , an iranian-german green party parliamentarian said there are deeper reasons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish soccer fans in kreuzberg , berlin " the psychological barriers between the locals and the new-locals are simply too high in this country , " said nouripour , adding he did n't believe the police had done enough to make the profession more attractive to ethnic minorities . " it 's not easy for immigrants to gain access to resources , " he said .
" even in the public service , you have to have a german passport to become a civil servant . " other cou n tries ahead , but with ow n problems even as germany wrings its hands over the issue , a look beyond its borders shows that other countries seem to be miles ahead . britain 's metropolitan police has doubled the proportion of ethnic minority officers since 1998 - they currently make up some 11 percent of the force - and even holland has considerably hiked the number in its police force . but experts caution that both have managed to do so by following an indirect policy of " positive discrimination " or affirmative action - something that 's taboo in germany . " in holland , for instance , new recruits do n't have to be fluent in dutch ; they 're encouraged to learn the language during training , " behr said , adding that such concessions often led to negative fallouts . " officers within the force end up being treated as second-class citizens , " he said , adding that holland had a discrimination problem within its ranks and even britain had an entire labor union for black officers . on the other hand , germany 's rigidly standardized entry requirements for the police force has ended up keeping ethnic minorities away while ensuring it 's not plagued by discrimination and foul play . " the few ethnic minorities we have in the force are thus 99 percent identical to their german counterparts , " behr said .
" the only difference is that an officer might have a turkish surname . " melti n g of borders though there may be no relief in the short time , in the long run reservations about modifying entry rules for immigrants might just become superfluous . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch and german police during a mock riot-control operation last year " the functions of the police are already gradually transcending national borders , " said behr , pointing to last year 's bilateral cooperation between germany and holland when german police accompanied some known soccer hooligans to holland .

why are germany 's immigrants so reluctant to become cops ? it may be a magnet for foreigners and home to people from over 180 countries as its tourism officials love to point out .
but walk into a public administrative building in berlin and chances are you 'll be hard pressed to find any sign of its ethnic diversity among the employees . less than 2 percent of its ethnic minorities are estimated to work in the public service sector despite making up 13 percent of berlin 's 3-million-strong population .
studies show the pattern is reflected across all of germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish police officer aspirants try out some police gear in berlin now , one institution has decided to turn the tide .
the berlin police force wants to try to fill in some 10 percent of the 200 new recruits they accept this year with ethnic minorities , particularly those who speak fluent turkish , arabic , polish , serbo-croatian and russian . " berlin is a multicultural city and the police force certainly does n't reflect that , " said rainer gerlach , head of the personnel department of the berlin police .
" officers from ethnic minorities are n't just valuable when it comes to overcoming language barriers ; they bring in a whole new dimension of sensitivity towards other cultures . " uphill task but recruiting ethnic minority police officers may be easier said than done . ever since the early 1990s , following a tweaking of the law to pave the way for non-germans in the police force , successive german states including berlin have tried poster campaigns , information seminars , informal chats and television ads among other things to lure immigrants into their police forces - without success . ethnic minorities still make up only around 1 percent of the entire german police force , according to rafael behr , a former police officer in the state of hesse and sociologist and author . " in some eastern states like saxony and thuringia , they 're almost non-existent , " he said . educatio n the biggest stumbli n g block bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's police force has a tough time finding ethnic minority officers so why does germany have such few ethnic minorities in the police force at a time when their presence there would largely be seen as asserting multicultural credentials and being more representative of the country 's racial mix ? the most frequently cited reason is that immigrants simply do n't pass the grueling police entrance tests which require high fitness levels as well as a good high school degree . " the entry bar is very high in germany , " behr said .
" that 's where most immigrants who are neither fluent in german nor in their own mother tongue stumble .
and those who are well educated do n't go to the police but go on to study law , medicine or engineering . " in addition , it 's not always easy for an immigrant to choose to be a cop - a profession that 's often treated with high levels of mistrust by families and friends who have bad memories of the police from the countries they come from .

producers say the outlook for 2006 is good , citing rising demand and increased investment . the german gas and oil industry is small , but german gas production in particular makes up a significant chunk of the country 's energy supply . with sales on the rise in 2005 , german oil and gas producers pumped money into investment .
the federation of the german gas and oil industry , or weg , said at its annual press conference that german energy firms boosted investment by more than a third last year , to approximately 1.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : limited resources mean gas will remain expensive , although stable georg schöning , head of german energy and water company rwe dea ag is also head of the weg .
he chalked the good results up to the world 's seemingly unquenchable thirst for oil , especially in china . " we saw already a year ago , that huge demand exists in china .
it was admittedly slightly lower in 2004 , but in general , global demand has kept growing . " industry expects price stability the oil and gas companies and their subcontractors are counting on continued strong demand for oil .
although high demand has led to sharp oil and gas price increases in the past , the weg predicts this trend is waning . the weg also said it expects less price fluctuation than in the last year , although no price decrease is expected .
this is mainly a question of supply and demand : in the short term , output can not be increased . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rwe headquarters in essen , germany " we 've seen global demand grow in the last couple of years and we have to say that the possibility of increasing output further is limited .
that means … extremely limited availability of extra supplies , " schöning said no one at the weg is keen to talk about a future when oil reserves run out .
they stress , instead , the projection that currently known oil reserves will last for another 50 years , and gas reserves should last another 60 years . political stability is key " the oil and gas reserves are predominantly located in the middle- and far east .
that means areas that we , as a western industry , do n't always have easy access to -lrb- the reserves -rrb- , neither do we have any influence on these countries ' political stability , " schöning said . this supply could be damaged by political instability , such as recent developments in nigeria , where local regions have been fighting over their share of oil wealth .
german oil producers hope transparency is the answer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a refinery in the state of sachsen anhalt schöning said his company rwe is an example .
" our activities in egypt … are clearly regulated through production-sharing agreements .
that means contractual agreements exist with the countries stating exactly what is due to the state and what belongs to the oil companies . " despite the turbulence in world markets and increasing tensions in the major oil-producing nations , weg claims germany 's oil supply is secure .
the fact that the country produces even a fraction of its own oil supply adds an element of stability , schöning said . germany cites balanced supply " here in germany , we have a fairly balanced supply structure .
this applies to both the oil and gas markets , " said schöning .
" if we take the uk as an example , we can see that local oil production will in the future no longer be possible , and they 'll have to rely on the global market for all their energy needs .
this in turn means that price volatility is likely to increase . " one fifth of germany 's gas supply comes from national sources , although its gas production has been decreasing for several years .
moreover , technologically , it is becoming increasingly difficult for germany to exploit its own gas resources in an economically viable manner . schöning discounted the effects political conflicts could have on energy supplies , saying , " i 'm really not that greatly concerned about oil supplies for europe as a whole , as the past has proven .
none of the political conflicts we 've experienced have threatened supplies to any great extent .

" if we take the uk as an example , we can see that local oil production will in the future no longer be possible , and they 'll have to rely on the global market for all their energy needs .
this in turn means that price volatility is likely to increase . " one fifth of germany 's gas supply comes from national sources , although its gas production has been decreasing for several years .
moreover , technologically , it is becoming increasingly difficult for germany to exploit its own gas resources in an economically viable manner . schöning discounted the effects political conflicts could have on energy supplies , saying , " i 'm really not that greatly concerned about oil supplies for europe as a whole , as the past has proven .
none of the political conflicts we 've experienced have threatened supplies to any great extent .

drawing on a classified bundestag report , the " new york times " reported thursday that german spies helped the us military invasion of iraq in an intelligence-sharing deal approved by top german officials . the intelligence sharing deal , which ended when the invasion came to an end , flies in the face of official german opposition to the war and is contained in a classified report by the german parliament , the bundestag , a copy of which was obtained by the newspaper . it also follows strong denials from berlin and the pentagon that german intelligence -lrb- bnd -rrb- had provided a copy of iraq 's war plans to the us military months before the us invasion , as the new york times reported monday . a scoop - or rehashed news ? the german parliamentary committee report , on which the times based its story , was issued after a series of recent , closed-door hearings on the role of german intelligence during the iraq war .
parts of the report were made available to the public , but several key references defined as classified were left out . the german media has not , for example , had access to certain information deemed sensitive by the bnd - such as the existence of a german intelligence officer in franks ' office , because , according to the report , this information overlaps with the espionage activities of another country , in this case the us . it was n't until the newspaper published its report that many more of the details became known . nonetheless , the claims are being downplayed in germany . according to social democratic parliamentarian olaf scholz , the article reveals nothing new .

" the german report , said the times , made clear that the intelligence-sharing arrangement was approved in late 2002 at the highest levels of the german government , including frank-walter steinmeier , the chief of staff for gerhard schröder , then the german chancellor , and by the foreign minister at the time , joschka fischer .

drawing on a classified bundestag report , the " new york times " reported thursday that german spies helped the us military invasion of iraq in an intelligence-sharing deal approved by top german officials . the intelligence sharing deal , which ended when the invasion came to an end , flies in the face of official german opposition to the war and is contained in a classified report by the german parliament , the bundestag , a copy of which was obtained by the newspaper . it also follows strong denials from berlin and the pentagon that german intelligence -lrb- bnd -rrb- had provided a copy of iraq 's war plans to the us military months before the us invasion , as the new york times reported monday . a scoop - or rehashed news ? the german parliamentary committee report , on which the times based its story , was issued after a series of recent , closed-door hearings on the role of german intelligence during the iraq war .
parts of the report were made available to the public , but several key references defined as classified were left out . the german media has not , for example , had access to certain information deemed sensitive by the bnd - such as the existence of a german intelligence officer in franks ' office , because , according to the report , this information overlaps with the espionage activities of another country , in this case the us . it was n't until the newspaper published its report that many more of the details became known . nonetheless , the claims are being downplayed in germany . according to social democratic parliamentarian olaf scholz , the article reveals nothing new .

" the german report , said the times , made clear that the intelligence-sharing arrangement was approved in late 2002 at the highest levels of the german government , including frank-walter steinmeier , the chief of staff for gerhard schröder , then the german chancellor , and by the foreign minister at the time , joschka fischer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 02.03.2006 public sector strikes widen across germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rubbish has been piling up in several states since the strikes began the biggest public sector strike to hit germany in 14 years escalated after talks broke down between unions and local authorities in a southwestern state and services union verdi warned of a long-drawn out conflict . hopes for a quick nationwide settlement were shattered as the giant services union verdi broke off negotiations late on wednesday in baden-württemberg , one of nine states where public services strikes have been going on for weeks . verdi rejected an offer by local authority employers of a 39.7 hour working week .
speaking in stuttgart , verdi 's alfred wohlfart said there was no way the deal could have worked . " the gentlemen have entrenched themselves , they have put their ideological goals before the goal of giving people a perspective , " wohlfart said .
he urged the populace to understand the reasons behind the crippling strikes , saying verdi was battling against moves by employers that would further worsen mass unemployment . first major strike i n 14 years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the strikes have met an overwhelming response among public sector employees the strikes , which began in early february this year , have been over employers ' plans to extend the working week from 38.5 hours to 40 hours without any additional pay and against proposals to cut christmas bonuses in half . trade unions fear this will lead to further job cuts .
verdi is demanding 38.8 hours for the 220,000-strong workforce . the strike is the first major one in the sector for 14 years and the unions have warned they have sufficient funds to sustain a long , drawn-out conflict .
verdi estimates that around 24,000 employees had joined the walkouts so far . about 4.7 million people are employed in germany 's public sector . employers co n sider privatizatio n on thursday however the employers ' side indicated they might up the stakes in the dispute by considering privatization of services . " naturally one of the consequences would be , that there will be more privatization , " hartmut möllring , the chairman of the wage negotiating committee of the federal states and a conservative politician , said in a radio interview .
" that 's not a threat , rather a fact . " möllring , who is also the finance minister in the state of lower saxony , said the population would realize that privatization would mean that the garbage would be collected and kindergartens would remain open . esse n tial services crippled the wave of strikes have in particular affected local administration , hospitals , kindergartens and garbage services in europe 's largest economy , with rubbish left piling up in the streets in some places . verdi has now vowed to step up its action in baden-württemberg , with longer and wider work stoppages .
it has called upon 9,000 to 10,000 employees to join walkouts on thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scenes such as these have become commonplace in some cities the move spells further bad news for the state 's residents who are already grappling with mountains of piled up rubbish on the streets and making alternative arrangements to care for their kids after the kindergartens have remained shut for weeks . the negotiator for the local authority employers ' side , gerhard widder , called it a black day for the public services sector , saying the strikes were conducted at the expense of the people 's needs . " the result is that the people in our cities will have to continue to endure the strike , " widder said . compromise i n hamburg however , in the northern city of hamburg , a compromise was found under a complicated formula depending on the pay grade , age and family situation of the respective employees . top negotiator for the local public employers in hamburg , volkmar schön welcomed the deal . " you will see that we have created the working hour plan with three elements , and all of these elements have a social character , " he said . under the accord , the average working week would be increased to 39 hours - but not for everyone .
while young single and well paid employees may have to work 40 hours , older employees or those with young children may in fact find that their working week is even reduced . but , the deal is unlikely to serve as a model for other federal states . elsewhere in germany , employees in the northern city of bremen joined the strike for the first time with 1,000 workers in 70 kindergartens not showing up for work . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans look to talks amid drawn-out strike germany 's ongoing civil service strike could have widespread repercussions for unions .

on wednesday , the european commission warned it expected results by the end of 2007 . germany 's public deficit has breached the eu 's limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product since 2002 .

producers say the outlook for 2006 is good , citing rising demand and increased investment . the german gas and oil industry is small , but german gas production in particular makes up a significant chunk of the country 's energy supply . with sales on the rise in 2005 , german oil and gas producers pumped money into investment .
the federation of the german gas and oil industry , or weg , said at its annual press conference that german energy firms boosted investment by more than a third last year , to approximately 1.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : limited resources mean gas will remain expensive , although stable georg schöning , head of german energy and water company rwe dea ag is also head of the weg .
he chalked the good results up to the world 's seemingly unquenchable thirst for oil , especially in china . " we saw already a year ago , that huge demand exists in china .
it was admittedly slightly lower in 2004 , but in general , global demand has kept growing . " industry expects price stability the oil and gas companies and their subcontractors are counting on continued strong demand for oil .
although high demand has led to sharp oil and gas price increases in the past , the weg predicts this trend is waning . the weg also said it expects less price fluctuation than in the last year , although no price decrease is expected .
this is mainly a question of supply and demand : in the short term , output can not be increased . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rwe headquarters in essen , germany " we 've seen global demand grow in the last couple of years and we have to say that the possibility of increasing output further is limited .
that means … extremely limited availability of extra supplies , " schöning said no one at the weg is keen to talk about a future when oil reserves run out .
they stress , instead , the projection that currently known oil reserves will last for another 50 years , and gas reserves should last another 60 years . political stability is key " the oil and gas reserves are predominantly located in the middle- and far east .
that means areas that we , as a western industry , do n't always have easy access to -lrb- the reserves -rrb- , neither do we have any influence on these countries ' political stability , " schöning said . this supply could be damaged by political instability , such as recent developments in nigeria , where local regions have been fighting over their share of oil wealth .
german oil producers hope transparency is the answer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a refinery in the state of sachsen anhalt schöning said his company rwe is an example .
" our activities in egypt … are clearly regulated through production-sharing agreements .
that means contractual agreements exist with the countries stating exactly what is due to the state and what belongs to the oil companies . " despite the turbulence in world markets and increasing tensions in the major oil-producing nations , weg claims germany 's oil supply is secure .
the fact that the country produces even a fraction of its own oil supply adds an element of stability , schöning said . germany cites balanced supply " here in germany , we have a fairly balanced supply structure .
this applies to both the oil and gas markets , " said schöning .
" if we take the uk as an example , we can see that local oil production will in the future no longer be possible , and they 'll have to rely on the global market for all their energy needs .
this in turn means that price volatility is likely to increase . " one fifth of germany 's gas supply comes from national sources , although its gas production has been decreasing for several years .
moreover , technologically , it is becoming increasingly difficult for germany to exploit its own gas resources in an economically viable manner . schöning discounted the effects political conflicts could have on energy supplies , saying , " i 'm really not that greatly concerned about oil supplies for europe as a whole , as the past has proven .
none of the political conflicts we 've experienced have threatened supplies to any great extent .

speaking in stuttgart , verdi 's alfred wohlfart said there was no way the deal could have worked . " the gentlemen have entrenched themselves , they have put their ideological goals before the goal of giving people a perspective , " wohlfart said .
he urged the populace to understand the reasons behind the crippling strikes , saying verdi was battling against moves by employers that would further worsen mass unemployment . first major strike i n 14 years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the strikes have met an overwhelming response among public sector employees the strikes , which began in early february this year , have been over employers ' plans to extend the working week from 38.5 hours to 40 hours without any additional pay and against proposals to cut christmas bonuses in half . trade unions fear this will lead to further job cuts .
verdi is demanding 38.8 hours for the 220,000-strong workforce . the strike is the first major one in the sector for 14 years and the unions have warned they have sufficient funds to sustain a long , drawn-out conflict .
verdi estimates that around 24,000 employees had joined the walkouts so far . about 4.7 million people are employed in germany 's public sector . employers co n sider privatizatio n on thursday however the employers ' side indicated they might up the stakes in the dispute by considering privatization of services . " naturally one of the consequences would be , that there will be more privatization , " hartmut möllring , the chairman of the wage negotiating committee of the federal states and a conservative politician , said in a radio interview .
" that 's not a threat , rather a fact . " möllring , who is also the finance minister in the state of lower saxony , said the population would realize that privatization would mean that the garbage would be collected and kindergartens would remain open . esse n tial services crippled the wave of strikes have in particular affected local administration , hospitals , kindergartens and garbage services in europe 's largest economy , with rubbish left piling up in the streets in some places . verdi has now vowed to step up its action in baden-württemberg , with longer and wider work stoppages .

" the result is that the people in our cities will have to continue to endure the strike , " widder said . compromise i n hamburg however , in the northern city of hamburg , a compromise was found under a complicated formula depending on the pay grade , age and family situation of the respective employees . top negotiator for the local public employers in hamburg , volkmar schön welcomed the deal . " you will see that we have created the working hour plan with three elements , and all of these elements have a social character , " he said . under the accord , the average working week would be increased to 39 hours - but not for everyone .
while young single and well paid employees may have to work 40 hours , older employees or those with young children may in fact find that their working week is even reduced . but , the deal is unlikely to serve as a model for other federal states . elsewhere in germany , employees in the northern city of bremen joined the strike for the first time with 1,000 workers in 70 kindergartens not showing up for work . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans look to talks amid drawn-out strike germany 's ongoing civil service strike could have widespread repercussions for unions .

speaking in stuttgart , verdi 's alfred wohlfart said there was no way the deal could have worked . " the gentlemen have entrenched themselves , they have put their ideological goals before the goal of giving people a perspective , " wohlfart said .
he urged the populace to understand the reasons behind the crippling strikes , saying verdi was battling against moves by employers that would further worsen mass unemployment . first major strike i n 14 years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the strikes have met an overwhelming response among public sector employees the strikes , which began in early february this year , have been over employers ' plans to extend the working week from 38.5 hours to 40 hours without any additional pay and against proposals to cut christmas bonuses in half . trade unions fear this will lead to further job cuts .
verdi is demanding 38.8 hours for the 220,000-strong workforce . the strike is the first major one in the sector for 14 years and the unions have warned they have sufficient funds to sustain a long , drawn-out conflict .
verdi estimates that around 24,000 employees had joined the walkouts so far . about 4.7 million people are employed in germany 's public sector . employers co n sider privatizatio n on thursday however the employers ' side indicated they might up the stakes in the dispute by considering privatization of services . " naturally one of the consequences would be , that there will be more privatization , " hartmut möllring , the chairman of the wage negotiating committee of the federal states and a conservative politician , said in a radio interview .
" that 's not a threat , rather a fact . " möllring , who is also the finance minister in the state of lower saxony , said the population would realize that privatization would mean that the garbage would be collected and kindergartens would remain open . esse n tial services crippled the wave of strikes have in particular affected local administration , hospitals , kindergartens and garbage services in europe 's largest economy , with rubbish left piling up in the streets in some places . verdi has now vowed to step up its action in baden-württemberg , with longer and wider work stoppages .
it has called upon 9,000 to 10,000 employees to join walkouts on thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scenes such as these have become commonplace in some cities the move spells further bad news for the state 's residents who are already grappling with mountains of piled up rubbish on the streets and making alternative arrangements to care for their kids after the kindergartens have remained shut for weeks . the negotiator for the local authority employers ' side , gerhard widder , called it a black day for the public services sector , saying the strikes were conducted at the expense of the people 's needs . " the result is that the people in our cities will have to continue to endure the strike , " widder said . compromise i n hamburg however , in the northern city of hamburg , a compromise was found under a complicated formula depending on the pay grade , age and family situation of the respective employees . top negotiator for the local public employers in hamburg , volkmar schön welcomed the deal . " you will see that we have created the working hour plan with three elements , and all of these elements have a social character , " he said . under the accord , the average working week would be increased to 39 hours - but not for everyone .
while young single and well paid employees may have to work 40 hours , older employees or those with young children may in fact find that their working week is even reduced . but , the deal is unlikely to serve as a model for other federal states . elsewhere in germany , employees in the northern city of bremen joined the strike for the first time with 1,000 workers in 70 kindergartens not showing up for work . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans look to talks amid drawn-out strike germany 's ongoing civil service strike could have widespread repercussions for unions .

on wednesday , the european commission warned it expected results by the end of 2007 . germany 's public deficit has breached the eu 's limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product since 2002 .
last year , berlin convinced its eu partners to freeze excessive deficit procedures - including financial penalties - against it , following a long struggle with brussels . now though , the european commission has warned germany that it has until the end of 2007 to reduce its budget deficit , or face the possibility of sanctions . the german finance ministry was quick to respond , saying it planned to meet the eu requirement to bring its deficit below the 3 percent level specified in the stability and growth pact . " germany will achieve an underlying structural deficit improvement of about 1 percentage point in the next two years , thus meeting the commission 's guidelines , " the ministry said in a statement . the ministry added that it would release a 2007 draft budget in july that will show its ability to meet the eu deficit limits . the commission , which polices member states ' public finances , said that germany was set to breach the limit again this year but welcomed belt-tightening measures to bring it below the threshold next year . " although the -lrb- european -rrb- commission welcomes the renewed priority attached by the german government to budgetary consolidation , it is clear that the procedure needs to be stepped up to guarantee a lasting correction of the deficit , " economic affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said . huge fi n es in theory , berlin could face huge fines if it fails to rein in its deficit although that would be unlikely if the government sticks to its promises to improve the public accounts . german finance minister peer steinbrück supported the commission 's action , which he saw as boosting the credibility of the eu 's public finances pact . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister peer steinbrück supported the commission 's action " for germany , it is of the highest importance that the credibility of the stability and growth pact be protected in the long-term , " he said in a statement .
" that is why the government agrees with the eu decision .

speaking in stuttgart , verdi 's alfred wohlfart said there was no way the deal could have worked . " the gentlemen have entrenched themselves , they have put their ideological goals before the goal of giving people a perspective , " wohlfart said .
he urged the populace to understand the reasons behind the crippling strikes , saying verdi was battling against moves by employers that would further worsen mass unemployment . first major strike i n 14 years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the strikes have met an overwhelming response among public sector employees the strikes , which began in early february this year , have been over employers ' plans to extend the working week from 38.5 hours to 40 hours without any additional pay and against proposals to cut christmas bonuses in half . trade unions fear this will lead to further job cuts .
verdi is demanding 38.8 hours for the 220,000-strong workforce . the strike is the first major one in the sector for 14 years and the unions have warned they have sufficient funds to sustain a long , drawn-out conflict .
verdi estimates that around 24,000 employees had joined the walkouts so far . about 4.7 million people are employed in germany 's public sector . employers co n sider privatizatio n on thursday however the employers ' side indicated they might up the stakes in the dispute by considering privatization of services . " naturally one of the consequences would be , that there will be more privatization , " hartmut möllring , the chairman of the wage negotiating committee of the federal states and a conservative politician , said in a radio interview .

" the result is that the people in our cities will have to continue to endure the strike , " widder said . compromise i n hamburg however , in the northern city of hamburg , a compromise was found under a complicated formula depending on the pay grade , age and family situation of the respective employees . top negotiator for the local public employers in hamburg , volkmar schön welcomed the deal . " you will see that we have created the working hour plan with three elements , and all of these elements have a social character , " he said . under the accord , the average working week would be increased to 39 hours - but not for everyone .
while young single and well paid employees may have to work 40 hours , older employees or those with young children may in fact find that their working week is even reduced . but , the deal is unlikely to serve as a model for other federal states . elsewhere in germany , employees in the northern city of bremen joined the strike for the first time with 1,000 workers in 70 kindergartens not showing up for work . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans look to talks amid drawn-out strike germany 's ongoing civil service strike could have widespread repercussions for unions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.03.2006 wanted : ethnic minority cops for germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not even a sexy bike , it seems , can get germany 's ethnic minorities excited the berlin police force wants recruits from the city 's considerable ethnic minorities , but similar efforts have met with scant success in the past .
why are germany 's immigrants so reluctant to become cops ? it may be a magnet for foreigners and home to people from over 180 countries as its tourism officials love to point out .
but walk into a public administrative building in berlin and chances are you 'll be hard pressed to find any sign of its ethnic diversity among the employees . less than 2 percent of its ethnic minorities are estimated to work in the public service sector despite making up 13 percent of berlin 's 3-million-strong population .
studies show the pattern is reflected across all of germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish police officer aspirants try out some police gear in berlin now , one institution has decided to turn the tide .
the berlin police force wants to try to fill in some 10 percent of the 200 new recruits they accept this year with ethnic minorities , particularly those who speak fluent turkish , arabic , polish , serbo-croatian and russian . " berlin is a multicultural city and the police force certainly does n't reflect that , " said rainer gerlach , head of the personnel department of the berlin police .
" officers from ethnic minorities are n't just valuable when it comes to overcoming language barriers ; they bring in a whole new dimension of sensitivity towards other cultures . " uphill task but recruiting ethnic minority police officers may be easier said than done . ever since the early 1990s , following a tweaking of the law to pave the way for non-germans in the police force , successive german states including berlin have tried poster campaigns , information seminars , informal chats and television ads among other things to lure immigrants into their police forces - without success . ethnic minorities still make up only around 1 percent of the entire german police force , according to rafael behr , a former police officer in the state of hesse and sociologist and author . " in some eastern states like saxony and thuringia , they 're almost non-existent , " he said . educatio n the biggest stumbli n g block bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's police force has a tough time finding ethnic minority officers so why does germany have such few ethnic minorities in the police force at a time when their presence there would largely be seen as asserting multicultural credentials and being more representative of the country 's racial mix ? the most frequently cited reason is that immigrants simply do n't pass the grueling police entrance tests which require high fitness levels as well as a good high school degree . " the entry bar is very high in germany , " behr said .
" that 's where most immigrants who are neither fluent in german nor in their own mother tongue stumble .
and those who are well educated do n't go to the police but go on to study law , medicine or engineering . " in addition , it 's not always easy for an immigrant to choose to be a cop - a profession that 's often treated with high levels of mistrust by families and friends who have bad memories of the police from the countries they come from . " it 's amazing for instance what some officers of turkish origin have to go through when they are on patrol , " said klaus eisenreich , head of the police union in berlin .
" they 're often labeled as ' traitors ' by their own communities . " " psychological barriers " omid nouripour , an iranian-german green party parliamentarian said there are deeper reasons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish soccer fans in kreuzberg , berlin " the psychological barriers between the locals and the new-locals are simply too high in this country , " said nouripour , adding he did n't believe the police had done enough to make the profession more attractive to ethnic minorities . " it 's not easy for immigrants to gain access to resources , " he said .
" even in the public service , you have to have a german passport to become a civil servant . " other cou n tries ahead , but with ow n problems even as germany wrings its hands over the issue , a look beyond its borders shows that other countries seem to be miles ahead . britain 's metropolitan police has doubled the proportion of ethnic minority officers since 1998 - they currently make up some 11 percent of the force - and even holland has considerably hiked the number in its police force . but experts caution that both have managed to do so by following an indirect policy of " positive discrimination " or affirmative action - something that 's taboo in germany . " in holland , for instance , new recruits do n't have to be fluent in dutch ; they 're encouraged to learn the language during training , " behr said , adding that such concessions often led to negative fallouts . " officers within the force end up being treated as second-class citizens , " he said , adding that holland had a discrimination problem within its ranks and even britain had an entire labor union for black officers . on the other hand , germany 's rigidly standardized entry requirements for the police force has ended up keeping ethnic minorities away while ensuring it 's not plagued by discrimination and foul play . " the few ethnic minorities we have in the force are thus 99 percent identical to their german counterparts , " behr said .
" the only difference is that an officer might have a turkish surname . " melti n g of borders though there may be no relief in the short time , in the long run reservations about modifying entry rules for immigrants might just become superfluous . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch and german police during a mock riot-control operation last year " the functions of the police are already gradually transcending national borders , " said behr , pointing to last year 's bilateral cooperation between germany and holland when german police accompanied some known soccer hooligans to holland . " without this fixation on ' nation , ' it will be easier for ethnic minorities to play a naturally positive role in the police .

drawing on a classified bundestag report , the " new york times " reported thursday that german spies helped the us military invasion of iraq in an intelligence-sharing deal approved by top german officials . the intelligence sharing deal , which ended when the invasion came to an end , flies in the face of official german opposition to the war and is contained in a classified report by the german parliament , the bundestag , a copy of which was obtained by the newspaper . it also follows strong denials from berlin and the pentagon that german intelligence -lrb- bnd -rrb- had provided a copy of iraq 's war plans to the us military months before the us invasion , as the new york times reported monday . a scoop - or rehashed news ? the german parliamentary committee report , on which the times based its story , was issued after a series of recent , closed-door hearings on the role of german intelligence during the iraq war .
parts of the report were made available to the public , but several key references defined as classified were left out . the german media has not , for example , had access to certain information deemed sensitive by the bnd - such as the existence of a german intelligence officer in franks ' office , because , according to the report , this information overlaps with the espionage activities of another country , in this case the us . it was n't until the newspaper published its report that many more of the details became known . nonetheless , the claims are being downplayed in germany . according to social democratic parliamentarian olaf scholz , the article reveals nothing new .

" the german report , said the times , made clear that the intelligence-sharing arrangement was approved in late 2002 at the highest levels of the german government , including frank-walter steinmeier , the chief of staff for gerhard schröder , then the german chancellor , and by the foreign minister at the time , joschka fischer .

producers say the outlook for 2006 is good , citing rising demand and increased investment . the german gas and oil industry is small , but german gas production in particular makes up a significant chunk of the country 's energy supply . with sales on the rise in 2005 , german oil and gas producers pumped money into investment .
the federation of the german gas and oil industry , or weg , said at its annual press conference that german energy firms boosted investment by more than a third last year , to approximately 1.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : limited resources mean gas will remain expensive , although stable georg schöning , head of german energy and water company rwe dea ag is also head of the weg .
he chalked the good results up to the world 's seemingly unquenchable thirst for oil , especially in china . " we saw already a year ago , that huge demand exists in china .
it was admittedly slightly lower in 2004 , but in general , global demand has kept growing . " industry expects price stability the oil and gas companies and their subcontractors are counting on continued strong demand for oil .
although high demand has led to sharp oil and gas price increases in the past , the weg predicts this trend is waning . the weg also said it expects less price fluctuation than in the last year , although no price decrease is expected .
this is mainly a question of supply and demand : in the short term , output can not be increased . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rwe headquarters in essen , germany " we 've seen global demand grow in the last couple of years and we have to say that the possibility of increasing output further is limited .
that means … extremely limited availability of extra supplies , " schöning said no one at the weg is keen to talk about a future when oil reserves run out .
they stress , instead , the projection that currently known oil reserves will last for another 50 years , and gas reserves should last another 60 years . political stability is key " the oil and gas reserves are predominantly located in the middle- and far east .
that means areas that we , as a western industry , do n't always have easy access to -lrb- the reserves -rrb- , neither do we have any influence on these countries ' political stability , " schöning said . this supply could be damaged by political instability , such as recent developments in nigeria , where local regions have been fighting over their share of oil wealth .
german oil producers hope transparency is the answer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a refinery in the state of sachsen anhalt schöning said his company rwe is an example .
" our activities in egypt … are clearly regulated through production-sharing agreements .
that means contractual agreements exist with the countries stating exactly what is due to the state and what belongs to the oil companies . " despite the turbulence in world markets and increasing tensions in the major oil-producing nations , weg claims germany 's oil supply is secure .
the fact that the country produces even a fraction of its own oil supply adds an element of stability , schöning said . germany cites balanced supply " here in germany , we have a fairly balanced supply structure .
this applies to both the oil and gas markets , " said schöning .
" if we take the uk as an example , we can see that local oil production will in the future no longer be possible , and they 'll have to rely on the global market for all their energy needs .
this in turn means that price volatility is likely to increase . " one fifth of germany 's gas supply comes from national sources , although its gas production has been decreasing for several years .
moreover , technologically , it is becoming increasingly difficult for germany to exploit its own gas resources in an economically viable manner . schöning discounted the effects political conflicts could have on energy supplies , saying , " i 'm really not that greatly concerned about oil supplies for europe as a whole , as the past has proven .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.03.2006 us newspaper makes new claims of german espionage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what exactly were german spies doing in iraq ?
drawing on a classified bundestag report , the " new york times " reported thursday that german spies helped the us military invasion of iraq in an intelligence-sharing deal approved by top german officials . the intelligence sharing deal , which ended when the invasion came to an end , flies in the face of official german opposition to the war and is contained in a classified report by the german parliament , the bundestag , a copy of which was obtained by the newspaper . it also follows strong denials from berlin and the pentagon that german intelligence -lrb- bnd -rrb- had provided a copy of iraq 's war plans to the us military months before the us invasion , as the new york times reported monday . a scoop - or rehashed news ? the german parliamentary committee report , on which the times based its story , was issued after a series of recent , closed-door hearings on the role of german intelligence during the iraq war .
parts of the report were made available to the public , but several key references defined as classified were left out . the german media has not , for example , had access to certain information deemed sensitive by the bnd - such as the existence of a german intelligence officer in franks ' office , because , according to the report , this information overlaps with the espionage activities of another country , in this case the us . it was n't until the newspaper published its report that many more of the details became known . nonetheless , the claims are being downplayed in germany . according to social democratic parliamentarian olaf scholz , the article reveals nothing new . " the report is dredging up the same old news that has nothing to do with serious research , " he said in berlin , adding that us coverage of the issue is taking on " absurd characteristics .

why are germany 's immigrants so reluctant to become cops ? it may be a magnet for foreigners and home to people from over 180 countries as its tourism officials love to point out .
but walk into a public administrative building in berlin and chances are you 'll be hard pressed to find any sign of its ethnic diversity among the employees . less than 2 percent of its ethnic minorities are estimated to work in the public service sector despite making up 13 percent of berlin 's 3-million-strong population .
studies show the pattern is reflected across all of germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish police officer aspirants try out some police gear in berlin now , one institution has decided to turn the tide .
the berlin police force wants to try to fill in some 10 percent of the 200 new recruits they accept this year with ethnic minorities , particularly those who speak fluent turkish , arabic , polish , serbo-croatian and russian . " berlin is a multicultural city and the police force certainly does n't reflect that , " said rainer gerlach , head of the personnel department of the berlin police .
" officers from ethnic minorities are n't just valuable when it comes to overcoming language barriers ; they bring in a whole new dimension of sensitivity towards other cultures . " uphill task but recruiting ethnic minority police officers may be easier said than done . ever since the early 1990s , following a tweaking of the law to pave the way for non-germans in the police force , successive german states including berlin have tried poster campaigns , information seminars , informal chats and television ads among other things to lure immigrants into their police forces - without success . ethnic minorities still make up only around 1 percent of the entire german police force , according to rafael behr , a former police officer in the state of hesse and sociologist and author . " in some eastern states like saxony and thuringia , they 're almost non-existent , " he said . educatio n the biggest stumbli n g block bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's police force has a tough time finding ethnic minority officers so why does germany have such few ethnic minorities in the police force at a time when their presence there would largely be seen as asserting multicultural credentials and being more representative of the country 's racial mix ? the most frequently cited reason is that immigrants simply do n't pass the grueling police entrance tests which require high fitness levels as well as a good high school degree . " the entry bar is very high in germany , " behr said .
" that 's where most immigrants who are neither fluent in german nor in their own mother tongue stumble .
and those who are well educated do n't go to the police but go on to study law , medicine or engineering . " in addition , it 's not always easy for an immigrant to choose to be a cop - a profession that 's often treated with high levels of mistrust by families and friends who have bad memories of the police from the countries they come from . " it 's amazing for instance what some officers of turkish origin have to go through when they are on patrol , " said klaus eisenreich , head of the police union in berlin .
" they 're often labeled as ' traitors ' by their own communities . " " psychological barriers " omid nouripour , an iranian-german green party parliamentarian said there are deeper reasons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish soccer fans in kreuzberg , berlin " the psychological barriers between the locals and the new-locals are simply too high in this country , " said nouripour , adding he did n't believe the police had done enough to make the profession more attractive to ethnic minorities . " it 's not easy for immigrants to gain access to resources , " he said .
" even in the public service , you have to have a german passport to become a civil servant . " other cou n tries ahead , but with ow n problems even as germany wrings its hands over the issue , a look beyond its borders shows that other countries seem to be miles ahead . britain 's metropolitan police has doubled the proportion of ethnic minority officers since 1998 - they currently make up some 11 percent of the force - and even holland has considerably hiked the number in its police force . but experts caution that both have managed to do so by following an indirect policy of " positive discrimination " or affirmative action - something that 's taboo in germany . " in holland , for instance , new recruits do n't have to be fluent in dutch ; they 're encouraged to learn the language during training , " behr said , adding that such concessions often led to negative fallouts . " officers within the force end up being treated as second-class citizens , " he said , adding that holland had a discrimination problem within its ranks and even britain had an entire labor union for black officers . on the other hand , germany 's rigidly standardized entry requirements for the police force has ended up keeping ethnic minorities away while ensuring it 's not plagued by discrimination and foul play . " the few ethnic minorities we have in the force are thus 99 percent identical to their german counterparts , " behr said .
" the only difference is that an officer might have a turkish surname . " melti n g of borders though there may be no relief in the short time , in the long run reservations about modifying entry rules for immigrants might just become superfluous . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch and german police during a mock riot-control operation last year " the functions of the police are already gradually transcending national borders , " said behr , pointing to last year 's bilateral cooperation between germany and holland when german police accompanied some known soccer hooligans to holland . " without this fixation on ' nation , ' it will be easier for ethnic minorities to play a naturally positive role in the police .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 02.03.2006 german energy industry upbeat for 2006 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany provides one-fifth of its own gas supply , helping stability rising energy demand has boosted trade in the german oil and gas industry .
producers say the outlook for 2006 is good , citing rising demand and increased investment . the german gas and oil industry is small , but german gas production in particular makes up a significant chunk of the country 's energy supply . with sales on the rise in 2005 , german oil and gas producers pumped money into investment .
the federation of the german gas and oil industry , or weg , said at its annual press conference that german energy firms boosted investment by more than a third last year , to approximately 1.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : limited resources mean gas will remain expensive , although stable georg schöning , head of german energy and water company rwe dea ag is also head of the weg .
he chalked the good results up to the world 's seemingly unquenchable thirst for oil , especially in china . " we saw already a year ago , that huge demand exists in china .
it was admittedly slightly lower in 2004 , but in general , global demand has kept growing . " industry expects price stability the oil and gas companies and their subcontractors are counting on continued strong demand for oil .
although high demand has led to sharp oil and gas price increases in the past , the weg predicts this trend is waning . the weg also said it expects less price fluctuation than in the last year , although no price decrease is expected .
this is mainly a question of supply and demand : in the short term , output can not be increased . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rwe headquarters in essen , germany " we 've seen global demand grow in the last couple of years and we have to say that the possibility of increasing output further is limited .
that means … extremely limited availability of extra supplies , " schöning said no one at the weg is keen to talk about a future when oil reserves run out .
they stress , instead , the projection that currently known oil reserves will last for another 50 years , and gas reserves should last another 60 years . political stability is key " the oil and gas reserves are predominantly located in the middle- and far east .
that means areas that we , as a western industry , do n't always have easy access to -lrb- the reserves -rrb- , neither do we have any influence on these countries ' political stability , " schöning said . this supply could be damaged by political instability , such as recent developments in nigeria , where local regions have been fighting over their share of oil wealth .
german oil producers hope transparency is the answer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a refinery in the state of sachsen anhalt schöning said his company rwe is an example .
" our activities in egypt … are clearly regulated through production-sharing agreements .
that means contractual agreements exist with the countries stating exactly what is due to the state and what belongs to the oil companies . " despite the turbulence in world markets and increasing tensions in the major oil-producing nations , weg claims germany 's oil supply is secure .
the fact that the country produces even a fraction of its own oil supply adds an element of stability , schöning said . germany cites balanced supply " here in germany , we have a fairly balanced supply structure .
this applies to both the oil and gas markets , " said schöning .
" if we take the uk as an example , we can see that local oil production will in the future no longer be possible , and they 'll have to rely on the global market for all their energy needs .
this in turn means that price volatility is likely to increase . " one fifth of germany 's gas supply comes from national sources , although its gas production has been decreasing for several years .
moreover , technologically , it is becoming increasingly difficult for germany to exploit its own gas resources in an economically viable manner . schöning discounted the effects political conflicts could have on energy supplies , saying , " i 'm really not that greatly concerned about oil supplies for europe as a whole , as the past has proven .
none of the political conflicts we 've experienced have threatened supplies to any great extent .

" the least it can do is to follow france 's lead , " he said .
" -lrb- the tax -rrb- would be a first step , " he added , towards achieving the increase in the development budget set for 2015 . optimism overall , the head of the un agency fighting aids , peter piot , said he was optimistic about the moves sponsored by france and brazil . it was " absolutely necessary " for countries to come up with new ways of raising development aid , he told afp , but only " on condition that that is not a pretext for states to reduce their contributions elsewhere .

on monday , the eu gave serbia a final deadline to cooperate with the united nations war crimes tribunal or jeopardize its negotiations with the eu , which are due to recommence on april 4 . a decade after the war in bosnia , the conflict 's most wanted men - mladic and radovan karadzic - are still on the run .

his election was heartily blasted by shocked serbian officials , who warned " the extremists are advancing , " and called the vote " another provocation . " the general was known as a war horse in the struggle against the serbian military and paramilitary , during the civil warns of the 1990s . there is also the question of montenegro , the smaller of the two former yugoslav republics .
montenegro and serbia are joined in a union – but the pro-independence government in montenegro wants out .
the eu has a mediating role in montenegro , and the parliament there on wednesday adopted a law that paves the way for a referendum in may on the independence proposition . kate hairsine -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu warns serbia , bosnia on war crimes cooperation european union foreign ministers warned serbia that its hopes of joining the bloc could be thrown into jeopardy if it fails to step up cooperation with the un war crimes tribunal .

why are germany 's immigrants so reluctant to become cops ? it may be a magnet for foreigners and home to people from over 180 countries as its tourism officials love to point out .
but walk into a public administrative building in berlin and chances are you 'll be hard pressed to find any sign of its ethnic diversity among the employees . less than 2 percent of its ethnic minorities are estimated to work in the public service sector despite making up 13 percent of berlin 's 3-million-strong population .
studies show the pattern is reflected across all of germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish police officer aspirants try out some police gear in berlin now , one institution has decided to turn the tide .
the berlin police force wants to try to fill in some 10 percent of the 200 new recruits they accept this year with ethnic minorities , particularly those who speak fluent turkish , arabic , polish , serbo-croatian and russian . " berlin is a multicultural city and the police force certainly does n't reflect that , " said rainer gerlach , head of the personnel department of the berlin police .
" officers from ethnic minorities are n't just valuable when it comes to overcoming language barriers ; they bring in a whole new dimension of sensitivity towards other cultures . " uphill task but recruiting ethnic minority police officers may be easier said than done . ever since the early 1990s , following a tweaking of the law to pave the way for non-germans in the police force , successive german states including berlin have tried poster campaigns , information seminars , informal chats and television ads among other things to lure immigrants into their police forces - without success . ethnic minorities still make up only around 1 percent of the entire german police force , according to rafael behr , a former police officer in the state of hesse and sociologist and author . " in some eastern states like saxony and thuringia , they 're almost non-existent , " he said . educatio n the biggest stumbli n g block bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's police force has a tough time finding ethnic minority officers so why does germany have such few ethnic minorities in the police force at a time when their presence there would largely be seen as asserting multicultural credentials and being more representative of the country 's racial mix ? the most frequently cited reason is that immigrants simply do n't pass the grueling police entrance tests which require high fitness levels as well as a good high school degree . " the entry bar is very high in germany , " behr said .
" that 's where most immigrants who are neither fluent in german nor in their own mother tongue stumble .
and those who are well educated do n't go to the police but go on to study law , medicine or engineering . " in addition , it 's not always easy for an immigrant to choose to be a cop - a profession that 's often treated with high levels of mistrust by families and friends who have bad memories of the police from the countries they come from . " it 's amazing for instance what some officers of turkish origin have to go through when they are on patrol , " said klaus eisenreich , head of the police union in berlin .
" they 're often labeled as ' traitors ' by their own communities . " " psychological barriers " omid nouripour , an iranian-german green party parliamentarian said there are deeper reasons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish soccer fans in kreuzberg , berlin " the psychological barriers between the locals and the new-locals are simply too high in this country , " said nouripour , adding he did n't believe the police had done enough to make the profession more attractive to ethnic minorities . " it 's not easy for immigrants to gain access to resources , " he said .
" even in the public service , you have to have a german passport to become a civil servant . " other cou n tries ahead , but with ow n problems even as germany wrings its hands over the issue , a look beyond its borders shows that other countries seem to be miles ahead . britain 's metropolitan police has doubled the proportion of ethnic minority officers since 1998 - they currently make up some 11 percent of the force - and even holland has considerably hiked the number in its police force . but experts caution that both have managed to do so by following an indirect policy of " positive discrimination " or affirmative action - something that 's taboo in germany . " in holland , for instance , new recruits do n't have to be fluent in dutch ; they 're encouraged to learn the language during training , " behr said , adding that such concessions often led to negative fallouts . " officers within the force end up being treated as second-class citizens , " he said , adding that holland had a discrimination problem within its ranks and even britain had an entire labor union for black officers . on the other hand , germany 's rigidly standardized entry requirements for the police force has ended up keeping ethnic minorities away while ensuring it 's not plagued by discrimination and foul play . " the few ethnic minorities we have in the force are thus 99 percent identical to their german counterparts , " behr said .
" the only difference is that an officer might have a turkish surname . " melti n g of borders though there may be no relief in the short time , in the long run reservations about modifying entry rules for immigrants might just become superfluous . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch and german police during a mock riot-control operation last year " the functions of the police are already gradually transcending national borders , " said behr , pointing to last year 's bilateral cooperation between germany and holland when german police accompanied some known soccer hooligans to holland . " without this fixation on ' nation , ' it will be easier for ethnic minorities to play a naturally positive role in the police .

germany reveres him as the man who made peaceful german unification possible . in the summer of 1989 , just months before the berlin wall fell , soviet president gorbachev and his wife , raisa , made a state visit to west germany .
" gorbi , gorbi , " read the title page of bild , germany 's most widely circulated paper , on which the couple was shown smiling with a german boy in their arms . the newspaper clipping is now part of the display at the bonn " house of history " museum , which documents german history from the end of world war ii to the present .
the part of the exhibition on the 1980s is devoted to gorbachev and his reforms . " we use the headlines of the german press to show that gorbachev was celebrated like a superstar , " said museum employee andrea mork .
" here , people had a clear sense that someone they could pin their hopes on was visiting bonn . " cha n gi n g the world later , germans viewed the man identified with the policies of glas n ost and perestroika - policies focused on emphasizing openness and making the soviet economy and bureaucracy more efficient - as a hero who had made it possible for their country to be reunited in 1990 .
" for that we owe him abiding thanks , " said werner krawietz , a professor at the university of münster , which bestowed an honorary doctorate on the former president on the 20th anniversary of perestroika .
" it 's not just a mere memory , but a vivid sentiment that germany feels towards gorbachev . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gorbachev is still engaged in changing russia " he has contributed to dismantling prejudices , to mutual understanding and to cooperation in all areas of political , cultural and social life like hardly anyone else , " krawietz said , drawing attention to his role as russian chairman of the so-called petersburg dialogue , an annual series of intensive talks between german and russian elites . " there are good reasons for saying that mikhail gorbachev changed the world - and for the better - for the decades-long cold war was dismantled through his changes to soviet policy , " said hans-dietrich genscher , who was west germany 's foreign minister at the time .
u n popular at home in russia , however , comparatively few people revere gorbachev . german writer klaus-rüdiger mai , who recently completed a biography of gorbachev , interviewed many russians about the former president .
some saw gorbachev as the man who opened up their country , others as the man who destroyed it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gorbachev lost power over the kremlin after the ussr broke up after introducing wide-ranging reforms in the soviet union , gorbachev allowed the country 's satellite states to become independent .
in the end , the soviet union broke apart and was replaced by the loose alliance of its former republics , the commonwealth of independent states -lrb- cis -rrb- .
he subsequently lost power to boris yeltsin . many russians blamed gorbachev 's reforms rather than yeltsin 's economic policies when their standard of living declined . gorbachev himself is sober about his legacy . " my hopes for a rapid turnaround and a quick change for the better in russia were premature , " he told dw-radio .
" there are still people who do n't accept the idea of perestroika , above all in the n ome n klatura that still exists in politics , business , civil service and bureaucracy . "
re-assessi n g the legacy biographer mai though was convinced that russians would one day change their assessment . " the reformers repeatedly moved the country forward , " he said .
" that 's why i think that one day people will come to terms with his great legacy .
gorbachev correctly saw the route to democracy in russia : it can only happen step by step . " for his part , gorbachev does n't appear bothered by his lack of fans in russia .
asked by an interviewer for the german magazine ster n why he was so unpopular at home , he responded : " do you know a reformer who 's loved ?

drawing on a classified bundestag report , the " new york times " reported thursday that german spies helped the us military invasion of iraq in an intelligence-sharing deal approved by top german officials . the intelligence sharing deal , which ended when the invasion came to an end , flies in the face of official german opposition to the war and is contained in a classified report by the german parliament , the bundestag , a copy of which was obtained by the newspaper . it also follows strong denials from berlin and the pentagon that german intelligence -lrb- bnd -rrb- had provided a copy of iraq 's war plans to the us military months before the us invasion , as the new york times reported monday . a scoop - or rehashed news ? the german parliamentary committee report , on which the times based its story , was issued after a series of recent , closed-door hearings on the role of german intelligence during the iraq war .

drawing on a classified bundestag report , the " new york times " reported thursday that german spies helped the us military invasion of iraq in an intelligence-sharing deal approved by top german officials . the intelligence sharing deal , which ended when the invasion came to an end , flies in the face of official german opposition to the war and is contained in a classified report by the german parliament , the bundestag , a copy of which was obtained by the newspaper . it also follows strong denials from berlin and the pentagon that german intelligence -lrb- bnd -rrb- had provided a copy of iraq 's war plans to the us military months before the us invasion , as the new york times reported monday . a scoop - or rehashed news ? the german parliamentary committee report , on which the times based its story , was issued after a series of recent , closed-door hearings on the role of german intelligence during the iraq war .
parts of the report were made available to the public , but several key references defined as classified were left out . the german media has not , for example , had access to certain information deemed sensitive by the bnd - such as the existence of a german intelligence officer in franks ' office , because , according to the report , this information overlaps with the espionage activities of another country , in this case the us . it was n't until the newspaper published its report that many more of the details became known . nonetheless , the claims are being downplayed in germany . according to social democratic parliamentarian olaf scholz , the article reveals nothing new . " the report is dredging up the same old news that has nothing to do with serious research , " he said in berlin , adding that us coverage of the issue is taking on " absurd characteristics . " approval from the top bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general tommy franks in reviewing german-american cooperation before and during the iraq war , german lawmakers said in their report that , starting in early 2003 , a german intelligence officer was stationed in the office of us general tommy franks , who headed the us central command and the invading forces in iraq . two other german spies in baghdad passed on information to their colleague in franks ' office mostly about sites in the iraqi capital , such as embassies and suspected location of hostages , to be avoided by us bombs . they also provided information on iraqi police and military units in baghdad , although the german report stressed that the spies did not direct airstrikes against iraqi leaders or forces , the daily said . in all , the german spies provided 25 reports to the us central command and were awarded american meritorious medals , after the invasion came to an end , in recognition of the " critical information to united states central command to support combat operations in iraq . " the german report , said the times , made clear that the intelligence-sharing arrangement was approved in late 2002 at the highest levels of the german government , including frank-walter steinmeier , the chief of staff for gerhard schröder , then the german chancellor , and by the foreign minister at the time , joschka fischer .
steinmeier is now germany 's foreign minister . " verbally imposed " conditions were " verbally imposed " on the german intelligence officials , the report said .
the liaison officer in franks ' office , for example , was to provide " no support for the strategic air war offensive carried out by the usa . " he was also instructed to give out no " information with direct relevance for the tactical air and land warfare on the part of the usa . " the classified version of the report was provided by a german journalist to a times reporter in germany , who read the text into a tape recorder so it could be transcribed and translated . the deputy spokesman for the german government consulted by telephone by the new york times did not comment on the newspaper 's account . " i do n't know the classified version .

producers say the outlook for 2006 is good , citing rising demand and increased investment . the german gas and oil industry is small , but german gas production in particular makes up a significant chunk of the country 's energy supply . with sales on the rise in 2005 , german oil and gas producers pumped money into investment .
the federation of the german gas and oil industry , or weg , said at its annual press conference that german energy firms boosted investment by more than a third last year , to approximately 1.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : limited resources mean gas will remain expensive , although stable georg schöning , head of german energy and water company rwe dea ag is also head of the weg .
he chalked the good results up to the world 's seemingly unquenchable thirst for oil , especially in china . " we saw already a year ago , that huge demand exists in china .
it was admittedly slightly lower in 2004 , but in general , global demand has kept growing . " industry expects price stability the oil and gas companies and their subcontractors are counting on continued strong demand for oil .
although high demand has led to sharp oil and gas price increases in the past , the weg predicts this trend is waning . the weg also said it expects less price fluctuation than in the last year , although no price decrease is expected .
this is mainly a question of supply and demand : in the short term , output can not be increased . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rwe headquarters in essen , germany " we 've seen global demand grow in the last couple of years and we have to say that the possibility of increasing output further is limited .
that means … extremely limited availability of extra supplies , " schöning said no one at the weg is keen to talk about a future when oil reserves run out .
they stress , instead , the projection that currently known oil reserves will last for another 50 years , and gas reserves should last another 60 years . political stability is key " the oil and gas reserves are predominantly located in the middle- and far east .
that means areas that we , as a western industry , do n't always have easy access to -lrb- the reserves -rrb- , neither do we have any influence on these countries ' political stability , " schöning said . this supply could be damaged by political instability , such as recent developments in nigeria , where local regions have been fighting over their share of oil wealth .
german oil producers hope transparency is the answer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a refinery in the state of sachsen anhalt schöning said his company rwe is an example .
" our activities in egypt … are clearly regulated through production-sharing agreements .
that means contractual agreements exist with the countries stating exactly what is due to the state and what belongs to the oil companies . " despite the turbulence in world markets and increasing tensions in the major oil-producing nations , weg claims germany 's oil supply is secure .
the fact that the country produces even a fraction of its own oil supply adds an element of stability , schöning said . germany cites balanced supply " here in germany , we have a fairly balanced supply structure .
this applies to both the oil and gas markets , " said schöning .
" if we take the uk as an example , we can see that local oil production will in the future no longer be possible , and they 'll have to rely on the global market for all their energy needs .
this in turn means that price volatility is likely to increase . " one fifth of germany 's gas supply comes from national sources , although its gas production has been decreasing for several years .
moreover , technologically , it is becoming increasingly difficult for germany to exploit its own gas resources in an economically viable manner . schöning discounted the effects political conflicts could have on energy supplies , saying , " i 'm really not that greatly concerned about oil supplies for europe as a whole , as the past has proven .
none of the political conflicts we 've experienced have threatened supplies to any great extent .

why are germany 's immigrants so reluctant to become cops ? it may be a magnet for foreigners and home to people from over 180 countries as its tourism officials love to point out .
but walk into a public administrative building in berlin and chances are you 'll be hard pressed to find any sign of its ethnic diversity among the employees . less than 2 percent of its ethnic minorities are estimated to work in the public service sector despite making up 13 percent of berlin 's 3-million-strong population .
studies show the pattern is reflected across all of germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish police officer aspirants try out some police gear in berlin now , one institution has decided to turn the tide .
the berlin police force wants to try to fill in some 10 percent of the 200 new recruits they accept this year with ethnic minorities , particularly those who speak fluent turkish , arabic , polish , serbo-croatian and russian . " berlin is a multicultural city and the police force certainly does n't reflect that , " said rainer gerlach , head of the personnel department of the berlin police .
" officers from ethnic minorities are n't just valuable when it comes to overcoming language barriers ; they bring in a whole new dimension of sensitivity towards other cultures . " uphill task but recruiting ethnic minority police officers may be easier said than done . ever since the early 1990s , following a tweaking of the law to pave the way for non-germans in the police force , successive german states including berlin have tried poster campaigns , information seminars , informal chats and television ads among other things to lure immigrants into their police forces - without success . ethnic minorities still make up only around 1 percent of the entire german police force , according to rafael behr , a former police officer in the state of hesse and sociologist and author . " in some eastern states like saxony and thuringia , they 're almost non-existent , " he said . educatio n the biggest stumbli n g block bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's police force has a tough time finding ethnic minority officers so why does germany have such few ethnic minorities in the police force at a time when their presence there would largely be seen as asserting multicultural credentials and being more representative of the country 's racial mix ? the most frequently cited reason is that immigrants simply do n't pass the grueling police entrance tests which require high fitness levels as well as a good high school degree . " the entry bar is very high in germany , " behr said .
" that 's where most immigrants who are neither fluent in german nor in their own mother tongue stumble .
and those who are well educated do n't go to the police but go on to study law , medicine or engineering . " in addition , it 's not always easy for an immigrant to choose to be a cop - a profession that 's often treated with high levels of mistrust by families and friends who have bad memories of the police from the countries they come from . " it 's amazing for instance what some officers of turkish origin have to go through when they are on patrol , " said klaus eisenreich , head of the police union in berlin .
" they 're often labeled as ' traitors ' by their own communities . " " psychological barriers " omid nouripour , an iranian-german green party parliamentarian said there are deeper reasons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish soccer fans in kreuzberg , berlin " the psychological barriers between the locals and the new-locals are simply too high in this country , " said nouripour , adding he did n't believe the police had done enough to make the profession more attractive to ethnic minorities . " it 's not easy for immigrants to gain access to resources , " he said .
" even in the public service , you have to have a german passport to become a civil servant . " other cou n tries ahead , but with ow n problems even as germany wrings its hands over the issue , a look beyond its borders shows that other countries seem to be miles ahead . britain 's metropolitan police has doubled the proportion of ethnic minority officers since 1998 - they currently make up some 11 percent of the force - and even holland has considerably hiked the number in its police force . but experts caution that both have managed to do so by following an indirect policy of " positive discrimination " or affirmative action - something that 's taboo in germany . " in holland , for instance , new recruits do n't have to be fluent in dutch ; they 're encouraged to learn the language during training , " behr said , adding that such concessions often led to negative fallouts . " officers within the force end up being treated as second-class citizens , " he said , adding that holland had a discrimination problem within its ranks and even britain had an entire labor union for black officers . on the other hand , germany 's rigidly standardized entry requirements for the police force has ended up keeping ethnic minorities away while ensuring it 's not plagued by discrimination and foul play . " the few ethnic minorities we have in the force are thus 99 percent identical to their german counterparts , " behr said .
" the only difference is that an officer might have a turkish surname . " melti n g of borders though there may be no relief in the short time , in the long run reservations about modifying entry rules for immigrants might just become superfluous . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch and german police during a mock riot-control operation last year " the functions of the police are already gradually transcending national borders , " said behr , pointing to last year 's bilateral cooperation between germany and holland when german police accompanied some known soccer hooligans to holland . " without this fixation on ' nation , ' it will be easier for ethnic minorities to play a naturally positive role in the police .

why are germany 's immigrants so reluctant to become cops ? it may be a magnet for foreigners and home to people from over 180 countries as its tourism officials love to point out .
but walk into a public administrative building in berlin and chances are you 'll be hard pressed to find any sign of its ethnic diversity among the employees . less than 2 percent of its ethnic minorities are estimated to work in the public service sector despite making up 13 percent of berlin 's 3-million-strong population .
studies show the pattern is reflected across all of germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish police officer aspirants try out some police gear in berlin now , one institution has decided to turn the tide .
the berlin police force wants to try to fill in some 10 percent of the 200 new recruits they accept this year with ethnic minorities , particularly those who speak fluent turkish , arabic , polish , serbo-croatian and russian . " berlin is a multicultural city and the police force certainly does n't reflect that , " said rainer gerlach , head of the personnel department of the berlin police .
" officers from ethnic minorities are n't just valuable when it comes to overcoming language barriers ; they bring in a whole new dimension of sensitivity towards other cultures . " uphill task but recruiting ethnic minority police officers may be easier said than done . ever since the early 1990s , following a tweaking of the law to pave the way for non-germans in the police force , successive german states including berlin have tried poster campaigns , information seminars , informal chats and television ads among other things to lure immigrants into their police forces - without success . ethnic minorities still make up only around 1 percent of the entire german police force , according to rafael behr , a former police officer in the state of hesse and sociologist and author . " in some eastern states like saxony and thuringia , they 're almost non-existent , " he said . educatio n the biggest stumbli n g block bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's police force has a tough time finding ethnic minority officers so why does germany have such few ethnic minorities in the police force at a time when their presence there would largely be seen as asserting multicultural credentials and being more representative of the country 's racial mix ? the most frequently cited reason is that immigrants simply do n't pass the grueling police entrance tests which require high fitness levels as well as a good high school degree . " the entry bar is very high in germany , " behr said .
" that 's where most immigrants who are neither fluent in german nor in their own mother tongue stumble .
and those who are well educated do n't go to the police but go on to study law , medicine or engineering . " in addition , it 's not always easy for an immigrant to choose to be a cop - a profession that 's often treated with high levels of mistrust by families and friends who have bad memories of the police from the countries they come from . " it 's amazing for instance what some officers of turkish origin have to go through when they are on patrol , " said klaus eisenreich , head of the police union in berlin .
" they 're often labeled as ' traitors ' by their own communities . " " psychological barriers " omid nouripour , an iranian-german green party parliamentarian said there are deeper reasons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish soccer fans in kreuzberg , berlin " the psychological barriers between the locals and the new-locals are simply too high in this country , " said nouripour , adding he did n't believe the police had done enough to make the profession more attractive to ethnic minorities . " it 's not easy for immigrants to gain access to resources , " he said .
" even in the public service , you have to have a german passport to become a civil servant . " other cou n tries ahead , but with ow n problems even as germany wrings its hands over the issue , a look beyond its borders shows that other countries seem to be miles ahead . britain 's metropolitan police has doubled the proportion of ethnic minority officers since 1998 - they currently make up some 11 percent of the force - and even holland has considerably hiked the number in its police force . but experts caution that both have managed to do so by following an indirect policy of " positive discrimination " or affirmative action - something that 's taboo in germany . " in holland , for instance , new recruits do n't have to be fluent in dutch ; they 're encouraged to learn the language during training , " behr said , adding that such concessions often led to negative fallouts . " officers within the force end up being treated as second-class citizens , " he said , adding that holland had a discrimination problem within its ranks and even britain had an entire labor union for black officers . on the other hand , germany 's rigidly standardized entry requirements for the police force has ended up keeping ethnic minorities away while ensuring it 's not plagued by discrimination and foul play . " the few ethnic minorities we have in the force are thus 99 percent identical to their german counterparts , " behr said .
" the only difference is that an officer might have a turkish surname . " melti n g of borders though there may be no relief in the short time , in the long run reservations about modifying entry rules for immigrants might just become superfluous . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch and german police during a mock riot-control operation last year " the functions of the police are already gradually transcending national borders , " said behr , pointing to last year 's bilateral cooperation between germany and holland when german police accompanied some known soccer hooligans to holland . " without this fixation on ' nation , ' it will be easier for ethnic minorities to play a naturally positive role in the police .

producers say the outlook for 2006 is good , citing rising demand and increased investment . the german gas and oil industry is small , but german gas production in particular makes up a significant chunk of the country 's energy supply . with sales on the rise in 2005 , german oil and gas producers pumped money into investment .
the federation of the german gas and oil industry , or weg , said at its annual press conference that german energy firms boosted investment by more than a third last year , to approximately 1.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : limited resources mean gas will remain expensive , although stable georg schöning , head of german energy and water company rwe dea ag is also head of the weg .
he chalked the good results up to the world 's seemingly unquenchable thirst for oil , especially in china . " we saw already a year ago , that huge demand exists in china .
it was admittedly slightly lower in 2004 , but in general , global demand has kept growing . " industry expects price stability the oil and gas companies and their subcontractors are counting on continued strong demand for oil .
although high demand has led to sharp oil and gas price increases in the past , the weg predicts this trend is waning . the weg also said it expects less price fluctuation than in the last year , although no price decrease is expected .
this is mainly a question of supply and demand : in the short term , output can not be increased . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rwe headquarters in essen , germany " we 've seen global demand grow in the last couple of years and we have to say that the possibility of increasing output further is limited .
that means … extremely limited availability of extra supplies , " schöning said no one at the weg is keen to talk about a future when oil reserves run out .
they stress , instead , the projection that currently known oil reserves will last for another 50 years , and gas reserves should last another 60 years . political stability is key " the oil and gas reserves are predominantly located in the middle- and far east .
that means areas that we , as a western industry , do n't always have easy access to -lrb- the reserves -rrb- , neither do we have any influence on these countries ' political stability , " schöning said . this supply could be damaged by political instability , such as recent developments in nigeria , where local regions have been fighting over their share of oil wealth .
german oil producers hope transparency is the answer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a refinery in the state of sachsen anhalt schöning said his company rwe is an example .
" our activities in egypt … are clearly regulated through production-sharing agreements .
that means contractual agreements exist with the countries stating exactly what is due to the state and what belongs to the oil companies . " despite the turbulence in world markets and increasing tensions in the major oil-producing nations , weg claims germany 's oil supply is secure .
the fact that the country produces even a fraction of its own oil supply adds an element of stability , schöning said . germany cites balanced supply " here in germany , we have a fairly balanced supply structure .
this applies to both the oil and gas markets , " said schöning .
" if we take the uk as an example , we can see that local oil production will in the future no longer be possible , and they 'll have to rely on the global market for all their energy needs .
this in turn means that price volatility is likely to increase . " one fifth of germany 's gas supply comes from national sources , although its gas production has been decreasing for several years .
moreover , technologically , it is becoming increasingly difficult for germany to exploit its own gas resources in an economically viable manner . schöning discounted the effects political conflicts could have on energy supplies , saying , " i 'm really not that greatly concerned about oil supplies for europe as a whole , as the past has proven .

producers say the outlook for 2006 is good , citing rising demand and increased investment . the german gas and oil industry is small , but german gas production in particular makes up a significant chunk of the country 's energy supply . with sales on the rise in 2005 , german oil and gas producers pumped money into investment .
the federation of the german gas and oil industry , or weg , said at its annual press conference that german energy firms boosted investment by more than a third last year , to approximately 1.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : limited resources mean gas will remain expensive , although stable georg schöning , head of german energy and water company rwe dea ag is also head of the weg .
he chalked the good results up to the world 's seemingly unquenchable thirst for oil , especially in china . " we saw already a year ago , that huge demand exists in china .

" germany will achieve an underlying structural deficit improvement of about 1 percentage point in the next two years , thus meeting the commission 's guidelines , " the ministry said in a statement . the ministry added that it would release a 2007 draft budget in july that will show its ability to meet the eu deficit limits . the commission , which polices member states ' public finances , said that germany was set to breach the limit again this year but welcomed belt-tightening measures to bring it below the threshold next year . " although the -lrb- european -rrb- commission welcomes the renewed priority attached by the german government to budgetary consolidation , it is clear that the procedure needs to be stepped up to guarantee a lasting correction of the deficit , " economic affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said . huge fi n es in theory , berlin could face huge fines if it fails to rein in its deficit although that would be unlikely if the government sticks to its promises to improve the public accounts . german finance minister peer steinbrück supported the commission 's action , which he saw as boosting the credibility of the eu 's public finances pact . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister peer steinbrück supported the commission 's action " for germany , it is of the highest importance that the credibility of the stability and growth pact be protected in the long-term , " he said in a statement .
" that is why the government agrees with the eu decision . " berlin and paris , whose deficit has also breached eu limits for years , won a formal suspension of disciplinary measures against them at the beginning of last year . damage to stability pact suspension of the measures came only after a lengthy battle with brussels which resulted in the eu rewriting the public finances pact last year and , in effect , watering it down . " after the revision last year , i think from the political point of view the commission and the ministers have learned a lot about the importance of establishing good dialogue channels to avoid these kinds of conflicts , " almunia said . in a recent review of french public finances , paris was let off the hook for further measures on account of efforts to cut its deficit . germany , worried that other euro members would be less disciplined about their public finances , was the main author behind the fiscal rulebook when it was drawn up in 1997 . the revision of the pact was met with scorn from many private and even some public economists , who believed that it no longer had any credibility because member states would have too much leeway to avoid disciplinary measures . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu commission to supervise german spending germany 's new finance minister peer steinbrück is making waves by suggesting an unusual way of avoiding eu sanctions which brussels could impose over berlin 's non-compliance with the stability pact .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.03.2006 us newspaper makes new claims of german espionage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what exactly were german spies doing in iraq ?
drawing on a classified bundestag report , the " new york times " reported thursday that german spies helped the us military invasion of iraq in an intelligence-sharing deal approved by top german officials . the intelligence sharing deal , which ended when the invasion came to an end , flies in the face of official german opposition to the war and is contained in a classified report by the german parliament , the bundestag , a copy of which was obtained by the newspaper . it also follows strong denials from berlin and the pentagon that german intelligence -lrb- bnd -rrb- had provided a copy of iraq 's war plans to the us military months before the us invasion , as the new york times reported monday . a scoop - or rehashed news ? the german parliamentary committee report , on which the times based its story , was issued after a series of recent , closed-door hearings on the role of german intelligence during the iraq war .

drawing on a classified bundestag report , the " new york times " reported thursday that german spies helped the us military invasion of iraq in an intelligence-sharing deal approved by top german officials . the intelligence sharing deal , which ended when the invasion came to an end , flies in the face of official german opposition to the war and is contained in a classified report by the german parliament , the bundestag , a copy of which was obtained by the newspaper . it also follows strong denials from berlin and the pentagon that german intelligence -lrb- bnd -rrb- had provided a copy of iraq 's war plans to the us military months before the us invasion , as the new york times reported monday . a scoop - or rehashed news ? the german parliamentary committee report , on which the times based its story , was issued after a series of recent , closed-door hearings on the role of german intelligence during the iraq war .
parts of the report were made available to the public , but several key references defined as classified were left out . the german media has not , for example , had access to certain information deemed sensitive by the bnd - such as the existence of a german intelligence officer in franks ' office , because , according to the report , this information overlaps with the espionage activities of another country , in this case the us . it was n't until the newspaper published its report that many more of the details became known . nonetheless , the claims are being downplayed in germany . according to social democratic parliamentarian olaf scholz , the article reveals nothing new .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 02.03.2006 eu pressures germany to cut deficit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economic commissioner joaquin almunia : deficit procedures need to be stepped up germany had bought time to bring its excessive budget deficit back in line with eu rules , but the grace period is over .
on wednesday , the european commission warned it expected results by the end of 2007 . germany 's public deficit has breached the eu 's limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product since 2002 .
last year , berlin convinced its eu partners to freeze excessive deficit procedures - including financial penalties - against it , following a long struggle with brussels . now though , the european commission has warned germany that it has until the end of 2007 to reduce its budget deficit , or face the possibility of sanctions . the german finance ministry was quick to respond , saying it planned to meet the eu requirement to bring its deficit below the 3 percent level specified in the stability and growth pact . " germany will achieve an underlying structural deficit improvement of about 1 percentage point in the next two years , thus meeting the commission 's guidelines , " the ministry said in a statement . the ministry added that it would release a 2007 draft budget in july that will show its ability to meet the eu deficit limits . the commission , which polices member states ' public finances , said that germany was set to breach the limit again this year but welcomed belt-tightening measures to bring it below the threshold next year . " although the -lrb- european -rrb- commission welcomes the renewed priority attached by the german government to budgetary consolidation , it is clear that the procedure needs to be stepped up to guarantee a lasting correction of the deficit , " economic affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said . huge fi n es in theory , berlin could face huge fines if it fails to rein in its deficit although that would be unlikely if the government sticks to its promises to improve the public accounts . german finance minister peer steinbrück supported the commission 's action , which he saw as boosting the credibility of the eu 's public finances pact . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister peer steinbrück supported the commission 's action " for germany , it is of the highest importance that the credibility of the stability and growth pact be protected in the long-term , " he said in a statement .
" that is why the government agrees with the eu decision . " berlin and paris , whose deficit has also breached eu limits for years , won a formal suspension of disciplinary measures against them at the beginning of last year . damage to stability pact suspension of the measures came only after a lengthy battle with brussels which resulted in the eu rewriting the public finances pact last year and , in effect , watering it down . " after the revision last year , i think from the political point of view the commission and the ministers have learned a lot about the importance of establishing good dialogue channels to avoid these kinds of conflicts , " almunia said . in a recent review of french public finances , paris was let off the hook for further measures on account of efforts to cut its deficit . germany , worried that other euro members would be less disciplined about their public finances , was the main author behind the fiscal rulebook when it was drawn up in 1997 . the revision of the pact was met with scorn from many private and even some public economists , who believed that it no longer had any credibility because member states would have too much leeway to avoid disciplinary measures . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu commission to supervise german spending germany 's new finance minister peer steinbrück is making waves by suggesting an unusual way of avoiding eu sanctions which brussels could impose over berlin 's non-compliance with the stability pact .

on wednesday , the european commission warned it expected results by the end of 2007 . germany 's public deficit has breached the eu 's limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product since 2002 .
last year , berlin convinced its eu partners to freeze excessive deficit procedures - including financial penalties - against it , following a long struggle with brussels . now though , the european commission has warned germany that it has until the end of 2007 to reduce its budget deficit , or face the possibility of sanctions . the german finance ministry was quick to respond , saying it planned to meet the eu requirement to bring its deficit below the 3 percent level specified in the stability and growth pact . " germany will achieve an underlying structural deficit improvement of about 1 percentage point in the next two years , thus meeting the commission 's guidelines , " the ministry said in a statement . the ministry added that it would release a 2007 draft budget in july that will show its ability to meet the eu deficit limits . the commission , which polices member states ' public finances , said that germany was set to breach the limit again this year but welcomed belt-tightening measures to bring it below the threshold next year . " although the -lrb- european -rrb- commission welcomes the renewed priority attached by the german government to budgetary consolidation , it is clear that the procedure needs to be stepped up to guarantee a lasting correction of the deficit , " economic affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said . huge fi n es in theory , berlin could face huge fines if it fails to rein in its deficit although that would be unlikely if the government sticks to its promises to improve the public accounts . german finance minister peer steinbrück supported the commission 's action , which he saw as boosting the credibility of the eu 's public finances pact . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister peer steinbrück supported the commission 's action " for germany , it is of the highest importance that the credibility of the stability and growth pact be protected in the long-term , " he said in a statement .
" that is why the government agrees with the eu decision . " berlin and paris , whose deficit has also breached eu limits for years , won a formal suspension of disciplinary measures against them at the beginning of last year . damage to stability pact suspension of the measures came only after a lengthy battle with brussels which resulted in the eu rewriting the public finances pact last year and , in effect , watering it down . " after the revision last year , i think from the political point of view the commission and the ministers have learned a lot about the importance of establishing good dialogue channels to avoid these kinds of conflicts , " almunia said . in a recent review of french public finances , paris was let off the hook for further measures on account of efforts to cut its deficit . germany , worried that other euro members would be less disciplined about their public finances , was the main author behind the fiscal rulebook when it was drawn up in 1997 . the revision of the pact was met with scorn from many private and even some public economists , who believed that it no longer had any credibility because member states would have too much leeway to avoid disciplinary measures . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu commission to supervise german spending germany 's new finance minister peer steinbrück is making waves by suggesting an unusual way of avoiding eu sanctions which brussels could impose over berlin 's non-compliance with the stability pact .

drawing on a classified bundestag report , the " new york times " reported thursday that german spies helped the us military invasion of iraq in an intelligence-sharing deal approved by top german officials . the intelligence sharing deal , which ended when the invasion came to an end , flies in the face of official german opposition to the war and is contained in a classified report by the german parliament , the bundestag , a copy of which was obtained by the newspaper . it also follows strong denials from berlin and the pentagon that german intelligence -lrb- bnd -rrb- had provided a copy of iraq 's war plans to the us military months before the us invasion , as the new york times reported monday . a scoop - or rehashed news ? the german parliamentary committee report , on which the times based its story , was issued after a series of recent , closed-door hearings on the role of german intelligence during the iraq war .
parts of the report were made available to the public , but several key references defined as classified were left out . the german media has not , for example , had access to certain information deemed sensitive by the bnd - such as the existence of a german intelligence officer in franks ' office , because , according to the report , this information overlaps with the espionage activities of another country , in this case the us . it was n't until the newspaper published its report that many more of the details became known . nonetheless , the claims are being downplayed in germany . according to social democratic parliamentarian olaf scholz , the article reveals nothing new . " the report is dredging up the same old news that has nothing to do with serious research , " he said in berlin , adding that us coverage of the issue is taking on " absurd characteristics . " approval from the top bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general tommy franks in reviewing german-american cooperation before and during the iraq war , german lawmakers said in their report that , starting in early 2003 , a german intelligence officer was stationed in the office of us general tommy franks , who headed the us central command and the invading forces in iraq . two other german spies in baghdad passed on information to their colleague in franks ' office mostly about sites in the iraqi capital , such as embassies and suspected location of hostages , to be avoided by us bombs . they also provided information on iraqi police and military units in baghdad , although the german report stressed that the spies did not direct airstrikes against iraqi leaders or forces , the daily said . in all , the german spies provided 25 reports to the us central command and were awarded american meritorious medals , after the invasion came to an end , in recognition of the " critical information to united states central command to support combat operations in iraq . " the german report , said the times , made clear that the intelligence-sharing arrangement was approved in late 2002 at the highest levels of the german government , including frank-walter steinmeier , the chief of staff for gerhard schröder , then the german chancellor , and by the foreign minister at the time , joschka fischer .
steinmeier is now germany 's foreign minister . " verbally imposed " conditions were " verbally imposed " on the german intelligence officials , the report said .
the liaison officer in franks ' office , for example , was to provide " no support for the strategic air war offensive carried out by the usa . " he was also instructed to give out no " information with direct relevance for the tactical air and land warfare on the part of the usa . " the classified version of the report was provided by a german journalist to a times reporter in germany , who read the text into a tape recorder so it could be transcribed and translated . the deputy spokesman for the german government consulted by telephone by the new york times did not comment on the newspaper 's account . " i do n't know the classified version .

producers say the outlook for 2006 is good , citing rising demand and increased investment . the german gas and oil industry is small , but german gas production in particular makes up a significant chunk of the country 's energy supply . with sales on the rise in 2005 , german oil and gas producers pumped money into investment .
the federation of the german gas and oil industry , or weg , said at its annual press conference that german energy firms boosted investment by more than a third last year , to approximately 1.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : limited resources mean gas will remain expensive , although stable georg schöning , head of german energy and water company rwe dea ag is also head of the weg .
he chalked the good results up to the world 's seemingly unquenchable thirst for oil , especially in china . " we saw already a year ago , that huge demand exists in china .
it was admittedly slightly lower in 2004 , but in general , global demand has kept growing . " industry expects price stability the oil and gas companies and their subcontractors are counting on continued strong demand for oil .
although high demand has led to sharp oil and gas price increases in the past , the weg predicts this trend is waning . the weg also said it expects less price fluctuation than in the last year , although no price decrease is expected .
this is mainly a question of supply and demand : in the short term , output can not be increased . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rwe headquarters in essen , germany " we 've seen global demand grow in the last couple of years and we have to say that the possibility of increasing output further is limited .
that means … extremely limited availability of extra supplies , " schöning said no one at the weg is keen to talk about a future when oil reserves run out .
they stress , instead , the projection that currently known oil reserves will last for another 50 years , and gas reserves should last another 60 years . political stability is key " the oil and gas reserves are predominantly located in the middle- and far east .
that means areas that we , as a western industry , do n't always have easy access to -lrb- the reserves -rrb- , neither do we have any influence on these countries ' political stability , " schöning said . this supply could be damaged by political instability , such as recent developments in nigeria , where local regions have been fighting over their share of oil wealth .
german oil producers hope transparency is the answer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a refinery in the state of sachsen anhalt schöning said his company rwe is an example .
" our activities in egypt … are clearly regulated through production-sharing agreements .
that means contractual agreements exist with the countries stating exactly what is due to the state and what belongs to the oil companies . " despite the turbulence in world markets and increasing tensions in the major oil-producing nations , weg claims germany 's oil supply is secure .
the fact that the country produces even a fraction of its own oil supply adds an element of stability , schöning said . germany cites balanced supply " here in germany , we have a fairly balanced supply structure .
this applies to both the oil and gas markets , " said schöning .
" if we take the uk as an example , we can see that local oil production will in the future no longer be possible , and they 'll have to rely on the global market for all their energy needs .
this in turn means that price volatility is likely to increase . " one fifth of germany 's gas supply comes from national sources , although its gas production has been decreasing for several years .
moreover , technologically , it is becoming increasingly difficult for germany to exploit its own gas resources in an economically viable manner . schöning discounted the effects political conflicts could have on energy supplies , saying , " i 'm really not that greatly concerned about oil supplies for europe as a whole , as the past has proven .

why are germany 's immigrants so reluctant to become cops ? it may be a magnet for foreigners and home to people from over 180 countries as its tourism officials love to point out .
but walk into a public administrative building in berlin and chances are you 'll be hard pressed to find any sign of its ethnic diversity among the employees . less than 2 percent of its ethnic minorities are estimated to work in the public service sector despite making up 13 percent of berlin 's 3-million-strong population .
studies show the pattern is reflected across all of germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish police officer aspirants try out some police gear in berlin now , one institution has decided to turn the tide .
the berlin police force wants to try to fill in some 10 percent of the 200 new recruits they accept this year with ethnic minorities , particularly those who speak fluent turkish , arabic , polish , serbo-croatian and russian . " berlin is a multicultural city and the police force certainly does n't reflect that , " said rainer gerlach , head of the personnel department of the berlin police .
" officers from ethnic minorities are n't just valuable when it comes to overcoming language barriers ; they bring in a whole new dimension of sensitivity towards other cultures . " uphill task but recruiting ethnic minority police officers may be easier said than done . ever since the early 1990s , following a tweaking of the law to pave the way for non-germans in the police force , successive german states including berlin have tried poster campaigns , information seminars , informal chats and television ads among other things to lure immigrants into their police forces - without success . ethnic minorities still make up only around 1 percent of the entire german police force , according to rafael behr , a former police officer in the state of hesse and sociologist and author . " in some eastern states like saxony and thuringia , they 're almost non-existent , " he said . educatio n the biggest stumbli n g block bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's police force has a tough time finding ethnic minority officers so why does germany have such few ethnic minorities in the police force at a time when their presence there would largely be seen as asserting multicultural credentials and being more representative of the country 's racial mix ? the most frequently cited reason is that immigrants simply do n't pass the grueling police entrance tests which require high fitness levels as well as a good high school degree . " the entry bar is very high in germany , " behr said .
" that 's where most immigrants who are neither fluent in german nor in their own mother tongue stumble .
and those who are well educated do n't go to the police but go on to study law , medicine or engineering . " in addition , it 's not always easy for an immigrant to choose to be a cop - a profession that 's often treated with high levels of mistrust by families and friends who have bad memories of the police from the countries they come from .

" germany will achieve an underlying structural deficit improvement of about 1 percentage point in the next two years , thus meeting the commission 's guidelines , " the ministry said in a statement . the ministry added that it would release a 2007 draft budget in july that will show its ability to meet the eu deficit limits . the commission , which polices member states ' public finances , said that germany was set to breach the limit again this year but welcomed belt-tightening measures to bring it below the threshold next year .

why are germany 's immigrants so reluctant to become cops ? it may be a magnet for foreigners and home to people from over 180 countries as its tourism officials love to point out .
but walk into a public administrative building in berlin and chances are you 'll be hard pressed to find any sign of its ethnic diversity among the employees . less than 2 percent of its ethnic minorities are estimated to work in the public service sector despite making up 13 percent of berlin 's 3-million-strong population .
studies show the pattern is reflected across all of germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish police officer aspirants try out some police gear in berlin now , one institution has decided to turn the tide .
the berlin police force wants to try to fill in some 10 percent of the 200 new recruits they accept this year with ethnic minorities , particularly those who speak fluent turkish , arabic , polish , serbo-croatian and russian . " berlin is a multicultural city and the police force certainly does n't reflect that , " said rainer gerlach , head of the personnel department of the berlin police .
" officers from ethnic minorities are n't just valuable when it comes to overcoming language barriers ; they bring in a whole new dimension of sensitivity towards other cultures . " uphill task but recruiting ethnic minority police officers may be easier said than done . ever since the early 1990s , following a tweaking of the law to pave the way for non-germans in the police force , successive german states including berlin have tried poster campaigns , information seminars , informal chats and television ads among other things to lure immigrants into their police forces - without success . ethnic minorities still make up only around 1 percent of the entire german police force , according to rafael behr , a former police officer in the state of hesse and sociologist and author . " in some eastern states like saxony and thuringia , they 're almost non-existent , " he said . educatio n the biggest stumbli n g block bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's police force has a tough time finding ethnic minority officers so why does germany have such few ethnic minorities in the police force at a time when their presence there would largely be seen as asserting multicultural credentials and being more representative of the country 's racial mix ? the most frequently cited reason is that immigrants simply do n't pass the grueling police entrance tests which require high fitness levels as well as a good high school degree . " the entry bar is very high in germany , " behr said .
" that 's where most immigrants who are neither fluent in german nor in their own mother tongue stumble .
and those who are well educated do n't go to the police but go on to study law , medicine or engineering . " in addition , it 's not always easy for an immigrant to choose to be a cop - a profession that 's often treated with high levels of mistrust by families and friends who have bad memories of the police from the countries they come from . " it 's amazing for instance what some officers of turkish origin have to go through when they are on patrol , " said klaus eisenreich , head of the police union in berlin .
" they 're often labeled as ' traitors ' by their own communities . " " psychological barriers " omid nouripour , an iranian-german green party parliamentarian said there are deeper reasons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish soccer fans in kreuzberg , berlin " the psychological barriers between the locals and the new-locals are simply too high in this country , " said nouripour , adding he did n't believe the police had done enough to make the profession more attractive to ethnic minorities . " it 's not easy for immigrants to gain access to resources , " he said .
" even in the public service , you have to have a german passport to become a civil servant . " other cou n tries ahead , but with ow n problems even as germany wrings its hands over the issue , a look beyond its borders shows that other countries seem to be miles ahead . britain 's metropolitan police has doubled the proportion of ethnic minority officers since 1998 - they currently make up some 11 percent of the force - and even holland has considerably hiked the number in its police force . but experts caution that both have managed to do so by following an indirect policy of " positive discrimination " or affirmative action - something that 's taboo in germany . " in holland , for instance , new recruits do n't have to be fluent in dutch ; they 're encouraged to learn the language during training , " behr said , adding that such concessions often led to negative fallouts . " officers within the force end up being treated as second-class citizens , " he said , adding that holland had a discrimination problem within its ranks and even britain had an entire labor union for black officers . on the other hand , germany 's rigidly standardized entry requirements for the police force has ended up keeping ethnic minorities away while ensuring it 's not plagued by discrimination and foul play . " the few ethnic minorities we have in the force are thus 99 percent identical to their german counterparts , " behr said .

drawing on a classified bundestag report , the " new york times " reported thursday that german spies helped the us military invasion of iraq in an intelligence-sharing deal approved by top german officials . the intelligence sharing deal , which ended when the invasion came to an end , flies in the face of official german opposition to the war and is contained in a classified report by the german parliament , the bundestag , a copy of which was obtained by the newspaper . it also follows strong denials from berlin and the pentagon that german intelligence -lrb- bnd -rrb- had provided a copy of iraq 's war plans to the us military months before the us invasion , as the new york times reported monday . a scoop - or rehashed news ? the german parliamentary committee report , on which the times based its story , was issued after a series of recent , closed-door hearings on the role of german intelligence during the iraq war .
parts of the report were made available to the public , but several key references defined as classified were left out . the german media has not , for example , had access to certain information deemed sensitive by the bnd - such as the existence of a german intelligence officer in franks ' office , because , according to the report , this information overlaps with the espionage activities of another country , in this case the us . it was n't until the newspaper published its report that many more of the details became known . nonetheless , the claims are being downplayed in germany . according to social democratic parliamentarian olaf scholz , the article reveals nothing new .

" the german report , said the times , made clear that the intelligence-sharing arrangement was approved in late 2002 at the highest levels of the german government , including frank-walter steinmeier , the chief of staff for gerhard schröder , then the german chancellor , and by the foreign minister at the time , joschka fischer .

why are germany 's immigrants so reluctant to become cops ? it may be a magnet for foreigners and home to people from over 180 countries as its tourism officials love to point out .
but walk into a public administrative building in berlin and chances are you 'll be hard pressed to find any sign of its ethnic diversity among the employees . less than 2 percent of its ethnic minorities are estimated to work in the public service sector despite making up 13 percent of berlin 's 3-million-strong population .
studies show the pattern is reflected across all of germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish police officer aspirants try out some police gear in berlin now , one institution has decided to turn the tide .
the berlin police force wants to try to fill in some 10 percent of the 200 new recruits they accept this year with ethnic minorities , particularly those who speak fluent turkish , arabic , polish , serbo-croatian and russian . " berlin is a multicultural city and the police force certainly does n't reflect that , " said rainer gerlach , head of the personnel department of the berlin police .
" officers from ethnic minorities are n't just valuable when it comes to overcoming language barriers ; they bring in a whole new dimension of sensitivity towards other cultures . " uphill task but recruiting ethnic minority police officers may be easier said than done . ever since the early 1990s , following a tweaking of the law to pave the way for non-germans in the police force , successive german states including berlin have tried poster campaigns , information seminars , informal chats and television ads among other things to lure immigrants into their police forces - without success . ethnic minorities still make up only around 1 percent of the entire german police force , according to rafael behr , a former police officer in the state of hesse and sociologist and author . " in some eastern states like saxony and thuringia , they 're almost non-existent , " he said . educatio n the biggest stumbli n g block bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's police force has a tough time finding ethnic minority officers so why does germany have such few ethnic minorities in the police force at a time when their presence there would largely be seen as asserting multicultural credentials and being more representative of the country 's racial mix ? the most frequently cited reason is that immigrants simply do n't pass the grueling police entrance tests which require high fitness levels as well as a good high school degree . " the entry bar is very high in germany , " behr said .
" that 's where most immigrants who are neither fluent in german nor in their own mother tongue stumble .
and those who are well educated do n't go to the police but go on to study law , medicine or engineering . " in addition , it 's not always easy for an immigrant to choose to be a cop - a profession that 's often treated with high levels of mistrust by families and friends who have bad memories of the police from the countries they come from . " it 's amazing for instance what some officers of turkish origin have to go through when they are on patrol , " said klaus eisenreich , head of the police union in berlin .
" they 're often labeled as ' traitors ' by their own communities . " " psychological barriers " omid nouripour , an iranian-german green party parliamentarian said there are deeper reasons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish soccer fans in kreuzberg , berlin " the psychological barriers between the locals and the new-locals are simply too high in this country , " said nouripour , adding he did n't believe the police had done enough to make the profession more attractive to ethnic minorities . " it 's not easy for immigrants to gain access to resources , " he said .
" even in the public service , you have to have a german passport to become a civil servant . " other cou n tries ahead , but with ow n problems even as germany wrings its hands over the issue , a look beyond its borders shows that other countries seem to be miles ahead . britain 's metropolitan police has doubled the proportion of ethnic minority officers since 1998 - they currently make up some 11 percent of the force - and even holland has considerably hiked the number in its police force . but experts caution that both have managed to do so by following an indirect policy of " positive discrimination " or affirmative action - something that 's taboo in germany . " in holland , for instance , new recruits do n't have to be fluent in dutch ; they 're encouraged to learn the language during training , " behr said , adding that such concessions often led to negative fallouts . " officers within the force end up being treated as second-class citizens , " he said , adding that holland had a discrimination problem within its ranks and even britain had an entire labor union for black officers . on the other hand , germany 's rigidly standardized entry requirements for the police force has ended up keeping ethnic minorities away while ensuring it 's not plagued by discrimination and foul play . " the few ethnic minorities we have in the force are thus 99 percent identical to their german counterparts , " behr said .
" the only difference is that an officer might have a turkish surname . " melti n g of borders though there may be no relief in the short time , in the long run reservations about modifying entry rules for immigrants might just become superfluous . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch and german police during a mock riot-control operation last year " the functions of the police are already gradually transcending national borders , " said behr , pointing to last year 's bilateral cooperation between germany and holland when german police accompanied some known soccer hooligans to holland . " without this fixation on ' nation , ' it will be easier for ethnic minorities to play a naturally positive role in the police .

why are germany 's immigrants so reluctant to become cops ? it may be a magnet for foreigners and home to people from over 180 countries as its tourism officials love to point out .
but walk into a public administrative building in berlin and chances are you 'll be hard pressed to find any sign of its ethnic diversity among the employees . less than 2 percent of its ethnic minorities are estimated to work in the public service sector despite making up 13 percent of berlin 's 3-million-strong population .
studies show the pattern is reflected across all of germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish police officer aspirants try out some police gear in berlin now , one institution has decided to turn the tide .
the berlin police force wants to try to fill in some 10 percent of the 200 new recruits they accept this year with ethnic minorities , particularly those who speak fluent turkish , arabic , polish , serbo-croatian and russian . " berlin is a multicultural city and the police force certainly does n't reflect that , " said rainer gerlach , head of the personnel department of the berlin police .
" officers from ethnic minorities are n't just valuable when it comes to overcoming language barriers ; they bring in a whole new dimension of sensitivity towards other cultures . " uphill task but recruiting ethnic minority police officers may be easier said than done . ever since the early 1990s , following a tweaking of the law to pave the way for non-germans in the police force , successive german states including berlin have tried poster campaigns , information seminars , informal chats and television ads among other things to lure immigrants into their police forces - without success . ethnic minorities still make up only around 1 percent of the entire german police force , according to rafael behr , a former police officer in the state of hesse and sociologist and author . " in some eastern states like saxony and thuringia , they 're almost non-existent , " he said . educatio n the biggest stumbli n g block bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's police force has a tough time finding ethnic minority officers so why does germany have such few ethnic minorities in the police force at a time when their presence there would largely be seen as asserting multicultural credentials and being more representative of the country 's racial mix ? the most frequently cited reason is that immigrants simply do n't pass the grueling police entrance tests which require high fitness levels as well as a good high school degree . " the entry bar is very high in germany , " behr said .
" that 's where most immigrants who are neither fluent in german nor in their own mother tongue stumble .
and those who are well educated do n't go to the police but go on to study law , medicine or engineering . " in addition , it 's not always easy for an immigrant to choose to be a cop - a profession that 's often treated with high levels of mistrust by families and friends who have bad memories of the police from the countries they come from . " it 's amazing for instance what some officers of turkish origin have to go through when they are on patrol , " said klaus eisenreich , head of the police union in berlin .

" even in the public service , you have to have a german passport to become a civil servant . " other cou n tries ahead , but with ow n problems even as germany wrings its hands over the issue , a look beyond its borders shows that other countries seem to be miles ahead . britain 's metropolitan police has doubled the proportion of ethnic minority officers since 1998 - they currently make up some 11 percent of the force - and even holland has considerably hiked the number in its police force . but experts caution that both have managed to do so by following an indirect policy of " positive discrimination " or affirmative action - something that 's taboo in germany . " in holland , for instance , new recruits do n't have to be fluent in dutch ; they 're encouraged to learn the language during training , " behr said , adding that such concessions often led to negative fallouts . " officers within the force end up being treated as second-class citizens , " he said , adding that holland had a discrimination problem within its ranks and even britain had an entire labor union for black officers . on the other hand , germany 's rigidly standardized entry requirements for the police force has ended up keeping ethnic minorities away while ensuring it 's not plagued by discrimination and foul play .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 02.03.2006 german energy industry upbeat for 2006 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany provides one-fifth of its own gas supply , helping stability rising energy demand has boosted trade in the german oil and gas industry .
producers say the outlook for 2006 is good , citing rising demand and increased investment . the german gas and oil industry is small , but german gas production in particular makes up a significant chunk of the country 's energy supply . with sales on the rise in 2005 , german oil and gas producers pumped money into investment .
the federation of the german gas and oil industry , or weg , said at its annual press conference that german energy firms boosted investment by more than a third last year , to approximately 1.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : limited resources mean gas will remain expensive , although stable georg schöning , head of german energy and water company rwe dea ag is also head of the weg .
he chalked the good results up to the world 's seemingly unquenchable thirst for oil , especially in china . " we saw already a year ago , that huge demand exists in china .
it was admittedly slightly lower in 2004 , but in general , global demand has kept growing . " industry expects price stability the oil and gas companies and their subcontractors are counting on continued strong demand for oil .
although high demand has led to sharp oil and gas price increases in the past , the weg predicts this trend is waning . the weg also said it expects less price fluctuation than in the last year , although no price decrease is expected .
this is mainly a question of supply and demand : in the short term , output can not be increased . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rwe headquarters in essen , germany " we 've seen global demand grow in the last couple of years and we have to say that the possibility of increasing output further is limited .
that means … extremely limited availability of extra supplies , " schöning said no one at the weg is keen to talk about a future when oil reserves run out .
they stress , instead , the projection that currently known oil reserves will last for another 50 years , and gas reserves should last another 60 years . political stability is key " the oil and gas reserves are predominantly located in the middle- and far east .
that means areas that we , as a western industry , do n't always have easy access to -lrb- the reserves -rrb- , neither do we have any influence on these countries ' political stability , " schöning said . this supply could be damaged by political instability , such as recent developments in nigeria , where local regions have been fighting over their share of oil wealth .
german oil producers hope transparency is the answer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a refinery in the state of sachsen anhalt schöning said his company rwe is an example .
" our activities in egypt … are clearly regulated through production-sharing agreements .
that means contractual agreements exist with the countries stating exactly what is due to the state and what belongs to the oil companies . " despite the turbulence in world markets and increasing tensions in the major oil-producing nations , weg claims germany 's oil supply is secure .
the fact that the country produces even a fraction of its own oil supply adds an element of stability , schöning said . germany cites balanced supply " here in germany , we have a fairly balanced supply structure .
this applies to both the oil and gas markets , " said schöning .
" if we take the uk as an example , we can see that local oil production will in the future no longer be possible , and they 'll have to rely on the global market for all their energy needs .
this in turn means that price volatility is likely to increase . " one fifth of germany 's gas supply comes from national sources , although its gas production has been decreasing for several years .
moreover , technologically , it is becoming increasingly difficult for germany to exploit its own gas resources in an economically viable manner . schöning discounted the effects political conflicts could have on energy supplies , saying , " i 'm really not that greatly concerned about oil supplies for europe as a whole , as the past has proven .
none of the political conflicts we 've experienced have threatened supplies to any great extent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 02.03.2006 german energy industry upbeat for 2006 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany provides one-fifth of its own gas supply , helping stability rising energy demand has boosted trade in the german oil and gas industry .
producers say the outlook for 2006 is good , citing rising demand and increased investment . the german gas and oil industry is small , but german gas production in particular makes up a significant chunk of the country 's energy supply . with sales on the rise in 2005 , german oil and gas producers pumped money into investment .
the federation of the german gas and oil industry , or weg , said at its annual press conference that german energy firms boosted investment by more than a third last year , to approximately 1.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : limited resources mean gas will remain expensive , although stable georg schöning , head of german energy and water company rwe dea ag is also head of the weg .
he chalked the good results up to the world 's seemingly unquenchable thirst for oil , especially in china . " we saw already a year ago , that huge demand exists in china .
it was admittedly slightly lower in 2004 , but in general , global demand has kept growing . " industry expects price stability the oil and gas companies and their subcontractors are counting on continued strong demand for oil .
although high demand has led to sharp oil and gas price increases in the past , the weg predicts this trend is waning . the weg also said it expects less price fluctuation than in the last year , although no price decrease is expected .
this is mainly a question of supply and demand : in the short term , output can not be increased . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rwe headquarters in essen , germany " we 've seen global demand grow in the last couple of years and we have to say that the possibility of increasing output further is limited .
that means … extremely limited availability of extra supplies , " schöning said no one at the weg is keen to talk about a future when oil reserves run out .
they stress , instead , the projection that currently known oil reserves will last for another 50 years , and gas reserves should last another 60 years . political stability is key " the oil and gas reserves are predominantly located in the middle- and far east .
that means areas that we , as a western industry , do n't always have easy access to -lrb- the reserves -rrb- , neither do we have any influence on these countries ' political stability , " schöning said . this supply could be damaged by political instability , such as recent developments in nigeria , where local regions have been fighting over their share of oil wealth .
german oil producers hope transparency is the answer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a refinery in the state of sachsen anhalt schöning said his company rwe is an example .
" our activities in egypt … are clearly regulated through production-sharing agreements .
that means contractual agreements exist with the countries stating exactly what is due to the state and what belongs to the oil companies . " despite the turbulence in world markets and increasing tensions in the major oil-producing nations , weg claims germany 's oil supply is secure .
the fact that the country produces even a fraction of its own oil supply adds an element of stability , schöning said . germany cites balanced supply " here in germany , we have a fairly balanced supply structure .
this applies to both the oil and gas markets , " said schöning .
" if we take the uk as an example , we can see that local oil production will in the future no longer be possible , and they 'll have to rely on the global market for all their energy needs .
this in turn means that price volatility is likely to increase . " one fifth of germany 's gas supply comes from national sources , although its gas production has been decreasing for several years .
moreover , technologically , it is becoming increasingly difficult for germany to exploit its own gas resources in an economically viable manner . schöning discounted the effects political conflicts could have on energy supplies , saying , " i 'm really not that greatly concerned about oil supplies for europe as a whole , as the past has proven .
none of the political conflicts we 've experienced have threatened supplies to any great extent .

drawing on a classified bundestag report , the " new york times " reported thursday that german spies helped the us military invasion of iraq in an intelligence-sharing deal approved by top german officials . the intelligence sharing deal , which ended when the invasion came to an end , flies in the face of official german opposition to the war and is contained in a classified report by the german parliament , the bundestag , a copy of which was obtained by the newspaper . it also follows strong denials from berlin and the pentagon that german intelligence -lrb- bnd -rrb- had provided a copy of iraq 's war plans to the us military months before the us invasion , as the new york times reported monday . a scoop - or rehashed news ? the german parliamentary committee report , on which the times based its story , was issued after a series of recent , closed-door hearings on the role of german intelligence during the iraq war .
parts of the report were made available to the public , but several key references defined as classified were left out . the german media has not , for example , had access to certain information deemed sensitive by the bnd - such as the existence of a german intelligence officer in franks ' office , because , according to the report , this information overlaps with the espionage activities of another country , in this case the us . it was n't until the newspaper published its report that many more of the details became known . nonetheless , the claims are being downplayed in germany . according to social democratic parliamentarian olaf scholz , the article reveals nothing new . " the report is dredging up the same old news that has nothing to do with serious research , " he said in berlin , adding that us coverage of the issue is taking on " absurd characteristics . " approval from the top bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general tommy franks in reviewing german-american cooperation before and during the iraq war , german lawmakers said in their report that , starting in early 2003 , a german intelligence officer was stationed in the office of us general tommy franks , who headed the us central command and the invading forces in iraq . two other german spies in baghdad passed on information to their colleague in franks ' office mostly about sites in the iraqi capital , such as embassies and suspected location of hostages , to be avoided by us bombs . they also provided information on iraqi police and military units in baghdad , although the german report stressed that the spies did not direct airstrikes against iraqi leaders or forces , the daily said . in all , the german spies provided 25 reports to the us central command and were awarded american meritorious medals , after the invasion came to an end , in recognition of the " critical information to united states central command to support combat operations in iraq . " the german report , said the times , made clear that the intelligence-sharing arrangement was approved in late 2002 at the highest levels of the german government , including frank-walter steinmeier , the chief of staff for gerhard schröder , then the german chancellor , and by the foreign minister at the time , joschka fischer .
steinmeier is now germany 's foreign minister . " verbally imposed " conditions were " verbally imposed " on the german intelligence officials , the report said .
the liaison officer in franks ' office , for example , was to provide " no support for the strategic air war offensive carried out by the usa . " he was also instructed to give out no " information with direct relevance for the tactical air and land warfare on the part of the usa . " the classified version of the report was provided by a german journalist to a times reporter in germany , who read the text into a tape recorder so it could be transcribed and translated . the deputy spokesman for the german government consulted by telephone by the new york times did not comment on the newspaper 's account . " i do n't know the classified version .

producers say the outlook for 2006 is good , citing rising demand and increased investment . the german gas and oil industry is small , but german gas production in particular makes up a significant chunk of the country 's energy supply . with sales on the rise in 2005 , german oil and gas producers pumped money into investment .
the federation of the german gas and oil industry , or weg , said at its annual press conference that german energy firms boosted investment by more than a third last year , to approximately 1.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : limited resources mean gas will remain expensive , although stable georg schöning , head of german energy and water company rwe dea ag is also head of the weg .
he chalked the good results up to the world 's seemingly unquenchable thirst for oil , especially in china . " we saw already a year ago , that huge demand exists in china .
it was admittedly slightly lower in 2004 , but in general , global demand has kept growing . " industry expects price stability the oil and gas companies and their subcontractors are counting on continued strong demand for oil .
although high demand has led to sharp oil and gas price increases in the past , the weg predicts this trend is waning . the weg also said it expects less price fluctuation than in the last year , although no price decrease is expected .
this is mainly a question of supply and demand : in the short term , output can not be increased . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rwe headquarters in essen , germany " we 've seen global demand grow in the last couple of years and we have to say that the possibility of increasing output further is limited .
that means … extremely limited availability of extra supplies , " schöning said no one at the weg is keen to talk about a future when oil reserves run out .
they stress , instead , the projection that currently known oil reserves will last for another 50 years , and gas reserves should last another 60 years . political stability is key " the oil and gas reserves are predominantly located in the middle- and far east .
that means areas that we , as a western industry , do n't always have easy access to -lrb- the reserves -rrb- , neither do we have any influence on these countries ' political stability , " schöning said . this supply could be damaged by political instability , such as recent developments in nigeria , where local regions have been fighting over their share of oil wealth .
german oil producers hope transparency is the answer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a refinery in the state of sachsen anhalt schöning said his company rwe is an example .
" our activities in egypt … are clearly regulated through production-sharing agreements .
that means contractual agreements exist with the countries stating exactly what is due to the state and what belongs to the oil companies . " despite the turbulence in world markets and increasing tensions in the major oil-producing nations , weg claims germany 's oil supply is secure .
the fact that the country produces even a fraction of its own oil supply adds an element of stability , schöning said . germany cites balanced supply " here in germany , we have a fairly balanced supply structure .
this applies to both the oil and gas markets , " said schöning .
" if we take the uk as an example , we can see that local oil production will in the future no longer be possible , and they 'll have to rely on the global market for all their energy needs .
this in turn means that price volatility is likely to increase . " one fifth of germany 's gas supply comes from national sources , although its gas production has been decreasing for several years .
moreover , technologically , it is becoming increasingly difficult for germany to exploit its own gas resources in an economically viable manner . schöning discounted the effects political conflicts could have on energy supplies , saying , " i 'm really not that greatly concerned about oil supplies for europe as a whole , as the past has proven .
none of the political conflicts we 've experienced have threatened supplies to any great extent .

that is expected to raise 200 million euros per year in development aid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : philippe douste-blazy -lrb- left -rrb- foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said the money would go to a central medicine buying facility france and brazil are working to set up which would notably work to give aids and hiv sufferers cheaper and easier access to anti-retroviral drugs . the united states , however , is hostile to that idea and was only present at the conference in the status of observer , not participant . germany drags its feet a further 25 countries , including germany , belgium , austria , south africa , south korea and mexico , elected not to impose the tax but were willing to make financial contributions to the project - much to the chagrin of the german green party , which urged berlin to follow the french example . thilo hoppe , who heads the bundestag 's development committee , told the neue osnabrücker zeitung that he was disappointed by the government 's failure to get on board . " the least it can do is to follow france 's lead , " he said .
" -lrb- the tax -rrb- would be a first step , " he added , towards achieving the increase in the development budget set for 2015 . optimism overall , the head of the un agency fighting aids , peter piot , said he was optimistic about the moves sponsored by france and brazil . it was " absolutely necessary " for countries to come up with new ways of raising development aid , he told afp , but only " on condition that that is not a pretext for states to reduce their contributions elsewhere .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 02.03.2006 german energy industry upbeat for 2006 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany provides one-fifth of its own gas supply , helping stability rising energy demand has boosted trade in the german oil and gas industry .
producers say the outlook for 2006 is good , citing rising demand and increased investment . the german gas and oil industry is small , but german gas production in particular makes up a significant chunk of the country 's energy supply . with sales on the rise in 2005 , german oil and gas producers pumped money into investment .
the federation of the german gas and oil industry , or weg , said at its annual press conference that german energy firms boosted investment by more than a third last year , to approximately 1.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : limited resources mean gas will remain expensive , although stable georg schöning , head of german energy and water company rwe dea ag is also head of the weg .
he chalked the good results up to the world 's seemingly unquenchable thirst for oil , especially in china . " we saw already a year ago , that huge demand exists in china .
it was admittedly slightly lower in 2004 , but in general , global demand has kept growing . " industry expects price stability the oil and gas companies and their subcontractors are counting on continued strong demand for oil .
although high demand has led to sharp oil and gas price increases in the past , the weg predicts this trend is waning . the weg also said it expects less price fluctuation than in the last year , although no price decrease is expected .
this is mainly a question of supply and demand : in the short term , output can not be increased . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rwe headquarters in essen , germany " we 've seen global demand grow in the last couple of years and we have to say that the possibility of increasing output further is limited .
that means … extremely limited availability of extra supplies , " schöning said no one at the weg is keen to talk about a future when oil reserves run out .
they stress , instead , the projection that currently known oil reserves will last for another 50 years , and gas reserves should last another 60 years . political stability is key " the oil and gas reserves are predominantly located in the middle- and far east .
that means areas that we , as a western industry , do n't always have easy access to -lrb- the reserves -rrb- , neither do we have any influence on these countries ' political stability , " schöning said . this supply could be damaged by political instability , such as recent developments in nigeria , where local regions have been fighting over their share of oil wealth .
german oil producers hope transparency is the answer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a refinery in the state of sachsen anhalt schöning said his company rwe is an example .
" our activities in egypt … are clearly regulated through production-sharing agreements .
that means contractual agreements exist with the countries stating exactly what is due to the state and what belongs to the oil companies . " despite the turbulence in world markets and increasing tensions in the major oil-producing nations , weg claims germany 's oil supply is secure .
the fact that the country produces even a fraction of its own oil supply adds an element of stability , schöning said . germany cites balanced supply " here in germany , we have a fairly balanced supply structure .
this applies to both the oil and gas markets , " said schöning .
" if we take the uk as an example , we can see that local oil production will in the future no longer be possible , and they 'll have to rely on the global market for all their energy needs .
this in turn means that price volatility is likely to increase . " one fifth of germany 's gas supply comes from national sources , although its gas production has been decreasing for several years .
moreover , technologically , it is becoming increasingly difficult for germany to exploit its own gas resources in an economically viable manner . schöning discounted the effects political conflicts could have on energy supplies , saying , " i 'm really not that greatly concerned about oil supplies for europe as a whole , as the past has proven .
none of the political conflicts we 've experienced have threatened supplies to any great extent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.03.2006 wanted : ethnic minority cops for germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not even a sexy bike , it seems , can get germany 's ethnic minorities excited the berlin police force wants recruits from the city 's considerable ethnic minorities , but similar efforts have met with scant success in the past .
why are germany 's immigrants so reluctant to become cops ? it may be a magnet for foreigners and home to people from over 180 countries as its tourism officials love to point out .
but walk into a public administrative building in berlin and chances are you 'll be hard pressed to find any sign of its ethnic diversity among the employees . less than 2 percent of its ethnic minorities are estimated to work in the public service sector despite making up 13 percent of berlin 's 3-million-strong population .
studies show the pattern is reflected across all of germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish police officer aspirants try out some police gear in berlin now , one institution has decided to turn the tide .
the berlin police force wants to try to fill in some 10 percent of the 200 new recruits they accept this year with ethnic minorities , particularly those who speak fluent turkish , arabic , polish , serbo-croatian and russian . " berlin is a multicultural city and the police force certainly does n't reflect that , " said rainer gerlach , head of the personnel department of the berlin police .
" officers from ethnic minorities are n't just valuable when it comes to overcoming language barriers ; they bring in a whole new dimension of sensitivity towards other cultures . " uphill task but recruiting ethnic minority police officers may be easier said than done . ever since the early 1990s , following a tweaking of the law to pave the way for non-germans in the police force , successive german states including berlin have tried poster campaigns , information seminars , informal chats and television ads among other things to lure immigrants into their police forces - without success . ethnic minorities still make up only around 1 percent of the entire german police force , according to rafael behr , a former police officer in the state of hesse and sociologist and author . " in some eastern states like saxony and thuringia , they 're almost non-existent , " he said . educatio n the biggest stumbli n g block bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's police force has a tough time finding ethnic minority officers so why does germany have such few ethnic minorities in the police force at a time when their presence there would largely be seen as asserting multicultural credentials and being more representative of the country 's racial mix ? the most frequently cited reason is that immigrants simply do n't pass the grueling police entrance tests which require high fitness levels as well as a good high school degree . " the entry bar is very high in germany , " behr said .
" that 's where most immigrants who are neither fluent in german nor in their own mother tongue stumble .
and those who are well educated do n't go to the police but go on to study law , medicine or engineering . " in addition , it 's not always easy for an immigrant to choose to be a cop - a profession that 's often treated with high levels of mistrust by families and friends who have bad memories of the police from the countries they come from . " it 's amazing for instance what some officers of turkish origin have to go through when they are on patrol , " said klaus eisenreich , head of the police union in berlin .
" they 're often labeled as ' traitors ' by their own communities . " " psychological barriers " omid nouripour , an iranian-german green party parliamentarian said there are deeper reasons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish soccer fans in kreuzberg , berlin " the psychological barriers between the locals and the new-locals are simply too high in this country , " said nouripour , adding he did n't believe the police had done enough to make the profession more attractive to ethnic minorities . " it 's not easy for immigrants to gain access to resources , " he said .
" even in the public service , you have to have a german passport to become a civil servant . " other cou n tries ahead , but with ow n problems even as germany wrings its hands over the issue , a look beyond its borders shows that other countries seem to be miles ahead . britain 's metropolitan police has doubled the proportion of ethnic minority officers since 1998 - they currently make up some 11 percent of the force - and even holland has considerably hiked the number in its police force . but experts caution that both have managed to do so by following an indirect policy of " positive discrimination " or affirmative action - something that 's taboo in germany . " in holland , for instance , new recruits do n't have to be fluent in dutch ; they 're encouraged to learn the language during training , " behr said , adding that such concessions often led to negative fallouts . " officers within the force end up being treated as second-class citizens , " he said , adding that holland had a discrimination problem within its ranks and even britain had an entire labor union for black officers . on the other hand , germany 's rigidly standardized entry requirements for the police force has ended up keeping ethnic minorities away while ensuring it 's not plagued by discrimination and foul play . " the few ethnic minorities we have in the force are thus 99 percent identical to their german counterparts , " behr said .
" the only difference is that an officer might have a turkish surname . " melti n g of borders though there may be no relief in the short time , in the long run reservations about modifying entry rules for immigrants might just become superfluous . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch and german police during a mock riot-control operation last year " the functions of the police are already gradually transcending national borders , " said behr , pointing to last year 's bilateral cooperation between germany and holland when german police accompanied some known soccer hooligans to holland . " without this fixation on ' nation , ' it will be easier for ethnic minorities to play a naturally positive role in the police .

why are germany 's immigrants so reluctant to become cops ? it may be a magnet for foreigners and home to people from over 180 countries as its tourism officials love to point out .
but walk into a public administrative building in berlin and chances are you 'll be hard pressed to find any sign of its ethnic diversity among the employees . less than 2 percent of its ethnic minorities are estimated to work in the public service sector despite making up 13 percent of berlin 's 3-million-strong population .
studies show the pattern is reflected across all of germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish police officer aspirants try out some police gear in berlin now , one institution has decided to turn the tide .
the berlin police force wants to try to fill in some 10 percent of the 200 new recruits they accept this year with ethnic minorities , particularly those who speak fluent turkish , arabic , polish , serbo-croatian and russian . " berlin is a multicultural city and the police force certainly does n't reflect that , " said rainer gerlach , head of the personnel department of the berlin police .
" officers from ethnic minorities are n't just valuable when it comes to overcoming language barriers ; they bring in a whole new dimension of sensitivity towards other cultures . " uphill task but recruiting ethnic minority police officers may be easier said than done . ever since the early 1990s , following a tweaking of the law to pave the way for non-germans in the police force , successive german states including berlin have tried poster campaigns , information seminars , informal chats and television ads among other things to lure immigrants into their police forces - without success . ethnic minorities still make up only around 1 percent of the entire german police force , according to rafael behr , a former police officer in the state of hesse and sociologist and author .

" the entry bar is very high in germany , " behr said .
" that 's where most immigrants who are neither fluent in german nor in their own mother tongue stumble .

" in addition , it 's not always easy for an immigrant to choose to be a cop - a profession that 's often treated with high levels of mistrust by families and friends who have bad memories of the police from the countries they come from . " it 's amazing for instance what some officers of turkish origin have to go through when they are on patrol , " said klaus eisenreich , head of the police union in berlin .

" in holland , for instance , new recruits do n't have to be fluent in dutch ; they 're encouraged to learn the language during training , " behr said , adding that such concessions often led to negative fallouts . " officers within the force end up being treated as second-class citizens , " he said , adding that holland had a discrimination problem within its ranks and even britain had an entire labor union for black officers . on the other hand , germany 's rigidly standardized entry requirements for the police force has ended up keeping ethnic minorities away while ensuring it 's not plagued by discrimination and foul play .

" the least it can do is to follow france 's lead , " he said .
" -lrb- the tax -rrb- would be a first step , " he added , towards achieving the increase in the development budget set for 2015 . optimism overall , the head of the un agency fighting aids , peter piot , said he was optimistic about the moves sponsored by france and brazil . it was " absolutely necessary " for countries to come up with new ways of raising development aid , he told afp , but only " on condition that that is not a pretext for states to reduce their contributions elsewhere .

on wednesday , the european commission warned it expected results by the end of 2007 . germany 's public deficit has breached the eu 's limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product since 2002 .
last year , berlin convinced its eu partners to freeze excessive deficit procedures - including financial penalties - against it , following a long struggle with brussels . now though , the european commission has warned germany that it has until the end of 2007 to reduce its budget deficit , or face the possibility of sanctions . the german finance ministry was quick to respond , saying it planned to meet the eu requirement to bring its deficit below the 3 percent level specified in the stability and growth pact . " germany will achieve an underlying structural deficit improvement of about 1 percentage point in the next two years , thus meeting the commission 's guidelines , " the ministry said in a statement . the ministry added that it would release a 2007 draft budget in july that will show its ability to meet the eu deficit limits . the commission , which polices member states ' public finances , said that germany was set to breach the limit again this year but welcomed belt-tightening measures to bring it below the threshold next year .

" berlin and paris , whose deficit has also breached eu limits for years , won a formal suspension of disciplinary measures against them at the beginning of last year . damage to stability pact suspension of the measures came only after a lengthy battle with brussels which resulted in the eu rewriting the public finances pact last year and , in effect , watering it down . " after the revision last year , i think from the political point of view the commission and the ministers have learned a lot about the importance of establishing good dialogue channels to avoid these kinds of conflicts , " almunia said . in a recent review of french public finances , paris was let off the hook for further measures on account of efforts to cut its deficit . germany , worried that other euro members would be less disciplined about their public finances , was the main author behind the fiscal rulebook when it was drawn up in 1997 . the revision of the pact was met with scorn from many private and even some public economists , who believed that it no longer had any credibility because member states would have too much leeway to avoid disciplinary measures . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu commission to supervise german spending germany 's new finance minister peer steinbrück is making waves by suggesting an unusual way of avoiding eu sanctions which brussels could impose over berlin 's non-compliance with the stability pact .

drawing on a classified bundestag report , the " new york times " reported thursday that german spies helped the us military invasion of iraq in an intelligence-sharing deal approved by top german officials . the intelligence sharing deal , which ended when the invasion came to an end , flies in the face of official german opposition to the war and is contained in a classified report by the german parliament , the bundestag , a copy of which was obtained by the newspaper . it also follows strong denials from berlin and the pentagon that german intelligence -lrb- bnd -rrb- had provided a copy of iraq 's war plans to the us military months before the us invasion , as the new york times reported monday . a scoop - or rehashed news ? the german parliamentary committee report , on which the times based its story , was issued after a series of recent , closed-door hearings on the role of german intelligence during the iraq war .
parts of the report were made available to the public , but several key references defined as classified were left out . the german media has not , for example , had access to certain information deemed sensitive by the bnd - such as the existence of a german intelligence officer in franks ' office , because , according to the report , this information overlaps with the espionage activities of another country , in this case the us . it was n't until the newspaper published its report that many more of the details became known . nonetheless , the claims are being downplayed in germany . according to social democratic parliamentarian olaf scholz , the article reveals nothing new . " the report is dredging up the same old news that has nothing to do with serious research , " he said in berlin , adding that us coverage of the issue is taking on " absurd characteristics . " approval from the top bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general tommy franks in reviewing german-american cooperation before and during the iraq war , german lawmakers said in their report that , starting in early 2003 , a german intelligence officer was stationed in the office of us general tommy franks , who headed the us central command and the invading forces in iraq . two other german spies in baghdad passed on information to their colleague in franks ' office mostly about sites in the iraqi capital , such as embassies and suspected location of hostages , to be avoided by us bombs . they also provided information on iraqi police and military units in baghdad , although the german report stressed that the spies did not direct airstrikes against iraqi leaders or forces , the daily said . in all , the german spies provided 25 reports to the us central command and were awarded american meritorious medals , after the invasion came to an end , in recognition of the " critical information to united states central command to support combat operations in iraq . " the german report , said the times , made clear that the intelligence-sharing arrangement was approved in late 2002 at the highest levels of the german government , including frank-walter steinmeier , the chief of staff for gerhard schröder , then the german chancellor , and by the foreign minister at the time , joschka fischer .
steinmeier is now germany 's foreign minister . " verbally imposed " conditions were " verbally imposed " on the german intelligence officials , the report said .
the liaison officer in franks ' office , for example , was to provide " no support for the strategic air war offensive carried out by the usa . " he was also instructed to give out no " information with direct relevance for the tactical air and land warfare on the part of the usa . " the classified version of the report was provided by a german journalist to a times reporter in germany , who read the text into a tape recorder so it could be transcribed and translated . the deputy spokesman for the german government consulted by telephone by the new york times did not comment on the newspaper 's account . " i do n't know the classified version .

why are germany 's immigrants so reluctant to become cops ? it may be a magnet for foreigners and home to people from over 180 countries as its tourism officials love to point out .
but walk into a public administrative building in berlin and chances are you 'll be hard pressed to find any sign of its ethnic diversity among the employees . less than 2 percent of its ethnic minorities are estimated to work in the public service sector despite making up 13 percent of berlin 's 3-million-strong population .
studies show the pattern is reflected across all of germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish police officer aspirants try out some police gear in berlin now , one institution has decided to turn the tide .
the berlin police force wants to try to fill in some 10 percent of the 200 new recruits they accept this year with ethnic minorities , particularly those who speak fluent turkish , arabic , polish , serbo-croatian and russian . " berlin is a multicultural city and the police force certainly does n't reflect that , " said rainer gerlach , head of the personnel department of the berlin police .
" officers from ethnic minorities are n't just valuable when it comes to overcoming language barriers ; they bring in a whole new dimension of sensitivity towards other cultures . " uphill task but recruiting ethnic minority police officers may be easier said than done . ever since the early 1990s , following a tweaking of the law to pave the way for non-germans in the police force , successive german states including berlin have tried poster campaigns , information seminars , informal chats and television ads among other things to lure immigrants into their police forces - without success . ethnic minorities still make up only around 1 percent of the entire german police force , according to rafael behr , a former police officer in the state of hesse and sociologist and author . " in some eastern states like saxony and thuringia , they 're almost non-existent , " he said . educatio n the biggest stumbli n g block bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's police force has a tough time finding ethnic minority officers so why does germany have such few ethnic minorities in the police force at a time when their presence there would largely be seen as asserting multicultural credentials and being more representative of the country 's racial mix ? the most frequently cited reason is that immigrants simply do n't pass the grueling police entrance tests which require high fitness levels as well as a good high school degree . " the entry bar is very high in germany , " behr said .
" that 's where most immigrants who are neither fluent in german nor in their own mother tongue stumble .
and those who are well educated do n't go to the police but go on to study law , medicine or engineering . " in addition , it 's not always easy for an immigrant to choose to be a cop - a profession that 's often treated with high levels of mistrust by families and friends who have bad memories of the police from the countries they come from . " it 's amazing for instance what some officers of turkish origin have to go through when they are on patrol , " said klaus eisenreich , head of the police union in berlin .
" they 're often labeled as ' traitors ' by their own communities . " " psychological barriers " omid nouripour , an iranian-german green party parliamentarian said there are deeper reasons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish soccer fans in kreuzberg , berlin " the psychological barriers between the locals and the new-locals are simply too high in this country , " said nouripour , adding he did n't believe the police had done enough to make the profession more attractive to ethnic minorities . " it 's not easy for immigrants to gain access to resources , " he said .
" even in the public service , you have to have a german passport to become a civil servant . " other cou n tries ahead , but with ow n problems even as germany wrings its hands over the issue , a look beyond its borders shows that other countries seem to be miles ahead . britain 's metropolitan police has doubled the proportion of ethnic minority officers since 1998 - they currently make up some 11 percent of the force - and even holland has considerably hiked the number in its police force . but experts caution that both have managed to do so by following an indirect policy of " positive discrimination " or affirmative action - something that 's taboo in germany . " in holland , for instance , new recruits do n't have to be fluent in dutch ; they 're encouraged to learn the language during training , " behr said , adding that such concessions often led to negative fallouts . " officers within the force end up being treated as second-class citizens , " he said , adding that holland had a discrimination problem within its ranks and even britain had an entire labor union for black officers . on the other hand , germany 's rigidly standardized entry requirements for the police force has ended up keeping ethnic minorities away while ensuring it 's not plagued by discrimination and foul play . " the few ethnic minorities we have in the force are thus 99 percent identical to their german counterparts , " behr said .
" the only difference is that an officer might have a turkish surname . " melti n g of borders though there may be no relief in the short time , in the long run reservations about modifying entry rules for immigrants might just become superfluous . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch and german police during a mock riot-control operation last year " the functions of the police are already gradually transcending national borders , " said behr , pointing to last year 's bilateral cooperation between germany and holland when german police accompanied some known soccer hooligans to holland . " without this fixation on ' nation , ' it will be easier for ethnic minorities to play a naturally positive role in the police .

why are germany 's immigrants so reluctant to become cops ? it may be a magnet for foreigners and home to people from over 180 countries as its tourism officials love to point out .
but walk into a public administrative building in berlin and chances are you 'll be hard pressed to find any sign of its ethnic diversity among the employees . less than 2 percent of its ethnic minorities are estimated to work in the public service sector despite making up 13 percent of berlin 's 3-million-strong population .
studies show the pattern is reflected across all of germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish police officer aspirants try out some police gear in berlin now , one institution has decided to turn the tide .
the berlin police force wants to try to fill in some 10 percent of the 200 new recruits they accept this year with ethnic minorities , particularly those who speak fluent turkish , arabic , polish , serbo-croatian and russian . " berlin is a multicultural city and the police force certainly does n't reflect that , " said rainer gerlach , head of the personnel department of the berlin police .
" officers from ethnic minorities are n't just valuable when it comes to overcoming language barriers ; they bring in a whole new dimension of sensitivity towards other cultures . " uphill task but recruiting ethnic minority police officers may be easier said than done . ever since the early 1990s , following a tweaking of the law to pave the way for non-germans in the police force , successive german states including berlin have tried poster campaigns , information seminars , informal chats and television ads among other things to lure immigrants into their police forces - without success . ethnic minorities still make up only around 1 percent of the entire german police force , according to rafael behr , a former police officer in the state of hesse and sociologist and author . " in some eastern states like saxony and thuringia , they 're almost non-existent , " he said . educatio n the biggest stumbli n g block bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's police force has a tough time finding ethnic minority officers so why does germany have such few ethnic minorities in the police force at a time when their presence there would largely be seen as asserting multicultural credentials and being more representative of the country 's racial mix ? the most frequently cited reason is that immigrants simply do n't pass the grueling police entrance tests which require high fitness levels as well as a good high school degree . " the entry bar is very high in germany , " behr said .
" that 's where most immigrants who are neither fluent in german nor in their own mother tongue stumble .
and those who are well educated do n't go to the police but go on to study law , medicine or engineering . " in addition , it 's not always easy for an immigrant to choose to be a cop - a profession that 's often treated with high levels of mistrust by families and friends who have bad memories of the police from the countries they come from . " it 's amazing for instance what some officers of turkish origin have to go through when they are on patrol , " said klaus eisenreich , head of the police union in berlin .
" they 're often labeled as ' traitors ' by their own communities . " " psychological barriers " omid nouripour , an iranian-german green party parliamentarian said there are deeper reasons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish soccer fans in kreuzberg , berlin " the psychological barriers between the locals and the new-locals are simply too high in this country , " said nouripour , adding he did n't believe the police had done enough to make the profession more attractive to ethnic minorities . " it 's not easy for immigrants to gain access to resources , " he said .
" even in the public service , you have to have a german passport to become a civil servant . " other cou n tries ahead , but with ow n problems even as germany wrings its hands over the issue , a look beyond its borders shows that other countries seem to be miles ahead . britain 's metropolitan police has doubled the proportion of ethnic minority officers since 1998 - they currently make up some 11 percent of the force - and even holland has considerably hiked the number in its police force . but experts caution that both have managed to do so by following an indirect policy of " positive discrimination " or affirmative action - something that 's taboo in germany . " in holland , for instance , new recruits do n't have to be fluent in dutch ; they 're encouraged to learn the language during training , " behr said , adding that such concessions often led to negative fallouts . " officers within the force end up being treated as second-class citizens , " he said , adding that holland had a discrimination problem within its ranks and even britain had an entire labor union for black officers . on the other hand , germany 's rigidly standardized entry requirements for the police force has ended up keeping ethnic minorities away while ensuring it 's not plagued by discrimination and foul play . " the few ethnic minorities we have in the force are thus 99 percent identical to their german counterparts , " behr said .
" the only difference is that an officer might have a turkish surname . " melti n g of borders though there may be no relief in the short time , in the long run reservations about modifying entry rules for immigrants might just become superfluous . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch and german police during a mock riot-control operation last year " the functions of the police are already gradually transcending national borders , " said behr , pointing to last year 's bilateral cooperation between germany and holland when german police accompanied some known soccer hooligans to holland . " without this fixation on ' nation , ' it will be easier for ethnic minorities to play a naturally positive role in the police .

producers say the outlook for 2006 is good , citing rising demand and increased investment . the german gas and oil industry is small , but german gas production in particular makes up a significant chunk of the country 's energy supply . with sales on the rise in 2005 , german oil and gas producers pumped money into investment .
the federation of the german gas and oil industry , or weg , said at its annual press conference that german energy firms boosted investment by more than a third last year , to approximately 1.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : limited resources mean gas will remain expensive , although stable georg schöning , head of german energy and water company rwe dea ag is also head of the weg .
he chalked the good results up to the world 's seemingly unquenchable thirst for oil , especially in china . " we saw already a year ago , that huge demand exists in china .
it was admittedly slightly lower in 2004 , but in general , global demand has kept growing . " industry expects price stability the oil and gas companies and their subcontractors are counting on continued strong demand for oil .
although high demand has led to sharp oil and gas price increases in the past , the weg predicts this trend is waning . the weg also said it expects less price fluctuation than in the last year , although no price decrease is expected .
this is mainly a question of supply and demand : in the short term , output can not be increased . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rwe headquarters in essen , germany " we 've seen global demand grow in the last couple of years and we have to say that the possibility of increasing output further is limited .
that means … extremely limited availability of extra supplies , " schöning said no one at the weg is keen to talk about a future when oil reserves run out .
they stress , instead , the projection that currently known oil reserves will last for another 50 years , and gas reserves should last another 60 years . political stability is key " the oil and gas reserves are predominantly located in the middle- and far east .
that means areas that we , as a western industry , do n't always have easy access to -lrb- the reserves -rrb- , neither do we have any influence on these countries ' political stability , " schöning said . this supply could be damaged by political instability , such as recent developments in nigeria , where local regions have been fighting over their share of oil wealth .
german oil producers hope transparency is the answer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a refinery in the state of sachsen anhalt schöning said his company rwe is an example .
" our activities in egypt … are clearly regulated through production-sharing agreements .
that means contractual agreements exist with the countries stating exactly what is due to the state and what belongs to the oil companies . " despite the turbulence in world markets and increasing tensions in the major oil-producing nations , weg claims germany 's oil supply is secure .
the fact that the country produces even a fraction of its own oil supply adds an element of stability , schöning said . germany cites balanced supply " here in germany , we have a fairly balanced supply structure .
this applies to both the oil and gas markets , " said schöning .
" if we take the uk as an example , we can see that local oil production will in the future no longer be possible , and they 'll have to rely on the global market for all their energy needs .
this in turn means that price volatility is likely to increase . " one fifth of germany 's gas supply comes from national sources , although its gas production has been decreasing for several years .
moreover , technologically , it is becoming increasingly difficult for germany to exploit its own gas resources in an economically viable manner . schöning discounted the effects political conflicts could have on energy supplies , saying , " i 'm really not that greatly concerned about oil supplies for europe as a whole , as the past has proven .

drawing on a classified bundestag report , the " new york times " reported thursday that german spies helped the us military invasion of iraq in an intelligence-sharing deal approved by top german officials . the intelligence sharing deal , which ended when the invasion came to an end , flies in the face of official german opposition to the war and is contained in a classified report by the german parliament , the bundestag , a copy of which was obtained by the newspaper . it also follows strong denials from berlin and the pentagon that german intelligence -lrb- bnd -rrb- had provided a copy of iraq 's war plans to the us military months before the us invasion , as the new york times reported monday . a scoop - or rehashed news ? the german parliamentary committee report , on which the times based its story , was issued after a series of recent , closed-door hearings on the role of german intelligence during the iraq war .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 02.03.2006 german energy industry upbeat for 2006 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany provides one-fifth of its own gas supply , helping stability rising energy demand has boosted trade in the german oil and gas industry .
producers say the outlook for 2006 is good , citing rising demand and increased investment . the german gas and oil industry is small , but german gas production in particular makes up a significant chunk of the country 's energy supply . with sales on the rise in 2005 , german oil and gas producers pumped money into investment .
the federation of the german gas and oil industry , or weg , said at its annual press conference that german energy firms boosted investment by more than a third last year , to approximately 1.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : limited resources mean gas will remain expensive , although stable georg schöning , head of german energy and water company rwe dea ag is also head of the weg .
he chalked the good results up to the world 's seemingly unquenchable thirst for oil , especially in china . " we saw already a year ago , that huge demand exists in china .
it was admittedly slightly lower in 2004 , but in general , global demand has kept growing . " industry expects price stability the oil and gas companies and their subcontractors are counting on continued strong demand for oil .
although high demand has led to sharp oil and gas price increases in the past , the weg predicts this trend is waning . the weg also said it expects less price fluctuation than in the last year , although no price decrease is expected .
this is mainly a question of supply and demand : in the short term , output can not be increased . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rwe headquarters in essen , germany " we 've seen global demand grow in the last couple of years and we have to say that the possibility of increasing output further is limited .
that means … extremely limited availability of extra supplies , " schöning said no one at the weg is keen to talk about a future when oil reserves run out .
they stress , instead , the projection that currently known oil reserves will last for another 50 years , and gas reserves should last another 60 years . political stability is key " the oil and gas reserves are predominantly located in the middle- and far east .
that means areas that we , as a western industry , do n't always have easy access to -lrb- the reserves -rrb- , neither do we have any influence on these countries ' political stability , " schöning said . this supply could be damaged by political instability , such as recent developments in nigeria , where local regions have been fighting over their share of oil wealth .
german oil producers hope transparency is the answer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a refinery in the state of sachsen anhalt schöning said his company rwe is an example .
" our activities in egypt … are clearly regulated through production-sharing agreements .
that means contractual agreements exist with the countries stating exactly what is due to the state and what belongs to the oil companies . " despite the turbulence in world markets and increasing tensions in the major oil-producing nations , weg claims germany 's oil supply is secure .
the fact that the country produces even a fraction of its own oil supply adds an element of stability , schöning said . germany cites balanced supply " here in germany , we have a fairly balanced supply structure .
this applies to both the oil and gas markets , " said schöning .

on wednesday , the european commission warned it expected results by the end of 2007 . germany 's public deficit has breached the eu 's limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product since 2002 .
last year , berlin convinced its eu partners to freeze excessive deficit procedures - including financial penalties - against it , following a long struggle with brussels . now though , the european commission has warned germany that it has until the end of 2007 to reduce its budget deficit , or face the possibility of sanctions . the german finance ministry was quick to respond , saying it planned to meet the eu requirement to bring its deficit below the 3 percent level specified in the stability and growth pact . " germany will achieve an underlying structural deficit improvement of about 1 percentage point in the next two years , thus meeting the commission 's guidelines , " the ministry said in a statement . the ministry added that it would release a 2007 draft budget in july that will show its ability to meet the eu deficit limits . the commission , which polices member states ' public finances , said that germany was set to breach the limit again this year but welcomed belt-tightening measures to bring it below the threshold next year . " although the -lrb- european -rrb- commission welcomes the renewed priority attached by the german government to budgetary consolidation , it is clear that the procedure needs to be stepped up to guarantee a lasting correction of the deficit , " economic affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said . huge fi n es in theory , berlin could face huge fines if it fails to rein in its deficit although that would be unlikely if the government sticks to its promises to improve the public accounts . german finance minister peer steinbrück supported the commission 's action , which he saw as boosting the credibility of the eu 's public finances pact . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister peer steinbrück supported the commission 's action " for germany , it is of the highest importance that the credibility of the stability and growth pact be protected in the long-term , " he said in a statement .
" that is why the government agrees with the eu decision . " berlin and paris , whose deficit has also breached eu limits for years , won a formal suspension of disciplinary measures against them at the beginning of last year . damage to stability pact suspension of the measures came only after a lengthy battle with brussels which resulted in the eu rewriting the public finances pact last year and , in effect , watering it down . " after the revision last year , i think from the political point of view the commission and the ministers have learned a lot about the importance of establishing good dialogue channels to avoid these kinds of conflicts , " almunia said . in a recent review of french public finances , paris was let off the hook for further measures on account of efforts to cut its deficit . germany , worried that other euro members would be less disciplined about their public finances , was the main author behind the fiscal rulebook when it was drawn up in 1997 . the revision of the pact was met with scorn from many private and even some public economists , who believed that it no longer had any credibility because member states would have too much leeway to avoid disciplinary measures . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu commission to supervise german spending germany 's new finance minister peer steinbrück is making waves by suggesting an unusual way of avoiding eu sanctions which brussels could impose over berlin 's non-compliance with the stability pact .

on monday , the eu gave serbia a final deadline to cooperate with the united nations war crimes tribunal or jeopardize its negotiations with the eu , which are due to recommence on april 4 . a decade after the war in bosnia , the conflict 's most wanted men - mladic and radovan karadzic - are still on the run .
the bosnian-serb mladic is believed to be hiding in serbia .
before leaving for belgrade , steinmeier had reiterated the relationship between the hunt for war fugitives and serbia 's relationship with the eu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an undated photo of one-time serb leader karadzic , left and his military commander mladic " the connection is clear , so clear that there is no need to formulate an ultimatum , " steinmeier said .
" and it is just as clear that the eu negotiations wo n't be interrupted if there is co-operation from the serbian side . " also up for discussion are territorial disputes involving serbia .
the serbian province of kosovo has been administered by the united nations since 1999 .
kosovo 's ethnic albanians are demanding full independence from serbia , a proposition that the government in belgrade does n't agree with . outrage over ceku n omi n atio n the kosovo issue has been greatly inflamed by the nomination on thursday of former guerrilla leader agim ceku to replace kosovo 's prime minister , who stepped down wednesday . ceku is wanted by serbia on war crimes charges ; belgrade says he is responsible for the death of 669 serbs .
his election was heartily blasted by shocked serbian officials , who warned " the extremists are advancing , " and called the vote " another provocation . " the general was known as a war horse in the struggle against the serbian military and paramilitary , during the civil warns of the 1990s . there is also the question of montenegro , the smaller of the two former yugoslav republics .
montenegro and serbia are joined in a union – but the pro-independence government in montenegro wants out .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 02.03.2006 public sector strikes widen across germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rubbish has been piling up in several states since the strikes began the biggest public sector strike to hit germany in 14 years escalated after talks broke down between unions and local authorities in a southwestern state and services union verdi warned of a long-drawn out conflict . hopes for a quick nationwide settlement were shattered as the giant services union verdi broke off negotiations late on wednesday in baden-württemberg , one of nine states where public services strikes have been going on for weeks . verdi rejected an offer by local authority employers of a 39.7 hour working week .
speaking in stuttgart , verdi 's alfred wohlfart said there was no way the deal could have worked . " the gentlemen have entrenched themselves , they have put their ideological goals before the goal of giving people a perspective , " wohlfart said .
he urged the populace to understand the reasons behind the crippling strikes , saying verdi was battling against moves by employers that would further worsen mass unemployment . first major strike i n 14 years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the strikes have met an overwhelming response among public sector employees the strikes , which began in early february this year , have been over employers ' plans to extend the working week from 38.5 hours to 40 hours without any additional pay and against proposals to cut christmas bonuses in half . trade unions fear this will lead to further job cuts .
verdi is demanding 38.8 hours for the 220,000-strong workforce . the strike is the first major one in the sector for 14 years and the unions have warned they have sufficient funds to sustain a long , drawn-out conflict .
verdi estimates that around 24,000 employees had joined the walkouts so far . about 4.7 million people are employed in germany 's public sector . employers co n sider privatizatio n on thursday however the employers ' side indicated they might up the stakes in the dispute by considering privatization of services . " naturally one of the consequences would be , that there will be more privatization , " hartmut möllring , the chairman of the wage negotiating committee of the federal states and a conservative politician , said in a radio interview .
" that 's not a threat , rather a fact . " möllring , who is also the finance minister in the state of lower saxony , said the population would realize that privatization would mean that the garbage would be collected and kindergartens would remain open . esse n tial services crippled the wave of strikes have in particular affected local administration , hospitals , kindergartens and garbage services in europe 's largest economy , with rubbish left piling up in the streets in some places . verdi has now vowed to step up its action in baden-württemberg , with longer and wider work stoppages .
it has called upon 9,000 to 10,000 employees to join walkouts on thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scenes such as these have become commonplace in some cities the move spells further bad news for the state 's residents who are already grappling with mountains of piled up rubbish on the streets and making alternative arrangements to care for their kids after the kindergartens have remained shut for weeks . the negotiator for the local authority employers ' side , gerhard widder , called it a black day for the public services sector , saying the strikes were conducted at the expense of the people 's needs . " the result is that the people in our cities will have to continue to endure the strike , " widder said . compromise i n hamburg however , in the northern city of hamburg , a compromise was found under a complicated formula depending on the pay grade , age and family situation of the respective employees . top negotiator for the local public employers in hamburg , volkmar schön welcomed the deal . " you will see that we have created the working hour plan with three elements , and all of these elements have a social character , " he said . under the accord , the average working week would be increased to 39 hours - but not for everyone .
while young single and well paid employees may have to work 40 hours , older employees or those with young children may in fact find that their working week is even reduced . but , the deal is unlikely to serve as a model for other federal states . elsewhere in germany , employees in the northern city of bremen joined the strike for the first time with 1,000 workers in 70 kindergartens not showing up for work . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans look to talks amid drawn-out strike germany 's ongoing civil service strike could have widespread repercussions for unions .

speaking in stuttgart , verdi 's alfred wohlfart said there was no way the deal could have worked . " the gentlemen have entrenched themselves , they have put their ideological goals before the goal of giving people a perspective , " wohlfart said .
he urged the populace to understand the reasons behind the crippling strikes , saying verdi was battling against moves by employers that would further worsen mass unemployment . first major strike i n 14 years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the strikes have met an overwhelming response among public sector employees the strikes , which began in early february this year , have been over employers ' plans to extend the working week from 38.5 hours to 40 hours without any additional pay and against proposals to cut christmas bonuses in half . trade unions fear this will lead to further job cuts .
verdi is demanding 38.8 hours for the 220,000-strong workforce . the strike is the first major one in the sector for 14 years and the unions have warned they have sufficient funds to sustain a long , drawn-out conflict .
verdi estimates that around 24,000 employees had joined the walkouts so far . about 4.7 million people are employed in germany 's public sector . employers co n sider privatizatio n on thursday however the employers ' side indicated they might up the stakes in the dispute by considering privatization of services . " naturally one of the consequences would be , that there will be more privatization , " hartmut möllring , the chairman of the wage negotiating committee of the federal states and a conservative politician , said in a radio interview .
" that 's not a threat , rather a fact . " möllring , who is also the finance minister in the state of lower saxony , said the population would realize that privatization would mean that the garbage would be collected and kindergartens would remain open . esse n tial services crippled the wave of strikes have in particular affected local administration , hospitals , kindergartens and garbage services in europe 's largest economy , with rubbish left piling up in the streets in some places . verdi has now vowed to step up its action in baden-württemberg , with longer and wider work stoppages .
it has called upon 9,000 to 10,000 employees to join walkouts on thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scenes such as these have become commonplace in some cities the move spells further bad news for the state 's residents who are already grappling with mountains of piled up rubbish on the streets and making alternative arrangements to care for their kids after the kindergartens have remained shut for weeks . the negotiator for the local authority employers ' side , gerhard widder , called it a black day for the public services sector , saying the strikes were conducted at the expense of the people 's needs . " the result is that the people in our cities will have to continue to endure the strike , " widder said . compromise i n hamburg however , in the northern city of hamburg , a compromise was found under a complicated formula depending on the pay grade , age and family situation of the respective employees . top negotiator for the local public employers in hamburg , volkmar schön welcomed the deal . " you will see that we have created the working hour plan with three elements , and all of these elements have a social character , " he said . under the accord , the average working week would be increased to 39 hours - but not for everyone .
while young single and well paid employees may have to work 40 hours , older employees or those with young children may in fact find that their working week is even reduced . but , the deal is unlikely to serve as a model for other federal states . elsewhere in germany , employees in the northern city of bremen joined the strike for the first time with 1,000 workers in 70 kindergartens not showing up for work . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans look to talks amid drawn-out strike germany 's ongoing civil service strike could have widespread repercussions for unions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 02.03.2006 eu pressures germany to cut deficit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economic commissioner joaquin almunia : deficit procedures need to be stepped up germany had bought time to bring its excessive budget deficit back in line with eu rules , but the grace period is over .
on wednesday , the european commission warned it expected results by the end of 2007 . germany 's public deficit has breached the eu 's limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product since 2002 .
last year , berlin convinced its eu partners to freeze excessive deficit procedures - including financial penalties - against it , following a long struggle with brussels . now though , the european commission has warned germany that it has until the end of 2007 to reduce its budget deficit , or face the possibility of sanctions . the german finance ministry was quick to respond , saying it planned to meet the eu requirement to bring its deficit below the 3 percent level specified in the stability and growth pact . " germany will achieve an underlying structural deficit improvement of about 1 percentage point in the next two years , thus meeting the commission 's guidelines , " the ministry said in a statement . the ministry added that it would release a 2007 draft budget in july that will show its ability to meet the eu deficit limits . the commission , which polices member states ' public finances , said that germany was set to breach the limit again this year but welcomed belt-tightening measures to bring it below the threshold next year . " although the -lrb- european -rrb- commission welcomes the renewed priority attached by the german government to budgetary consolidation , it is clear that the procedure needs to be stepped up to guarantee a lasting correction of the deficit , " economic affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said . huge fi n es in theory , berlin could face huge fines if it fails to rein in its deficit although that would be unlikely if the government sticks to its promises to improve the public accounts . german finance minister peer steinbrück supported the commission 's action , which he saw as boosting the credibility of the eu 's public finances pact . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister peer steinbrück supported the commission 's action " for germany , it is of the highest importance that the credibility of the stability and growth pact be protected in the long-term , " he said in a statement .
" that is why the government agrees with the eu decision . " berlin and paris , whose deficit has also breached eu limits for years , won a formal suspension of disciplinary measures against them at the beginning of last year . damage to stability pact suspension of the measures came only after a lengthy battle with brussels which resulted in the eu rewriting the public finances pact last year and , in effect , watering it down . " after the revision last year , i think from the political point of view the commission and the ministers have learned a lot about the importance of establishing good dialogue channels to avoid these kinds of conflicts , " almunia said . in a recent review of french public finances , paris was let off the hook for further measures on account of efforts to cut its deficit . germany , worried that other euro members would be less disciplined about their public finances , was the main author behind the fiscal rulebook when it was drawn up in 1997 . the revision of the pact was met with scorn from many private and even some public economists , who believed that it no longer had any credibility because member states would have too much leeway to avoid disciplinary measures . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu commission to supervise german spending germany 's new finance minister peer steinbrück is making waves by suggesting an unusual way of avoiding eu sanctions which brussels could impose over berlin 's non-compliance with the stability pact .

" you will see that we have created the working hour plan with three elements , and all of these elements have a social character , " he said . under the accord , the average working week would be increased to 39 hours - but not for everyone .
while young single and well paid employees may have to work 40 hours , older employees or those with young children may in fact find that their working week is even reduced . but , the deal is unlikely to serve as a model for other federal states . elsewhere in germany , employees in the northern city of bremen joined the strike for the first time with 1,000 workers in 70 kindergartens not showing up for work . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans look to talks amid drawn-out strike germany 's ongoing civil service strike could have widespread repercussions for unions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 02.03.2006 german energy industry upbeat for 2006 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany provides one-fifth of its own gas supply , helping stability rising energy demand has boosted trade in the german oil and gas industry .
producers say the outlook for 2006 is good , citing rising demand and increased investment . the german gas and oil industry is small , but german gas production in particular makes up a significant chunk of the country 's energy supply . with sales on the rise in 2005 , german oil and gas producers pumped money into investment .
the federation of the german gas and oil industry , or weg , said at its annual press conference that german energy firms boosted investment by more than a third last year , to approximately 1.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : limited resources mean gas will remain expensive , although stable georg schöning , head of german energy and water company rwe dea ag is also head of the weg .
he chalked the good results up to the world 's seemingly unquenchable thirst for oil , especially in china . " we saw already a year ago , that huge demand exists in china .
it was admittedly slightly lower in 2004 , but in general , global demand has kept growing . " industry expects price stability the oil and gas companies and their subcontractors are counting on continued strong demand for oil .
although high demand has led to sharp oil and gas price increases in the past , the weg predicts this trend is waning . the weg also said it expects less price fluctuation than in the last year , although no price decrease is expected .
this is mainly a question of supply and demand : in the short term , output can not be increased . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rwe headquarters in essen , germany " we 've seen global demand grow in the last couple of years and we have to say that the possibility of increasing output further is limited .
that means … extremely limited availability of extra supplies , " schöning said no one at the weg is keen to talk about a future when oil reserves run out .
they stress , instead , the projection that currently known oil reserves will last for another 50 years , and gas reserves should last another 60 years . political stability is key " the oil and gas reserves are predominantly located in the middle- and far east .
that means areas that we , as a western industry , do n't always have easy access to -lrb- the reserves -rrb- , neither do we have any influence on these countries ' political stability , " schöning said . this supply could be damaged by political instability , such as recent developments in nigeria , where local regions have been fighting over their share of oil wealth .
german oil producers hope transparency is the answer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a refinery in the state of sachsen anhalt schöning said his company rwe is an example .
" our activities in egypt … are clearly regulated through production-sharing agreements .
that means contractual agreements exist with the countries stating exactly what is due to the state and what belongs to the oil companies . " despite the turbulence in world markets and increasing tensions in the major oil-producing nations , weg claims germany 's oil supply is secure .
the fact that the country produces even a fraction of its own oil supply adds an element of stability , schöning said . germany cites balanced supply " here in germany , we have a fairly balanced supply structure .
this applies to both the oil and gas markets , " said schöning .
" if we take the uk as an example , we can see that local oil production will in the future no longer be possible , and they 'll have to rely on the global market for all their energy needs .
this in turn means that price volatility is likely to increase . " one fifth of germany 's gas supply comes from national sources , although its gas production has been decreasing for several years .
moreover , technologically , it is becoming increasingly difficult for germany to exploit its own gas resources in an economically viable manner . schöning discounted the effects political conflicts could have on energy supplies , saying , " i 'm really not that greatly concerned about oil supplies for europe as a whole , as the past has proven .
none of the political conflicts we 've experienced have threatened supplies to any great extent .

drawing on a classified bundestag report , the " new york times " reported thursday that german spies helped the us military invasion of iraq in an intelligence-sharing deal approved by top german officials . the intelligence sharing deal , which ended when the invasion came to an end , flies in the face of official german opposition to the war and is contained in a classified report by the german parliament , the bundestag , a copy of which was obtained by the newspaper . it also follows strong denials from berlin and the pentagon that german intelligence -lrb- bnd -rrb- had provided a copy of iraq 's war plans to the us military months before the us invasion , as the new york times reported monday . a scoop - or rehashed news ? the german parliamentary committee report , on which the times based its story , was issued after a series of recent , closed-door hearings on the role of german intelligence during the iraq war .
parts of the report were made available to the public , but several key references defined as classified were left out . the german media has not , for example , had access to certain information deemed sensitive by the bnd - such as the existence of a german intelligence officer in franks ' office , because , according to the report , this information overlaps with the espionage activities of another country , in this case the us . it was n't until the newspaper published its report that many more of the details became known . nonetheless , the claims are being downplayed in germany . according to social democratic parliamentarian olaf scholz , the article reveals nothing new . " the report is dredging up the same old news that has nothing to do with serious research , " he said in berlin , adding that us coverage of the issue is taking on " absurd characteristics . " approval from the top bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general tommy franks in reviewing german-american cooperation before and during the iraq war , german lawmakers said in their report that , starting in early 2003 , a german intelligence officer was stationed in the office of us general tommy franks , who headed the us central command and the invading forces in iraq . two other german spies in baghdad passed on information to their colleague in franks ' office mostly about sites in the iraqi capital , such as embassies and suspected location of hostages , to be avoided by us bombs . they also provided information on iraqi police and military units in baghdad , although the german report stressed that the spies did not direct airstrikes against iraqi leaders or forces , the daily said . in all , the german spies provided 25 reports to the us central command and were awarded american meritorious medals , after the invasion came to an end , in recognition of the " critical information to united states central command to support combat operations in iraq . " the german report , said the times , made clear that the intelligence-sharing arrangement was approved in late 2002 at the highest levels of the german government , including frank-walter steinmeier , the chief of staff for gerhard schröder , then the german chancellor , and by the foreign minister at the time , joschka fischer .
steinmeier is now germany 's foreign minister . " verbally imposed " conditions were " verbally imposed " on the german intelligence officials , the report said .
the liaison officer in franks ' office , for example , was to provide " no support for the strategic air war offensive carried out by the usa . " he was also instructed to give out no " information with direct relevance for the tactical air and land warfare on the part of the usa . " the classified version of the report was provided by a german journalist to a times reporter in germany , who read the text into a tape recorder so it could be transcribed and translated . the deputy spokesman for the german government consulted by telephone by the new york times did not comment on the newspaper 's account . " i do n't know the classified version .

on wednesday , the european commission warned it expected results by the end of 2007 . germany 's public deficit has breached the eu 's limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product since 2002 .
last year , berlin convinced its eu partners to freeze excessive deficit procedures - including financial penalties - against it , following a long struggle with brussels . now though , the european commission has warned germany that it has until the end of 2007 to reduce its budget deficit , or face the possibility of sanctions . the german finance ministry was quick to respond , saying it planned to meet the eu requirement to bring its deficit below the 3 percent level specified in the stability and growth pact . " germany will achieve an underlying structural deficit improvement of about 1 percentage point in the next two years , thus meeting the commission 's guidelines , " the ministry said in a statement . the ministry added that it would release a 2007 draft budget in july that will show its ability to meet the eu deficit limits . the commission , which polices member states ' public finances , said that germany was set to breach the limit again this year but welcomed belt-tightening measures to bring it below the threshold next year . " although the -lrb- european -rrb- commission welcomes the renewed priority attached by the german government to budgetary consolidation , it is clear that the procedure needs to be stepped up to guarantee a lasting correction of the deficit , " economic affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said . huge fi n es in theory , berlin could face huge fines if it fails to rein in its deficit although that would be unlikely if the government sticks to its promises to improve the public accounts . german finance minister peer steinbrück supported the commission 's action , which he saw as boosting the credibility of the eu 's public finances pact . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister peer steinbrück supported the commission 's action " for germany , it is of the highest importance that the credibility of the stability and growth pact be protected in the long-term , " he said in a statement .
" that is why the government agrees with the eu decision . " berlin and paris , whose deficit has also breached eu limits for years , won a formal suspension of disciplinary measures against them at the beginning of last year . damage to stability pact suspension of the measures came only after a lengthy battle with brussels which resulted in the eu rewriting the public finances pact last year and , in effect , watering it down . " after the revision last year , i think from the political point of view the commission and the ministers have learned a lot about the importance of establishing good dialogue channels to avoid these kinds of conflicts , " almunia said . in a recent review of french public finances , paris was let off the hook for further measures on account of efforts to cut its deficit . germany , worried that other euro members would be less disciplined about their public finances , was the main author behind the fiscal rulebook when it was drawn up in 1997 . the revision of the pact was met with scorn from many private and even some public economists , who believed that it no longer had any credibility because member states would have too much leeway to avoid disciplinary measures . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu commission to supervise german spending germany 's new finance minister peer steinbrück is making waves by suggesting an unusual way of avoiding eu sanctions which brussels could impose over berlin 's non-compliance with the stability pact .

" the least it can do is to follow france 's lead , " he said .
" -lrb- the tax -rrb- would be a first step , " he added , towards achieving the increase in the development budget set for 2015 . optimism overall , the head of the un agency fighting aids , peter piot , said he was optimistic about the moves sponsored by france and brazil . it was " absolutely necessary " for countries to come up with new ways of raising development aid , he told afp , but only " on condition that that is not a pretext for states to reduce their contributions elsewhere .

why are germany 's immigrants so reluctant to become cops ? it may be a magnet for foreigners and home to people from over 180 countries as its tourism officials love to point out .
but walk into a public administrative building in berlin and chances are you 'll be hard pressed to find any sign of its ethnic diversity among the employees . less than 2 percent of its ethnic minorities are estimated to work in the public service sector despite making up 13 percent of berlin 's 3-million-strong population .
studies show the pattern is reflected across all of germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish police officer aspirants try out some police gear in berlin now , one institution has decided to turn the tide .
the berlin police force wants to try to fill in some 10 percent of the 200 new recruits they accept this year with ethnic minorities , particularly those who speak fluent turkish , arabic , polish , serbo-croatian and russian . " berlin is a multicultural city and the police force certainly does n't reflect that , " said rainer gerlach , head of the personnel department of the berlin police .
" officers from ethnic minorities are n't just valuable when it comes to overcoming language barriers ; they bring in a whole new dimension of sensitivity towards other cultures . " uphill task but recruiting ethnic minority police officers may be easier said than done . ever since the early 1990s , following a tweaking of the law to pave the way for non-germans in the police force , successive german states including berlin have tried poster campaigns , information seminars , informal chats and television ads among other things to lure immigrants into their police forces - without success . ethnic minorities still make up only around 1 percent of the entire german police force , according to rafael behr , a former police officer in the state of hesse and sociologist and author . " in some eastern states like saxony and thuringia , they 're almost non-existent , " he said . educatio n the biggest stumbli n g block bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's police force has a tough time finding ethnic minority officers so why does germany have such few ethnic minorities in the police force at a time when their presence there would largely be seen as asserting multicultural credentials and being more representative of the country 's racial mix ? the most frequently cited reason is that immigrants simply do n't pass the grueling police entrance tests which require high fitness levels as well as a good high school degree . " the entry bar is very high in germany , " behr said .
" that 's where most immigrants who are neither fluent in german nor in their own mother tongue stumble .
and those who are well educated do n't go to the police but go on to study law , medicine or engineering . " in addition , it 's not always easy for an immigrant to choose to be a cop - a profession that 's often treated with high levels of mistrust by families and friends who have bad memories of the police from the countries they come from . " it 's amazing for instance what some officers of turkish origin have to go through when they are on patrol , " said klaus eisenreich , head of the police union in berlin .
" they 're often labeled as ' traitors ' by their own communities . " " psychological barriers " omid nouripour , an iranian-german green party parliamentarian said there are deeper reasons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish soccer fans in kreuzberg , berlin " the psychological barriers between the locals and the new-locals are simply too high in this country , " said nouripour , adding he did n't believe the police had done enough to make the profession more attractive to ethnic minorities . " it 's not easy for immigrants to gain access to resources , " he said .
" even in the public service , you have to have a german passport to become a civil servant . " other cou n tries ahead , but with ow n problems even as germany wrings its hands over the issue , a look beyond its borders shows that other countries seem to be miles ahead . britain 's metropolitan police has doubled the proportion of ethnic minority officers since 1998 - they currently make up some 11 percent of the force - and even holland has considerably hiked the number in its police force . but experts caution that both have managed to do so by following an indirect policy of " positive discrimination " or affirmative action - something that 's taboo in germany . " in holland , for instance , new recruits do n't have to be fluent in dutch ; they 're encouraged to learn the language during training , " behr said , adding that such concessions often led to negative fallouts . " officers within the force end up being treated as second-class citizens , " he said , adding that holland had a discrimination problem within its ranks and even britain had an entire labor union for black officers . on the other hand , germany 's rigidly standardized entry requirements for the police force has ended up keeping ethnic minorities away while ensuring it 's not plagued by discrimination and foul play . " the few ethnic minorities we have in the force are thus 99 percent identical to their german counterparts , " behr said .
" the only difference is that an officer might have a turkish surname . " melti n g of borders though there may be no relief in the short time , in the long run reservations about modifying entry rules for immigrants might just become superfluous . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch and german police during a mock riot-control operation last year " the functions of the police are already gradually transcending national borders , " said behr , pointing to last year 's bilateral cooperation between germany and holland when german police accompanied some known soccer hooligans to holland . " without this fixation on ' nation , ' it will be easier for ethnic minorities to play a naturally positive role in the police .

why are germany 's immigrants so reluctant to become cops ? it may be a magnet for foreigners and home to people from over 180 countries as its tourism officials love to point out .
but walk into a public administrative building in berlin and chances are you 'll be hard pressed to find any sign of its ethnic diversity among the employees . less than 2 percent of its ethnic minorities are estimated to work in the public service sector despite making up 13 percent of berlin 's 3-million-strong population .
studies show the pattern is reflected across all of germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish police officer aspirants try out some police gear in berlin now , one institution has decided to turn the tide .
the berlin police force wants to try to fill in some 10 percent of the 200 new recruits they accept this year with ethnic minorities , particularly those who speak fluent turkish , arabic , polish , serbo-croatian and russian . " berlin is a multicultural city and the police force certainly does n't reflect that , " said rainer gerlach , head of the personnel department of the berlin police .
" officers from ethnic minorities are n't just valuable when it comes to overcoming language barriers ; they bring in a whole new dimension of sensitivity towards other cultures . " uphill task but recruiting ethnic minority police officers may be easier said than done . ever since the early 1990s , following a tweaking of the law to pave the way for non-germans in the police force , successive german states including berlin have tried poster campaigns , information seminars , informal chats and television ads among other things to lure immigrants into their police forces - without success . ethnic minorities still make up only around 1 percent of the entire german police force , according to rafael behr , a former police officer in the state of hesse and sociologist and author . " in some eastern states like saxony and thuringia , they 're almost non-existent , " he said . educatio n the biggest stumbli n g block bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's police force has a tough time finding ethnic minority officers so why does germany have such few ethnic minorities in the police force at a time when their presence there would largely be seen as asserting multicultural credentials and being more representative of the country 's racial mix ? the most frequently cited reason is that immigrants simply do n't pass the grueling police entrance tests which require high fitness levels as well as a good high school degree . " the entry bar is very high in germany , " behr said .
" that 's where most immigrants who are neither fluent in german nor in their own mother tongue stumble .
and those who are well educated do n't go to the police but go on to study law , medicine or engineering . " in addition , it 's not always easy for an immigrant to choose to be a cop - a profession that 's often treated with high levels of mistrust by families and friends who have bad memories of the police from the countries they come from . " it 's amazing for instance what some officers of turkish origin have to go through when they are on patrol , " said klaus eisenreich , head of the police union in berlin .
" they 're often labeled as ' traitors ' by their own communities . " " psychological barriers " omid nouripour , an iranian-german green party parliamentarian said there are deeper reasons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish soccer fans in kreuzberg , berlin " the psychological barriers between the locals and the new-locals are simply too high in this country , " said nouripour , adding he did n't believe the police had done enough to make the profession more attractive to ethnic minorities . " it 's not easy for immigrants to gain access to resources , " he said .
" even in the public service , you have to have a german passport to become a civil servant . " other cou n tries ahead , but with ow n problems even as germany wrings its hands over the issue , a look beyond its borders shows that other countries seem to be miles ahead . britain 's metropolitan police has doubled the proportion of ethnic minority officers since 1998 - they currently make up some 11 percent of the force - and even holland has considerably hiked the number in its police force . but experts caution that both have managed to do so by following an indirect policy of " positive discrimination " or affirmative action - something that 's taboo in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 02.03.2006 german energy industry upbeat for 2006 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany provides one-fifth of its own gas supply , helping stability rising energy demand has boosted trade in the german oil and gas industry .
producers say the outlook for 2006 is good , citing rising demand and increased investment . the german gas and oil industry is small , but german gas production in particular makes up a significant chunk of the country 's energy supply . with sales on the rise in 2005 , german oil and gas producers pumped money into investment .
the federation of the german gas and oil industry , or weg , said at its annual press conference that german energy firms boosted investment by more than a third last year , to approximately 1.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : limited resources mean gas will remain expensive , although stable georg schöning , head of german energy and water company rwe dea ag is also head of the weg .
he chalked the good results up to the world 's seemingly unquenchable thirst for oil , especially in china . " we saw already a year ago , that huge demand exists in china .
it was admittedly slightly lower in 2004 , but in general , global demand has kept growing . " industry expects price stability the oil and gas companies and their subcontractors are counting on continued strong demand for oil .
although high demand has led to sharp oil and gas price increases in the past , the weg predicts this trend is waning . the weg also said it expects less price fluctuation than in the last year , although no price decrease is expected .
this is mainly a question of supply and demand : in the short term , output can not be increased . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rwe headquarters in essen , germany " we 've seen global demand grow in the last couple of years and we have to say that the possibility of increasing output further is limited .
that means … extremely limited availability of extra supplies , " schöning said no one at the weg is keen to talk about a future when oil reserves run out .
they stress , instead , the projection that currently known oil reserves will last for another 50 years , and gas reserves should last another 60 years . political stability is key " the oil and gas reserves are predominantly located in the middle- and far east .
that means areas that we , as a western industry , do n't always have easy access to -lrb- the reserves -rrb- , neither do we have any influence on these countries ' political stability , " schöning said . this supply could be damaged by political instability , such as recent developments in nigeria , where local regions have been fighting over their share of oil wealth .
german oil producers hope transparency is the answer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a refinery in the state of sachsen anhalt schöning said his company rwe is an example .
" our activities in egypt … are clearly regulated through production-sharing agreements .
that means contractual agreements exist with the countries stating exactly what is due to the state and what belongs to the oil companies . " despite the turbulence in world markets and increasing tensions in the major oil-producing nations , weg claims germany 's oil supply is secure .
the fact that the country produces even a fraction of its own oil supply adds an element of stability , schöning said . germany cites balanced supply " here in germany , we have a fairly balanced supply structure .
this applies to both the oil and gas markets , " said schöning .
" if we take the uk as an example , we can see that local oil production will in the future no longer be possible , and they 'll have to rely on the global market for all their energy needs .
this in turn means that price volatility is likely to increase . " one fifth of germany 's gas supply comes from national sources , although its gas production has been decreasing for several years .
moreover , technologically , it is becoming increasingly difficult for germany to exploit its own gas resources in an economically viable manner . schöning discounted the effects political conflicts could have on energy supplies , saying , " i 'm really not that greatly concerned about oil supplies for europe as a whole , as the past has proven .
none of the political conflicts we 've experienced have threatened supplies to any great extent .

on monday , the eu gave serbia a final deadline to cooperate with the united nations war crimes tribunal or jeopardize its negotiations with the eu , which are due to recommence on april 4 . a decade after the war in bosnia , the conflict 's most wanted men - mladic and radovan karadzic - are still on the run .

" and it is just as clear that the eu negotiations wo n't be interrupted if there is co-operation from the serbian side . " also up for discussion are territorial disputes involving serbia .

producers say the outlook for 2006 is good , citing rising demand and increased investment . the german gas and oil industry is small , but german gas production in particular makes up a significant chunk of the country 's energy supply . with sales on the rise in 2005 , german oil and gas producers pumped money into investment .
the federation of the german gas and oil industry , or weg , said at its annual press conference that german energy firms boosted investment by more than a third last year , to approximately 1.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : limited resources mean gas will remain expensive , although stable georg schöning , head of german energy and water company rwe dea ag is also head of the weg .
he chalked the good results up to the world 's seemingly unquenchable thirst for oil , especially in china . " we saw already a year ago , that huge demand exists in china .
it was admittedly slightly lower in 2004 , but in general , global demand has kept growing . " industry expects price stability the oil and gas companies and their subcontractors are counting on continued strong demand for oil .
although high demand has led to sharp oil and gas price increases in the past , the weg predicts this trend is waning . the weg also said it expects less price fluctuation than in the last year , although no price decrease is expected .
this is mainly a question of supply and demand : in the short term , output can not be increased . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rwe headquarters in essen , germany " we 've seen global demand grow in the last couple of years and we have to say that the possibility of increasing output further is limited .
that means … extremely limited availability of extra supplies , " schöning said no one at the weg is keen to talk about a future when oil reserves run out .
they stress , instead , the projection that currently known oil reserves will last for another 50 years , and gas reserves should last another 60 years . political stability is key " the oil and gas reserves are predominantly located in the middle- and far east .
that means areas that we , as a western industry , do n't always have easy access to -lrb- the reserves -rrb- , neither do we have any influence on these countries ' political stability , " schöning said . this supply could be damaged by political instability , such as recent developments in nigeria , where local regions have been fighting over their share of oil wealth .
german oil producers hope transparency is the answer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a refinery in the state of sachsen anhalt schöning said his company rwe is an example .
" our activities in egypt … are clearly regulated through production-sharing agreements .
that means contractual agreements exist with the countries stating exactly what is due to the state and what belongs to the oil companies . " despite the turbulence in world markets and increasing tensions in the major oil-producing nations , weg claims germany 's oil supply is secure .
the fact that the country produces even a fraction of its own oil supply adds an element of stability , schöning said . germany cites balanced supply " here in germany , we have a fairly balanced supply structure .
this applies to both the oil and gas markets , " said schöning .
" if we take the uk as an example , we can see that local oil production will in the future no longer be possible , and they 'll have to rely on the global market for all their energy needs .
this in turn means that price volatility is likely to increase . " one fifth of germany 's gas supply comes from national sources , although its gas production has been decreasing for several years .
moreover , technologically , it is becoming increasingly difficult for germany to exploit its own gas resources in an economically viable manner . schöning discounted the effects political conflicts could have on energy supplies , saying , " i 'm really not that greatly concerned about oil supplies for europe as a whole , as the past has proven .

producers say the outlook for 2006 is good , citing rising demand and increased investment . the german gas and oil industry is small , but german gas production in particular makes up a significant chunk of the country 's energy supply . with sales on the rise in 2005 , german oil and gas producers pumped money into investment .
the federation of the german gas and oil industry , or weg , said at its annual press conference that german energy firms boosted investment by more than a third last year , to approximately 1.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : limited resources mean gas will remain expensive , although stable georg schöning , head of german energy and water company rwe dea ag is also head of the weg .
he chalked the good results up to the world 's seemingly unquenchable thirst for oil , especially in china . " we saw already a year ago , that huge demand exists in china .
it was admittedly slightly lower in 2004 , but in general , global demand has kept growing . " industry expects price stability the oil and gas companies and their subcontractors are counting on continued strong demand for oil .
although high demand has led to sharp oil and gas price increases in the past , the weg predicts this trend is waning . the weg also said it expects less price fluctuation than in the last year , although no price decrease is expected .
this is mainly a question of supply and demand : in the short term , output can not be increased . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rwe headquarters in essen , germany " we 've seen global demand grow in the last couple of years and we have to say that the possibility of increasing output further is limited .
that means … extremely limited availability of extra supplies , " schöning said no one at the weg is keen to talk about a future when oil reserves run out .
they stress , instead , the projection that currently known oil reserves will last for another 50 years , and gas reserves should last another 60 years . political stability is key " the oil and gas reserves are predominantly located in the middle- and far east .
that means areas that we , as a western industry , do n't always have easy access to -lrb- the reserves -rrb- , neither do we have any influence on these countries ' political stability , " schöning said . this supply could be damaged by political instability , such as recent developments in nigeria , where local regions have been fighting over their share of oil wealth .
german oil producers hope transparency is the answer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a refinery in the state of sachsen anhalt schöning said his company rwe is an example .
" our activities in egypt … are clearly regulated through production-sharing agreements .
that means contractual agreements exist with the countries stating exactly what is due to the state and what belongs to the oil companies . " despite the turbulence in world markets and increasing tensions in the major oil-producing nations , weg claims germany 's oil supply is secure .
the fact that the country produces even a fraction of its own oil supply adds an element of stability , schöning said . germany cites balanced supply " here in germany , we have a fairly balanced supply structure .
this applies to both the oil and gas markets , " said schöning .
" if we take the uk as an example , we can see that local oil production will in the future no longer be possible , and they 'll have to rely on the global market for all their energy needs .
this in turn means that price volatility is likely to increase . " one fifth of germany 's gas supply comes from national sources , although its gas production has been decreasing for several years .
moreover , technologically , it is becoming increasingly difficult for germany to exploit its own gas resources in an economically viable manner . schöning discounted the effects political conflicts could have on energy supplies , saying , " i 'm really not that greatly concerned about oil supplies for europe as a whole , as the past has proven .
none of the political conflicts we 've experienced have threatened supplies to any great extent .

on monday , the eu gave serbia a final deadline to cooperate with the united nations war crimes tribunal or jeopardize its negotiations with the eu , which are due to recommence on april 4 . a decade after the war in bosnia , the conflict 's most wanted men - mladic and radovan karadzic - are still on the run .
the bosnian-serb mladic is believed to be hiding in serbia .
before leaving for belgrade , steinmeier had reiterated the relationship between the hunt for war fugitives and serbia 's relationship with the eu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an undated photo of one-time serb leader karadzic , left and his military commander mladic " the connection is clear , so clear that there is no need to formulate an ultimatum , " steinmeier said .
" and it is just as clear that the eu negotiations wo n't be interrupted if there is co-operation from the serbian side . " also up for discussion are territorial disputes involving serbia .
the serbian province of kosovo has been administered by the united nations since 1999 .
kosovo 's ethnic albanians are demanding full independence from serbia , a proposition that the government in belgrade does n't agree with . outrage over ceku n omi n atio n the kosovo issue has been greatly inflamed by the nomination on thursday of former guerrilla leader agim ceku to replace kosovo 's prime minister , who stepped down wednesday . ceku is wanted by serbia on war crimes charges ; belgrade says he is responsible for the death of 669 serbs .
his election was heartily blasted by shocked serbian officials , who warned " the extremists are advancing , " and called the vote " another provocation . " the general was known as a war horse in the struggle against the serbian military and paramilitary , during the civil warns of the 1990s . there is also the question of montenegro , the smaller of the two former yugoslav republics .
montenegro and serbia are joined in a union – but the pro-independence government in montenegro wants out .
the eu has a mediating role in montenegro , and the parliament there on wednesday adopted a law that paves the way for a referendum in may on the independence proposition . kate hairsine -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu warns serbia , bosnia on war crimes cooperation european union foreign ministers warned serbia that its hopes of joining the bloc could be thrown into jeopardy if it fails to step up cooperation with the un war crimes tribunal .

on monday , the eu gave serbia a final deadline to cooperate with the united nations war crimes tribunal or jeopardize its negotiations with the eu , which are due to recommence on april 4 . a decade after the war in bosnia , the conflict 's most wanted men - mladic and radovan karadzic - are still on the run .
the bosnian-serb mladic is believed to be hiding in serbia .
before leaving for belgrade , steinmeier had reiterated the relationship between the hunt for war fugitives and serbia 's relationship with the eu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an undated photo of one-time serb leader karadzic , left and his military commander mladic " the connection is clear , so clear that there is no need to formulate an ultimatum , " steinmeier said .
" and it is just as clear that the eu negotiations wo n't be interrupted if there is co-operation from the serbian side . " also up for discussion are territorial disputes involving serbia .
the serbian province of kosovo has been administered by the united nations since 1999 .
kosovo 's ethnic albanians are demanding full independence from serbia , a proposition that the government in belgrade does n't agree with . outrage over ceku n omi n atio n the kosovo issue has been greatly inflamed by the nomination on thursday of former guerrilla leader agim ceku to replace kosovo 's prime minister , who stepped down wednesday . ceku is wanted by serbia on war crimes charges ; belgrade says he is responsible for the death of 669 serbs .
his election was heartily blasted by shocked serbian officials , who warned " the extremists are advancing , " and called the vote " another provocation . " the general was known as a war horse in the struggle against the serbian military and paramilitary , during the civil warns of the 1990s . there is also the question of montenegro , the smaller of the two former yugoslav republics .
montenegro and serbia are joined in a union – but the pro-independence government in montenegro wants out .
the eu has a mediating role in montenegro , and the parliament there on wednesday adopted a law that paves the way for a referendum in may on the independence proposition . kate hairsine -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu warns serbia , bosnia on war crimes cooperation european union foreign ministers warned serbia that its hopes of joining the bloc could be thrown into jeopardy if it fails to step up cooperation with the un war crimes tribunal .

a village doctor for the past 55 years , he was just 15 when he started practising as a third-generation herbalist .
dr liu quan says everyone got equal health care under mao in the 1970s he received simple training under chairman mao 's programme to send " barefoot doctors " to serve china 's rural masses .
dr liu still wears a faded mao suit and a picture of the great helmsman dominates his bare clinic .
he remembers those days with nostalgia .
" in chairman mao 's time , you could see a doctor whether you had money or not .
we could carry out disease prevention , like injections , whether our patients had money or not .
nowadays only those with money can get injections , " he says .
today the old system providing near-universal access to basic healthcare has been dismantled , as the government tries to spread the cost of providing healthcare to more than one billion people .
our hospital 's state funding is n't enough to even cover staff salaries for one month .
under the current system , hospitals have to chase profit to survive hu weimin , cardiovascular doctor economics rule and village doctors need to turn a profit .
but making money is not easy when your patients are too poor to afford medical services .
a world health organization survey measuring the equality of medical treatment placed china 187th out of 191 countries .
the who 's hana brixi explains : " healthcare providers need to raise revenues .
they are not covered even for the delivery of public services .
" so they necessarily concentrate on those who have resources to spend .
they provide excessive services to those who can pay , and limited services or no services at all to those who are unable to pay . "
the evidence suggests the poor are failing to seek medical treatment because of the cost , while the rich are paying more and more .
government figures show hospital visits actually dropped almost 5 % between 2000 and 2003 , yet hospital profits increased 70 % over the same period .
behind such bald statistics lie heartbreaking stories , like that of mrs li .
she lies semi-paralysed , unable to speak , in a well-known beijing hospital .
this is the result of a failed operation after she suffered a brain aneurysm .
her family have paid $ 18,000 and they do not know where the money has gone .
her daughter , xie pei , suspects the hospital increased the fees after finding out how wealthy they were .
" my friend was visiting and a doctor asked her what my financial circumstances were like and what model of car i drove .
the next day the doctor said the cost of the operation had gone up by $ 5,000 . "
backhanders the family admits they gave bribes to the doctors .
it is not supposed to happen but it is commonplace in china .
" i gave $ 1,000 to the professor , " said xie pei .
" before the operation , a doctor told me that surgery would take place that night and i had to give money to others , including the anaesthetist .
in the end i gave $ 1,700 in red packets .
the first thing they did after the operation -lsb- failed -rsb- was return most of the money . "
the hospital declined to be interviewed by the bbc while it carries out an inquiry .
this case highlights many of the worst problems with china 's health service .
since 1980 , government spending dropped from 36 % of all healthcare expenditure to 17 % , while patients ' out-of-pocket spending rocketed up from 20 % to 59 % .
one media report said a girl had 108 tests for an appendectomy , including an aids test hu weimin with low subsidies , hospitals need to find other ways to cover their costs .
hu weimin knows their strategies all too well .
he is a cardiovascular doctor turned whistleblower , who publicised his hospital 's regulations showing how it made money from patients .
at his hospital , in hunan province , doctors and their departments got a percentage payment from every prescription they wrote .
so the more medicine doctors prescribed , the more they earned .
each time a patient was hospitalised , the physician was awarded a bonus of $ 3 , while more sophisticated procedures earned bigger handouts .
" there are many examples of chasing profit , such as ordering unnecessary test for a patient , " dr hu told the bbc .
" for example , if someone has a cold , giving them a ct scan .
one media report said a girl had 108 tests for an appendectomy , including an aids test .
moreover the cost of medicine has doubled , tripled or worse by the time it reaches the patients . "
dr hu was unwilling to speak about his own experience in detail .
he had been beaten after exposing his hospital 's charging system , and his family have moved elsewhere , fearful for their safety .
but dr hu admitted hospitals have no choice but to act the way they do .
" our hospital 's state funding is n't enough to even cover staff salaries for one month .
under the current system , hospitals have to chase profit to survive . "
the system has even been criticised by a government think tank , the state council 's development research centre , which said healthcare reforms had " basically failed " .
reforms it warned that social stability and public support for the government could be affected if the country does not overhaul healthcare .
but health ministry spokesman mao qun 'an disagreed .
" we 're providing basic health services for 22 % of the world 's population with 2 % of the resources .
i think we 've had enormous success , " he told the bbc .
he also outlined an ambitious programme of further reforms , including building low-cost hospitals in cities and providing healthcare insurance to the whole population by 2010 .
however , mr mao acknowledged the system of hospital funding was flawed and admitted there was some overcharging .
" i think we are bravely admitting that problems exist in our medical system , and that 's a sign of our self-confidence , " he said .
" it 's an expression of our determination to tackle these problems . "
cheng changzhen 's extended family contributed to her treatment but in fengyan village in sichuan province , change will come too late for one family .
mrs cheng is already stick-thin , her flesh cleaving to her bones .
she watches as the rest of the family eats , unable to keep her food down .
she has womb cancer , but had to stop treatment after four rounds of chemotherapy .
" we have no money , " she told me .
" we relied on friends and relatives to raise money , but they ca n't raise any more .
i still need treatment , but there 's no more money . "
her son dropped out of high school to find work , sacrificing his future to raise money for his mother 's treatment .
her husband , liu niancai , admits her illness has plunged the extended family , and some of their neighbours , into poverty .
" we used our life savings , more than $ 1,000 , for treatment .
but it cost more than three times that .
all our relations and friends gave money , but it was n't anywhere near enough , " he said .
one world bank study found 20 % of china 's poor blamed healthcare costs for their financial straits .
and the country 's healthcare crisis reflects its biggest problems - fighting corruption , and bridging the ever-increasing divide between the rich and the poor , the city and the countryside .
with anger growing among the have-nots , china 's leaders may find the political cost of failing to solve the problem could be higher than they ever imagined .

a village doctor for the past 55 years , he was just 15 when he started practising as a third-generation herbalist .
dr liu quan says everyone got equal health care under mao in the 1970s he received simple training under chairman mao 's programme to send " barefoot doctors " to serve china 's rural masses .
dr liu still wears a faded mao suit and a picture of the great helmsman dominates his bare clinic .
he remembers those days with nostalgia .
" in chairman mao 's time , you could see a doctor whether you had money or not .
we could carry out disease prevention , like injections , whether our patients had money or not .
nowadays only those with money can get injections , " he says .
today the old system providing near-universal access to basic healthcare has been dismantled , as the government tries to spread the cost of providing healthcare to more than one billion people .
our hospital 's state funding is n't enough to even cover staff salaries for one month .
under the current system , hospitals have to chase profit to survive hu weimin , cardiovascular doctor economics rule and village doctors need to turn a profit .
but making money is not easy when your patients are too poor to afford medical services .
a world health organization survey measuring the equality of medical treatment placed china 187th out of 191 countries .
the who 's hana brixi explains : " healthcare providers need to raise revenues .
they are not covered even for the delivery of public services .
" so they necessarily concentrate on those who have resources to spend .
they provide excessive services to those who can pay , and limited services or no services at all to those who are unable to pay . "
the evidence suggests the poor are failing to seek medical treatment because of the cost , while the rich are paying more and more .
government figures show hospital visits actually dropped almost 5 % between 2000 and 2003 , yet hospital profits increased 70 % over the same period .
behind such bald statistics lie heartbreaking stories , like that of mrs li .
she lies semi-paralysed , unable to speak , in a well-known beijing hospital .
this is the result of a failed operation after she suffered a brain aneurysm .
her family have paid $ 18,000 and they do not know where the money has gone .
her daughter , xie pei , suspects the hospital increased the fees after finding out how wealthy they were .
" my friend was visiting and a doctor asked her what my financial circumstances were like and what model of car i drove .
the next day the doctor said the cost of the operation had gone up by $ 5,000 . "
backhanders the family admits they gave bribes to the doctors .
it is not supposed to happen but it is commonplace in china .
" i gave $ 1,000 to the professor , " said xie pei .
" before the operation , a doctor told me that surgery would take place that night and i had to give money to others , including the anaesthetist .
in the end i gave $ 1,700 in red packets .
the first thing they did after the operation -lsb- failed -rsb- was return most of the money . "
the hospital declined to be interviewed by the bbc while it carries out an inquiry .
this case highlights many of the worst problems with china 's health service .
since 1980 , government spending dropped from 36 % of all healthcare expenditure to 17 % , while patients ' out-of-pocket spending rocketed up from 20 % to 59 % .
one media report said a girl had 108 tests for an appendectomy , including an aids test hu weimin with low subsidies , hospitals need to find other ways to cover their costs .
hu weimin knows their strategies all too well .
he is a cardiovascular doctor turned whistleblower , who publicised his hospital 's regulations showing how it made money from patients .
at his hospital , in hunan province , doctors and their departments got a percentage payment from every prescription they wrote .
so the more medicine doctors prescribed , the more they earned .
each time a patient was hospitalised , the physician was awarded a bonus of $ 3 , while more sophisticated procedures earned bigger handouts .
" there are many examples of chasing profit , such as ordering unnecessary test for a patient , " dr hu told the bbc .
" for example , if someone has a cold , giving them a ct scan .
one media report said a girl had 108 tests for an appendectomy , including an aids test .
moreover the cost of medicine has doubled , tripled or worse by the time it reaches the patients . "
dr hu was unwilling to speak about his own experience in detail .
he had been beaten after exposing his hospital 's charging system , and his family have moved elsewhere , fearful for their safety .
but dr hu admitted hospitals have no choice but to act the way they do .
" our hospital 's state funding is n't enough to even cover staff salaries for one month .
under the current system , hospitals have to chase profit to survive . "
the system has even been criticised by a government think tank , the state council 's development research centre , which said healthcare reforms had " basically failed " .
reforms it warned that social stability and public support for the government could be affected if the country does not overhaul healthcare .
but health ministry spokesman mao qun 'an disagreed .
" we 're providing basic health services for 22 % of the world 's population with 2 % of the resources .
i think we 've had enormous success , " he told the bbc .
he also outlined an ambitious programme of further reforms , including building low-cost hospitals in cities and providing healthcare insurance to the whole population by 2010 .
however , mr mao acknowledged the system of hospital funding was flawed and admitted there was some overcharging .
" i think we are bravely admitting that problems exist in our medical system , and that 's a sign of our self-confidence , " he said .
" it 's an expression of our determination to tackle these problems . "
cheng changzhen 's extended family contributed to her treatment but in fengyan village in sichuan province , change will come too late for one family .
mrs cheng is already stick-thin , her flesh cleaving to her bones .
she watches as the rest of the family eats , unable to keep her food down .
she has womb cancer , but had to stop treatment after four rounds of chemotherapy .
" we have no money , " she told me .
" we relied on friends and relatives to raise money , but they ca n't raise any more .
i still need treatment , but there 's no more money . "
her son dropped out of high school to find work , sacrificing his future to raise money for his mother 's treatment .
her husband , liu niancai , admits her illness has plunged the extended family , and some of their neighbours , into poverty .
" we used our life savings , more than $ 1,000 , for treatment .
but it cost more than three times that .
all our relations and friends gave money , but it was n't anywhere near enough , " he said .
one world bank study found 20 % of china 's poor blamed healthcare costs for their financial straits .
and the country 's healthcare crisis reflects its biggest problems - fighting corruption , and bridging the ever-increasing divide between the rich and the poor , the city and the countryside .
with anger growing among the have-nots , china 's leaders may find the political cost of failing to solve the problem could be higher than they ever imagined .

so the more medicine doctors prescribed , the more they earned .
each time a patient was hospitalised , the physician was awarded a bonus of $ 3 , while more sophisticated procedures earned bigger handouts .
" there are many examples of chasing profit , such as ordering unnecessary test for a patient , " dr hu told the bbc .
" for example , if someone has a cold , giving them a ct scan .
one media report said a girl had 108 tests for an appendectomy , including an aids test .
moreover the cost of medicine has doubled , tripled or worse by the time it reaches the patients . "
dr hu was unwilling to speak about his own experience in detail .
he had been beaten after exposing his hospital 's charging system , and his family have moved elsewhere , fearful for their safety .
but dr hu admitted hospitals have no choice but to act the way they do .
" our hospital 's state funding is n't enough to even cover staff salaries for one month .
under the current system , hospitals have to chase profit to survive . "
the system has even been criticised by a government think tank , the state council 's development research centre , which said healthcare reforms had " basically failed " .
reforms it warned that social stability and public support for the government could be affected if the country does not overhaul healthcare .
but health ministry spokesman mao qun 'an disagreed .
" we 're providing basic health services for 22 % of the world 's population with 2 % of the resources .
i think we 've had enormous success , " he told the bbc .
he also outlined an ambitious programme of further reforms , including building low-cost hospitals in cities and providing healthcare insurance to the whole population by 2010 .
however , mr mao acknowledged the system of hospital funding was flawed and admitted there was some overcharging .
" i think we are bravely admitting that problems exist in our medical system , and that 's a sign of our self-confidence , " he said .
" it 's an expression of our determination to tackle these problems . "
cheng changzhen 's extended family contributed to her treatment but in fengyan village in sichuan province , change will come too late for one family .

she watches as the rest of the family eats , unable to keep her food down .
she has womb cancer , but had to stop treatment after four rounds of chemotherapy .
" we have no money , " she told me .
" we relied on friends and relatives to raise money , but they ca n't raise any more .

her son dropped out of high school to find work , sacrificing his future to raise money for his mother 's treatment .
her husband , liu niancai , admits her illness has plunged the extended family , and some of their neighbours , into poverty .
" we used our life savings , more than $ 1,000 , for treatment .

a village doctor for the past 55 years , he was just 15 when he started practising as a third-generation herbalist .
dr liu quan says everyone got equal health care under mao in the 1970s he received simple training under chairman mao 's programme to send " barefoot doctors " to serve china 's rural masses .
dr liu still wears a faded mao suit and a picture of the great helmsman dominates his bare clinic .
he remembers those days with nostalgia .
" in chairman mao 's time , you could see a doctor whether you had money or not .
we could carry out disease prevention , like injections , whether our patients had money or not .
nowadays only those with money can get injections , " he says .
today the old system providing near-universal access to basic healthcare has been dismantled , as the government tries to spread the cost of providing healthcare to more than one billion people .
our hospital 's state funding is n't enough to even cover staff salaries for one month .
under the current system , hospitals have to chase profit to survive hu weimin , cardiovascular doctor economics rule and village doctors need to turn a profit .
but making money is not easy when your patients are too poor to afford medical services .
a world health organization survey measuring the equality of medical treatment placed china 187th out of 191 countries .
the who 's hana brixi explains : " healthcare providers need to raise revenues .
they are not covered even for the delivery of public services .
" so they necessarily concentrate on those who have resources to spend .
they provide excessive services to those who can pay , and limited services or no services at all to those who are unable to pay . "
the evidence suggests the poor are failing to seek medical treatment because of the cost , while the rich are paying more and more .
government figures show hospital visits actually dropped almost 5 % between 2000 and 2003 , yet hospital profits increased 70 % over the same period .
behind such bald statistics lie heartbreaking stories , like that of mrs li .
she lies semi-paralysed , unable to speak , in a well-known beijing hospital .
this is the result of a failed operation after she suffered a brain aneurysm .
her family have paid $ 18,000 and they do not know where the money has gone .
her daughter , xie pei , suspects the hospital increased the fees after finding out how wealthy they were .
" my friend was visiting and a doctor asked her what my financial circumstances were like and what model of car i drove .
the next day the doctor said the cost of the operation had gone up by $ 5,000 . "
backhanders the family admits they gave bribes to the doctors .
it is not supposed to happen but it is commonplace in china .
" i gave $ 1,000 to the professor , " said xie pei .
" before the operation , a doctor told me that surgery would take place that night and i had to give money to others , including the anaesthetist .
in the end i gave $ 1,700 in red packets .
the first thing they did after the operation -lsb- failed -rsb- was return most of the money . "
the hospital declined to be interviewed by the bbc while it carries out an inquiry .
this case highlights many of the worst problems with china 's health service .
since 1980 , government spending dropped from 36 % of all healthcare expenditure to 17 % , while patients ' out-of-pocket spending rocketed up from 20 % to 59 % .
one media report said a girl had 108 tests for an appendectomy , including an aids test hu weimin with low subsidies , hospitals need to find other ways to cover their costs .
hu weimin knows their strategies all too well .

the decision to scrap the show came after women 's groups voiced anger that the boxer is a convicted rapist .
it also followed calls for the 39-year-old not to be allowed in the uk due to his violent reputation .
brighton and hove city council leader simon burgess said he was confident he had made the right decision .
tyson was the youngest ever heavyweight champion but was jailed for rape in 1992 .
the event had been due to take place at the brighton centre on 22 march .
it had been billed as part of a drive to get youngsters back into boxing and disciplined sports .

a spokesperson said official guidance sets out clearly who should be counted as a rough sleeper .
people sleeping in the open air - such as on the streets , or in doorways , parks or bus shelters - and people in buildings or other places not designed for habitation are all counted , the odpm said .
public perception of rough sleeping can often be affected by people seen drinking and begging on the streets during the day , but who do not sleep rough overnight and have homes to return to .

the firm 's share price inched slightly upwards on wednesday to $ 364.80 -lrb- £ 208.46 -rrb- , a rise of $ 2.18 or 0.6 % .
tuesday 's fall came after google 's chief finance officer george reyes said overall growth was slowing .
google later issued a statement seeking to assure investors that the company still saw " significant opportunities " for revenue growth .
mr reyes told investors at a conference that the company would have to find new ways to increase revenues . " we 're going to have to find other ways to monetise the business , " he said .
nearly all google advertising revenue comes from a pay-per-click ads system .
' negative reaction ' " growth is slowing and now largely organic , " mr reyes was quoted as saying .
increasing the number of search queries google performs would be one way to achieve such growth , he said . "
google is taking a shaky market down .
it 's the other shoe to drop " larry peruzzi , analyst " the search monetisation gains have now been largely realised . "
tim biggam , chief options strategist at man securities in chicago , said that stock valuations based on future growth prospects were also likely to be hit when expectations were dampened .
" as in the case with google ... you are going to see this sort of negative reaction in the marketplace . "
google stock had been hit in january over fears that its shares were overvalued .

the complex ciphers were encoded in 1942 by a new version of the german enigma machine , and led to regular hits on allied vessels by german u-boats .
allied experts initially failed to deal with the german adoption in 1942 of a complex new cipher system , brought in at the same time as a newly upgraded enigma machine .

mr krah named the project m4 , in honour of the m4 enigma machine that originally encoded the ciphers .

using early computers , bletchley park decoded thousands of intercepts in a knife-edge race to head off u-boat attacks .
german messages were encoded using the fearsome enigma machine , which used a series of rotors , often augmented by a so-called " plugboard " , to scramble transmissions not meant for allied eyes .
the machines used ever-changing rotor wheel combinations and electrical currents to produce unique coded messages .
plugboards further complicated matters by swapping pairs of letters over during the encoding process , greatly increasing the numbers of possible encryptions .

mr krah told the bbc news website that " basic human curiosity " had motivated him to crack the codes , but stressed the debt he owed to veteran codebreaking enthusiasts who have spent years researching enigma .

mr krah named the project m4 , in honour of the m4 enigma machine that originally encoded the ciphers .
there are now some 2,500 separate terminals contributing to the project , mr krah said .
" the most amazing thing about the project is the exponential growth of participants .
all i did myself was to announce it in two news groups and on one mailing list . "
nevertheless , in little over a month an apparently random combination of letters had been decoded into a real wartime communication .
in its encrypted form the cipher makes no sense at all , reading as follows : bletchley park was thought to cut wwii by two years " nczw vusx pnym inhz xmqx sfwx wlkj ahsh nmco ccak uqpm kcsm hkse inju sblk iosx ckub hmll xcsj usrr dvko hulx wccb gvli yxeo ahxr hkkf vdre wezl xoba fgyu jquk grtv ukam eurb veks uhhv oyha bcjw makl fklm yfvn rizr vvrt kofd anjm olbg ffle oprg tflv rhow opbe kvwm uqfm pwpa rmfh agkx iibg " unencrypted and translated into english , the message suddenly comes to life : " forced to submerge during attack .

a check against existing records confirmed that the message was sent by kapitanleutnant hartwig looks , commander of the german navy 's u264 submarine , on 25 november 1942 .
sophisticated during the war , teams of codebreakers based at bletchley park , in the uk , scrambled to unravel german communications in an attempt both to undermine the german war machine and to save the lives of soldiers and seamen .
frantic codebreaking work was carried out in plain-looking huts using early computers , bletchley park decoded thousands of intercepts in a knife-edge race to head off u-boat attacks .
german messages were encoded using the fearsome enigma machine , which used a series of rotors , often augmented by a so-called " plugboard " , to scramble transmissions not meant for allied eyes .
the machines used ever-changing rotor wheel combinations and electrical currents to produce unique coded messages .
plugboards further complicated matters by swapping pairs of letters over during the encoding process , greatly increasing the numbers of possible encryptions .

the combined approach increases the chances of stumbling across a match by recreating possible combinations of plugboard swaps while methodically working through combinations of rotor settings .
proud milestone bletchley park and its codebreakers have been immortalised on television , in film and in best-selling novels .
now a museum , staff at the site are not attempting to close the book on world war ii by solving any remaining ciphers .
that they leave to the enthusiasts .
but a spokeswoman said that bletchley park followed the m4 project with interest , describing mr krah 's work as a " great tribute " to the achievements of the wartime codebreakers .
ralph erskine , who submitted the original intercepts to the journal cryptologia in december 1995 , told the bbc news website that cracking the german codes after more than 63 years would be an important milestone for amateur cryptologists .
" i think there is more satisfaction for people engaged in the project to know that they have been able to do something that bletchley park could n't do , " he said .

some are too young to be immunised .
health officials in doncaster warned there could be a large outbreak in the town when five cases were confirmed last week .
there has not been a confirmed case of measles in the area for five years .

the immunisation was introduced in the uk in 1988 and by 1992 more than 90 % of children were being immunised .
children are given a first dose at 12 to 15 months and a second , booster dose , at between three and five years old .

hefce announced that funding for higher education in england would rise by almost 6 % this year .
and it said £ 6.7bn would be available next year , including an increase for recruiting more students .
the government said it was committed to " making progress " towards having half of young people in higher education .
it was an " economic and social necessity " said higher education minister bill rammell .
' solid platform ' the funding council said that participation -lrb- the proportion of young people in higher education -rrb- currently stood at 42.5 % , and was predicted to rise to 43 % next year .
it said the rate of growth would not be enough to ensure a rise to 50 % by 2010 .
but £ 344m had been allocated to support the widening of participation of students from under-represented groups , and those at risk of not completing their studies .
there had been concerns that there would be no substantial rise in higher education funding this year , since universities will gain increased revenue from variable tuition fees for the first time from september .
but funding for teaching will rise by 6.3 % to £ 4,228 - and there will be an increase of 8.5 % for capital funding , including research equipment .
acting chief executive of hefce , steve egan , said : " this represents a good settlement for universities and colleges .
" building on previous announcements , funding for 2006-07 continues to make significant inroads into the cumulative effect of years of under-funding of higher education . "
he said the increase in funding , together with additional income from fees , would provide them with a " solid platform " to develop .
he added that the resources would help institutions meet one of the " biggest challenges " facing higher education - recruitment and retention of under-represented groups .
the settlement will also provide an extra £ 98m to provide extra student places , of which £ 18m is for new medical and dental students .
' no cap on ambition ' hefce funds individual institutions according to their number of students , subject mix and quality of research .
a spokesperson for universities uk said the settlement would go some way towards enabling institutions to pursue objectives of widening participation , engaging in world-class research and raising student numbers .
" universities are fully committed to making higher education open to all and we 're pleased that additional funding has been made available , " the spokesperson said .
higher education minister bill rammell said : " our commitment has always been to make progress towards 50 % participation in he for 18-30 year olds by 2010 ... because it is both an economic and social necessity .
" at the heart of government education policies is the belief that people with aspiration and talent , irrespective of background , must have the opportunity to get on in life .

it said the rate of growth would not be enough to ensure a rise to 50 % by 2010 .
but £ 344m had been allocated to support the widening of participation of students from under-represented groups , and those at risk of not completing their studies .
there had been concerns that there would be no substantial rise in higher education funding this year , since universities will gain increased revenue from variable tuition fees for the first time from september .
but funding for teaching will rise by 6.3 % to £ 4,228 - and there will be an increase of 8.5 % for capital funding , including research equipment .
acting chief executive of hefce , steve egan , said : " this represents a good settlement for universities and colleges .
" building on previous announcements , funding for 2006-07 continues to make significant inroads into the cumulative effect of years of under-funding of higher education . "
he said the increase in funding , together with additional income from fees , would provide them with a " solid platform " to develop .
he added that the resources would help institutions meet one of the " biggest challenges " facing higher education - recruitment and retention of under-represented groups .
the settlement will also provide an extra £ 98m to provide extra student places , of which £ 18m is for new medical and dental students .
' no cap on ambition ' hefce funds individual institutions according to their number of students , subject mix and quality of research .
a spokesperson for universities uk said the settlement would go some way towards enabling institutions to pursue objectives of widening participation , engaging in world-class research and raising student numbers .
" universities are fully committed to making higher education open to all and we 're pleased that additional funding has been made available , " the spokesperson said .
higher education minister bill rammell said : " our commitment has always been to make progress towards 50 % participation in he for 18-30 year olds by 2010 ... because it is both an economic and social necessity .
" at the heart of government education policies is the belief that people with aspiration and talent , irrespective of background , must have the opportunity to get on in life .
we should not put a cap on ambition .
" that is why the government believes we need to expand , not restrict , the numbers that go to university . "

figures from nearly two thirds of billing authorities suggest an average band-d home bill rise of £ 53 , to £ 1250 .
despite being more than twice the rate of inflation , the council tax rise is only marginally above last year 's and the second lowest in a decade .
but the isitfair campaign group says the rise is too much for pensioners .
despite the relatively small increase in bills overall , the group , which campaigns for local tax reform , says elderly people will be hit as it comes on top of big rises in heating costs .
marginal rise two pensioners were jailed last year for withdrawing part of their council tax and many others have also threatened to pay inflation-only increases .
government threats of capping appear to have worked , with many councils coming in just under the perceived 5 % capping limit and only a few going above .
the chief executive of cipfa , steve freer , said the government 's efforts to keep council tax increases under control appeared to be working .
if he does n't hand over that £ 200 to pensioners , i think there 'll be a terrific , bitter feeling in the nation eric pickles conservative local government spokesman " it is very clear that the government at the centre is very , very keen to keep council tax increases under control .
" it 's using the threat of capping local authority budgets to impose that control and the vast majority of authorities have clearly heeded that message and are setting below that level . "
in london , the prospect of elections in may appears to have had an impact .
spending contracts at least five boroughs have frozen bills at the current level - their charges only increased by the rise in ken livingstone 's mayoral precept , which includes a payment towards the 2012 olympics .
chairman of the local government association sandy bruce-lockhart said the rise was higher than councils had wanted , but spending was difficult to control as it involved contractors .
" so much of what local government spends now they contract with the private sector .
he said the department of trade and industry found road maintenance cost had risen 6.5 % while street lighting costs were up 18 % on new contracts .
" so if you 're getting an increase of two or 3 % , it 's very hard to meet those costs and keep council tax down . "
local government minister phil woolas said the government was not to blame for the increase .
" we have put a cap on it .
the councils themselves set the council tax . "
he added that labour councils were " coming in the lowest and the liberal democrats and conservatives , higher . "
' bitter feeling ' however , the conservatives ' local government spokesman , eric pickles , said council tax " has increased by 84 % under labour , and people on fixed incomes , particularly pensioners , have been hit hard " .
mr woolas had been unable to confirm on bbc radio 4 's today programme whether pensioners would receive £ 200 payment to help with council tax .
mr pickles said this meant pensioners had been " abandoned by the chancellor " .
" if he does n't hand over that £ 200 to pensioners , i think there 'll be a terrific , bitter feeling in the nation , " mr pickles said .

despite the relatively small increase in bills overall , the group , which campaigns for local tax reform , says elderly people will be hit as it comes on top of big rises in heating costs .
marginal rise two pensioners were jailed last year for withdrawing part of their council tax and many others have also threatened to pay inflation-only increases .
government threats of capping appear to have worked , with many councils coming in just under the perceived 5 % capping limit and only a few going above .
the chief executive of cipfa , steve freer , said the government 's efforts to keep council tax increases under control appeared to be working .
if he does n't hand over that £ 200 to pensioners , i think there 'll be a terrific , bitter feeling in the nation eric pickles conservative local government spokesman " it is very clear that the government at the centre is very , very keen to keep council tax increases under control .
" it 's using the threat of capping local authority budgets to impose that control and the vast majority of authorities have clearly heeded that message and are setting below that level . "
in london , the prospect of elections in may appears to have had an impact .
spending contracts at least five boroughs have frozen bills at the current level - their charges only increased by the rise in ken livingstone 's mayoral precept , which includes a payment towards the 2012 olympics .
chairman of the local government association sandy bruce-lockhart said the rise was higher than councils had wanted , but spending was difficult to control as it involved contractors .
" so much of what local government spends now they contract with the private sector .
he said the department of trade and industry found road maintenance cost had risen 6.5 % while street lighting costs were up 18 % on new contracts .
" so if you 're getting an increase of two or 3 % , it 's very hard to meet those costs and keep council tax down . "
local government minister phil woolas said the government was not to blame for the increase .

the councils themselves set the council tax . "
he added that labour councils were " coming in the lowest and the liberal democrats and conservatives , higher . "

mr woolas had been unable to confirm on bbc radio 4 's today programme whether pensioners would receive £ 200 payment to help with council tax .
mr pickles said this meant pensioners had been " abandoned by the chancellor " .
" if he does n't hand over that £ 200 to pensioners , i think there 'll be a terrific , bitter feeling in the nation , " mr pickles said .

new leader has to put party back on track the leader who had just taken the party to its best election result for 80 years was forced out by his colleagues over his drinking , one candidate was embroiled in a sex scandal and another forced to apologise if he had misled anyone over his sexuality .
so the first task facing the new leader is to start the fightback after a leadership contest which has failed to claim the headlines for positive reasons .
former leader lord paddy ashdown spelled out the challenge - with the party facing a battle for the political centre ground with both conservatives and labour .
lord ashdown , who endorsed sir menzies campbell , admitted the party faced a hard time in the short term but offered the new leader an optimistic picture of a future of , at worst , power sharing and , at best , outright power .
the stunning dunfermline by-election victory last month seemed to give some substance to that optimism , suggesting that despite the negative headlines the party was still attracting voters .
but few doubt that the new leader will need to start rebuilding the party 's image which , under charles kennedy , focused on trust and openness .
common purpose it will not be easy , but the weekend spring conference in harrogate will offer the perfect opportunity for the leader to start that process with his first keynote speech .
but there are other major issues that need to be addressed - most crucially the direction in which the party will now be taken .
ashdown supported sir menzies the leadership campaign was relatively free of personal wrangling and all agreed that there was a need to re-unify the party once it was over .
that message of unity and common purpose is also bound to be sent out from the harrogate conference .
the challenge is to resolve the long-running battle between the so-called social liberals and economic liberals .
in simple terms that is a split between those who emphasise the issues of civil liberties and state-run public services and those supporters of the orange book who have adopted a more market oriented , some say right-wing agenda .
charles kennedy was widely regarded as having not tackled this split - the challenge for the new leader is to do so without alienating one of those wings .
both worlds but the battle over whether the party becomes the new left-wing option , to the left of labour , or continues to fight on that crowded middle ground has to be ended .
kennedy was forced out during the campaign , simon hughes was seen as the left wing champion while chris huhne won the support of many of the orange bookers .
sir menzies campbell attempted to avoid either label .
but all insisted the divide was not as simple or irreconcilable as some had suggested and there is always room for a bit of cherry picking between the two agendas in a bid to get what is seen as the best of both worlds .
electorally , the task is to build on recent by-election victories , notably dunfermline , and see that translate back into a sense of optimism over the next general election .
some of that optimism had already worn off in the wake of the good , but not as good as some had hoped , result at the 2005 general election .
if david cameron continues to move onto the centre ground with policies deliberately designed to attract former lib dem voters , it could be difficult to restore that sense of hope for the future .
so the new leader will want to map out a distinct agenda - and that may well take some considerable time and involve a wide-ranging policy review , originally set up by mr kennedy .
then there is a frontbench reshuffle in which the leader will need to give the other two contenders senior portfolios while also offering jobs to representatives of the different wings of the party and bring on some of the young new mps who entered the commons at the last election as ever , for any new leader , the real struggle starts now .

new leader has to put party back on track the leader who had just taken the party to its best election result for 80 years was forced out by his colleagues over his drinking , one candidate was embroiled in a sex scandal and another forced to apologise if he had misled anyone over his sexuality .
so the first task facing the new leader is to start the fightback after a leadership contest which has failed to claim the headlines for positive reasons .
former leader lord paddy ashdown spelled out the challenge - with the party facing a battle for the political centre ground with both conservatives and labour .
lord ashdown , who endorsed sir menzies campbell , admitted the party faced a hard time in the short term but offered the new leader an optimistic picture of a future of , at worst , power sharing and , at best , outright power .
the stunning dunfermline by-election victory last month seemed to give some substance to that optimism , suggesting that despite the negative headlines the party was still attracting voters .
but few doubt that the new leader will need to start rebuilding the party 's image which , under charles kennedy , focused on trust and openness .
common purpose it will not be easy , but the weekend spring conference in harrogate will offer the perfect opportunity for the leader to start that process with his first keynote speech .
but there are other major issues that need to be addressed - most crucially the direction in which the party will now be taken .
ashdown supported sir menzies the leadership campaign was relatively free of personal wrangling and all agreed that there was a need to re-unify the party once it was over .
that message of unity and common purpose is also bound to be sent out from the harrogate conference .
the challenge is to resolve the long-running battle between the so-called social liberals and economic liberals .
in simple terms that is a split between those who emphasise the issues of civil liberties and state-run public services and those supporters of the orange book who have adopted a more market oriented , some say right-wing agenda .
charles kennedy was widely regarded as having not tackled this split - the challenge for the new leader is to do so without alienating one of those wings .
both worlds but the battle over whether the party becomes the new left-wing option , to the left of labour , or continues to fight on that crowded middle ground has to be ended .
kennedy was forced out during the campaign , simon hughes was seen as the left wing champion while chris huhne won the support of many of the orange bookers .
sir menzies campbell attempted to avoid either label .
but all insisted the divide was not as simple or irreconcilable as some had suggested and there is always room for a bit of cherry picking between the two agendas in a bid to get what is seen as the best of both worlds .
electorally , the task is to build on recent by-election victories , notably dunfermline , and see that translate back into a sense of optimism over the next general election .
some of that optimism had already worn off in the wake of the good , but not as good as some had hoped , result at the 2005 general election .
if david cameron continues to move onto the centre ground with policies deliberately designed to attract former lib dem voters , it could be difficult to restore that sense of hope for the future .
so the new leader will want to map out a distinct agenda - and that may well take some considerable time and involve a wide-ranging policy review , originally set up by mr kennedy .
then there is a frontbench reshuffle in which the leader will need to give the other two contenders senior portfolios while also offering jobs to representatives of the different wings of the party and bring on some of the young new mps who entered the commons at the last election as ever , for any new leader , the real struggle starts now .

new leader has to put party back on track the leader who had just taken the party to its best election result for 80 years was forced out by his colleagues over his drinking , one candidate was embroiled in a sex scandal and another forced to apologise if he had misled anyone over his sexuality .
so the first task facing the new leader is to start the fightback after a leadership contest which has failed to claim the headlines for positive reasons .
former leader lord paddy ashdown spelled out the challenge - with the party facing a battle for the political centre ground with both conservatives and labour .
lord ashdown , who endorsed sir menzies campbell , admitted the party faced a hard time in the short term but offered the new leader an optimistic picture of a future of , at worst , power sharing and , at best , outright power .
the stunning dunfermline by-election victory last month seemed to give some substance to that optimism , suggesting that despite the negative headlines the party was still attracting voters .
but few doubt that the new leader will need to start rebuilding the party 's image which , under charles kennedy , focused on trust and openness .
common purpose it will not be easy , but the weekend spring conference in harrogate will offer the perfect opportunity for the leader to start that process with his first keynote speech .
but there are other major issues that need to be addressed - most crucially the direction in which the party will now be taken .
ashdown supported sir menzies the leadership campaign was relatively free of personal wrangling and all agreed that there was a need to re-unify the party once it was over .
that message of unity and common purpose is also bound to be sent out from the harrogate conference .
the challenge is to resolve the long-running battle between the so-called social liberals and economic liberals .
in simple terms that is a split between those who emphasise the issues of civil liberties and state-run public services and those supporters of the orange book who have adopted a more market oriented , some say right-wing agenda .
charles kennedy was widely regarded as having not tackled this split - the challenge for the new leader is to do so without alienating one of those wings .
both worlds but the battle over whether the party becomes the new left-wing option , to the left of labour , or continues to fight on that crowded middle ground has to be ended .
kennedy was forced out during the campaign , simon hughes was seen as the left wing champion while chris huhne won the support of many of the orange bookers .
sir menzies campbell attempted to avoid either label .
but all insisted the divide was not as simple or irreconcilable as some had suggested and there is always room for a bit of cherry picking between the two agendas in a bid to get what is seen as the best of both worlds .
electorally , the task is to build on recent by-election victories , notably dunfermline , and see that translate back into a sense of optimism over the next general election .
some of that optimism had already worn off in the wake of the good , but not as good as some had hoped , result at the 2005 general election .
if david cameron continues to move onto the centre ground with policies deliberately designed to attract former lib dem voters , it could be difficult to restore that sense of hope for the future .
so the new leader will want to map out a distinct agenda - and that may well take some considerable time and involve a wide-ranging policy review , originally set up by mr kennedy .
then there is a frontbench reshuffle in which the leader will need to give the other two contenders senior portfolios while also offering jobs to representatives of the different wings of the party and bring on some of the young new mps who entered the commons at the last election as ever , for any new leader , the real struggle starts now .

eager for a glimpse of the disgraced rock star , who is accused of molesting two young girls , many of those waiting imagined they would be met by a broken man .
but as he stepped out of the van , 61-year-old glitter looked far from defeated .
his face was gaunt and he had evidently lost weight during his four-month detention , but as he walked up the stairs for the start of his trial , he raised his hand in a victory salute and mouthed the word " innocent " .
manual labour since his arrest in november , glitter has been incarcerated in a jail on the outskirts of vung tau town .
it is a forbidding place , surrounded by four-metre -lrb- 13ft -rrb- walls topped with razor wire .
local man van hien said he was n't really following the glitter trial inmates carry out manual work in the hot vietnamese sun , wearing regulation black and white-striped outfits - a world away from the outrageous silver suits and bright , thick make-up that were glitter 's trademark in his 1970s heyday .
but then , even before his arrest , his life was not exactly that of an international rock star .
since 1999 , when he was jailed for two months in the uk for downloading pornographic images , glitter has flitted from country to country .
after being deported from cambodia amid unspecified rumours of child abuse in 2002 , he eventually made his home in vung tau , buying a house on the beachfront and mingling with other expatriates .
before his arrest , hardly anyone in vung tau knew of his famous past .
and even now they do know , few of them care .
while the british press was clamouring to get a glimpse of glitter at the court on thursday , few vietnamese turned up - and even then , many of them were attracted by the presence of foreign media rather than the former star .
glitter ' naive ' back in the town of vung tau itself , less than 30 minutes away from the court , thursday morning was just like any other .
even people playing cards in the alley next to the former rock star 's house showed little interest .
vung tau 's cd shop does not sell any of glitter 's music " i knew gary glitter by sight as i live and work around here , but i 'm not really following the case , " said van hien , as he sat in a plastic chair next to the wall into glitter 's garden .
westerners living in vung tau are understandably more interested in the trial proceedings .
" we do talk about gary glitter , yes , " said drew , an australian who works on the nearby offshore oil rigs .
" but to be honest , we often joke about it - not the allegations , of course , but how he could have been so stupid and naive .
" if you 're gary glitter , to come here and have young girls round to your house - whatever happens after that - well , it 's just stupid . "
lasting legacy some locals are also worried about the effect of the trial on the town 's image .
" i think it will change people 's views about vung tau , and make them think it 's a place for foreigners to come to visit young girls , " said nguyen thi bich lien , the owner of a local music shop .
" if that happens , i 'm afraid there will be other cases like this one , " she said .
whatever the verdict of the trial , it seems almost certain that glitter will not be welcomed back to live in vung tau as a free man .
his lasting legacy in the town will certainly not be his music , but the notoriety brought by the court case .
" gary glitter used to come into my shop a lot to buy cds , " said nguyen thi bich lien .
" we never sold any of his music , though .
in fact i have n't even heard any his songs .

the fourth-quarter loss compares with a net profit of 20m euros a year earlier , and was worse than forecasts .
sales for the period were up 27.2 % to 1.52bn euros , boosted by strong demand for football products ahead of the world cup .
adidas bought reebok for $ 3.8bn in a bid to take on market leader nike .
however , a third-quarter sales slump for reebok has sparked fears of a costly revamp at the us firm .
" many of our current efforts will now focus on turning around the reebok brand , " said chief executive herbert hainer .
despite the problems at reebok , net profits for the full year were up 21.8 % to 383m euros , with sales up 13.2 % .
adidas is currently in the middle of a spat with nike , which filed a patent infringement suit against the company last month claiming that a number of its rival 's trainers copied its technology .
us giant nike said the adidas shoes in question infringed its " shox cushioning " patents and demanded damages from its german competitor .
adidas shares were down 3.2 % at 159.65 on thursday .

alongside the two revamped vehicles , showgoers will also get a glimpse of the urban cruiser concept car , a crossover that is slightly smaller than the rav4 and that combines suv features with car-like handling .
the new-look models are sparking expectations that the japanese car maker 's sales in europe will top a million this year .
last year , the automotive group sold 964,000 toyota and lexus in europe , says thierry dombreval , chief operating officer of toyota motor marketing europe , " and we built the vast majority of those cars here " .
analysts believe local production helps boost the car maker 's profits .
" toyota 's expansion of its global production network in europe , north america , asia and elsewhere is beginning to produce results , and we anticipate considerable earnings contributions in the coming years , " says nikko citigroup analyst noriyuki matsushima .
toyota sales in europe have already risen nine years in a row , points out mr dombreval , taking its market share to 5.1 % of the european market .
" fundamentally , there 's nothing negative you can point to with toyota , " observes koichi ogawa , chief portfolio manager at daiwa sb investments .
european appeal however , it has not all been plain sailing .
in january , when toyota was named " america 's best-selling brand " , its european performance was left wanting .
toyota brand sales fell more than 10 % in europe that month , according to brussels-based industry watchers acea .
similarly , toyota 's luxury subsidiary lexus remains unpopular in europe , despite its pole position in the luxury segment in the us .
but a pair of lexus models on display in geneva could go a long way to correct that .
the lexus gs450h is the first luxury saloon equipped with a hybrid petrol-electric engine to hit the market , an example of toyota 's technological hegemony in this area .
" not only do we consider toyota highly cost-competitive in established areas , we believe it has also a strong lead over competitors in commercialising new technologies , " says mr matsushima .
lexus also made a splash with the ls460 luxury saloon , which should pose a more serious threat to top models from german car makers bmw , mercedes and audi than any other lexus before it .
anticipated returns investors too have high hopes for the future .
in north america in particular , toyota motor made a splash last month when its market value reached fresh records , crashing through the psychologically-crucial $ 200bn ceiling for the first time .
not only did this make toyota the world 's tenth most valuable company ; it also meant the japanese giant was worth more than twice as much as general motors , ford motor and daimlerchrysler combined .
" interest in toyota is high , and we think there 's plenty of upside for the shares , " says deutsche securities analyst tsuyoshi mochimaru .

inspector general bakri omar told district police chiefs they should quit if they could not grasp the concept .
" we do n't want stupid officers , " bakri omar said .
the force has faced a barrage of public criticism in recent months following several high profile incidents in which detainees have been abused .
mr bakri was speaking to a human rights seminar attended by 145 district commanders , who listened in stunned silence as he singled out the head of one particular station for a telling off .
officers based at kajang , near kuala lumpur , had prompted public outrage after they arrested and shaved the heads of 11 elderly malaysian chinese men for gambling at mah-jong during chinese new year .
tough line the police chief said he had been forced to apologise on their behalf , and that it was not an isolated incident .
late last year , a video showing a naked woman being humiliated at a different police station provoked a fierce debate in malaysia .
mr bakri 's tough line , stressing good management and human rights , will serve to reinforce the government 's message that it is serious about reforming the police .
however , doubts have been expressed whether mr bakri 's likely successors share his enthusiasm for change .
his deputy recently said that most of the recommendations made last year by a government commission on police reform had been implemented ahead of schedule .
that suggestion has been greeted with considerable scepticism by civil liberties groups .

inspector general bakri omar told district police chiefs they should quit if they could not grasp the concept .
" we do n't want stupid officers , " bakri omar said .
the force has faced a barrage of public criticism in recent months following several high profile incidents in which detainees have been abused .
mr bakri was speaking to a human rights seminar attended by 145 district commanders , who listened in stunned silence as he singled out the head of one particular station for a telling off .
officers based at kajang , near kuala lumpur , had prompted public outrage after they arrested and shaved the heads of 11 elderly malaysian chinese men for gambling at mah-jong during chinese new year .
tough line the police chief said he had been forced to apologise on their behalf , and that it was not an isolated incident .
late last year , a video showing a naked woman being humiliated at a different police station provoked a fierce debate in malaysia .
mr bakri 's tough line , stressing good management and human rights , will serve to reinforce the government 's message that it is serious about reforming the police .
however , doubts have been expressed whether mr bakri 's likely successors share his enthusiasm for change .
his deputy recently said that most of the recommendations made last year by a government commission on police reform had been implemented ahead of schedule .
that suggestion has been greeted with considerable scepticism by civil liberties groups .

two delhi college students present contrasting views to the bbc news website on whether the american president is a welcome visitor .
mohammad junaid , jawaharlal nehru university i am protesting against george w bush 's visit to india because i think the united states is forcing us to give up our independent foreign policy .
we need to recognise that we have our own national interest which is not in conformity with us national interest .
look at china , which is often compared to us .
my message to bush is stop giving us this rhetoric about democracy .
stop killing people in the name of democracy china is not very proactive in the international stage but it is not toeing the line either .
it has an independent foreign policy and despite this gets more foreign investment from the us when compared to india .
we on the other hand always cow down to what the us says .
for instance , take iran with whom we have had pretty good relations for years .
recently , we have gone along with the united states and voted against iran at the iaea -lrb- international atomic energy agency -rrb- - a move that has jeopardised our plans to build a gas pipeline with iran .
it is not surprising to note that the pipeline is in our interest but not in the interest of the united states .
india as a responsible , growing power should recognise that such u-turns in foreign policy send a wrong signal to the world .
we should be consistent in our foreign policy .
a pipeline from iran through pakistan can also help our relationship with pakistan , and we should have stuck to that .
in the long term , what are we going to get with the nuclear cooperation deal -lsb- that india and the us has signed -rsb- .
the entire scientific community is against it .
by allowing international inspection of our nuclear facilities , we are hampering our independent research .
iran is one of the largest producers of oil and gas in the world and could help solve india 's energy crisis in the future .
my message to bush is stop giving us this rhetoric about democracy .
stop killing people in the name of democracy .
we know from american history how many democracies you have throttled and how many dissidents you have muzzled .
in your own country , what are you doing to your people - to the african-americans , the hispanics ?
what are you doing to other communities around the world in the name of democracy ?
it is not democracy .
aditya mahajan , st stephen 's college i certainly believe india should welcome george w bush .
let 's not forget when our prime minister , manmohan singh , went to the united states last year , he got a very warm welcome , a standing ovation .
so we should not overlook that or rally against this visit .
we have a lot in common with the united states .
we are both thriving democracies , we have similar values i believe it 's a big asset to be a partner of the strongest democracy in the world , one of the most powerful countries in the world .
it 's a very positive move by our government .
in the 1970s , our nuclear status was bitterly opposed by the united states .
now the us recognises our status and we are about to sign a landmark deal .
it is clear they need us .
it shows how strong india has become today .
it takes a democracy to recognise a democracy .
dictatorships , on the other hand , fall in line , like pakistan has .
i certainly believe that if we can open our economy to the chinese companies , to the british companies , then american companies deserve a place in our economy .
during the last us elections , there was a lot of rhetoric about the indian call centres , business processing centres and how they were taking jobs away from americans .
but president bush has supported our economic development .
america has realised the potential of india .
it has seen that we are a big market .
the amount of investment we get from the united states is far greater than what we get from elsewhere .
that is one reason we have a thriving economy today .
it is benefiting us in a big way .
i do not agree with those who say we are becoming too american , that we are losing our values .
indian values are now recognised and cherished in the west .
spiritual leaders like sri sri ravi shankar , yoga and vegetarianism are all gaining in popularity in the united states .
this is our contribution to them .
any democracy which needs to thrive needs to thrive on strong social structures .
and both india and the united states have that .
earlier indians used to go to america for better opportunities .
now the same people are coming back here for greater opportunities .
seventy percent of my family lives in california .
indian americans have succeeded greatly in that country , particularly in silicon valley .
they have contributed towards changing the perception of india among americans .
we have a lot in common with the united states .
we are both thriving democracies , we have similar values .
this is why president bush is coming here and why i think we should extend him a very warm welcome .

in the 1970s , our nuclear status was bitterly opposed by the united states .
now the us recognises our status and we are about to sign a landmark deal .
it is clear they need us .
it shows how strong india has become today .
it takes a democracy to recognise a democracy .
dictatorships , on the other hand , fall in line , like pakistan has .
i certainly believe that if we can open our economy to the chinese companies , to the british companies , then american companies deserve a place in our economy .
during the last us elections , there was a lot of rhetoric about the indian call centres , business processing centres and how they were taking jobs away from americans .
but president bush has supported our economic development .
america has realised the potential of india .
it has seen that we are a big market .
the amount of investment we get from the united states is far greater than what we get from elsewhere .
that is one reason we have a thriving economy today .
it is benefiting us in a big way .
i do not agree with those who say we are becoming too american , that we are losing our values .
indian values are now recognised and cherished in the west .
spiritual leaders like sri sri ravi shankar , yoga and vegetarianism are all gaining in popularity in the united states .
this is our contribution to them .
any democracy which needs to thrive needs to thrive on strong social structures .
and both india and the united states have that .
earlier indians used to go to america for better opportunities .
now the same people are coming back here for greater opportunities .
seventy percent of my family lives in california .
indian americans have succeeded greatly in that country , particularly in silicon valley .
they have contributed towards changing the perception of india among americans .
we have a lot in common with the united states .
we are both thriving democracies , we have similar values .
this is why president bush is coming here and why i think we should extend him a very warm welcome .

two delhi college students present contrasting views to the bbc news website on whether the american president is a welcome visitor .
mohammad junaid , jawaharlal nehru university i am protesting against george w bush 's visit to india because i think the united states is forcing us to give up our independent foreign policy .
we need to recognise that we have our own national interest which is not in conformity with us national interest .
look at china , which is often compared to us .
my message to bush is stop giving us this rhetoric about democracy .
stop killing people in the name of democracy china is not very proactive in the international stage but it is not toeing the line either .
it has an independent foreign policy and despite this gets more foreign investment from the us when compared to india .
we on the other hand always cow down to what the us says .
for instance , take iran with whom we have had pretty good relations for years .
recently , we have gone along with the united states and voted against iran at the iaea -lrb- international atomic energy agency -rrb- - a move that has jeopardised our plans to build a gas pipeline with iran .
it is not surprising to note that the pipeline is in our interest but not in the interest of the united states .
india as a responsible , growing power should recognise that such u-turns in foreign policy send a wrong signal to the world .
we should be consistent in our foreign policy .
a pipeline from iran through pakistan can also help our relationship with pakistan , and we should have stuck to that .
in the long term , what are we going to get with the nuclear cooperation deal -lsb- that india and the us has signed -rsb- .
the entire scientific community is against it .
by allowing international inspection of our nuclear facilities , we are hampering our independent research .
iran is one of the largest producers of oil and gas in the world and could help solve india 's energy crisis in the future .
my message to bush is stop giving us this rhetoric about democracy .
stop killing people in the name of democracy .
we know from american history how many democracies you have throttled and how many dissidents you have muzzled .
in your own country , what are you doing to your people - to the african-americans , the hispanics ?
what are you doing to other communities around the world in the name of democracy ?
it is not democracy .
aditya mahajan , st stephen 's college i certainly believe india should welcome george w bush .
let 's not forget when our prime minister , manmohan singh , went to the united states last year , he got a very warm welcome , a standing ovation .
so we should not overlook that or rally against this visit .
we have a lot in common with the united states .
we are both thriving democracies , we have similar values i believe it 's a big asset to be a partner of the strongest democracy in the world , one of the most powerful countries in the world .

while the ambitious former journalist has had difficulty shaking off the " johnny-come-lately " tag , he is certainly no political novice .
chris huhne age : 51 job : economics spokesman educated : westminster school , the sorbonne and magdalen college , oxford family : married , five children before politics : city economist and journalist key quote : " it is a time for new ideas and new horizons " what the papers say : " he has built up a strong reputation among the party 's up-and-coming ' modernisers ' , " london 's evening standard " .

the couple have three children together , plus two from ms pryce 's previous marriage .
mr huhne won his parliamentary spurs in brussels and strasbourg as an mep from 1999 to 2005 .
and he has argued throughout his campaign that his years in newspapers , business and the european parliament make him more suitable for the leadership than either of his rivals , despite their many years of experience in westminster .
mr huhne , 51 , became mp for eastleigh in may , 2005 , with a majority of 568 - by far the smallest of the three contenders .
within months he was appointed as the lib dems ' treasury spokesman , dealing with tax and public spending .
he was educated at westminster school , the sorbonne and magdalen college , oxford .
he worked as a city economist and as an economic journalist on the guardian , the independent and the economist .

the plans included replacing council tax with a local income tax - a flagship lib dem policy at the last election - and earmarking national insurance money as a ring-fenced tax to fund the nhs .
other plans to decentralise control of healthcare and education , and to continue allow private firms to do some nhs work , came under attack from some lib dems but were approved by the party 's conference .
during the leadership contest , mr huhne has called for higher environmental taxes to combat global warming and pollution , combined with lower taxes for the least well-off .
he has also argued for a " radical decentralisation " of the state and against identity cards .

while the ambitious former journalist has had difficulty shaking off the " johnny-come-lately " tag , he is certainly no political novice .
chris huhne age : 51 job : economics spokesman educated : westminster school , the sorbonne and magdalen college , oxford family : married , five children before politics : city economist and journalist key quote : " it is a time for new ideas and new horizons " what the papers say : " he has built up a strong reputation among the party 's up-and-coming ' modernisers ' , " london 's evening standard " .

the couple have three children together , plus two from ms pryce 's previous marriage .
mr huhne won his parliamentary spurs in brussels and strasbourg as an mep from 1999 to 2005 .
and he has argued throughout his campaign that his years in newspapers , business and the european parliament make him more suitable for the leadership than either of his rivals , despite their many years of experience in westminster .
mr huhne , 51 , became mp for eastleigh in may , 2005 , with a majority of 568 - by far the smallest of the three contenders .
within months he was appointed as the lib dems ' treasury spokesman , dealing with tax and public spending .
he was educated at westminster school , the sorbonne and magdalen college , oxford .
he worked as a city economist and as an economic journalist on the guardian , the independent and the economist .

he stood as a candidate for the sdp-liberal alliance in reading east -lrb- 1983 -rrb- and oxford west and abingdon -lrb- 1987 -rrb- general elections , but it was as mep for south east england that he first entered parliament in 1999 , albeit the european one .
he acted as deputy leader of the lib dem group there and served on the economic and monetary affairs committee , focusing on economic and financial policy , including regulation of the financial sector .
taxation mr huhne has long been one of the party 's key thinkers and in 2002 he took charge of revamping lib dem policies on public services .
the plans included replacing council tax with a local income tax - a flagship lib dem policy at the last election - and earmarking national insurance money as a ring-fenced tax to fund the nhs .
other plans to decentralise control of healthcare and education , and to continue allow private firms to do some nhs work , came under attack from some lib dems but were approved by the party 's conference .
during the leadership contest , mr huhne has called for higher environmental taxes to combat global warming and pollution , combined with lower taxes for the least well-off .
he has also argued for a " radical decentralisation " of the state and against identity cards .

the plans included replacing council tax with a local income tax - a flagship lib dem policy at the last election - and earmarking national insurance money as a ring-fenced tax to fund the nhs .
other plans to decentralise control of healthcare and education , and to continue allow private firms to do some nhs work , came under attack from some lib dems but were approved by the party 's conference .
during the leadership contest , mr huhne has called for higher environmental taxes to combat global warming and pollution , combined with lower taxes for the least well-off .
he has also argued for a " radical decentralisation " of the state and against identity cards .

local news agencies said onlookers shouted anti-american and anti-israeli slogans as the two men were executed .
six people were killed and many more injured in the bombings , which some iranian officials have blamed on uk forces stationed in southern iraq .
britain has strongly denied any involvement in the bombings .
the new-york-based group human rights watch said earlier this week that the number of executions being carried out in iran has risen dramatically since the election of president mahmoud ahmadinejad last year .
confessions on the eve of their execution , the bombers were shown confessing on provincial television , the bbc 's frances harrison reports from tehran .
one of those now executed , ali afravi , said he had contacted arab separatist groups based in canada and britain after reading their websites .
he said these groups asked him to create insecurity inside iran .
in total , nine men were shown on tv making confessions that were heavily edited .
it is not clear what will happen to the rest who were tried and convicted behind closed doors .
the attacks were part of a series of bombings in the city of ahwaz , in khuzestan province , following unrest a year ago in which ethnic arabs protested against alleged discrimination by the persian majority .
khuzestan television showed footage of the bombings that indicated the damage was far more extensive than reported at the time .
although several iranian officials have blamed the bombings on british forces stationed just across the iran-iraq border , the televised confessions made no reference to such allegations .

glitter , real name paul gadd , faces up to seven years in jail if found guilty but told reporters as he arrived at court that he was innocent .
prosecutors say the 61-year-old molested two girls , aged 11 and 12 , at his vietnam home .
the trial is initially behind closed doors as it involves minors .
he is alleged to have fondled and kissed the girls as well as engaged in other physical acts at a beach house in the resort town of vung tau , southern vietnam .
i 'm afraid there will be other cases like this one nguyen thi bich lien cd shop owner , vung tau resort town reacts profile : gary glitter a verdict is expected to be given on friday .
glitter shot to stardom in the 1970s with hits such as rock and roll -lrb- part 2 -rrb- and leader of the gang - a no 1 from 1973 .
with his flamboyant stage persona and over-the-top costumes , glitter continued touring for most of the 1980s and 1990s .
denials the former star has repeatedly professed his innocence , claiming he was teaching the girls english .
his lawyer , le thanh kinh , said glitter and the two alleged victims had been questioned in court .
" he denies all charges , " the lawyer said as he walked out of the courthouse during a break .
as glitter was escorted out of the court for a lunch break , reporters asked him if the girls were lying and whether he had pleaded innocent .
he nodded in response to both questions .
earlier , the former glam rocker , looking gaunt and wearing a black t-shirt and black cap , was met by a crowd of photographers and reporters as he arrived at the ba ria vung tau courthouse .
he has been in police custody at a jail near vung tau since 19 november when he was arrested in ho chi minh city about to board a flight out of the country .
compensation during the criminal investigation , police had considered whether to charge him with child rape , which carries a maximum penalty of death , but said prosecutors did not find sufficient evidence .
in december , glitter 's lawyer made compensatory payments to the families of the girls , who have appealed to the courts for clemency for glitter .
glitter was convicted of possessing child pornography in britain in 1999 and served half of a four-month jail sentence .
he later went to cambodia , which permanently expelled him in 2002 .

glitter , real name paul gadd , faces up to seven years in jail if found guilty but told reporters as he arrived at court that he was innocent .
prosecutors say the 61-year-old molested two girls , aged 11 and 12 , at his vietnam home .

he is alleged to have fondled and kissed the girls as well as engaged in other physical acts at a beach house in the resort town of vung tau , southern vietnam .

denials the former star has repeatedly professed his innocence , claiming he was teaching the girls english .
his lawyer , le thanh kinh , said glitter and the two alleged victims had been questioned in court .
" he denies all charges , " the lawyer said as he walked out of the courthouse during a break .
as glitter was escorted out of the court for a lunch break , reporters asked him if the girls were lying and whether he had pleaded innocent .
he nodded in response to both questions .

he has been in police custody at a jail near vung tau since 19 november when he was arrested in ho chi minh city about to board a flight out of the country .
compensation during the criminal investigation , police had considered whether to charge him with child rape , which carries a maximum penalty of death , but said prosecutors did not find sufficient evidence .
in december , glitter 's lawyer made compensatory payments to the families of the girls , who have appealed to the courts for clemency for glitter .

the proposal is contained in the legal profession and legal aid -lrb- scotland -rrb- bill , which was published on thursday .
the bill would also widen the range of legal representations and create an independent body to investigate complaints against lawyers .

deputy justice minister hugh henry said : " for many years the legal system has worked hard to deliver excellent , professional services .
" however , consumers now look for more from the services they use .
" they want and deserve more choice , tailored services , transparency and confidence that when things go wrong - their complaints will be handled fairly and efficiently . "
the scottish legal complaints commission would take over the role of the scottish legal services ombudsman in overseeing the way professional bodies handle conduct complaints and would have the power to enforce its recommendations .

legal services bill wider range of legal service suppliers able to apply to provide representation in court creation of a scottish legal complaints commission , independent of the legal profession transferring the power to grant legal aid in solemn cases from the courts to the scottish legal aid board improved access to advisors with appropriate skills and expertise under the new system , complainers would take their grievance to an independent commission , where non-lawyers would form the majority .
the commission could cut legal bills and order compensation if the complaint was upheld .
serious misconduct claims , such as alleged fraud , would still go to the scottish solicitors disciplinary tribunal .
the society backed the creation of an independent body to investigate complaints following a consultation last year .
deputy justice minister hugh henry said : " for many years the legal system has worked hard to deliver excellent , professional services .
" however , consumers now look for more from the services they use .
" they want and deserve more choice , tailored services , transparency and confidence that when things go wrong - their complaints will be handled fairly and efficiently . "
the scottish legal complaints commission would take over the role of the scottish legal services ombudsman in overseeing the way professional bodies handle conduct complaints and would have the power to enforce its recommendations .
graeme millar , chairman of the scottish consumer council , said : " we very much welcome this bill , which will increase not only consumer choice , but also public confidence in the justice system . "

it believes thousands of people who are sick or have disabilities are being wrongly denied benefit each year .
in recent years , more than 60 % of appeals against incapacity benefit refusal have been successful .
but the department of work and pensions has said its own findings show that the number of those dissatisfied was small .
the citizens advice report was based on hundreds of complaints to the charity .
some claimants complained doctors that assessed them were insensitive or rude .
mental health people with mental health problems are particularly likely to be wrongly assessed , according to the report 's authors .
in one case a woman with severe mental health problems lost her benefit after an examining doctor said she " did n't look mental " , the report said .
she had to live on £ 39 a week for six months while awaiting an appeal .
the report called for the " deeply flawed " decision-making process to be improved .
it said more than 60 % of decisions were overturned on appeal because there were " so many wrong decisions to refuse or withdraw benefit " .
the report largely blamed the way medical assessments were carried out and the weight they were given .
it criticised the department for relying too heavily on the assessment results , rather than evidence from claimants ' own gps or other practitioners .
' context needed ' the department said " unhappy " clients tended to ask the citizen advice bureau for help , whereas those that were satisfied with the handling of their claim did not comment .
" put into context of nearly one million medical examinations a year , customer satisfaction surveys show the proportion of clients who are dissatisfied is small compared to those who feel they have received a satisfactory service , " the department said .
it said it was " continually improving its standards of decision making and customer service to benefit claimants " .
a spokeswoman emphasised that the department expected to address problems with assessments .
this was to ensure people were " not left to a lifetime of benefit , but are given the help and support they need to enable them to return to work . "

it believes thousands of people who are sick or have disabilities are being wrongly denied benefit each year .
in recent years , more than 60 % of appeals against incapacity benefit refusal have been successful .
but the department of work and pensions has said its own findings show that the number of those dissatisfied was small .
the citizens advice report was based on hundreds of complaints to the charity .
some claimants complained doctors that assessed them were insensitive or rude .
mental health people with mental health problems are particularly likely to be wrongly assessed , according to the report 's authors .
in one case a woman with severe mental health problems lost her benefit after an examining doctor said she " did n't look mental " , the report said .
she had to live on £ 39 a week for six months while awaiting an appeal .
the report called for the " deeply flawed " decision-making process to be improved .
it said more than 60 % of decisions were overturned on appeal because there were " so many wrong decisions to refuse or withdraw benefit " .
the report largely blamed the way medical assessments were carried out and the weight they were given .
it criticised the department for relying too heavily on the assessment results , rather than evidence from claimants ' own gps or other practitioners .
' context needed ' the department said " unhappy " clients tended to ask the citizen advice bureau for help , whereas those that were satisfied with the handling of their claim did not comment .
" put into context of nearly one million medical examinations a year , customer satisfaction surveys show the proportion of clients who are dissatisfied is small compared to those who feel they have received a satisfactory service , " the department said .
it said it was " continually improving its standards of decision making and customer service to benefit claimants " .

both king kong and revenge of the sith are up against serenity , the chronicles of narnia : the lion , the witch and the wardrobe and harry potter and the goblet of fire for the newly introduced best sci-fi / fantasy award .
jackson is joined in the best director category by steven spielberg -lrb- war of the worlds -rrb- , christopher nolan -lrb- batman begins -rrb- , joe wright -lrb- pride & prejudice -rrb- , ron howard -lrb- cinderella man -rrb- and nick park and steve box -lrb- the curse of the were-rabbit -rrb- .

" in fact , this outstanding and diverse line-up is the only shortlist to celebrate the best movies of 2005 , films that were not only widely seen by the ordinary public but cherished and remembered some months later .
" while the oscars and the baftas rightfully celebrate the narrow set of prestige movies released during ' awards season ' , our show is designed to recognise movies of all genres , echoing the way ordinary filmgoers talk about movies . "

the trade magazine said the film has taken more than rmb100m -lrb- £ 7.1m -rrb- at mainland cinemas .

microsoft researchers are working on a way to let people use their feet to perform many routine computer tasks .
by tapping buttons on a pad on the floor users can scroll through their inbox and open , close and delete messages .
the researchers said they developed the foot interface to make interacting with computers more energetic .
spam stomping " many information workers spend a majority of their time trapped at their desk dealing with e-mail , " said brian meyers , from the step user interface project group who helped develop the prototype .
" we wanted to provide them with an alternative , " he said .
the group has adapted the mat that game firm konami developed for its hugely popular dance dance revolution game .
playing ddr involves copying the moves shown on screen by stepping on one of six sensors on the mat .
microsoft 's adaptation means that stepping on the six sensors carries out well-known tasks when going through an e-mail inbox .
one of the most popular manoeuvres is the double-foot stamp used to delete junk mail .
mr meyers said getting users standing up and using the mat interface gives people a break from mouse and keyboard and could help limit the spread of repetitive strain injuries .
it could also help those with limited hand movements interact with their computers .
findings from a study of how the step interface changes the way that pc owners use their computer will be presented in april at the acm computer human interaction conference in montreal .
an early look at the technology was given at microsoft 's techfest meeting this week .
open only to a select list of invitees and microsoft employees the techfest shows off the work of more than 400 researchers from the software giant 's five development labs .

microsoft researchers are working on a way to let people use their feet to perform many routine computer tasks .

the researchers said they developed the foot interface to make interacting with computers more energetic .
spam stomping " many information workers spend a majority of their time trapped at their desk dealing with e-mail , " said brian meyers , from the step user interface project group who helped develop the prototype .

the group has adapted the mat that game firm konami developed for its hugely popular dance dance revolution game .

microsoft 's adaptation means that stepping on the six sensors carries out well-known tasks when going through an e-mail inbox .
one of the most popular manoeuvres is the double-foot stamp used to delete junk mail .
mr meyers said getting users standing up and using the mat interface gives people a break from mouse and keyboard and could help limit the spread of repetitive strain injuries .
it could also help those with limited hand movements interact with their computers .
findings from a study of how the step interface changes the way that pc owners use their computer will be presented in april at the acm computer human interaction conference in montreal .

the school food trust was established by ministers who said they wanted to see a junk food ban in english schools .
trust chair dame suzi leather said child obesity must be tackled urgently , and schools must make it easy for children to eat healthily .
there will now be a period of consultation on the plans . "
the evidence is clear - children are eating too many foods with too much sugar , fat and salt " dame suzi leather ms leather said many children were eating themselves into an early grave , she added , pointing out that obesity could shorten one 's life by nine years .
" it 's terribly important that we understand the magnitude of the public health risk , " dame suzi told the bbc .
obesity currently costs the nhs up to a £ 1bn a year , and one in eight children is obese .
it is estimated that of the generation now entering school , a quarter could be obese by 2020 unless urgent preventative steps are taken .
the trust 's advice follows recommendations from the school meals review panel that new food-based standards should be introduced to improve school meal quality .
' healthy choice ' dame suzi said the new rules " can not succeed if pupils are surrounded with chocolate , crisps and drinks that fill them up with sugar and fat during the school day " .
" it 's not in children 's best interests to have unlimited access to these products , and they replace the consumption of more nourishing foods .
" the evidence is clear - children are eating too many foods with too much sugar , fat and salt and little or no nutritional value .
" by managing choice we can increase the variety of foods our children eat and make the healthy choice the easy choice . "
seeds and nuts she also said that evidence suggested behaviour and learning improved when junk food is removed from schools .
additionally schools should replace these products with health products such as seeds and nuts .
schools minister jacqui smith said the government would now hear wider views on the plans .
" the independent school food trust has proposed a robust set of standards for food which can be sold in schools through vending machines , in tuck shops and at break times , " she said .
head teacher and school workforce associations , dieticians , health charities , and food and drink organisations will be invited to submit responses to the trust 's proposals .
the government will publish the final version of the non-lunch food standards alongside the agreed standards for school lunches in may .
trust proposals include : schools should stop selling confectionery and " bagged savoury snacks " other than nuts and seeds with no added salt or sugar .
schools should offer a variety of fruit and vegetables in all food outlets and easy access to free , chilled drinking water .
the only other drinks available should be bottled water , skimmed or semi-skimmed milk , pure fruit juices , yoghurt and milk drinks with less than 5 % added sugar .
drinks made from a combination of these such as smoothies , tea or coffee would also be allowed .
chief executive of the royal society of health professor richard parish backed the new recommendations saying it was " about time that government , schools and the wider community put public health priorities first . "

deputy director general of the food and drink federation martin paterson said it welcomed better school meal provision , but that banning foods was neither an effective nor a practical solution .
" we recognise that tuck shops and vending should not compete with school meals - although they can play a part .
" balance is the key and bans will not help teach children how to build a balanced diet . "
obesity charity weight concern said children were not equipped to make healthy food decisions when high fat , high sugar options were available .

the oecd said that although ireland had produced " exemplary " results it needed to boost competition , improve education and encourage enterprise .
it also called on the country to improve its infrastructure .
however , if growth slows down the economy is likely to experience a soft landing , the oecd added .
" growth remains strong , foreign investment is still coming in , industry has shrugged off global shocks and house prices keep on climbing , " it said in an economic survey of the country .
the economy doubled in size in the 1990s , achieving the fastest growth in the oecd over that period .
bottlenecks however , ireland 's infrastructure has come under severe pressure due to the " extraordinary " growth in population and economic activity . "
ireland has continued its exemplary economic performance , attaining some of the highest growth rates in the oecd " oecd bottlenecks have emerged that may put a brake on growth , the oecd is warning , while lack of competition in the retail sector is pushing up consumer prices .
pressure is evident especially in the areas of transport , electricity transmission , landfill , waste water treatment and broadband internet .
insufficient investment in environmental infrastructure has led to pollution and soaring prices for some services such as landfill which the government is hoping to tackle .
property pressures the key domestic risk is the housing market , the oecd warned .
in the past decade , house prices have risen faster than in any other oecd country , with average prices having tripled in real terms .
although prices may have overshot to some extent , prices are expected to level out or fall only slightly rather than crash .
ireland 's tax system is much more supportive to housing than in most other oecd countries , the report said , which could further underpin the property market .
the oecd advised the government to avoid any tax changes that make housing more attractive .
if prices are too high , it could deter foreign investors from settling in the country .
" ireland has continued its exemplary economic performance , attaining some of the highest growth rates in the oecd , " the report concluded .
