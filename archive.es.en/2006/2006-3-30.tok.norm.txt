and business leaders , security experts and law enforcement gathering thursday and friday in london aim to change that . it has been quite a year for e-crime , say experts .
trojan horses have constantly bombarded banks and others in the financial sector .
phishing and identity theft attempts have risen to number about 8 million per day , according to security officials .
e-scams are costing businesses billions and that does n't include increasing funds - about 20 to 50 percent of total expenditures in the us and uk - to beef up security .
and it is only getting worse .
as a result , law enforcement , business and computer specialists have come together for the annual e-crime congress in london thursday and friday to find new methods to fight such cyber predators .
an illustrious group because it is such a growing problem internationally , the conference is attracting bigger names and from further afield , too .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : microsoft 's brad smith offered a reward of $ 5 million to those who help catch cyber criminals attendees include about 500 officials from governments , companies as amazon , ebay , skype and yahoo , bankers from scandinavia , the uk and the middle east and law enforcement such as the fbi , scotland yard and those from the china .
" the 2005 e-crime congress provided an excellent forum for us to interact with law enforcement agencies , security product vendors and others in the financial services industry to discuss the wider issues that affect us , " one british bank security official as quoted on the congress ' website .
e-crime remains a low priority e-crime , like white-collar crime , is low on the list of law enforcement priorities , experts say .
instead , police and intelligence agencies worldwide are busy grappling with violent crimes and terrorism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internet cafes in countries with few cyber or extradition laws are often used by cyber gangs in most countries , police officials are overworked and lack manpower and often expertise to investigate e-crime .
few prosecutors take on such cases and laws often lack teeth , experts say .
that lessens the already low deterrant power of law enforcement against cyber criminals , who already have very low odds of getting caught , especially if they are outside the us or europe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : soccer as a business world cup scores goal for german economy world cup commercialization slurs put fifa on defensive revenues rise for retailers and breweries during world cup adidas cashes in on the world cup world cup 2006 -pipe- 30.03.2006 businesses and events at mercy of fifa 's trademark control großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all legal and above board : these models wo n't have to strip off their official merchandise pop quiz : what is the name of the global soccer tournament taking place in germany this summer ?
answer : the fifa world cup .
you can say it ... but you ca n't wear it .
not without a license anyway . nearly every company in germany wants to make money on the upcoming world cup in june .
but not everyone is allowed to advertise with the logo .
fifa , world soccer 's governing body , has laid down strict criteria for world cup 2006 slogans and advertising . while soccer fans are gearing up for the world cup , the biggest event the sport has to offer , others are dreaming about how to make big bucks from it . but far from being a free-for-all cash cow which benefits everyone , the soccer powers-that-be have stipulated that only official fifa sponsors are allowed to sell their goods using the world cup 2006 tag which puts some traders on the wrong side of the tournament organizers and potentially on the wrong side of the law . the official sponsors , companies like automaker hyundai and sports equipment giant adidas amongst others , are the only ones allowed to use certain trademarks copyrighted by fifa .
and they have certainly paid for the privilege . these " official " companies have paid around 45 million euros each for exclusive permission to use the world cup for advertising purposes .
in addition , there are the national sponsors like german railways , postbank and others who have each paid 13 million euros for the rights , but may only use the world cup logo for their advertising within germany . fifa believes that the high price for getting on the exclusive list is worth it and that those who intend to use the trademarks without acquiring these rights should be punished .
fifa spokesman andreas herren says it is only what official sponsors would expect .
" companies who have acquired these rights of course deserve to be protected against this so-called ‘ ambush marketing ’ by free-riders . " those who unofficially use the world cup to make money face tough consequences .
during the 2002 world cup in japan / korea , for instance , fifa tracked down nearly 2,000 cases of fraud in 88 different countries .
over three million products were confiscated . official brand names a particularly prickly subject bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : official fifa products carry licensed logos and authenticity tags fifa gets particularly picky with the brand names " 2006 fifa world cup germany " and " world cup 2006 . "
those slogans enjoy special trademark protection .
those who abuse the trademark rights face punishment , says trademark lawyer martin chakraborty . " if someone uses the trademark illegally , say , to print it on t-shirts or baseballs caps to be sold outside the stadiums , then he will face a restraining order and could have to pay damages to fifa , " he says . visitors who buy and wear the unlicensed products could be forced by personnel to remove them at the stadiums .
however , not only would that mean potentially thousands of semi-naked fans teeming through the turnstiles ; it would also infringe on personal rights and freedom of action . spectators would have to stand up to the personnel and insist on their right to wear what they want which could lead to confrontation fifa and the german organizers are eager to avoid . high street traders unaware of potential fifa wrath while fifa expects businesses across germany to adhere to its strong-arm trademark policies , it seems that its message has not spread far enough to reach those who may be affected by it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knock-off merchandise can get traders into trouble in the cologne suburb of vingst , a number of traders were still blissfully unaware that selling unlicensed world cup products featuring seemingly innocuous slogans such as " world cup 2006 " could land them in hot water with the global soccer body . " i know these baseball caps are not licensed but i 'm not selling them as such , " said achim b. , the proprietor of a discount store selling a range of soccer related products .
" i 'm not trying to con anyone .
if they want to pay an extra 20 euros for the real thing , that ’ s up to them . " when informed that even the slogan " world cup 06 " could contravene fifa trademark rules , achim replied , " what else are we going to call it ?
soccer world championships 2006 ?
no one will know what that is ?
it 's the world cup .
anyway , i 'd never be able to fit that on a cap . " " crazy " fifa going too far , say shop owners " it 's just stupid , " said another trader who wished to remain anonymous .
" what will they do next ?
stop us from selling footballs because they have something to do with the world cup ?
we 'd have to call them ' balls to be kicked by the feet ' .
people would think i was crazy - just like fifa . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : champ 06 unofficial merchandise many companies have gotten around the strict trademark rules by marketing their products under world cup related headings without actually using the protected brand names .
however , the products lack a certain credibility without the world cup in the title and are perceived as cheap as a result . businesses are not alone in suffering under fifa 's control-freakery .
local authorities have also found that organizing small scale world cup related events under certain trademarked slogans could incur fifa 's wrath . katja hartmann , the events director with the phoenix sports club near ostheim , was forced to rename her world cup opening day festivities in line with fifa rules . local opening gala forced to change its name " we intended to hold our gala on june 9 under the title ' world cup festival 2006 ' but after applying for the necessary licenses we were advised by lawyers that the name could infringe on fifa trademarks .
unless we were willing to pay lots of money to use it , we had to change the name or go ahead and face the consequences . " " it was not such a big deal to change it but we felt pressured .
people should be allowed to celebrate the fact the world cup is in germany and call it just that .

answer : the fifa world cup .
you can say it ... but you ca n't wear it .
not without a license anyway . nearly every company in germany wants to make money on the upcoming world cup in june .
but not everyone is allowed to advertise with the logo .
fifa , world soccer 's governing body , has laid down strict criteria for world cup 2006 slogans and advertising . while soccer fans are gearing up for the world cup , the biggest event the sport has to offer , others are dreaming about how to make big bucks from it . but far from being a free-for-all cash cow which benefits everyone , the soccer powers-that-be have stipulated that only official fifa sponsors are allowed to sell their goods using the world cup 2006 tag which puts some traders on the wrong side of the tournament organizers and potentially on the wrong side of the law . the official sponsors , companies like automaker hyundai and sports equipment giant adidas amongst others , are the only ones allowed to use certain trademarks copyrighted by fifa .
and they have certainly paid for the privilege . these " official " companies have paid around 45 million euros each for exclusive permission to use the world cup for advertising purposes .
in addition , there are the national sponsors like german railways , postbank and others who have each paid 13 million euros for the rights , but may only use the world cup logo for their advertising within germany . fifa believes that the high price for getting on the exclusive list is worth it and that those who intend to use the trademarks without acquiring these rights should be punished .
fifa spokesman andreas herren says it is only what official sponsors would expect .
" companies who have acquired these rights of course deserve to be protected against this so-called ‘ ambush marketing ’ by free-riders . " those who unofficially use the world cup to make money face tough consequences .
during the 2002 world cup in japan / korea , for instance , fifa tracked down nearly 2,000 cases of fraud in 88 different countries .
over three million products were confiscated . official brand names a particularly prickly subject bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : official fifa products carry licensed logos and authenticity tags fifa gets particularly picky with the brand names " 2006 fifa world cup germany " and " world cup 2006 . "
those slogans enjoy special trademark protection .
those who abuse the trademark rights face punishment , says trademark lawyer martin chakraborty . " if someone uses the trademark illegally , say , to print it on t-shirts or baseballs caps to be sold outside the stadiums , then he will face a restraining order and could have to pay damages to fifa , " he says . visitors who buy and wear the unlicensed products could be forced by personnel to remove them at the stadiums .
however , not only would that mean potentially thousands of semi-naked fans teeming through the turnstiles ; it would also infringe on personal rights and freedom of action . spectators would have to stand up to the personnel and insist on their right to wear what they want which could lead to confrontation fifa and the german organizers are eager to avoid . high street traders unaware of potential fifa wrath while fifa expects businesses across germany to adhere to its strong-arm trademark policies , it seems that its message has not spread far enough to reach those who may be affected by it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knock-off merchandise can get traders into trouble in the cologne suburb of vingst , a number of traders were still blissfully unaware that selling unlicensed world cup products featuring seemingly innocuous slogans such as " world cup 2006 " could land them in hot water with the global soccer body . " i know these baseball caps are not licensed but i 'm not selling them as such , " said achim b. , the proprietor of a discount store selling a range of soccer related products .
" i 'm not trying to con anyone .
if they want to pay an extra 20 euros for the real thing , that ’ s up to them . " when informed that even the slogan " world cup 06 " could contravene fifa trademark rules , achim replied , " what else are we going to call it ?
soccer world championships 2006 ?
no one will know what that is ?
it 's the world cup .
anyway , i 'd never be able to fit that on a cap . " " crazy " fifa going too far , say shop owners " it 's just stupid , " said another trader who wished to remain anonymous .
" what will they do next ?
stop us from selling footballs because they have something to do with the world cup ?
we 'd have to call them ' balls to be kicked by the feet ' .
people would think i was crazy - just like fifa . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : champ 06 unofficial merchandise many companies have gotten around the strict trademark rules by marketing their products under world cup related headings without actually using the protected brand names .
however , the products lack a certain credibility without the world cup in the title and are perceived as cheap as a result . businesses are not alone in suffering under fifa 's control-freakery .
local authorities have also found that organizing small scale world cup related events under certain trademarked slogans could incur fifa 's wrath . katja hartmann , the events director with the phoenix sports club near ostheim , was forced to rename her world cup opening day festivities in line with fifa rules . local opening gala forced to change its name " we intended to hold our gala on june 9 under the title ' world cup festival 2006 ' but after applying for the necessary licenses we were advised by lawyers that the name could infringe on fifa trademarks .
unless we were willing to pay lots of money to use it , we had to change the name or go ahead and face the consequences . " " it was not such a big deal to change it but we felt pressured .
people should be allowed to celebrate the fact the world cup is in germany and call it just that .
the world cup is about the people but it seems that they are being pushed out of the picture in favor of money-making and marketing , " she added .

" this pipeline is not aimed against anyone but is aimed at ensuring the security of gas supplies to europe , " schröder said . " not only in germany but throughout western europe there is growing need for gas , while domestic production is falling , " he said .
" this project is in the interests of germany .
that is why it will be supported by every german government . " schröder added that he would be paid 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 300,000 -rrb- annually for holding the post . the 61-year old former chancellor is also an advisor to swiss media group ringier and international investment bank rothschild and has made lucrative public-speaking appearances . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life 's a gas : the old friends are reunited in business his acceptance of the job less than a month after he left the chancellor 's office last november prompted widespread criticism in germany .
he and russian president vladimir putin had worked closely on cementing german investment in the pipeline . earlier this month a lawyer acting for schröder said that he had won a temporary injunction against the leader of the liberal free democrats , guido westerwelle , preventing him from linking schröder 's post as chancellor to his involvement in the pipeline . appointment and pipeline project under fire the project has also prompted criticism from new eu members lithuania and poland , which complained that schröder had gone over their heads on a pipeline that is likely to pass through several baltic countries ' territorial waters . other members of the supervisory board include gazprom chief executive alexei miller as well as officials from germany 's e.on and basf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe hopes to keep the russian taps turned on gazprom has a 51.0 percent stake in the north european gas pipeline , while stakes of 24.5 percent are held by e.on and basf . matthias warnig , representative of dresdner bank in russia , was named as the pipeline 's managing director . miller on thursday appeared to give backing to the idea of possible involvement in the project by gaz de france .

a second pipeline is expected to double capacity to 55 billion cubic meters annually . the first part of the project will cost two to 2.5 billion euros and the total cost of the offshore section of the project will be over four billion euros , management has said . european union officials have sought to reassure new eu members worried that they could be left without supplies if russia no longer has to ship gas through their territory to western europe .

the american software giant has one last chance to convince eu regulators it is complying with a two-year old ruling .
failure means 2 million euros in daily fines . facing the threat of daily fines , microsoft tried to convince eu anti-trust regulators thursday that the us software giant is meeting their demands to comply with a landmark 2004 competition ruling . even before the start of a two-day closed-door hearing , microsoft came out fighting , saying that new fines would not resolve the long-standing competition row . " in our view , a fine is not the answer , " said microsoft 's top lawyer , brad smith , as he arrived for the hearing with the european commission . in response , commission spokesman for competition issues jonathan todd said that the commission had little choice but to brandish the threat of fines . " also from the commission 's perspective , fines are not the best way to resolve the conflict but two years after the decision , we have tried all other ways so that microsoft complies with the decision and it has still not done so , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new microsoft operating system vista may come under scrutiny also microsoft 's last chance the hearing is likely to be the microsoft 's last chance to prove it is complying with the european commission before regulators slap a daily fine of up to 2 million euros -lrb- $ 2.4 million -rrb- a day . smith , who is microsoft 's general counsel and is also third in command at the company , led a team of about 50 people including lawyers and computer scientists in its ranks . " we need clear guidance to find a solution , " he said .
" ultimately , the point i think we 'll underscore is this : we have complied and we 're willing to do more . " brussels growing impatient the commission is at pains to force microsoft to respect a march 2004 anti-trust ruling , in which the company was fined 497 million euros for abusing its dominant market position . microsoft was ordered to sell a version of its widely-used windows operating system unbundled from its media player software and to divulge information on its operating system needed by manufacturers of rival products . brussels has grown increasingly impatient for evidence that microsoft will comply and in december threatened to slap a fine , back-dated to december 15 , of up to 2 million euros a day on the company .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union commissioner for competition mario monti says microsoft is guilty of abusing its " near monopoly " but the company says that it has offered more than the commission has asked for by promising to reveal millions of lines of windows computer code for rivals to use to develop programs that work with it . however , an independent trustee advising the commission has deemed the offer to be " totally useless " . " it 's not necessary for microsoft to go beyond what we are asking for , " said todd .
" it would be quite sufficient for them to do what they are supposed to do in accordance with the decision of march 2004 . " he also said that although there were firms that found the offer to reveal computer code to be useful , " there are many companies that have told us that the information provided by microsoft is not suitable .

she said that reunited germany was now assuming greater responsibility in line with united nations and european union requirements . success on the international scene , however , was not the main topic of the parliamentary debate .
as widespread protests against pay cuts and layoffs continue throughout the country , merkel and her grand coalition government said they were stepping up efforts to find solutions to the pressing social and economic problems . labor reforms the latest unemployment figures for germany , which are published this thursday , are good news for the government : the number of jobless has dropped below the 5 million mark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frustrated by some of his coalition partners : labor minister franz müntefering merkel , however , appeared exasperated after a rift in the grand coalition over labor reforms .
social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- labor minister franz müntefering 's announced he was halting the labor reforms because some members of merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- were taking steps away from the coalition agreement and asking for reforms that would go beyond the agreed-upon measures such as allowing companies to fire workers during the two-year probationary period . " let 's first of all do what we resolved to do , " merkel said .
" we made an agreement on this . " merkel asked everybody to stick to the agreement and revisit the issue of germany 's job protection rules in two years .
but some members of her own party remained impatient . " the section on employment law in the coalition agreement does not go far enough , " said christian wulff , the conservative premier of lower saxony .
" it does not adequately reflect the real need for reform . " the trade unions , on the other hand , are stepping up pressure on spd - traditionally seen as a champion of workers ' rights . " the trade union 's goal is for dismissal protection not to deteriorate , but rather to be maintained , or even improved , " said michael sommer , head of the dgb trade union federation for german daily die welt .
" not everything that is in the coalition agreement must be implemented . " energy reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opposition is not her main problem : german chancellor angela merkel merkel announced that her grand coalition government would introduce a new long-term energy strategy in the second half of next year .
this moves comes as a response to the growing concern about germany 's reliance on russian natural gas and the rekindled debate about the country 's nuclear phase out program . " just because we have a difference of opinion on this one issue does n't mean we can afford to ignore the question of how our energy strategy out to 2020 should look , " merkel said in her speech before the bundestag . one of the most crucial pieces of legislation passed by outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens , in the eyes of many , was a planned phase-out of germany 's atomic energy plants by 2020 . the idea , largely pressed by the environmentally-friendly greens , was to focus on renewable energy and away from a crippling dependence on oil .
it also found support at a time when safety concerns over nuclear power reactors were highlighted with accidents like the one in chernobyl in 1986 .
the social democrats in the current grand coalition government made the nuclear phase-out an important part of the coalition agreement which was signed before the new government took office . german economics minister michael gloss , who raised quite a few eyebrows when he suggested in january that germany should reconsider prolonging the use of nuclear energy , toned down his views . " the nuclear exist is written into law and at the present time i do n't believe that the majority necessary to change this agreement exists in the german bundestag , " glos said in an interview for german daily handelsblatt . health reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : staying healthy has become more expensive in germany the german chancellor reassured parliamentarians that her coalition government would now start working seriously on an overdue reform of the statutory health system .
she said she was confident that the current clash of concepts could be overcome in a constructive manner . at present , merkel 's conservatives are backing a flat monthly premium paid regardless of income , while the social democrats favor a broadening of the funding base by bringing in currently exempt groups of the population and making them pay in line with their earnings . next year the public health care system will have a budget hole between 8 and 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.6 billion to $ 12 billion -rrb- .
germans , who have long enjoyed one of the most beneficial health care systems in europe , will have to steel themselves for difficult changes ahead .

he also demanded that the government should finally think hard about introducing a simpler tax system that citizens could relate to . " since you took office , you 've been telling us that this is the sort of tax policy you ca n't do in germany , " westerwelle said .
" you should finally defend your own ideas and convictions instead of pandering to the interests of your social democrat coalition partners . " the floor leader of the opposition left party , oskar lafontaine - himself a social democrat renegade - sharply criticized the government for what he described as grave budgetary neglect in the areas of education and research : " it 's outrageous that germany is among the poorest performers within oecd countries when it comes to investing in research and education , " lafontaine said .
" this is a situation that the new government seems unwilling to change .
but it has to be changed , if we 're serious about leading the country forward .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 30.03.2006 microsoft battles to avoid daily fines in eu standoff großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : microsoft concessions are unacceptable , eu officials say .
the american software giant has one last chance to convince eu regulators it is complying with a two-year old ruling .
failure means 2 million euros in daily fines . facing the threat of daily fines , microsoft tried to convince eu anti-trust regulators thursday that the us software giant is meeting their demands to comply with a landmark 2004 competition ruling . even before the start of a two-day closed-door hearing , microsoft came out fighting , saying that new fines would not resolve the long-standing competition row . " in our view , a fine is not the answer , " said microsoft 's top lawyer , brad smith , as he arrived for the hearing with the european commission . in response , commission spokesman for competition issues jonathan todd said that the commission had little choice but to brandish the threat of fines . " also from the commission 's perspective , fines are not the best way to resolve the conflict but two years after the decision , we have tried all other ways so that microsoft complies with the decision and it has still not done so , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new microsoft operating system vista may come under scrutiny also microsoft 's last chance the hearing is likely to be the microsoft 's last chance to prove it is complying with the european commission before regulators slap a daily fine of up to 2 million euros -lrb- $ 2.4 million -rrb- a day . smith , who is microsoft 's general counsel and is also third in command at the company , led a team of about 50 people including lawyers and computer scientists in its ranks . " we need clear guidance to find a solution , " he said .
" ultimately , the point i think we 'll underscore is this : we have complied and we 're willing to do more . " brussels growing impatient the commission is at pains to force microsoft to respect a march 2004 anti-trust ruling , in which the company was fined 497 million euros for abusing its dominant market position . microsoft was ordered to sell a version of its widely-used windows operating system unbundled from its media player software and to divulge information on its operating system needed by manufacturers of rival products . brussels has grown increasingly impatient for evidence that microsoft will comply and in december threatened to slap a fine , back-dated to december 15 , of up to 2 million euros a day on the company .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union commissioner for competition mario monti says microsoft is guilty of abusing its " near monopoly " but the company says that it has offered more than the commission has asked for by promising to reveal millions of lines of windows computer code for rivals to use to develop programs that work with it . however , an independent trustee advising the commission has deemed the offer to be " totally useless " . " it 's not necessary for microsoft to go beyond what we are asking for , " said todd .
" it would be quite sufficient for them to do what they are supposed to do in accordance with the decision of march 2004 . " he also said that although there were firms that found the offer to reveal computer code to be useful , " there are many companies that have told us that the information provided by microsoft is not suitable . " the european commission warned that it could open a new front in the standoff with microsoft if its new delay-plagued vista operating system did not respect anti-trust law . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de microsoft agrees to share source code in eu microsoft has said it will comply with the eu and license its source code - necessary for competitors to build compatible products .

this moves comes as a response to the growing concern about germany 's reliance on russian natural gas and the rekindled debate about the country 's nuclear phase out program . " just because we have a difference of opinion on this one issue does n't mean we can afford to ignore the question of how our energy strategy out to 2020 should look , " merkel said in her speech before the bundestag . one of the most crucial pieces of legislation passed by outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens , in the eyes of many , was a planned phase-out of germany 's atomic energy plants by 2020 . the idea , largely pressed by the environmentally-friendly greens , was to focus on renewable energy and away from a crippling dependence on oil .
it also found support at a time when safety concerns over nuclear power reactors were highlighted with accidents like the one in chernobyl in 1986 .
the social democrats in the current grand coalition government made the nuclear phase-out an important part of the coalition agreement which was signed before the new government took office . german economics minister michael gloss , who raised quite a few eyebrows when he suggested in january that germany should reconsider prolonging the use of nuclear energy , toned down his views . " the nuclear exist is written into law and at the present time i do n't believe that the majority necessary to change this agreement exists in the german bundestag , " glos said in an interview for german daily handelsblatt . health reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : staying healthy has become more expensive in germany the german chancellor reassured parliamentarians that her coalition government would now start working seriously on an overdue reform of the statutory health system .
she said she was confident that the current clash of concepts could be overcome in a constructive manner . at present , merkel 's conservatives are backing a flat monthly premium paid regardless of income , while the social democrats favor a broadening of the funding base by bringing in currently exempt groups of the population and making them pay in line with their earnings . next year the public health care system will have a budget hole between 8 and 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.6 billion to $ 12 billion -rrb- .
germans , who have long enjoyed one of the most beneficial health care systems in europe , will have to steel themselves for difficult changes ahead .
as is , workers and employers split the monthly premiums to health care providers .

he also demanded that the government should finally think hard about introducing a simpler tax system that citizens could relate to . " since you took office , you 've been telling us that this is the sort of tax policy you ca n't do in germany , " westerwelle said .
" you should finally defend your own ideas and convictions instead of pandering to the interests of your social democrat coalition partners . " the floor leader of the opposition left party , oskar lafontaine - himself a social democrat renegade - sharply criticized the government for what he described as grave budgetary neglect in the areas of education and research : " it 's outrageous that germany is among the poorest performers within oecd countries when it comes to investing in research and education , " lafontaine said .
" this is a situation that the new government seems unwilling to change .
but it has to be changed , if we 're serious about leading the country forward . " despite the attempts by the opposition to tear apart the government 's policy , the actors within the grand coalition do n't have much to fear since they have a comfortable majority of seats in both houses of parliament .

she said that reunited germany was now assuming greater responsibility in line with united nations and european union requirements . success on the international scene , however , was not the main topic of the parliamentary debate .
as widespread protests against pay cuts and layoffs continue throughout the country , merkel and her grand coalition government said they were stepping up efforts to find solutions to the pressing social and economic problems . labor reforms the latest unemployment figures for germany , which are published this thursday , are good news for the government : the number of jobless has dropped below the 5 million mark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frustrated by some of his coalition partners : labor minister franz müntefering merkel , however , appeared exasperated after a rift in the grand coalition over labor reforms .
social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- labor minister franz müntefering 's announced he was halting the labor reforms because some members of merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- were taking steps away from the coalition agreement and asking for reforms that would go beyond the agreed-upon measures such as allowing companies to fire workers during the two-year probationary period . " let 's first of all do what we resolved to do , " merkel said .
" we made an agreement on this . " merkel asked everybody to stick to the agreement and revisit the issue of germany 's job protection rules in two years .
but some members of her own party remained impatient . " the section on employment law in the coalition agreement does not go far enough , " said christian wulff , the conservative premier of lower saxony .
" it does not adequately reflect the real need for reform . " the trade unions , on the other hand , are stepping up pressure on spd - traditionally seen as a champion of workers ' rights .

answer : the fifa world cup .
you can say it ... but you ca n't wear it .
not without a license anyway . nearly every company in germany wants to make money on the upcoming world cup in june .
but not everyone is allowed to advertise with the logo .
fifa , world soccer 's governing body , has laid down strict criteria for world cup 2006 slogans and advertising . while soccer fans are gearing up for the world cup , the biggest event the sport has to offer , others are dreaming about how to make big bucks from it . but far from being a free-for-all cash cow which benefits everyone , the soccer powers-that-be have stipulated that only official fifa sponsors are allowed to sell their goods using the world cup 2006 tag which puts some traders on the wrong side of the tournament organizers and potentially on the wrong side of the law . the official sponsors , companies like automaker hyundai and sports equipment giant adidas amongst others , are the only ones allowed to use certain trademarks copyrighted by fifa .
and they have certainly paid for the privilege . these " official " companies have paid around 45 million euros each for exclusive permission to use the world cup for advertising purposes .
in addition , there are the national sponsors like german railways , postbank and others who have each paid 13 million euros for the rights , but may only use the world cup logo for their advertising within germany . fifa believes that the high price for getting on the exclusive list is worth it and that those who intend to use the trademarks without acquiring these rights should be punished .
fifa spokesman andreas herren says it is only what official sponsors would expect .
" companies who have acquired these rights of course deserve to be protected against this so-called ‘ ambush marketing ’ by free-riders . " those who unofficially use the world cup to make money face tough consequences .
during the 2002 world cup in japan / korea , for instance , fifa tracked down nearly 2,000 cases of fraud in 88 different countries .
over three million products were confiscated . official brand names a particularly prickly subject bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : official fifa products carry licensed logos and authenticity tags fifa gets particularly picky with the brand names " 2006 fifa world cup germany " and " world cup 2006 . "
those slogans enjoy special trademark protection .
those who abuse the trademark rights face punishment , says trademark lawyer martin chakraborty . " if someone uses the trademark illegally , say , to print it on t-shirts or baseballs caps to be sold outside the stadiums , then he will face a restraining order and could have to pay damages to fifa , " he says . visitors who buy and wear the unlicensed products could be forced by personnel to remove them at the stadiums .
however , not only would that mean potentially thousands of semi-naked fans teeming through the turnstiles ; it would also infringe on personal rights and freedom of action . spectators would have to stand up to the personnel and insist on their right to wear what they want which could lead to confrontation fifa and the german organizers are eager to avoid . high street traders unaware of potential fifa wrath while fifa expects businesses across germany to adhere to its strong-arm trademark policies , it seems that its message has not spread far enough to reach those who may be affected by it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knock-off merchandise can get traders into trouble in the cologne suburb of vingst , a number of traders were still blissfully unaware that selling unlicensed world cup products featuring seemingly innocuous slogans such as " world cup 2006 " could land them in hot water with the global soccer body . " i know these baseball caps are not licensed but i 'm not selling them as such , " said achim b. , the proprietor of a discount store selling a range of soccer related products .
" i 'm not trying to con anyone .
if they want to pay an extra 20 euros for the real thing , that ’ s up to them . " when informed that even the slogan " world cup 06 " could contravene fifa trademark rules , achim replied , " what else are we going to call it ?
soccer world championships 2006 ?
no one will know what that is ?
it 's the world cup .
anyway , i 'd never be able to fit that on a cap . " " crazy " fifa going too far , say shop owners " it 's just stupid , " said another trader who wished to remain anonymous .
" what will they do next ?
stop us from selling footballs because they have something to do with the world cup ?
we 'd have to call them ' balls to be kicked by the feet ' .
people would think i was crazy - just like fifa . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : champ 06 unofficial merchandise many companies have gotten around the strict trademark rules by marketing their products under world cup related headings without actually using the protected brand names .
however , the products lack a certain credibility without the world cup in the title and are perceived as cheap as a result . businesses are not alone in suffering under fifa 's control-freakery .
local authorities have also found that organizing small scale world cup related events under certain trademarked slogans could incur fifa 's wrath . katja hartmann , the events director with the phoenix sports club near ostheim , was forced to rename her world cup opening day festivities in line with fifa rules . local opening gala forced to change its name " we intended to hold our gala on june 9 under the title ' world cup festival 2006 ' but after applying for the necessary licenses we were advised by lawyers that the name could infringe on fifa trademarks .
unless we were willing to pay lots of money to use it , we had to change the name or go ahead and face the consequences . " " it was not such a big deal to change it but we felt pressured .
people should be allowed to celebrate the fact the world cup is in germany and call it just that .
the world cup is about the people but it seems that they are being pushed out of the picture in favor of money-making and marketing , " she added .

" ipi director johann fritz pointed out a british draft legislation " prohibiting the ' glorification ' of terrorism " following the july bombings in london and an eu discussion over the role of the media in " radicalizing " terrorism . these steps " signaled a shift in the balance between liberty and security and shaped the political debate over the controversial cartoons of mohammed published by the danish newspaper , jyllands posten , " he wrote in his foreword to the latest report . us and france not exempt fritz criticized china which " is embracing capitalism without introducing the requisite freedoms " and " american computer companies -lrb- who -rrb- helpfully censored their internet software " in compliance with beijing to establish themselves in the country . " in 2005 , more journalists were imprisoned in nepal than in any other country , " the report pointed out , also criticizing countries like the us and france , in which journalists were prosecuted for refusing to reveal their sources . in africa , the institute said freedom of the press was " being swiftly eroded " and legislation was used to hinder the work of journalists , in particular in zimbabwe where the " government has used every means at its disposal to silence the media . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suspects accused of murdering a journalist go on trial in philipiines " the situation for the mass media in russia continues to be difficult , " it also said , adding " in addition to the attacks on journalists , the media have engaged in a great deal of self-censorship , which was demonstrated by the coverage of the january social-benefit reform protests .

the american software giant has one last chance to convince eu regulators it is complying with a two-year old ruling .
failure means 2 million euros in daily fines . facing the threat of daily fines , microsoft tried to convince eu anti-trust regulators thursday that the us software giant is meeting their demands to comply with a landmark 2004 competition ruling . even before the start of a two-day closed-door hearing , microsoft came out fighting , saying that new fines would not resolve the long-standing competition row . " in our view , a fine is not the answer , " said microsoft 's top lawyer , brad smith , as he arrived for the hearing with the european commission . in response , commission spokesman for competition issues jonathan todd said that the commission had little choice but to brandish the threat of fines . " also from the commission 's perspective , fines are not the best way to resolve the conflict but two years after the decision , we have tried all other ways so that microsoft complies with the decision and it has still not done so , " he said .

" it 's not necessary for microsoft to go beyond what we are asking for , " said todd .
" it would be quite sufficient for them to do what they are supposed to do in accordance with the decision of march 2004 . " he also said that although there were firms that found the offer to reveal computer code to be useful , " there are many companies that have told us that the information provided by microsoft is not suitable .

and business leaders , security experts and law enforcement gathering thursday and friday in london aim to change that . it has been quite a year for e-crime , say experts .
trojan horses have constantly bombarded banks and others in the financial sector .
phishing and identity theft attempts have risen to number about 8 million per day , according to security officials .
e-scams are costing businesses billions and that does n't include increasing funds - about 20 to 50 percent of total expenditures in the us and uk - to beef up security .
and it is only getting worse .
as a result , law enforcement , business and computer specialists have come together for the annual e-crime congress in london thursday and friday to find new methods to fight such cyber predators .
an illustrious group because it is such a growing problem internationally , the conference is attracting bigger names and from further afield , too .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : microsoft 's brad smith offered a reward of $ 5 million to those who help catch cyber criminals attendees include about 500 officials from governments , companies as amazon , ebay , skype and yahoo , bankers from scandinavia , the uk and the middle east and law enforcement such as the fbi , scotland yard and those from the china .
" the 2005 e-crime congress provided an excellent forum for us to interact with law enforcement agencies , security product vendors and others in the financial services industry to discuss the wider issues that affect us , " one british bank security official as quoted on the congress ' website .
e-crime remains a low priority e-crime , like white-collar crime , is low on the list of law enforcement priorities , experts say .
instead , police and intelligence agencies worldwide are busy grappling with violent crimes and terrorism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internet cafes in countries with few cyber or extradition laws are often used by cyber gangs in most countries , police officials are overworked and lack manpower and often expertise to investigate e-crime .
few prosecutors take on such cases and laws often lack teeth , experts say .
that lessens the already low deterrant power of law enforcement against cyber criminals , who already have very low odds of getting caught , especially if they are outside the us or europe .

a new recycling system for electronics has been kicked off and manufacturers are getting the bill . you see them in or beside trash dumpsters or just sitting forlornly next to the curb : bulky beige computer monitors or dot-matrix printers , answering machines , refrigerators or that mobile phone that was the hippest must-have last year but is a unloved dinosaur now . they are all part of germany 's growing pile of electronic waste , which , according to the country 's environment ministry , amounts to about 1.8 million tons annually .
the new recycling requirements that require consumers to take their waste electronics to collection centers or have them picked up , is aimed at getting the rushing river of burned out components , shot transformers and obsolete electronic gadgets under control . " no type of trash has grown so rapidly recently as electronic waste , which has tripled in just a few years , " said eva leonhardt , waste expert at the environmental group deutsche umwelthilfe , which has set up a hotline to help people out with the new recycling rules .
" twenty years ago , the development cycle for electronics was around four years , now it 's three months .
that has led to an enormous increase in the amount of electronic trash . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : full of hazardous materials while beige computer boxes and refrigerators left on city sidewalks are unsightly , they can also be dangerous .
circuit boards , batteries and crts can contain hazardous materials such as lead and mercury while televisions usually also contain lead .
brominated flame retardants are commonly added to plastics used in electronics .
all these toxins can be released into the environment through incinerator ash or leach into the soil at landfills . " there are also recyclable waste in these products , like copper , aluminum , steel and sometimes even precious metals , " said leonhardt .
" to not use these materials again is almost criminal . " do n't just toss it on friday , germany 's " act governing the sale , return and environmentally sound disposal of electrical and electronic equipment " went into force .
the rules , better know as the electronic equipment law , require manufacturers to cover the cost of collecting and recycling consumer electronics and appliances .
they are designed to conform to an eu directive on electronic waste passed in 2004 . consumers are now asked to take their old electronic equipment and appliances to central collection areas , where special containers have been set up to receive them .
if consumers continue to throw their electronic waste in the normal trash , they can be fined . after that , it 's up to manufacturers to take care of things , since the law requires them to pick up the cost of recycling their products no longer in use .
companies who put any of 10 categories of electronic equipment on the german market have had to register with a central clearing house , called ear , which coordinates the collection . that does not mean that , for example , siemens sends out collection trucks to pick up its own discarded mobile phones and other equipment in the 1,500 collection areas around the country .
rather , in a complicated process , ear calculates the quantities of old electronics that each registered producer is required to collect from waste management authorities based on the amount the company puts on the market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dumpsters like this are off-limits for electronics companies can then contract with private recycling firms or other groups to disassemble the electronic waste , or do it themselves .
they then must dispose of the toxic materials in environmentally sound ways , and can either re-use recyclable materials , or sell them abroad , as is often the case , since more and more electronics manufacturing is being done in asia . " no , you ca n't really say we were supporters of these regulations , since it is going to cost manufacturers between 300 and 500 million euros -lrb- $ 360 - $ 600 -rrb- a year , " said otmar frey of the german electrical and electronic manufacturers ' association , even though his group decided to take a role in helping german lawmakers write up rules for implementing the eu directive . " we decided it would be better not to wait until others came up with rules that we would have a hard time living with , " he said .
the association did not want a repeat of the fiasco that followed the introduction of a deposit system on beverage cans and bottles , which many experts say was poorly thought through . in fact , according to frey and others , the electronics recycling system , although operational for less than a week , is running smoothly so far . higher costs in the store ? while environmental groups are cheering the new rules , trade associations say consumers will likely pay a price , although they are not being directly charged for the new plan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these could get more expensive because of the new rules according to germany 's leading retail association hde , producers will pass along the new recycling costs to consumers eventually .
the disposal of a washing machine costs around eight euros -lrb- $ 9.60 -rrb- , a refrigerator 15 euros -lrb- $ 18 -rrb- , and a television set around 10 euros -lrb- $ 12 -rrb- .
those amounts could soon be incorporated into the price tag . slow going around europe the eu electronic waste directive was supposed to have been implemented by member states by august 2005 , but most countries missed that deadline , including germany . while austria did get a registration and collection system online on schedule , it had not yet figured out what do with the old electronics once they had been turned in .
for months , collection centers were full of growing piles of plastic , glass and circuitry . # b # holland , belgium and sweden have systems in place , as do the swiss , although they are not part of the eu .
some countries are halfway there , such as hungary , although others , such as france , italy and the uk , have done little or nothing to turn the eu guidelines into national law .
the uk does not anticipate having a national system in place until 2007 . " several of these countries are facing proceedings because they are in breach of eu rules , " said frey . several of those countries with electronics recycling programs have organized them differently .
while germany separates its electronics according to functional category , austria does it by size , and hungary by tax number .
that will make any kind of cross-border cooperation more difficult , especially for manufacturers active internationally , said waste expert leonhardt .

" no , you ca n't really say we were supporters of these regulations , since it is going to cost manufacturers between 300 and 500 million euros -lrb- $ 360 - $ 600 -rrb- a year , " said otmar frey of the german electrical and electronic manufacturers ' association , even though his group decided to take a role in helping german lawmakers write up rules for implementing the eu directive . " we decided it would be better not to wait until others came up with rules that we would have a hard time living with , " he said .
the association did not want a repeat of the fiasco that followed the introduction of a deposit system on beverage cans and bottles , which many experts say was poorly thought through . in fact , according to frey and others , the electronics recycling system , although operational for less than a week , is running smoothly so far . higher costs in the store ? while environmental groups are cheering the new rules , trade associations say consumers will likely pay a price , although they are not being directly charged for the new plan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these could get more expensive because of the new rules according to germany 's leading retail association hde , producers will pass along the new recycling costs to consumers eventually .
the disposal of a washing machine costs around eight euros -lrb- $ 9.60 -rrb- , a refrigerator 15 euros -lrb- $ 18 -rrb- , and a television set around 10 euros -lrb- $ 12 -rrb- .
those amounts could soon be incorporated into the price tag . slow going around europe the eu electronic waste directive was supposed to have been implemented by member states by august 2005 , but most countries missed that deadline , including germany . while austria did get a registration and collection system online on schedule , it had not yet figured out what do with the old electronics once they had been turned in .
for months , collection centers were full of growing piles of plastic , glass and circuitry . # b # holland , belgium and sweden have systems in place , as do the swiss , although they are not part of the eu .
some countries are halfway there , such as hungary , although others , such as france , italy and the uk , have done little or nothing to turn the eu guidelines into national law .
the uk does not anticipate having a national system in place until 2007 . " several of these countries are facing proceedings because they are in breach of eu rules , " said frey . several of those countries with electronics recycling programs have organized them differently .
while germany separates its electronics according to functional category , austria does it by size , and hungary by tax number .
that will make any kind of cross-border cooperation more difficult , especially for manufacturers active internationally , said waste expert leonhardt .

and business leaders , security experts and law enforcement gathering thursday and friday in london aim to change that . it has been quite a year for e-crime , say experts .
trojan horses have constantly bombarded banks and others in the financial sector .
phishing and identity theft attempts have risen to number about 8 million per day , according to security officials .
e-scams are costing businesses billions and that does n't include increasing funds - about 20 to 50 percent of total expenditures in the us and uk - to beef up security .
and it is only getting worse .
as a result , law enforcement , business and computer specialists have come together for the annual e-crime congress in london thursday and friday to find new methods to fight such cyber predators .
an illustrious group because it is such a growing problem internationally , the conference is attracting bigger names and from further afield , too .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : microsoft 's brad smith offered a reward of $ 5 million to those who help catch cyber criminals attendees include about 500 officials from governments , companies as amazon , ebay , skype and yahoo , bankers from scandinavia , the uk and the middle east and law enforcement such as the fbi , scotland yard and those from the china .
" the 2005 e-crime congress provided an excellent forum for us to interact with law enforcement agencies , security product vendors and others in the financial services industry to discuss the wider issues that affect us , " one british bank security official as quoted on the congress ' website .
e-crime remains a low priority e-crime , like white-collar crime , is low on the list of law enforcement priorities , experts say .
instead , police and intelligence agencies worldwide are busy grappling with violent crimes and terrorism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internet cafes in countries with few cyber or extradition laws are often used by cyber gangs in most countries , police officials are overworked and lack manpower and often expertise to investigate e-crime .
few prosecutors take on such cases and laws often lack teeth , experts say .
that lessens the already low deterrant power of law enforcement against cyber criminals , who already have very low odds of getting caught , especially if they are outside the us or europe .

unity is the order of the day . for the past two and a half weeks , the un security council members have been at loggerheads over iran .
great britain , france and the u.s. disagree with russia and china on how to tackle the volatile islamic republic 's nuclear ambitions .
with the need to take a unified stance on the issue pressing , the foreign ministers of the five world powers will meet with merkel and eu foreign policy chief javier solana on how best to proceed .
the goal is to come out of the meeting with a unified stance and , hopefully , a draft resolution on iran that can go before the un security council . a new , weaker resolution ?
the latter will be more difficult to present .

" we have n't reached finish line yet , " foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier told the bundestag during a general debate on wednesday . iran has remained resolute in the face of international diplomatic pressure .
after more than two years of negotiations with britain , france and germany , it resumed uranium enrichment earlier this year .
the eu-3 broke off diplomatic negotiations soon after and u.s. representatives began looking for a way to refer the issue to the security council , where sanctions were possible . no military option , no talk of sanctions those plans appear abandoned given the stalemate at the moment - and any sort of military option against the islamic state seems far more unlikely .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uranium enrichment has been taken up again at isfahan " contrary to what has been said , there is no military option on the table .
there is no discussion of sanctions , " friedrich groenig , the head of arms control and disarmament at the german foreign minister told reuters . merkel is hoping for a resolution tomorrow , and says germany 's willingness to host the meeting is a sign of the country 's commitment to being a diplomatic player on the world stage .

a new recycling system for electronics has been kicked off and manufacturers are getting the bill . you see them in or beside trash dumpsters or just sitting forlornly next to the curb : bulky beige computer monitors or dot-matrix printers , answering machines , refrigerators or that mobile phone that was the hippest must-have last year but is a unloved dinosaur now . they are all part of germany 's growing pile of electronic waste , which , according to the country 's environment ministry , amounts to about 1.8 million tons annually .
the new recycling requirements that require consumers to take their waste electronics to collection centers or have them picked up , is aimed at getting the rushing river of burned out components , shot transformers and obsolete electronic gadgets under control . " no type of trash has grown so rapidly recently as electronic waste , which has tripled in just a few years , " said eva leonhardt , waste expert at the environmental group deutsche umwelthilfe , which has set up a hotline to help people out with the new recycling rules .
" twenty years ago , the development cycle for electronics was around four years , now it 's three months .
that has led to an enormous increase in the amount of electronic trash . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : full of hazardous materials while beige computer boxes and refrigerators left on city sidewalks are unsightly , they can also be dangerous .
circuit boards , batteries and crts can contain hazardous materials such as lead and mercury while televisions usually also contain lead .
brominated flame retardants are commonly added to plastics used in electronics .
all these toxins can be released into the environment through incinerator ash or leach into the soil at landfills . " there are also recyclable waste in these products , like copper , aluminum , steel and sometimes even precious metals , " said leonhardt .
" to not use these materials again is almost criminal . " do n't just toss it on friday , germany 's " act governing the sale , return and environmentally sound disposal of electrical and electronic equipment " went into force .
the rules , better know as the electronic equipment law , require manufacturers to cover the cost of collecting and recycling consumer electronics and appliances .
they are designed to conform to an eu directive on electronic waste passed in 2004 . consumers are now asked to take their old electronic equipment and appliances to central collection areas , where special containers have been set up to receive them .
if consumers continue to throw their electronic waste in the normal trash , they can be fined . after that , it 's up to manufacturers to take care of things , since the law requires them to pick up the cost of recycling their products no longer in use .
companies who put any of 10 categories of electronic equipment on the german market have had to register with a central clearing house , called ear , which coordinates the collection . that does not mean that , for example , siemens sends out collection trucks to pick up its own discarded mobile phones and other equipment in the 1,500 collection areas around the country .
rather , in a complicated process , ear calculates the quantities of old electronics that each registered producer is required to collect from waste management authorities based on the amount the company puts on the market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dumpsters like this are off-limits for electronics companies can then contract with private recycling firms or other groups to disassemble the electronic waste , or do it themselves .
they then must dispose of the toxic materials in environmentally sound ways , and can either re-use recyclable materials , or sell them abroad , as is often the case , since more and more electronics manufacturing is being done in asia . " no , you ca n't really say we were supporters of these regulations , since it is going to cost manufacturers between 300 and 500 million euros -lrb- $ 360 - $ 600 -rrb- a year , " said otmar frey of the german electrical and electronic manufacturers ' association , even though his group decided to take a role in helping german lawmakers write up rules for implementing the eu directive . " we decided it would be better not to wait until others came up with rules that we would have a hard time living with , " he said .
the association did not want a repeat of the fiasco that followed the introduction of a deposit system on beverage cans and bottles , which many experts say was poorly thought through . in fact , according to frey and others , the electronics recycling system , although operational for less than a week , is running smoothly so far . higher costs in the store ? while environmental groups are cheering the new rules , trade associations say consumers will likely pay a price , although they are not being directly charged for the new plan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these could get more expensive because of the new rules according to germany 's leading retail association hde , producers will pass along the new recycling costs to consumers eventually .
the disposal of a washing machine costs around eight euros -lrb- $ 9.60 -rrb- , a refrigerator 15 euros -lrb- $ 18 -rrb- , and a television set around 10 euros -lrb- $ 12 -rrb- .
those amounts could soon be incorporated into the price tag . slow going around europe the eu electronic waste directive was supposed to have been implemented by member states by august 2005 , but most countries missed that deadline , including germany . while austria did get a registration and collection system online on schedule , it had not yet figured out what do with the old electronics once they had been turned in .
for months , collection centers were full of growing piles of plastic , glass and circuitry . # b # holland , belgium and sweden have systems in place , as do the swiss , although they are not part of the eu .
some countries are halfway there , such as hungary , although others , such as france , italy and the uk , have done little or nothing to turn the eu guidelines into national law .
the uk does not anticipate having a national system in place until 2007 . " several of these countries are facing proceedings because they are in breach of eu rules , " said frey . several of those countries with electronics recycling programs have organized them differently .
while germany separates its electronics according to functional category , austria does it by size , and hungary by tax number .
that will make any kind of cross-border cooperation more difficult , especially for manufacturers active internationally , said waste expert leonhardt .

unity is the order of the day . for the past two and a half weeks , the un security council members have been at loggerheads over iran .
great britain , france and the u.s. disagree with russia and china on how to tackle the volatile islamic republic 's nuclear ambitions .
with the need to take a unified stance on the issue pressing , the foreign ministers of the five world powers will meet with merkel and eu foreign policy chief javier solana on how best to proceed .
the goal is to come out of the meeting with a unified stance and , hopefully , a draft resolution on iran that can go before the un security council . a new , weaker resolution ?
the latter will be more difficult to present .
with china and russia so far against hanging economic sanctions on iran , great britain , france and the u.s. are scrambling to find areas on which to compromise . reports out of the un in new york suggest that a new resolution is making the rounds that still forbids iran to enrich a uranium - part of the process of making an atomic bomb - but takes out language that would slap it with sanctions .

" this pipeline is not aimed against anyone but is aimed at ensuring the security of gas supplies to europe , " schröder said . " not only in germany but throughout western europe there is growing need for gas , while domestic production is falling , " he said .
" this project is in the interests of germany .
that is why it will be supported by every german government . " schröder added that he would be paid 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 300,000 -rrb- annually for holding the post . the 61-year old former chancellor is also an advisor to swiss media group ringier and international investment bank rothschild and has made lucrative public-speaking appearances . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life 's a gas : the old friends are reunited in business his acceptance of the job less than a month after he left the chancellor 's office last november prompted widespread criticism in germany .
he and russian president vladimir putin had worked closely on cementing german investment in the pipeline . earlier this month a lawyer acting for schröder said that he had won a temporary injunction against the leader of the liberal free democrats , guido westerwelle , preventing him from linking schröder 's post as chancellor to his involvement in the pipeline . appointment and pipeline project under fire the project has also prompted criticism from new eu members lithuania and poland , which complained that schröder had gone over their heads on a pipeline that is likely to pass through several baltic countries ' territorial waters . other members of the supervisory board include gazprom chief executive alexei miller as well as officials from germany 's e.on and basf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe hopes to keep the russian taps turned on gazprom has a 51.0 percent stake in the north european gas pipeline , while stakes of 24.5 percent are held by e.on and basf . matthias warnig , representative of dresdner bank in russia , was named as the pipeline 's managing director . miller on thursday appeared to give backing to the idea of possible involvement in the project by gaz de france .
" this decision could be taken if the new partner brings something new of strategic importance , " miller said in response to a question from journalists . schröder looking to use german links in new role earlier this week schröder paid a visit to gazprom production facilities in the siberian province of yamalo-nenets . he also confirmed that he plans to create a " german-russian think tank " but denied a russian press report that the body would be a lobbying agency for promoting the russian economy in germany . work on the pipeline has already begun onshore in russia that is planned to extend around 1,200 kilometers -lrb- 750 miles -rrb- under the baltic sea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pipeline managing director matthias warnig the pipeline is eventually expected to connect not only to germany but to other parts of western europe , including the netherlands , sweden and britain and is expected to come on stream in 2010 with an initial capacity of around 27.5 billion cubic meters of natural gas a year .
a second pipeline is expected to double capacity to 55 billion cubic meters annually . the first part of the project will cost two to 2.5 billion euros and the total cost of the offshore section of the project will be over four billion euros , management has said . european union officials have sought to reassure new eu members worried that they could be left without supplies if russia no longer has to ship gas through their territory to western europe .

unity is the order of the day . for the past two and a half weeks , the un security council members have been at loggerheads over iran .
great britain , france and the u.s. disagree with russia and china on how to tackle the volatile islamic republic 's nuclear ambitions .
with the need to take a unified stance on the issue pressing , the foreign ministers of the five world powers will meet with merkel and eu foreign policy chief javier solana on how best to proceed .
the goal is to come out of the meeting with a unified stance and , hopefully , a draft resolution on iran that can go before the un security council . a new , weaker resolution ?
the latter will be more difficult to present .
with china and russia so far against hanging economic sanctions on iran , great britain , france and the u.s. are scrambling to find areas on which to compromise . reports out of the un in new york suggest that a new resolution is making the rounds that still forbids iran to enrich a uranium - part of the process of making an atomic bomb - but takes out language that would slap it with sanctions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are sanctions still on the table in the un ? another proposal , by the international crisis group in belgium , would allow uranium enrichment , but force un inspections as well .
the proposal is favored by a deputy of german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who said the participants thursday would likely consider the idea . not at the finish line but a solid solution remains far off . " we have n't reached finish line yet , " foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier told the bundestag during a general debate on wednesday . iran has remained resolute in the face of international diplomatic pressure .
after more than two years of negotiations with britain , france and germany , it resumed uranium enrichment earlier this year .
the eu-3 broke off diplomatic negotiations soon after and u.s. representatives began looking for a way to refer the issue to the security council , where sanctions were possible . no military option , no talk of sanctions those plans appear abandoned given the stalemate at the moment - and any sort of military option against the islamic state seems far more unlikely .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uranium enrichment has been taken up again at isfahan " contrary to what has been said , there is no military option on the table .
there is no discussion of sanctions , " friedrich groenig , the head of arms control and disarmament at the german foreign minister told reuters . merkel is hoping for a resolution tomorrow , and says germany 's willingness to host the meeting is a sign of the country 's commitment to being a diplomatic player on the world stage .
germany , she said , wants to contribute to the clear signal towards iran or " what works in international politics and what does n't .

great britain , france and the u.s. disagree with russia and china on how to tackle the volatile islamic republic 's nuclear ambitions .
with the need to take a unified stance on the issue pressing , the foreign ministers of the five world powers will meet with merkel and eu foreign policy chief javier solana on how best to proceed .
the goal is to come out of the meeting with a unified stance and , hopefully , a draft resolution on iran that can go before the un security council . a new , weaker resolution ?
the latter will be more difficult to present .
with china and russia so far against hanging economic sanctions on iran , great britain , france and the u.s. are scrambling to find areas on which to compromise . reports out of the un in new york suggest that a new resolution is making the rounds that still forbids iran to enrich a uranium - part of the process of making an atomic bomb - but takes out language that would slap it with sanctions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are sanctions still on the table in the un ? another proposal , by the international crisis group in belgium , would allow uranium enrichment , but force un inspections as well .
the proposal is favored by a deputy of german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who said the participants thursday would likely consider the idea . not at the finish line but a solid solution remains far off . " we have n't reached finish line yet , " foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier told the bundestag during a general debate on wednesday . iran has remained resolute in the face of international diplomatic pressure .
after more than two years of negotiations with britain , france and germany , it resumed uranium enrichment earlier this year .
the eu-3 broke off diplomatic negotiations soon after and u.s. representatives began looking for a way to refer the issue to the security council , where sanctions were possible . no military option , no talk of sanctions those plans appear abandoned given the stalemate at the moment - and any sort of military option against the islamic state seems far more unlikely .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uranium enrichment has been taken up again at isfahan " contrary to what has been said , there is no military option on the table .
there is no discussion of sanctions , " friedrich groenig , the head of arms control and disarmament at the german foreign minister told reuters . merkel is hoping for a resolution tomorrow , and says germany 's willingness to host the meeting is a sign of the country 's commitment to being a diplomatic player on the world stage .

" this pipeline is not aimed against anyone but is aimed at ensuring the security of gas supplies to europe , " schröder said . " not only in germany but throughout western europe there is growing need for gas , while domestic production is falling , " he said .
" this project is in the interests of germany .
that is why it will be supported by every german government . " schröder added that he would be paid 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 300,000 -rrb- annually for holding the post . the 61-year old former chancellor is also an advisor to swiss media group ringier and international investment bank rothschild and has made lucrative public-speaking appearances . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life 's a gas : the old friends are reunited in business his acceptance of the job less than a month after he left the chancellor 's office last november prompted widespread criticism in germany .
he and russian president vladimir putin had worked closely on cementing german investment in the pipeline . earlier this month a lawyer acting for schröder said that he had won a temporary injunction against the leader of the liberal free democrats , guido westerwelle , preventing him from linking schröder 's post as chancellor to his involvement in the pipeline . appointment and pipeline project under fire the project has also prompted criticism from new eu members lithuania and poland , which complained that schröder had gone over their heads on a pipeline that is likely to pass through several baltic countries ' territorial waters . other members of the supervisory board include gazprom chief executive alexei miller as well as officials from germany 's e.on and basf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe hopes to keep the russian taps turned on gazprom has a 51.0 percent stake in the north european gas pipeline , while stakes of 24.5 percent are held by e.on and basf . matthias warnig , representative of dresdner bank in russia , was named as the pipeline 's managing director . miller on thursday appeared to give backing to the idea of possible involvement in the project by gaz de france .
" this decision could be taken if the new partner brings something new of strategic importance , " miller said in response to a question from journalists . schröder looking to use german links in new role earlier this week schröder paid a visit to gazprom production facilities in the siberian province of yamalo-nenets . he also confirmed that he plans to create a " german-russian think tank " but denied a russian press report that the body would be a lobbying agency for promoting the russian economy in germany . work on the pipeline has already begun onshore in russia that is planned to extend around 1,200 kilometers -lrb- 750 miles -rrb- under the baltic sea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pipeline managing director matthias warnig the pipeline is eventually expected to connect not only to germany but to other parts of western europe , including the netherlands , sweden and britain and is expected to come on stream in 2010 with an initial capacity of around 27.5 billion cubic meters of natural gas a year .
a second pipeline is expected to double capacity to 55 billion cubic meters annually . the first part of the project will cost two to 2.5 billion euros and the total cost of the offshore section of the project will be over four billion euros , management has said . european union officials have sought to reassure new eu members worried that they could be left without supplies if russia no longer has to ship gas through their territory to western europe .

answer : the fifa world cup .
you can say it ... but you ca n't wear it .
not without a license anyway . nearly every company in germany wants to make money on the upcoming world cup in june .
but not everyone is allowed to advertise with the logo .
fifa , world soccer 's governing body , has laid down strict criteria for world cup 2006 slogans and advertising . while soccer fans are gearing up for the world cup , the biggest event the sport has to offer , others are dreaming about how to make big bucks from it . but far from being a free-for-all cash cow which benefits everyone , the soccer powers-that-be have stipulated that only official fifa sponsors are allowed to sell their goods using the world cup 2006 tag which puts some traders on the wrong side of the tournament organizers and potentially on the wrong side of the law . the official sponsors , companies like automaker hyundai and sports equipment giant adidas amongst others , are the only ones allowed to use certain trademarks copyrighted by fifa .
and they have certainly paid for the privilege . these " official " companies have paid around 45 million euros each for exclusive permission to use the world cup for advertising purposes .
in addition , there are the national sponsors like german railways , postbank and others who have each paid 13 million euros for the rights , but may only use the world cup logo for their advertising within germany . fifa believes that the high price for getting on the exclusive list is worth it and that those who intend to use the trademarks without acquiring these rights should be punished .
fifa spokesman andreas herren says it is only what official sponsors would expect .
" companies who have acquired these rights of course deserve to be protected against this so-called ‘ ambush marketing ’ by free-riders . " those who unofficially use the world cup to make money face tough consequences .
during the 2002 world cup in japan / korea , for instance , fifa tracked down nearly 2,000 cases of fraud in 88 different countries .
over three million products were confiscated . official brand names a particularly prickly subject bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : official fifa products carry licensed logos and authenticity tags fifa gets particularly picky with the brand names " 2006 fifa world cup germany " and " world cup 2006 . "
those slogans enjoy special trademark protection .
those who abuse the trademark rights face punishment , says trademark lawyer martin chakraborty . " if someone uses the trademark illegally , say , to print it on t-shirts or baseballs caps to be sold outside the stadiums , then he will face a restraining order and could have to pay damages to fifa , " he says . visitors who buy and wear the unlicensed products could be forced by personnel to remove them at the stadiums .
however , not only would that mean potentially thousands of semi-naked fans teeming through the turnstiles ; it would also infringe on personal rights and freedom of action . spectators would have to stand up to the personnel and insist on their right to wear what they want which could lead to confrontation fifa and the german organizers are eager to avoid . high street traders unaware of potential fifa wrath while fifa expects businesses across germany to adhere to its strong-arm trademark policies , it seems that its message has not spread far enough to reach those who may be affected by it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knock-off merchandise can get traders into trouble in the cologne suburb of vingst , a number of traders were still blissfully unaware that selling unlicensed world cup products featuring seemingly innocuous slogans such as " world cup 2006 " could land them in hot water with the global soccer body . " i know these baseball caps are not licensed but i 'm not selling them as such , " said achim b. , the proprietor of a discount store selling a range of soccer related products .
" i 'm not trying to con anyone .
if they want to pay an extra 20 euros for the real thing , that ’ s up to them . " when informed that even the slogan " world cup 06 " could contravene fifa trademark rules , achim replied , " what else are we going to call it ?
soccer world championships 2006 ?
no one will know what that is ?
it 's the world cup .
anyway , i 'd never be able to fit that on a cap . " " crazy " fifa going too far , say shop owners " it 's just stupid , " said another trader who wished to remain anonymous .
" what will they do next ?
stop us from selling footballs because they have something to do with the world cup ?
we 'd have to call them ' balls to be kicked by the feet ' .
people would think i was crazy - just like fifa . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : champ 06 unofficial merchandise many companies have gotten around the strict trademark rules by marketing their products under world cup related headings without actually using the protected brand names .
however , the products lack a certain credibility without the world cup in the title and are perceived as cheap as a result . businesses are not alone in suffering under fifa 's control-freakery .
local authorities have also found that organizing small scale world cup related events under certain trademarked slogans could incur fifa 's wrath . katja hartmann , the events director with the phoenix sports club near ostheim , was forced to rename her world cup opening day festivities in line with fifa rules . local opening gala forced to change its name " we intended to hold our gala on june 9 under the title ' world cup festival 2006 ' but after applying for the necessary licenses we were advised by lawyers that the name could infringe on fifa trademarks .
unless we were willing to pay lots of money to use it , we had to change the name or go ahead and face the consequences . " " it was not such a big deal to change it but we felt pressured .
people should be allowed to celebrate the fact the world cup is in germany and call it just that .
the world cup is about the people but it seems that they are being pushed out of the picture in favor of money-making and marketing , " she added .

but while some call for sanctions , others say such measures will punish the wrong people . the eu must firmly condemn the belarus regime for its bloody crackdown on opposition supporters after presidential polls , but should not impose sanctions that hurt the people , polish prime minister kazimierz marcinkiewicz said in riga thursday . " belarus is our neighbor and what happens there touches us directly , " marcinkiewicz told reporters during a one-day visit .
" but economic sanctions or a blockade should not be applied as they would put pressure on the common people , not the ruling elite . " " a massive fraud " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riot police beat protesters in the belarusian capital minsk on saturday eu leaders agreed at a summit last week to widen a list of senior belarusian officials subject to a visa ban and said they were also considering financial sanctions .
poland has already imposed travel restrictions on belarusian officials it accused of falsifying results in the former soviet republic 's presidential election on march 19 in which " europe 's last dictator " won a landslide victory in a poll judged fraudulent by the eu , the u.s. and international observers . german chancellor angela merkel on wednesday denounced the belarus presidential election as marred by " massive fraud " as the lower house of parliament passed a resolution calling for the immediate release of arrested belarusian opposition activists and sanctions against the country by the european union . " this election was subject to massive fraud and somebody has to say so , " merkel told the bundestag . more than 500 arrested the german members of parliament are proposing to invite the main belarusian opposition candidate , alexander milinkevich , to the next meeting of eu foreign ministers in luxembourg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belarus ' opposition leader alexander milinkevich says he will return to belarus and continue to fight milinkevich , who led protests against the re-election of president alexander lukashenko , said he was going to poland thursday to tell the outside world what was going on in his country . " in the polish parliament i intend to say what is really happening in belarus , " alexander milinkevich told reuters .
he added that he had no plans to emigrate even though he faces jail if he returns to belarus in connection with the protests . so far , more than 500 people have been arrested in belarus after a wave of opposition demonstrations resulted in a bloody crackdown by pro-lukashenko security forces .
alexander kozulin , another opposition figure who ran against the president and was detained after the protests , has been charged with hooliganism and faces up to six years in jail . meanwhile , lukashenko postponed his inauguration friday to april with some suggesting that the protests , which drew as many as 10,000 people , had scared him . " maybe the main reason is lukashenko 's psychological mood , " milinkevich told reporters .

she said that reunited germany was now assuming greater responsibility in line with united nations and european union requirements . success on the international scene , however , was not the main topic of the parliamentary debate .
as widespread protests against pay cuts and layoffs continue throughout the country , merkel and her grand coalition government said they were stepping up efforts to find solutions to the pressing social and economic problems . labor reforms the latest unemployment figures for germany , which are published this thursday , are good news for the government : the number of jobless has dropped below the 5 million mark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frustrated by some of his coalition partners : labor minister franz müntefering merkel , however , appeared exasperated after a rift in the grand coalition over labor reforms .
social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- labor minister franz müntefering 's announced he was halting the labor reforms because some members of merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- were taking steps away from the coalition agreement and asking for reforms that would go beyond the agreed-upon measures such as allowing companies to fire workers during the two-year probationary period . " let 's first of all do what we resolved to do , " merkel said .
" we made an agreement on this . " merkel asked everybody to stick to the agreement and revisit the issue of germany 's job protection rules in two years .
but some members of her own party remained impatient . " the section on employment law in the coalition agreement does not go far enough , " said christian wulff , the conservative premier of lower saxony .
" it does not adequately reflect the real need for reform . " the trade unions , on the other hand , are stepping up pressure on spd - traditionally seen as a champion of workers ' rights . " the trade union 's goal is for dismissal protection not to deteriorate , but rather to be maintained , or even improved , " said michael sommer , head of the dgb trade union federation for german daily die welt .
" not everything that is in the coalition agreement must be implemented . " energy reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opposition is not her main problem : german chancellor angela merkel merkel announced that her grand coalition government would introduce a new long-term energy strategy in the second half of next year .
this moves comes as a response to the growing concern about germany 's reliance on russian natural gas and the rekindled debate about the country 's nuclear phase out program . " just because we have a difference of opinion on this one issue does n't mean we can afford to ignore the question of how our energy strategy out to 2020 should look , " merkel said in her speech before the bundestag . one of the most crucial pieces of legislation passed by outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens , in the eyes of many , was a planned phase-out of germany 's atomic energy plants by 2020 . the idea , largely pressed by the environmentally-friendly greens , was to focus on renewable energy and away from a crippling dependence on oil .
it also found support at a time when safety concerns over nuclear power reactors were highlighted with accidents like the one in chernobyl in 1986 .
the social democrats in the current grand coalition government made the nuclear phase-out an important part of the coalition agreement which was signed before the new government took office . german economics minister michael gloss , who raised quite a few eyebrows when he suggested in january that germany should reconsider prolonging the use of nuclear energy , toned down his views . " the nuclear exist is written into law and at the present time i do n't believe that the majority necessary to change this agreement exists in the german bundestag , " glos said in an interview for german daily handelsblatt . health reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : staying healthy has become more expensive in germany the german chancellor reassured parliamentarians that her coalition government would now start working seriously on an overdue reform of the statutory health system .
she said she was confident that the current clash of concepts could be overcome in a constructive manner . at present , merkel 's conservatives are backing a flat monthly premium paid regardless of income , while the social democrats favor a broadening of the funding base by bringing in currently exempt groups of the population and making them pay in line with their earnings . next year the public health care system will have a budget hole between 8 and 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.6 billion to $ 12 billion -rrb- .
germans , who have long enjoyed one of the most beneficial health care systems in europe , will have to steel themselves for difficult changes ahead .
as is , workers and employers split the monthly premiums to health care providers .
about 10 percent of the population has elected out of the state-sponsored public system , preferring costlier , but some say better , private insurance . opposition strikes back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they did n't get enough votes to form a coaltion : merkel and fdp leader westerwelle -lrb- right -rrb- oposition free-market liberal party -lrb- fdp -rrb- chief guido westerwelle accused the government of planning to raise taxes further as of next year despite pre-election promises to the contrary .
he also demanded that the government should finally think hard about introducing a simpler tax system that citizens could relate to . " since you took office , you 've been telling us that this is the sort of tax policy you ca n't do in germany , " westerwelle said .
" you should finally defend your own ideas and convictions instead of pandering to the interests of your social democrat coalition partners . " the floor leader of the opposition left party , oskar lafontaine - himself a social democrat renegade - sharply criticized the government for what he described as grave budgetary neglect in the areas of education and research : " it 's outrageous that germany is among the poorest performers within oecd countries when it comes to investing in research and education , " lafontaine said .
" this is a situation that the new government seems unwilling to change .

she said that reunited germany was now assuming greater responsibility in line with united nations and european union requirements . success on the international scene , however , was not the main topic of the parliamentary debate .
as widespread protests against pay cuts and layoffs continue throughout the country , merkel and her grand coalition government said they were stepping up efforts to find solutions to the pressing social and economic problems . labor reforms the latest unemployment figures for germany , which are published this thursday , are good news for the government : the number of jobless has dropped below the 5 million mark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frustrated by some of his coalition partners : labor minister franz müntefering merkel , however , appeared exasperated after a rift in the grand coalition over labor reforms .
social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- labor minister franz müntefering 's announced he was halting the labor reforms because some members of merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- were taking steps away from the coalition agreement and asking for reforms that would go beyond the agreed-upon measures such as allowing companies to fire workers during the two-year probationary period . " let 's first of all do what we resolved to do , " merkel said .
" we made an agreement on this . " merkel asked everybody to stick to the agreement and revisit the issue of germany 's job protection rules in two years .
but some members of her own party remained impatient . " the section on employment law in the coalition agreement does not go far enough , " said christian wulff , the conservative premier of lower saxony .
" it does not adequately reflect the real need for reform . " the trade unions , on the other hand , are stepping up pressure on spd - traditionally seen as a champion of workers ' rights . " the trade union 's goal is for dismissal protection not to deteriorate , but rather to be maintained , or even improved , " said michael sommer , head of the dgb trade union federation for german daily die welt .
" not everything that is in the coalition agreement must be implemented . " energy reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opposition is not her main problem : german chancellor angela merkel merkel announced that her grand coalition government would introduce a new long-term energy strategy in the second half of next year .
this moves comes as a response to the growing concern about germany 's reliance on russian natural gas and the rekindled debate about the country 's nuclear phase out program . " just because we have a difference of opinion on this one issue does n't mean we can afford to ignore the question of how our energy strategy out to 2020 should look , " merkel said in her speech before the bundestag . one of the most crucial pieces of legislation passed by outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens , in the eyes of many , was a planned phase-out of germany 's atomic energy plants by 2020 . the idea , largely pressed by the environmentally-friendly greens , was to focus on renewable energy and away from a crippling dependence on oil .
it also found support at a time when safety concerns over nuclear power reactors were highlighted with accidents like the one in chernobyl in 1986 .
the social democrats in the current grand coalition government made the nuclear phase-out an important part of the coalition agreement which was signed before the new government took office . german economics minister michael gloss , who raised quite a few eyebrows when he suggested in january that germany should reconsider prolonging the use of nuclear energy , toned down his views . " the nuclear exist is written into law and at the present time i do n't believe that the majority necessary to change this agreement exists in the german bundestag , " glos said in an interview for german daily handelsblatt . health reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : staying healthy has become more expensive in germany the german chancellor reassured parliamentarians that her coalition government would now start working seriously on an overdue reform of the statutory health system .
she said she was confident that the current clash of concepts could be overcome in a constructive manner . at present , merkel 's conservatives are backing a flat monthly premium paid regardless of income , while the social democrats favor a broadening of the funding base by bringing in currently exempt groups of the population and making them pay in line with their earnings . next year the public health care system will have a budget hole between 8 and 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.6 billion to $ 12 billion -rrb- .
germans , who have long enjoyed one of the most beneficial health care systems in europe , will have to steel themselves for difficult changes ahead .
as is , workers and employers split the monthly premiums to health care providers .
about 10 percent of the population has elected out of the state-sponsored public system , preferring costlier , but some say better , private insurance . opposition strikes back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they did n't get enough votes to form a coaltion : merkel and fdp leader westerwelle -lrb- right -rrb- oposition free-market liberal party -lrb- fdp -rrb- chief guido westerwelle accused the government of planning to raise taxes further as of next year despite pre-election promises to the contrary .
he also demanded that the government should finally think hard about introducing a simpler tax system that citizens could relate to . " since you took office , you 've been telling us that this is the sort of tax policy you ca n't do in germany , " westerwelle said .
" you should finally defend your own ideas and convictions instead of pandering to the interests of your social democrat coalition partners . " the floor leader of the opposition left party , oskar lafontaine - himself a social democrat renegade - sharply criticized the government for what he described as grave budgetary neglect in the areas of education and research : " it 's outrageous that germany is among the poorest performers within oecd countries when it comes to investing in research and education , " lafontaine said .
" this is a situation that the new government seems unwilling to change .
but it has to be changed , if we 're serious about leading the country forward .

as widespread protests against pay cuts and layoffs continue throughout the country , merkel and her grand coalition government said they were stepping up efforts to find solutions to the pressing social and economic problems . labor reforms the latest unemployment figures for germany , which are published this thursday , are good news for the government : the number of jobless has dropped below the 5 million mark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frustrated by some of his coalition partners : labor minister franz müntefering merkel , however , appeared exasperated after a rift in the grand coalition over labor reforms .
social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- labor minister franz müntefering 's announced he was halting the labor reforms because some members of merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- were taking steps away from the coalition agreement and asking for reforms that would go beyond the agreed-upon measures such as allowing companies to fire workers during the two-year probationary period . " let 's first of all do what we resolved to do , " merkel said .
" we made an agreement on this . " merkel asked everybody to stick to the agreement and revisit the issue of germany 's job protection rules in two years .
but some members of her own party remained impatient . " the section on employment law in the coalition agreement does not go far enough , " said christian wulff , the conservative premier of lower saxony .
" it does not adequately reflect the real need for reform . " the trade unions , on the other hand , are stepping up pressure on spd - traditionally seen as a champion of workers ' rights . " the trade union 's goal is for dismissal protection not to deteriorate , but rather to be maintained , or even improved , " said michael sommer , head of the dgb trade union federation for german daily die welt .
" not everything that is in the coalition agreement must be implemented . " energy reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opposition is not her main problem : german chancellor angela merkel merkel announced that her grand coalition government would introduce a new long-term energy strategy in the second half of next year .
this moves comes as a response to the growing concern about germany 's reliance on russian natural gas and the rekindled debate about the country 's nuclear phase out program . " just because we have a difference of opinion on this one issue does n't mean we can afford to ignore the question of how our energy strategy out to 2020 should look , " merkel said in her speech before the bundestag . one of the most crucial pieces of legislation passed by outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens , in the eyes of many , was a planned phase-out of germany 's atomic energy plants by 2020 . the idea , largely pressed by the environmentally-friendly greens , was to focus on renewable energy and away from a crippling dependence on oil .
it also found support at a time when safety concerns over nuclear power reactors were highlighted with accidents like the one in chernobyl in 1986 .
the social democrats in the current grand coalition government made the nuclear phase-out an important part of the coalition agreement which was signed before the new government took office . german economics minister michael gloss , who raised quite a few eyebrows when he suggested in january that germany should reconsider prolonging the use of nuclear energy , toned down his views . " the nuclear exist is written into law and at the present time i do n't believe that the majority necessary to change this agreement exists in the german bundestag , " glos said in an interview for german daily handelsblatt . health reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : staying healthy has become more expensive in germany the german chancellor reassured parliamentarians that her coalition government would now start working seriously on an overdue reform of the statutory health system .
she said she was confident that the current clash of concepts could be overcome in a constructive manner . at present , merkel 's conservatives are backing a flat monthly premium paid regardless of income , while the social democrats favor a broadening of the funding base by bringing in currently exempt groups of the population and making them pay in line with their earnings . next year the public health care system will have a budget hole between 8 and 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.6 billion to $ 12 billion -rrb- .
germans , who have long enjoyed one of the most beneficial health care systems in europe , will have to steel themselves for difficult changes ahead .
as is , workers and employers split the monthly premiums to health care providers .
about 10 percent of the population has elected out of the state-sponsored public system , preferring costlier , but some say better , private insurance . opposition strikes back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they did n't get enough votes to form a coaltion : merkel and fdp leader westerwelle -lrb- right -rrb- oposition free-market liberal party -lrb- fdp -rrb- chief guido westerwelle accused the government of planning to raise taxes further as of next year despite pre-election promises to the contrary .
he also demanded that the government should finally think hard about introducing a simpler tax system that citizens could relate to . " since you took office , you 've been telling us that this is the sort of tax policy you ca n't do in germany , " westerwelle said .
" you should finally defend your own ideas and convictions instead of pandering to the interests of your social democrat coalition partners . " the floor leader of the opposition left party , oskar lafontaine - himself a social democrat renegade - sharply criticized the government for what he described as grave budgetary neglect in the areas of education and research : " it 's outrageous that germany is among the poorest performers within oecd countries when it comes to investing in research and education , " lafontaine said .
" this is a situation that the new government seems unwilling to change .
but it has to be changed , if we 're serious about leading the country forward . " despite the attempts by the opposition to tear apart the government 's policy , the actors within the grand coalition do n't have much to fear since they have a comfortable majority of seats in both houses of parliament .
they can only self-destruct by engaging in internal struggles and failing to implement their own agreements . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany borrows heavily to balance 2006 budget germany 's grand coalition government has presented its 2006 budget plan to parliament to seek approval for a rise in spending and the creation of new debt in its efforts to boost the economy .

but while some call for sanctions , others say such measures will punish the wrong people . the eu must firmly condemn the belarus regime for its bloody crackdown on opposition supporters after presidential polls , but should not impose sanctions that hurt the people , polish prime minister kazimierz marcinkiewicz said in riga thursday . " belarus is our neighbor and what happens there touches us directly , " marcinkiewicz told reporters during a one-day visit .
" but economic sanctions or a blockade should not be applied as they would put pressure on the common people , not the ruling elite . " " a massive fraud " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riot police beat protesters in the belarusian capital minsk on saturday eu leaders agreed at a summit last week to widen a list of senior belarusian officials subject to a visa ban and said they were also considering financial sanctions .
poland has already imposed travel restrictions on belarusian officials it accused of falsifying results in the former soviet republic 's presidential election on march 19 in which " europe 's last dictator " won a landslide victory in a poll judged fraudulent by the eu , the u.s. and international observers . german chancellor angela merkel on wednesday denounced the belarus presidential election as marred by " massive fraud " as the lower house of parliament passed a resolution calling for the immediate release of arrested belarusian opposition activists and sanctions against the country by the european union . " this election was subject to massive fraud and somebody has to say so , " merkel told the bundestag . more than 500 arrested the german members of parliament are proposing to invite the main belarusian opposition candidate , alexander milinkevich , to the next meeting of eu foreign ministers in luxembourg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belarus ' opposition leader alexander milinkevich says he will return to belarus and continue to fight milinkevich , who led protests against the re-election of president alexander lukashenko , said he was going to poland thursday to tell the outside world what was going on in his country . " in the polish parliament i intend to say what is really happening in belarus , " alexander milinkevich told reuters .
he added that he had no plans to emigrate even though he faces jail if he returns to belarus in connection with the protests . so far , more than 500 people have been arrested in belarus after a wave of opposition demonstrations resulted in a bloody crackdown by pro-lukashenko security forces .
alexander kozulin , another opposition figure who ran against the president and was detained after the protests , has been charged with hooliganism and faces up to six years in jail . meanwhile , lukashenko postponed his inauguration friday to april with some suggesting that the protests , which drew as many as 10,000 people , had scared him . " maybe the main reason is lukashenko 's psychological mood , " milinkevich told reporters .

" iran 's decision on enrichment , particularly research and development is irreversible , " iranian ambassador to the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- aliasghar soltanieh in vienna told afp .
foreign minister manouchehr mottaki , speaking in geneva , described the un declaration as an " angry precedent " and a " bad move " . iran struck the defiant stance even as foreign ministers of the security council permanent members plus germany met in berlin to chart their next moves in the standoff . the un security council on wednesday unanimously approved a non-binding statement giving iran 30 days to abandon its uranium enrichment activities , ending a weeks-long impasse .

" the nuclear exist is written into law and at the present time i do n't believe that the majority necessary to change this agreement exists in the german bundestag , " glos said in an interview for german daily handelsblatt . health reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : staying healthy has become more expensive in germany the german chancellor reassured parliamentarians that her coalition government would now start working seriously on an overdue reform of the statutory health system .
she said she was confident that the current clash of concepts could be overcome in a constructive manner . at present , merkel 's conservatives are backing a flat monthly premium paid regardless of income , while the social democrats favor a broadening of the funding base by bringing in currently exempt groups of the population and making them pay in line with their earnings . next year the public health care system will have a budget hole between 8 and 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.6 billion to $ 12 billion -rrb- .
germans , who have long enjoyed one of the most beneficial health care systems in europe , will have to steel themselves for difficult changes ahead .
as is , workers and employers split the monthly premiums to health care providers .
about 10 percent of the population has elected out of the state-sponsored public system , preferring costlier , but some say better , private insurance . opposition strikes back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they did n't get enough votes to form a coaltion : merkel and fdp leader westerwelle -lrb- right -rrb- oposition free-market liberal party -lrb- fdp -rrb- chief guido westerwelle accused the government of planning to raise taxes further as of next year despite pre-election promises to the contrary .
he also demanded that the government should finally think hard about introducing a simpler tax system that citizens could relate to . " since you took office , you 've been telling us that this is the sort of tax policy you ca n't do in germany , " westerwelle said .
" you should finally defend your own ideas and convictions instead of pandering to the interests of your social democrat coalition partners . " the floor leader of the opposition left party , oskar lafontaine - himself a social democrat renegade - sharply criticized the government for what he described as grave budgetary neglect in the areas of education and research : " it 's outrageous that germany is among the poorest performers within oecd countries when it comes to investing in research and education , " lafontaine said .
" this is a situation that the new government seems unwilling to change .
but it has to be changed , if we 're serious about leading the country forward . " despite the attempts by the opposition to tear apart the government 's policy , the actors within the grand coalition do n't have much to fear since they have a comfortable majority of seats in both houses of parliament .

" this pipeline is not aimed against anyone but is aimed at ensuring the security of gas supplies to europe , " schröder said . " not only in germany but throughout western europe there is growing need for gas , while domestic production is falling , " he said .
" this project is in the interests of germany .
that is why it will be supported by every german government . " schröder added that he would be paid 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 300,000 -rrb- annually for holding the post . the 61-year old former chancellor is also an advisor to swiss media group ringier and international investment bank rothschild and has made lucrative public-speaking appearances . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life 's a gas : the old friends are reunited in business his acceptance of the job less than a month after he left the chancellor 's office last november prompted widespread criticism in germany .
he and russian president vladimir putin had worked closely on cementing german investment in the pipeline . earlier this month a lawyer acting for schröder said that he had won a temporary injunction against the leader of the liberal free democrats , guido westerwelle , preventing him from linking schröder 's post as chancellor to his involvement in the pipeline . appointment and pipeline project under fire the project has also prompted criticism from new eu members lithuania and poland , which complained that schröder had gone over their heads on a pipeline that is likely to pass through several baltic countries ' territorial waters . other members of the supervisory board include gazprom chief executive alexei miller as well as officials from germany 's e.on and basf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe hopes to keep the russian taps turned on gazprom has a 51.0 percent stake in the north european gas pipeline , while stakes of 24.5 percent are held by e.on and basf . matthias warnig , representative of dresdner bank in russia , was named as the pipeline 's managing director . miller on thursday appeared to give backing to the idea of possible involvement in the project by gaz de france .
" this decision could be taken if the new partner brings something new of strategic importance , " miller said in response to a question from journalists . schröder looking to use german links in new role earlier this week schröder paid a visit to gazprom production facilities in the siberian province of yamalo-nenets . he also confirmed that he plans to create a " german-russian think tank " but denied a russian press report that the body would be a lobbying agency for promoting the russian economy in germany . work on the pipeline has already begun onshore in russia that is planned to extend around 1,200 kilometers -lrb- 750 miles -rrb- under the baltic sea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pipeline managing director matthias warnig the pipeline is eventually expected to connect not only to germany but to other parts of western europe , including the netherlands , sweden and britain and is expected to come on stream in 2010 with an initial capacity of around 27.5 billion cubic meters of natural gas a year .
a second pipeline is expected to double capacity to 55 billion cubic meters annually . the first part of the project will cost two to 2.5 billion euros and the total cost of the offshore section of the project will be over four billion euros , management has said . european union officials have sought to reassure new eu members worried that they could be left without supplies if russia no longer has to ship gas through their territory to western europe .

" iran 's decision on enrichment , particularly research and development is irreversible , " iranian ambassador to the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- aliasghar soltanieh in vienna told afp .
foreign minister manouchehr mottaki , speaking in geneva , described the un declaration as an " angry precedent " and a " bad move " . iran struck the defiant stance even as foreign ministers of the security council permanent members plus germany met in berlin to chart their next moves in the standoff . the un security council on wednesday unanimously approved a non-binding statement giving iran 30 days to abandon its uranium enrichment activities , ending a weeks-long impasse .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian foreign minister mottaki negotiation , not confrontation " this is a strong sign to iran that negotiation not confrontation should be their course , " us secretary of state condoleezza rice said . " it is now up to iran to make a choice ... between isolation brought about by its own actions or a return to the negotiating table , " added german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , the meeting 's host . but cracks appeared between the major powers here over how to act if iran does not comply . the un statement leaves open what consequences might follow if tehran does not halt uranium enrichment , and russia and china insisted that economic sanctions or military action did not belong on the table . un members still apart on sanctions " russia does not believe that sanctions would serve the purpose of settling the various issues , " lavrov said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier : it 's iran 's choice in a clear warning against any the use of force to settle the standoff , chinese deputy foreign minister dai bingguo said that any such move would unleash chaos in the region . " the chinese side feels there has already been enough turmoil in the middle east and we do not want to see more turmoil introduced into the region , " he said . the un talks had been marred by differences between the united states and its western allies on the one hand and russia and china on the other over how to coax tehran away from uranium enrichment , which could be used to build a nuclear bomb . watered-down solution the statement that finally prevailed is a watered-down version of a franco-british statement that calls on iran to meet demands from the un nuclear watchdog , the iaea . it expresses clear concern that iran is trying to acquire nuclear weapons secretly , demands that iran comply with the wishes of the iaea governing board and calls for an iaea report within 30 days . the non-binding un security council declaration was seen as a bid to placate russia and china , which have opposed any hint of punitive measures against iran , an ally and key trading partner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran and president mahmoud ahmadinejad are stubborn in a further concession , the co-sponsors extended the deadline to 30 days from the 14 days they had initially sought . fears of a bomb besides rice , lavrov , steinmeier and dai , the working lunch in berlin brought together foreign secretary jack straw of britain , foreign minister philippe douste-blazy of france and eu foreign policy chief javier solana . washington and european powers believe iran has ambitions of building a nuclear bomb , which they argue would destabilize the entire region . tehran vehemently denies the charge and says its nuclear program is purely peaceful .
it is unclear how the crisis will unfold if iran refuses to buckle before the 30 day deadline is up . mottaki , speaking to the un conference on disarmament in geneva said , iran would formally offer to set up a " regional consortium " to enrich fuel for its nuclear program , implying that it would be set up in iran . dw staff / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world powers meet in berlin to show unity on iran angela merkel will host an emergency meeting of un security council members in berlin on thursday to break the deadlock on a draft resolution regarding iran 's nuclear ambitions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 30.03.2006 german parliament debates reforms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government has a safe majority in the parliament using wednesday 's debate about the chancellery 's budget for 2006 as a peg , german parliamentarians engaged in a general exchange of arguments and opinions about the grand coalition 's policies . german conservative chancellor angela merkel , who has won widespread praise for her appearances in the international arena and on the foreign policy front , started her address to the parliament on wednesday with an optimistic assessment of the country 's role in peace-keeping missions .
she said that reunited germany was now assuming greater responsibility in line with united nations and european union requirements . success on the international scene , however , was not the main topic of the parliamentary debate .
as widespread protests against pay cuts and layoffs continue throughout the country , merkel and her grand coalition government said they were stepping up efforts to find solutions to the pressing social and economic problems . labor reforms the latest unemployment figures for germany , which are published this thursday , are good news for the government : the number of jobless has dropped below the 5 million mark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frustrated by some of his coalition partners : labor minister franz müntefering merkel , however , appeared exasperated after a rift in the grand coalition over labor reforms .
social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- labor minister franz müntefering 's announced he was halting the labor reforms because some members of merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- were taking steps away from the coalition agreement and asking for reforms that would go beyond the agreed-upon measures such as allowing companies to fire workers during the two-year probationary period . " let 's first of all do what we resolved to do , " merkel said .
" we made an agreement on this . " merkel asked everybody to stick to the agreement and revisit the issue of germany 's job protection rules in two years .
but some members of her own party remained impatient . " the section on employment law in the coalition agreement does not go far enough , " said christian wulff , the conservative premier of lower saxony .
" it does not adequately reflect the real need for reform . " the trade unions , on the other hand , are stepping up pressure on spd - traditionally seen as a champion of workers ' rights . " the trade union 's goal is for dismissal protection not to deteriorate , but rather to be maintained , or even improved , " said michael sommer , head of the dgb trade union federation for german daily die welt .
" not everything that is in the coalition agreement must be implemented . " energy reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opposition is not her main problem : german chancellor angela merkel merkel announced that her grand coalition government would introduce a new long-term energy strategy in the second half of next year .
this moves comes as a response to the growing concern about germany 's reliance on russian natural gas and the rekindled debate about the country 's nuclear phase out program . " just because we have a difference of opinion on this one issue does n't mean we can afford to ignore the question of how our energy strategy out to 2020 should look , " merkel said in her speech before the bundestag . one of the most crucial pieces of legislation passed by outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens , in the eyes of many , was a planned phase-out of germany 's atomic energy plants by 2020 . the idea , largely pressed by the environmentally-friendly greens , was to focus on renewable energy and away from a crippling dependence on oil .
it also found support at a time when safety concerns over nuclear power reactors were highlighted with accidents like the one in chernobyl in 1986 .
the social democrats in the current grand coalition government made the nuclear phase-out an important part of the coalition agreement which was signed before the new government took office . german economics minister michael gloss , who raised quite a few eyebrows when he suggested in january that germany should reconsider prolonging the use of nuclear energy , toned down his views . " the nuclear exist is written into law and at the present time i do n't believe that the majority necessary to change this agreement exists in the german bundestag , " glos said in an interview for german daily handelsblatt . health reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : staying healthy has become more expensive in germany the german chancellor reassured parliamentarians that her coalition government would now start working seriously on an overdue reform of the statutory health system .
she said she was confident that the current clash of concepts could be overcome in a constructive manner . at present , merkel 's conservatives are backing a flat monthly premium paid regardless of income , while the social democrats favor a broadening of the funding base by bringing in currently exempt groups of the population and making them pay in line with their earnings . next year the public health care system will have a budget hole between 8 and 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.6 billion to $ 12 billion -rrb- .
germans , who have long enjoyed one of the most beneficial health care systems in europe , will have to steel themselves for difficult changes ahead .

a new recycling system for electronics has been kicked off and manufacturers are getting the bill . you see them in or beside trash dumpsters or just sitting forlornly next to the curb : bulky beige computer monitors or dot-matrix printers , answering machines , refrigerators or that mobile phone that was the hippest must-have last year but is a unloved dinosaur now . they are all part of germany 's growing pile of electronic waste , which , according to the country 's environment ministry , amounts to about 1.8 million tons annually .
the new recycling requirements that require consumers to take their waste electronics to collection centers or have them picked up , is aimed at getting the rushing river of burned out components , shot transformers and obsolete electronic gadgets under control . " no type of trash has grown so rapidly recently as electronic waste , which has tripled in just a few years , " said eva leonhardt , waste expert at the environmental group deutsche umwelthilfe , which has set up a hotline to help people out with the new recycling rules .
" twenty years ago , the development cycle for electronics was around four years , now it 's three months .
that has led to an enormous increase in the amount of electronic trash . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : full of hazardous materials while beige computer boxes and refrigerators left on city sidewalks are unsightly , they can also be dangerous .
circuit boards , batteries and crts can contain hazardous materials such as lead and mercury while televisions usually also contain lead .
brominated flame retardants are commonly added to plastics used in electronics .
all these toxins can be released into the environment through incinerator ash or leach into the soil at landfills . " there are also recyclable waste in these products , like copper , aluminum , steel and sometimes even precious metals , " said leonhardt .
" to not use these materials again is almost criminal . " do n't just toss it on friday , germany 's " act governing the sale , return and environmentally sound disposal of electrical and electronic equipment " went into force .
the rules , better know as the electronic equipment law , require manufacturers to cover the cost of collecting and recycling consumer electronics and appliances .
they are designed to conform to an eu directive on electronic waste passed in 2004 . consumers are now asked to take their old electronic equipment and appliances to central collection areas , where special containers have been set up to receive them .
if consumers continue to throw their electronic waste in the normal trash , they can be fined . after that , it 's up to manufacturers to take care of things , since the law requires them to pick up the cost of recycling their products no longer in use .
companies who put any of 10 categories of electronic equipment on the german market have had to register with a central clearing house , called ear , which coordinates the collection . that does not mean that , for example , siemens sends out collection trucks to pick up its own discarded mobile phones and other equipment in the 1,500 collection areas around the country .
rather , in a complicated process , ear calculates the quantities of old electronics that each registered producer is required to collect from waste management authorities based on the amount the company puts on the market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dumpsters like this are off-limits for electronics companies can then contract with private recycling firms or other groups to disassemble the electronic waste , or do it themselves .
they then must dispose of the toxic materials in environmentally sound ways , and can either re-use recyclable materials , or sell them abroad , as is often the case , since more and more electronics manufacturing is being done in asia . " no , you ca n't really say we were supporters of these regulations , since it is going to cost manufacturers between 300 and 500 million euros -lrb- $ 360 - $ 600 -rrb- a year , " said otmar frey of the german electrical and electronic manufacturers ' association , even though his group decided to take a role in helping german lawmakers write up rules for implementing the eu directive . " we decided it would be better not to wait until others came up with rules that we would have a hard time living with , " he said .
the association did not want a repeat of the fiasco that followed the introduction of a deposit system on beverage cans and bottles , which many experts say was poorly thought through . in fact , according to frey and others , the electronics recycling system , although operational for less than a week , is running smoothly so far . higher costs in the store ? while environmental groups are cheering the new rules , trade associations say consumers will likely pay a price , although they are not being directly charged for the new plan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these could get more expensive because of the new rules according to germany 's leading retail association hde , producers will pass along the new recycling costs to consumers eventually .
the disposal of a washing machine costs around eight euros -lrb- $ 9.60 -rrb- , a refrigerator 15 euros -lrb- $ 18 -rrb- , and a television set around 10 euros -lrb- $ 12 -rrb- .
those amounts could soon be incorporated into the price tag . slow going around europe the eu electronic waste directive was supposed to have been implemented by member states by august 2005 , but most countries missed that deadline , including germany . while austria did get a registration and collection system online on schedule , it had not yet figured out what do with the old electronics once they had been turned in .
for months , collection centers were full of growing piles of plastic , glass and circuitry . # b # holland , belgium and sweden have systems in place , as do the swiss , although they are not part of the eu .
some countries are halfway there , such as hungary , although others , such as france , italy and the uk , have done little or nothing to turn the eu guidelines into national law .
the uk does not anticipate having a national system in place until 2007 . " several of these countries are facing proceedings because they are in breach of eu rules , " said frey . several of those countries with electronics recycling programs have organized them differently .
while germany separates its electronics according to functional category , austria does it by size , and hungary by tax number .
that will make any kind of cross-border cooperation more difficult , especially for manufacturers active internationally , said waste expert leonhardt .

a new recycling system for electronics has been kicked off and manufacturers are getting the bill . you see them in or beside trash dumpsters or just sitting forlornly next to the curb : bulky beige computer monitors or dot-matrix printers , answering machines , refrigerators or that mobile phone that was the hippest must-have last year but is a unloved dinosaur now . they are all part of germany 's growing pile of electronic waste , which , according to the country 's environment ministry , amounts to about 1.8 million tons annually .
the new recycling requirements that require consumers to take their waste electronics to collection centers or have them picked up , is aimed at getting the rushing river of burned out components , shot transformers and obsolete electronic gadgets under control . " no type of trash has grown so rapidly recently as electronic waste , which has tripled in just a few years , " said eva leonhardt , waste expert at the environmental group deutsche umwelthilfe , which has set up a hotline to help people out with the new recycling rules .
" twenty years ago , the development cycle for electronics was around four years , now it 's three months .
that has led to an enormous increase in the amount of electronic trash . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : full of hazardous materials while beige computer boxes and refrigerators left on city sidewalks are unsightly , they can also be dangerous .
circuit boards , batteries and crts can contain hazardous materials such as lead and mercury while televisions usually also contain lead .
brominated flame retardants are commonly added to plastics used in electronics .
all these toxins can be released into the environment through incinerator ash or leach into the soil at landfills . " there are also recyclable waste in these products , like copper , aluminum , steel and sometimes even precious metals , " said leonhardt .
" to not use these materials again is almost criminal . " do n't just toss it on friday , germany 's " act governing the sale , return and environmentally sound disposal of electrical and electronic equipment " went into force .
the rules , better know as the electronic equipment law , require manufacturers to cover the cost of collecting and recycling consumer electronics and appliances .
they are designed to conform to an eu directive on electronic waste passed in 2004 . consumers are now asked to take their old electronic equipment and appliances to central collection areas , where special containers have been set up to receive them .
if consumers continue to throw their electronic waste in the normal trash , they can be fined . after that , it 's up to manufacturers to take care of things , since the law requires them to pick up the cost of recycling their products no longer in use .
companies who put any of 10 categories of electronic equipment on the german market have had to register with a central clearing house , called ear , which coordinates the collection . that does not mean that , for example , siemens sends out collection trucks to pick up its own discarded mobile phones and other equipment in the 1,500 collection areas around the country .
rather , in a complicated process , ear calculates the quantities of old electronics that each registered producer is required to collect from waste management authorities based on the amount the company puts on the market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dumpsters like this are off-limits for electronics companies can then contract with private recycling firms or other groups to disassemble the electronic waste , or do it themselves .
they then must dispose of the toxic materials in environmentally sound ways , and can either re-use recyclable materials , or sell them abroad , as is often the case , since more and more electronics manufacturing is being done in asia . " no , you ca n't really say we were supporters of these regulations , since it is going to cost manufacturers between 300 and 500 million euros -lrb- $ 360 - $ 600 -rrb- a year , " said otmar frey of the german electrical and electronic manufacturers ' association , even though his group decided to take a role in helping german lawmakers write up rules for implementing the eu directive . " we decided it would be better not to wait until others came up with rules that we would have a hard time living with , " he said .

a new recycling system for electronics has been kicked off and manufacturers are getting the bill . you see them in or beside trash dumpsters or just sitting forlornly next to the curb : bulky beige computer monitors or dot-matrix printers , answering machines , refrigerators or that mobile phone that was the hippest must-have last year but is a unloved dinosaur now . they are all part of germany 's growing pile of electronic waste , which , according to the country 's environment ministry , amounts to about 1.8 million tons annually .
the new recycling requirements that require consumers to take their waste electronics to collection centers or have them picked up , is aimed at getting the rushing river of burned out components , shot transformers and obsolete electronic gadgets under control . " no type of trash has grown so rapidly recently as electronic waste , which has tripled in just a few years , " said eva leonhardt , waste expert at the environmental group deutsche umwelthilfe , which has set up a hotline to help people out with the new recycling rules .
" twenty years ago , the development cycle for electronics was around four years , now it 's three months .
that has led to an enormous increase in the amount of electronic trash . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : full of hazardous materials while beige computer boxes and refrigerators left on city sidewalks are unsightly , they can also be dangerous .
circuit boards , batteries and crts can contain hazardous materials such as lead and mercury while televisions usually also contain lead .
brominated flame retardants are commonly added to plastics used in electronics .
all these toxins can be released into the environment through incinerator ash or leach into the soil at landfills . " there are also recyclable waste in these products , like copper , aluminum , steel and sometimes even precious metals , " said leonhardt .
" to not use these materials again is almost criminal . " do n't just toss it on friday , germany 's " act governing the sale , return and environmentally sound disposal of electrical and electronic equipment " went into force .
the rules , better know as the electronic equipment law , require manufacturers to cover the cost of collecting and recycling consumer electronics and appliances .
they are designed to conform to an eu directive on electronic waste passed in 2004 . consumers are now asked to take their old electronic equipment and appliances to central collection areas , where special containers have been set up to receive them .
if consumers continue to throw their electronic waste in the normal trash , they can be fined . after that , it 's up to manufacturers to take care of things , since the law requires them to pick up the cost of recycling their products no longer in use .
companies who put any of 10 categories of electronic equipment on the german market have had to register with a central clearing house , called ear , which coordinates the collection . that does not mean that , for example , siemens sends out collection trucks to pick up its own discarded mobile phones and other equipment in the 1,500 collection areas around the country .
rather , in a complicated process , ear calculates the quantities of old electronics that each registered producer is required to collect from waste management authorities based on the amount the company puts on the market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dumpsters like this are off-limits for electronics companies can then contract with private recycling firms or other groups to disassemble the electronic waste , or do it themselves .
they then must dispose of the toxic materials in environmentally sound ways , and can either re-use recyclable materials , or sell them abroad , as is often the case , since more and more electronics manufacturing is being done in asia . " no , you ca n't really say we were supporters of these regulations , since it is going to cost manufacturers between 300 and 500 million euros -lrb- $ 360 - $ 600 -rrb- a year , " said otmar frey of the german electrical and electronic manufacturers ' association , even though his group decided to take a role in helping german lawmakers write up rules for implementing the eu directive . " we decided it would be better not to wait until others came up with rules that we would have a hard time living with , " he said .
the association did not want a repeat of the fiasco that followed the introduction of a deposit system on beverage cans and bottles , which many experts say was poorly thought through . in fact , according to frey and others , the electronics recycling system , although operational for less than a week , is running smoothly so far . higher costs in the store ? while environmental groups are cheering the new rules , trade associations say consumers will likely pay a price , although they are not being directly charged for the new plan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these could get more expensive because of the new rules according to germany 's leading retail association hde , producers will pass along the new recycling costs to consumers eventually .
the disposal of a washing machine costs around eight euros -lrb- $ 9.60 -rrb- , a refrigerator 15 euros -lrb- $ 18 -rrb- , and a television set around 10 euros -lrb- $ 12 -rrb- .
those amounts could soon be incorporated into the price tag . slow going around europe the eu electronic waste directive was supposed to have been implemented by member states by august 2005 , but most countries missed that deadline , including germany . while austria did get a registration and collection system online on schedule , it had not yet figured out what do with the old electronics once they had been turned in .
for months , collection centers were full of growing piles of plastic , glass and circuitry . # b # holland , belgium and sweden have systems in place , as do the swiss , although they are not part of the eu .
some countries are halfway there , such as hungary , although others , such as france , italy and the uk , have done little or nothing to turn the eu guidelines into national law .
the uk does not anticipate having a national system in place until 2007 . " several of these countries are facing proceedings because they are in breach of eu rules , " said frey . several of those countries with electronics recycling programs have organized them differently .
while germany separates its electronics according to functional category , austria does it by size , and hungary by tax number .
that will make any kind of cross-border cooperation more difficult , especially for manufacturers active internationally , said waste expert leonhardt . " there will be a surprise waiting for electronics producers in every eu country , " she said . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de car sharing picks up speed once the domain of the decidedly “ green ” crowd , the concept of car sharing is finding more fans in the mainstream .

answer : the fifa world cup .
you can say it ... but you ca n't wear it .
not without a license anyway . nearly every company in germany wants to make money on the upcoming world cup in june .
but not everyone is allowed to advertise with the logo .
fifa , world soccer 's governing body , has laid down strict criteria for world cup 2006 slogans and advertising . while soccer fans are gearing up for the world cup , the biggest event the sport has to offer , others are dreaming about how to make big bucks from it . but far from being a free-for-all cash cow which benefits everyone , the soccer powers-that-be have stipulated that only official fifa sponsors are allowed to sell their goods using the world cup 2006 tag which puts some traders on the wrong side of the tournament organizers and potentially on the wrong side of the law . the official sponsors , companies like automaker hyundai and sports equipment giant adidas amongst others , are the only ones allowed to use certain trademarks copyrighted by fifa .
and they have certainly paid for the privilege . these " official " companies have paid around 45 million euros each for exclusive permission to use the world cup for advertising purposes .
in addition , there are the national sponsors like german railways , postbank and others who have each paid 13 million euros for the rights , but may only use the world cup logo for their advertising within germany . fifa believes that the high price for getting on the exclusive list is worth it and that those who intend to use the trademarks without acquiring these rights should be punished .
fifa spokesman andreas herren says it is only what official sponsors would expect .
" companies who have acquired these rights of course deserve to be protected against this so-called ‘ ambush marketing ’ by free-riders . " those who unofficially use the world cup to make money face tough consequences .
during the 2002 world cup in japan / korea , for instance , fifa tracked down nearly 2,000 cases of fraud in 88 different countries .
over three million products were confiscated . official brand names a particularly prickly subject bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : official fifa products carry licensed logos and authenticity tags fifa gets particularly picky with the brand names " 2006 fifa world cup germany " and " world cup 2006 . "
those slogans enjoy special trademark protection .
those who abuse the trademark rights face punishment , says trademark lawyer martin chakraborty . " if someone uses the trademark illegally , say , to print it on t-shirts or baseballs caps to be sold outside the stadiums , then he will face a restraining order and could have to pay damages to fifa , " he says . visitors who buy and wear the unlicensed products could be forced by personnel to remove them at the stadiums .
however , not only would that mean potentially thousands of semi-naked fans teeming through the turnstiles ; it would also infringe on personal rights and freedom of action . spectators would have to stand up to the personnel and insist on their right to wear what they want which could lead to confrontation fifa and the german organizers are eager to avoid . high street traders unaware of potential fifa wrath while fifa expects businesses across germany to adhere to its strong-arm trademark policies , it seems that its message has not spread far enough to reach those who may be affected by it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knock-off merchandise can get traders into trouble in the cologne suburb of vingst , a number of traders were still blissfully unaware that selling unlicensed world cup products featuring seemingly innocuous slogans such as " world cup 2006 " could land them in hot water with the global soccer body . " i know these baseball caps are not licensed but i 'm not selling them as such , " said achim b. , the proprietor of a discount store selling a range of soccer related products .
" i 'm not trying to con anyone .
if they want to pay an extra 20 euros for the real thing , that ’ s up to them . " when informed that even the slogan " world cup 06 " could contravene fifa trademark rules , achim replied , " what else are we going to call it ?
soccer world championships 2006 ?
no one will know what that is ?
it 's the world cup .
anyway , i 'd never be able to fit that on a cap . " " crazy " fifa going too far , say shop owners " it 's just stupid , " said another trader who wished to remain anonymous .
" what will they do next ?
stop us from selling footballs because they have something to do with the world cup ?
we 'd have to call them ' balls to be kicked by the feet ' .
people would think i was crazy - just like fifa . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : champ 06 unofficial merchandise many companies have gotten around the strict trademark rules by marketing their products under world cup related headings without actually using the protected brand names .
however , the products lack a certain credibility without the world cup in the title and are perceived as cheap as a result . businesses are not alone in suffering under fifa 's control-freakery .
local authorities have also found that organizing small scale world cup related events under certain trademarked slogans could incur fifa 's wrath . katja hartmann , the events director with the phoenix sports club near ostheim , was forced to rename her world cup opening day festivities in line with fifa rules . local opening gala forced to change its name " we intended to hold our gala on june 9 under the title ' world cup festival 2006 ' but after applying for the necessary licenses we were advised by lawyers that the name could infringe on fifa trademarks .
unless we were willing to pay lots of money to use it , we had to change the name or go ahead and face the consequences . " " it was not such a big deal to change it but we felt pressured .
people should be allowed to celebrate the fact the world cup is in germany and call it just that .
the world cup is about the people but it seems that they are being pushed out of the picture in favor of money-making and marketing , " she added .
" our ' cup fest 06 ' will go ahead but it has lost its shine a bit .

failure means 2 million euros in daily fines . facing the threat of daily fines , microsoft tried to convince eu anti-trust regulators thursday that the us software giant is meeting their demands to comply with a landmark 2004 competition ruling . even before the start of a two-day closed-door hearing , microsoft came out fighting , saying that new fines would not resolve the long-standing competition row . " in our view , a fine is not the answer , " said microsoft 's top lawyer , brad smith , as he arrived for the hearing with the european commission . in response , commission spokesman for competition issues jonathan todd said that the commission had little choice but to brandish the threat of fines .

failure means 2 million euros in daily fines . facing the threat of daily fines , microsoft tried to convince eu anti-trust regulators thursday that the us software giant is meeting their demands to comply with a landmark 2004 competition ruling . even before the start of a two-day closed-door hearing , microsoft came out fighting , saying that new fines would not resolve the long-standing competition row . " in our view , a fine is not the answer , " said microsoft 's top lawyer , brad smith , as he arrived for the hearing with the european commission . in response , commission spokesman for competition issues jonathan todd said that the commission had little choice but to brandish the threat of fines .

answer : the fifa world cup .
you can say it ... but you ca n't wear it .
not without a license anyway . nearly every company in germany wants to make money on the upcoming world cup in june .
but not everyone is allowed to advertise with the logo .
fifa , world soccer 's governing body , has laid down strict criteria for world cup 2006 slogans and advertising . while soccer fans are gearing up for the world cup , the biggest event the sport has to offer , others are dreaming about how to make big bucks from it . but far from being a free-for-all cash cow which benefits everyone , the soccer powers-that-be have stipulated that only official fifa sponsors are allowed to sell their goods using the world cup 2006 tag which puts some traders on the wrong side of the tournament organizers and potentially on the wrong side of the law . the official sponsors , companies like automaker hyundai and sports equipment giant adidas amongst others , are the only ones allowed to use certain trademarks copyrighted by fifa .
and they have certainly paid for the privilege . these " official " companies have paid around 45 million euros each for exclusive permission to use the world cup for advertising purposes .
in addition , there are the national sponsors like german railways , postbank and others who have each paid 13 million euros for the rights , but may only use the world cup logo for their advertising within germany . fifa believes that the high price for getting on the exclusive list is worth it and that those who intend to use the trademarks without acquiring these rights should be punished .
fifa spokesman andreas herren says it is only what official sponsors would expect .
" companies who have acquired these rights of course deserve to be protected against this so-called ‘ ambush marketing ’ by free-riders . " those who unofficially use the world cup to make money face tough consequences .
during the 2002 world cup in japan / korea , for instance , fifa tracked down nearly 2,000 cases of fraud in 88 different countries .
over three million products were confiscated . official brand names a particularly prickly subject bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : official fifa products carry licensed logos and authenticity tags fifa gets particularly picky with the brand names " 2006 fifa world cup germany " and " world cup 2006 . "
those slogans enjoy special trademark protection .
those who abuse the trademark rights face punishment , says trademark lawyer martin chakraborty . " if someone uses the trademark illegally , say , to print it on t-shirts or baseballs caps to be sold outside the stadiums , then he will face a restraining order and could have to pay damages to fifa , " he says . visitors who buy and wear the unlicensed products could be forced by personnel to remove them at the stadiums .
however , not only would that mean potentially thousands of semi-naked fans teeming through the turnstiles ; it would also infringe on personal rights and freedom of action . spectators would have to stand up to the personnel and insist on their right to wear what they want which could lead to confrontation fifa and the german organizers are eager to avoid . high street traders unaware of potential fifa wrath while fifa expects businesses across germany to adhere to its strong-arm trademark policies , it seems that its message has not spread far enough to reach those who may be affected by it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knock-off merchandise can get traders into trouble in the cologne suburb of vingst , a number of traders were still blissfully unaware that selling unlicensed world cup products featuring seemingly innocuous slogans such as " world cup 2006 " could land them in hot water with the global soccer body . " i know these baseball caps are not licensed but i 'm not selling them as such , " said achim b. , the proprietor of a discount store selling a range of soccer related products .
" i 'm not trying to con anyone .
if they want to pay an extra 20 euros for the real thing , that ’ s up to them . " when informed that even the slogan " world cup 06 " could contravene fifa trademark rules , achim replied , " what else are we going to call it ?
soccer world championships 2006 ?
no one will know what that is ?
it 's the world cup .
anyway , i 'd never be able to fit that on a cap . " " crazy " fifa going too far , say shop owners " it 's just stupid , " said another trader who wished to remain anonymous .
" what will they do next ?
stop us from selling footballs because they have something to do with the world cup ?
we 'd have to call them ' balls to be kicked by the feet ' .
people would think i was crazy - just like fifa . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : champ 06 unofficial merchandise many companies have gotten around the strict trademark rules by marketing their products under world cup related headings without actually using the protected brand names .
however , the products lack a certain credibility without the world cup in the title and are perceived as cheap as a result . businesses are not alone in suffering under fifa 's control-freakery .
local authorities have also found that organizing small scale world cup related events under certain trademarked slogans could incur fifa 's wrath . katja hartmann , the events director with the phoenix sports club near ostheim , was forced to rename her world cup opening day festivities in line with fifa rules . local opening gala forced to change its name " we intended to hold our gala on june 9 under the title ' world cup festival 2006 ' but after applying for the necessary licenses we were advised by lawyers that the name could infringe on fifa trademarks .
unless we were willing to pay lots of money to use it , we had to change the name or go ahead and face the consequences . " " it was not such a big deal to change it but we felt pressured .
people should be allowed to celebrate the fact the world cup is in germany and call it just that .
the world cup is about the people but it seems that they are being pushed out of the picture in favor of money-making and marketing , " she added .
" our ' cup fest 06 ' will go ahead but it has lost its shine a bit .

fifa , world soccer 's governing body , has laid down strict criteria for world cup 2006 slogans and advertising . while soccer fans are gearing up for the world cup , the biggest event the sport has to offer , others are dreaming about how to make big bucks from it . but far from being a free-for-all cash cow which benefits everyone , the soccer powers-that-be have stipulated that only official fifa sponsors are allowed to sell their goods using the world cup 2006 tag which puts some traders on the wrong side of the tournament organizers and potentially on the wrong side of the law . the official sponsors , companies like automaker hyundai and sports equipment giant adidas amongst others , are the only ones allowed to use certain trademarks copyrighted by fifa .
and they have certainly paid for the privilege . these " official " companies have paid around 45 million euros each for exclusive permission to use the world cup for advertising purposes .
in addition , there are the national sponsors like german railways , postbank and others who have each paid 13 million euros for the rights , but may only use the world cup logo for their advertising within germany . fifa believes that the high price for getting on the exclusive list is worth it and that those who intend to use the trademarks without acquiring these rights should be punished .
fifa spokesman andreas herren says it is only what official sponsors would expect .
" companies who have acquired these rights of course deserve to be protected against this so-called ‘ ambush marketing ’ by free-riders . " those who unofficially use the world cup to make money face tough consequences .
during the 2002 world cup in japan / korea , for instance , fifa tracked down nearly 2,000 cases of fraud in 88 different countries .
over three million products were confiscated . official brand names a particularly prickly subject bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : official fifa products carry licensed logos and authenticity tags fifa gets particularly picky with the brand names " 2006 fifa world cup germany " and " world cup 2006 . "
those slogans enjoy special trademark protection .
those who abuse the trademark rights face punishment , says trademark lawyer martin chakraborty . " if someone uses the trademark illegally , say , to print it on t-shirts or baseballs caps to be sold outside the stadiums , then he will face a restraining order and could have to pay damages to fifa , " he says . visitors who buy and wear the unlicensed products could be forced by personnel to remove them at the stadiums .
however , not only would that mean potentially thousands of semi-naked fans teeming through the turnstiles ; it would also infringe on personal rights and freedom of action . spectators would have to stand up to the personnel and insist on their right to wear what they want which could lead to confrontation fifa and the german organizers are eager to avoid . high street traders unaware of potential fifa wrath while fifa expects businesses across germany to adhere to its strong-arm trademark policies , it seems that its message has not spread far enough to reach those who may be affected by it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knock-off merchandise can get traders into trouble in the cologne suburb of vingst , a number of traders were still blissfully unaware that selling unlicensed world cup products featuring seemingly innocuous slogans such as " world cup 2006 " could land them in hot water with the global soccer body .

" what will they do next ?

answer : the fifa world cup .
you can say it ... but you ca n't wear it .
not without a license anyway . nearly every company in germany wants to make money on the upcoming world cup in june .
but not everyone is allowed to advertise with the logo .
fifa , world soccer 's governing body , has laid down strict criteria for world cup 2006 slogans and advertising . while soccer fans are gearing up for the world cup , the biggest event the sport has to offer , others are dreaming about how to make big bucks from it . but far from being a free-for-all cash cow which benefits everyone , the soccer powers-that-be have stipulated that only official fifa sponsors are allowed to sell their goods using the world cup 2006 tag which puts some traders on the wrong side of the tournament organizers and potentially on the wrong side of the law . the official sponsors , companies like automaker hyundai and sports equipment giant adidas amongst others , are the only ones allowed to use certain trademarks copyrighted by fifa .
and they have certainly paid for the privilege . these " official " companies have paid around 45 million euros each for exclusive permission to use the world cup for advertising purposes .
in addition , there are the national sponsors like german railways , postbank and others who have each paid 13 million euros for the rights , but may only use the world cup logo for their advertising within germany . fifa believes that the high price for getting on the exclusive list is worth it and that those who intend to use the trademarks without acquiring these rights should be punished .
fifa spokesman andreas herren says it is only what official sponsors would expect .
" companies who have acquired these rights of course deserve to be protected against this so-called ‘ ambush marketing ’ by free-riders . " those who unofficially use the world cup to make money face tough consequences .
during the 2002 world cup in japan / korea , for instance , fifa tracked down nearly 2,000 cases of fraud in 88 different countries .
over three million products were confiscated . official brand names a particularly prickly subject bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : official fifa products carry licensed logos and authenticity tags fifa gets particularly picky with the brand names " 2006 fifa world cup germany " and " world cup 2006 . "
those slogans enjoy special trademark protection .
those who abuse the trademark rights face punishment , says trademark lawyer martin chakraborty . " if someone uses the trademark illegally , say , to print it on t-shirts or baseballs caps to be sold outside the stadiums , then he will face a restraining order and could have to pay damages to fifa , " he says . visitors who buy and wear the unlicensed products could be forced by personnel to remove them at the stadiums .
however , not only would that mean potentially thousands of semi-naked fans teeming through the turnstiles ; it would also infringe on personal rights and freedom of action . spectators would have to stand up to the personnel and insist on their right to wear what they want which could lead to confrontation fifa and the german organizers are eager to avoid . high street traders unaware of potential fifa wrath while fifa expects businesses across germany to adhere to its strong-arm trademark policies , it seems that its message has not spread far enough to reach those who may be affected by it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knock-off merchandise can get traders into trouble in the cologne suburb of vingst , a number of traders were still blissfully unaware that selling unlicensed world cup products featuring seemingly innocuous slogans such as " world cup 2006 " could land them in hot water with the global soccer body . " i know these baseball caps are not licensed but i 'm not selling them as such , " said achim b. , the proprietor of a discount store selling a range of soccer related products .
" i 'm not trying to con anyone .
if they want to pay an extra 20 euros for the real thing , that ’ s up to them . " when informed that even the slogan " world cup 06 " could contravene fifa trademark rules , achim replied , " what else are we going to call it ?
soccer world championships 2006 ?
no one will know what that is ?
it 's the world cup .
anyway , i 'd never be able to fit that on a cap . " " crazy " fifa going too far , say shop owners " it 's just stupid , " said another trader who wished to remain anonymous .
" what will they do next ?
stop us from selling footballs because they have something to do with the world cup ?
we 'd have to call them ' balls to be kicked by the feet ' .
people would think i was crazy - just like fifa .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 30.03.2006 germany starts chipping away at mountain of electronic junk großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a jumble of electronic junk at a berlin recycling center as of friday , germans could no longer just throw their old phones , computers or coffee makers in the trashcan out back .
a new recycling system for electronics has been kicked off and manufacturers are getting the bill . you see them in or beside trash dumpsters or just sitting forlornly next to the curb : bulky beige computer monitors or dot-matrix printers , answering machines , refrigerators or that mobile phone that was the hippest must-have last year but is a unloved dinosaur now . they are all part of germany 's growing pile of electronic waste , which , according to the country 's environment ministry , amounts to about 1.8 million tons annually .
the new recycling requirements that require consumers to take their waste electronics to collection centers or have them picked up , is aimed at getting the rushing river of burned out components , shot transformers and obsolete electronic gadgets under control . " no type of trash has grown so rapidly recently as electronic waste , which has tripled in just a few years , " said eva leonhardt , waste expert at the environmental group deutsche umwelthilfe , which has set up a hotline to help people out with the new recycling rules .
" twenty years ago , the development cycle for electronics was around four years , now it 's three months .
that has led to an enormous increase in the amount of electronic trash . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : full of hazardous materials while beige computer boxes and refrigerators left on city sidewalks are unsightly , they can also be dangerous .
circuit boards , batteries and crts can contain hazardous materials such as lead and mercury while televisions usually also contain lead .
brominated flame retardants are commonly added to plastics used in electronics .
all these toxins can be released into the environment through incinerator ash or leach into the soil at landfills . " there are also recyclable waste in these products , like copper , aluminum , steel and sometimes even precious metals , " said leonhardt .
" to not use these materials again is almost criminal . " do n't just toss it on friday , germany 's " act governing the sale , return and environmentally sound disposal of electrical and electronic equipment " went into force .
the rules , better know as the electronic equipment law , require manufacturers to cover the cost of collecting and recycling consumer electronics and appliances .
they are designed to conform to an eu directive on electronic waste passed in 2004 . consumers are now asked to take their old electronic equipment and appliances to central collection areas , where special containers have been set up to receive them .
if consumers continue to throw their electronic waste in the normal trash , they can be fined . after that , it 's up to manufacturers to take care of things , since the law requires them to pick up the cost of recycling their products no longer in use .
companies who put any of 10 categories of electronic equipment on the german market have had to register with a central clearing house , called ear , which coordinates the collection . that does not mean that , for example , siemens sends out collection trucks to pick up its own discarded mobile phones and other equipment in the 1,500 collection areas around the country .
rather , in a complicated process , ear calculates the quantities of old electronics that each registered producer is required to collect from waste management authorities based on the amount the company puts on the market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dumpsters like this are off-limits for electronics companies can then contract with private recycling firms or other groups to disassemble the electronic waste , or do it themselves .
they then must dispose of the toxic materials in environmentally sound ways , and can either re-use recyclable materials , or sell them abroad , as is often the case , since more and more electronics manufacturing is being done in asia . " no , you ca n't really say we were supporters of these regulations , since it is going to cost manufacturers between 300 and 500 million euros -lrb- $ 360 - $ 600 -rrb- a year , " said otmar frey of the german electrical and electronic manufacturers ' association , even though his group decided to take a role in helping german lawmakers write up rules for implementing the eu directive . " we decided it would be better not to wait until others came up with rules that we would have a hard time living with , " he said .
the association did not want a repeat of the fiasco that followed the introduction of a deposit system on beverage cans and bottles , which many experts say was poorly thought through . in fact , according to frey and others , the electronics recycling system , although operational for less than a week , is running smoothly so far . higher costs in the store ? while environmental groups are cheering the new rules , trade associations say consumers will likely pay a price , although they are not being directly charged for the new plan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these could get more expensive because of the new rules according to germany 's leading retail association hde , producers will pass along the new recycling costs to consumers eventually .
the disposal of a washing machine costs around eight euros -lrb- $ 9.60 -rrb- , a refrigerator 15 euros -lrb- $ 18 -rrb- , and a television set around 10 euros -lrb- $ 12 -rrb- .
those amounts could soon be incorporated into the price tag . slow going around europe the eu electronic waste directive was supposed to have been implemented by member states by august 2005 , but most countries missed that deadline , including germany . while austria did get a registration and collection system online on schedule , it had not yet figured out what do with the old electronics once they had been turned in .
for months , collection centers were full of growing piles of plastic , glass and circuitry . # b # holland , belgium and sweden have systems in place , as do the swiss , although they are not part of the eu .
some countries are halfway there , such as hungary , although others , such as france , italy and the uk , have done little or nothing to turn the eu guidelines into national law .
the uk does not anticipate having a national system in place until 2007 . " several of these countries are facing proceedings because they are in breach of eu rules , " said frey . several of those countries with electronics recycling programs have organized them differently .
while germany separates its electronics according to functional category , austria does it by size , and hungary by tax number .
that will make any kind of cross-border cooperation more difficult , especially for manufacturers active internationally , said waste expert leonhardt .

and business leaders , security experts and law enforcement gathering thursday and friday in london aim to change that . it has been quite a year for e-crime , say experts .
trojan horses have constantly bombarded banks and others in the financial sector .
phishing and identity theft attempts have risen to number about 8 million per day , according to security officials .
e-scams are costing businesses billions and that does n't include increasing funds - about 20 to 50 percent of total expenditures in the us and uk - to beef up security .
and it is only getting worse .
as a result , law enforcement , business and computer specialists have come together for the annual e-crime congress in london thursday and friday to find new methods to fight such cyber predators .
an illustrious group because it is such a growing problem internationally , the conference is attracting bigger names and from further afield , too .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : microsoft 's brad smith offered a reward of $ 5 million to those who help catch cyber criminals attendees include about 500 officials from governments , companies as amazon , ebay , skype and yahoo , bankers from scandinavia , the uk and the middle east and law enforcement such as the fbi , scotland yard and those from the china .
" the 2005 e-crime congress provided an excellent forum for us to interact with law enforcement agencies , security product vendors and others in the financial services industry to discuss the wider issues that affect us , " one british bank security official as quoted on the congress ' website .
e-crime remains a low priority e-crime , like white-collar crime , is low on the list of law enforcement priorities , experts say .
instead , police and intelligence agencies worldwide are busy grappling with violent crimes and terrorism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internet cafes in countries with few cyber or extradition laws are often used by cyber gangs in most countries , police officials are overworked and lack manpower and often expertise to investigate e-crime .
few prosecutors take on such cases and laws often lack teeth , experts say .
that lessens the already low deterrant power of law enforcement against cyber criminals , who already have very low odds of getting caught , especially if they are outside the us or europe .

" this pipeline is not aimed against anyone but is aimed at ensuring the security of gas supplies to europe , " schröder said . " not only in germany but throughout western europe there is growing need for gas , while domestic production is falling , " he said .
" this project is in the interests of germany .
that is why it will be supported by every german government . " schröder added that he would be paid 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 300,000 -rrb- annually for holding the post . the 61-year old former chancellor is also an advisor to swiss media group ringier and international investment bank rothschild and has made lucrative public-speaking appearances . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life 's a gas : the old friends are reunited in business his acceptance of the job less than a month after he left the chancellor 's office last november prompted widespread criticism in germany .
he and russian president vladimir putin had worked closely on cementing german investment in the pipeline . earlier this month a lawyer acting for schröder said that he had won a temporary injunction against the leader of the liberal free democrats , guido westerwelle , preventing him from linking schröder 's post as chancellor to his involvement in the pipeline . appointment and pipeline project under fire the project has also prompted criticism from new eu members lithuania and poland , which complained that schröder had gone over their heads on a pipeline that is likely to pass through several baltic countries ' territorial waters . other members of the supervisory board include gazprom chief executive alexei miller as well as officials from germany 's e.on and basf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe hopes to keep the russian taps turned on gazprom has a 51.0 percent stake in the north european gas pipeline , while stakes of 24.5 percent are held by e.on and basf . matthias warnig , representative of dresdner bank in russia , was named as the pipeline 's managing director . miller on thursday appeared to give backing to the idea of possible involvement in the project by gaz de france .
" this decision could be taken if the new partner brings something new of strategic importance , " miller said in response to a question from journalists . schröder looking to use german links in new role earlier this week schröder paid a visit to gazprom production facilities in the siberian province of yamalo-nenets . he also confirmed that he plans to create a " german-russian think tank " but denied a russian press report that the body would be a lobbying agency for promoting the russian economy in germany . work on the pipeline has already begun onshore in russia that is planned to extend around 1,200 kilometers -lrb- 750 miles -rrb- under the baltic sea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pipeline managing director matthias warnig the pipeline is eventually expected to connect not only to germany but to other parts of western europe , including the netherlands , sweden and britain and is expected to come on stream in 2010 with an initial capacity of around 27.5 billion cubic meters of natural gas a year .
a second pipeline is expected to double capacity to 55 billion cubic meters annually . the first part of the project will cost two to 2.5 billion euros and the total cost of the offshore section of the project will be over four billion euros , management has said . european union officials have sought to reassure new eu members worried that they could be left without supplies if russia no longer has to ship gas through their territory to western europe .
the eu expects the pipeline to be used to increase supplies to europe rather than for rerouting existing deliveries , an eu official said recently . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's schröder bags top us public speaking deal former german chancellor schröder certainly knows how to stay in the headlines .

" iran 's decision on enrichment , particularly research and development is irreversible , " iranian ambassador to the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- aliasghar soltanieh in vienna told afp .
foreign minister manouchehr mottaki , speaking in geneva , described the un declaration as an " angry precedent " and a " bad move " . iran struck the defiant stance even as foreign ministers of the security council permanent members plus germany met in berlin to chart their next moves in the standoff . the un security council on wednesday unanimously approved a non-binding statement giving iran 30 days to abandon its uranium enrichment activities , ending a weeks-long impasse .

" iran 's decision on enrichment , particularly research and development is irreversible , " iranian ambassador to the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- aliasghar soltanieh in vienna told afp .
foreign minister manouchehr mottaki , speaking in geneva , described the un declaration as an " angry precedent " and a " bad move " . iran struck the defiant stance even as foreign ministers of the security council permanent members plus germany met in berlin to chart their next moves in the standoff . the un security council on wednesday unanimously approved a non-binding statement giving iran 30 days to abandon its uranium enrichment activities , ending a weeks-long impasse .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian foreign minister mottaki negotiation , not confrontation " this is a strong sign to iran that negotiation not confrontation should be their course , " us secretary of state condoleezza rice said . " it is now up to iran to make a choice ... between isolation brought about by its own actions or a return to the negotiating table , " added german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , the meeting 's host . but cracks appeared between the major powers here over how to act if iran does not comply . the un statement leaves open what consequences might follow if tehran does not halt uranium enrichment , and russia and china insisted that economic sanctions or military action did not belong on the table . un members still apart on sanctions " russia does not believe that sanctions would serve the purpose of settling the various issues , " lavrov said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier : it 's iran 's choice in a clear warning against any the use of force to settle the standoff , chinese deputy foreign minister dai bingguo said that any such move would unleash chaos in the region .

the american software giant has one last chance to convince eu regulators it is complying with a two-year old ruling .
failure means 2 million euros in daily fines . facing the threat of daily fines , microsoft tried to convince eu anti-trust regulators thursday that the us software giant is meeting their demands to comply with a landmark 2004 competition ruling . even before the start of a two-day closed-door hearing , microsoft came out fighting , saying that new fines would not resolve the long-standing competition row . " in our view , a fine is not the answer , " said microsoft 's top lawyer , brad smith , as he arrived for the hearing with the european commission . in response , commission spokesman for competition issues jonathan todd said that the commission had little choice but to brandish the threat of fines .

the american software giant has one last chance to convince eu regulators it is complying with a two-year old ruling .
failure means 2 million euros in daily fines . facing the threat of daily fines , microsoft tried to convince eu anti-trust regulators thursday that the us software giant is meeting their demands to comply with a landmark 2004 competition ruling . even before the start of a two-day closed-door hearing , microsoft came out fighting , saying that new fines would not resolve the long-standing competition row . " in our view , a fine is not the answer , " said microsoft 's top lawyer , brad smith , as he arrived for the hearing with the european commission . in response , commission spokesman for competition issues jonathan todd said that the commission had little choice but to brandish the threat of fines . " also from the commission 's perspective , fines are not the best way to resolve the conflict but two years after the decision , we have tried all other ways so that microsoft complies with the decision and it has still not done so , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new microsoft operating system vista may come under scrutiny also microsoft 's last chance the hearing is likely to be the microsoft 's last chance to prove it is complying with the european commission before regulators slap a daily fine of up to 2 million euros -lrb- $ 2.4 million -rrb- a day . smith , who is microsoft 's general counsel and is also third in command at the company , led a team of about 50 people including lawyers and computer scientists in its ranks . " we need clear guidance to find a solution , " he said .
" ultimately , the point i think we 'll underscore is this : we have complied and we 're willing to do more .

" this pipeline is not aimed against anyone but is aimed at ensuring the security of gas supplies to europe , " schröder said . " not only in germany but throughout western europe there is growing need for gas , while domestic production is falling , " he said .
" this project is in the interests of germany .
that is why it will be supported by every german government . " schröder added that he would be paid 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 300,000 -rrb- annually for holding the post . the 61-year old former chancellor is also an advisor to swiss media group ringier and international investment bank rothschild and has made lucrative public-speaking appearances . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life 's a gas : the old friends are reunited in business his acceptance of the job less than a month after he left the chancellor 's office last november prompted widespread criticism in germany .
he and russian president vladimir putin had worked closely on cementing german investment in the pipeline . earlier this month a lawyer acting for schröder said that he had won a temporary injunction against the leader of the liberal free democrats , guido westerwelle , preventing him from linking schröder 's post as chancellor to his involvement in the pipeline . appointment and pipeline project under fire the project has also prompted criticism from new eu members lithuania and poland , which complained that schröder had gone over their heads on a pipeline that is likely to pass through several baltic countries ' territorial waters . other members of the supervisory board include gazprom chief executive alexei miller as well as officials from germany 's e.on and basf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe hopes to keep the russian taps turned on gazprom has a 51.0 percent stake in the north european gas pipeline , while stakes of 24.5 percent are held by e.on and basf . matthias warnig , representative of dresdner bank in russia , was named as the pipeline 's managing director . miller on thursday appeared to give backing to the idea of possible involvement in the project by gaz de france .

a second pipeline is expected to double capacity to 55 billion cubic meters annually . the first part of the project will cost two to 2.5 billion euros and the total cost of the offshore section of the project will be over four billion euros , management has said . european union officials have sought to reassure new eu members worried that they could be left without supplies if russia no longer has to ship gas through their territory to western europe .

" this project is in the interests of germany .
that is why it will be supported by every german government . " schröder added that he would be paid 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 300,000 -rrb- annually for holding the post . the 61-year old former chancellor is also an advisor to swiss media group ringier and international investment bank rothschild and has made lucrative public-speaking appearances . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life 's a gas : the old friends are reunited in business his acceptance of the job less than a month after he left the chancellor 's office last november prompted widespread criticism in germany .
he and russian president vladimir putin had worked closely on cementing german investment in the pipeline . earlier this month a lawyer acting for schröder said that he had won a temporary injunction against the leader of the liberal free democrats , guido westerwelle , preventing him from linking schröder 's post as chancellor to his involvement in the pipeline . appointment and pipeline project under fire the project has also prompted criticism from new eu members lithuania and poland , which complained that schröder had gone over their heads on a pipeline that is likely to pass through several baltic countries ' territorial waters . other members of the supervisory board include gazprom chief executive alexei miller as well as officials from germany 's e.on and basf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe hopes to keep the russian taps turned on gazprom has a 51.0 percent stake in the north european gas pipeline , while stakes of 24.5 percent are held by e.on and basf . matthias warnig , representative of dresdner bank in russia , was named as the pipeline 's managing director . miller on thursday appeared to give backing to the idea of possible involvement in the project by gaz de france .
" this decision could be taken if the new partner brings something new of strategic importance , " miller said in response to a question from journalists . schröder looking to use german links in new role earlier this week schröder paid a visit to gazprom production facilities in the siberian province of yamalo-nenets . he also confirmed that he plans to create a " german-russian think tank " but denied a russian press report that the body would be a lobbying agency for promoting the russian economy in germany . work on the pipeline has already begun onshore in russia that is planned to extend around 1,200 kilometers -lrb- 750 miles -rrb- under the baltic sea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pipeline managing director matthias warnig the pipeline is eventually expected to connect not only to germany but to other parts of western europe , including the netherlands , sweden and britain and is expected to come on stream in 2010 with an initial capacity of around 27.5 billion cubic meters of natural gas a year .
a second pipeline is expected to double capacity to 55 billion cubic meters annually . the first part of the project will cost two to 2.5 billion euros and the total cost of the offshore section of the project will be over four billion euros , management has said . european union officials have sought to reassure new eu members worried that they could be left without supplies if russia no longer has to ship gas through their territory to western europe .

answer : the fifa world cup .
you can say it ... but you ca n't wear it .
not without a license anyway . nearly every company in germany wants to make money on the upcoming world cup in june .
but not everyone is allowed to advertise with the logo .
fifa , world soccer 's governing body , has laid down strict criteria for world cup 2006 slogans and advertising . while soccer fans are gearing up for the world cup , the biggest event the sport has to offer , others are dreaming about how to make big bucks from it . but far from being a free-for-all cash cow which benefits everyone , the soccer powers-that-be have stipulated that only official fifa sponsors are allowed to sell their goods using the world cup 2006 tag which puts some traders on the wrong side of the tournament organizers and potentially on the wrong side of the law . the official sponsors , companies like automaker hyundai and sports equipment giant adidas amongst others , are the only ones allowed to use certain trademarks copyrighted by fifa .
and they have certainly paid for the privilege . these " official " companies have paid around 45 million euros each for exclusive permission to use the world cup for advertising purposes .
in addition , there are the national sponsors like german railways , postbank and others who have each paid 13 million euros for the rights , but may only use the world cup logo for their advertising within germany . fifa believes that the high price for getting on the exclusive list is worth it and that those who intend to use the trademarks without acquiring these rights should be punished .
fifa spokesman andreas herren says it is only what official sponsors would expect .
" companies who have acquired these rights of course deserve to be protected against this so-called ‘ ambush marketing ’ by free-riders . " those who unofficially use the world cup to make money face tough consequences .
during the 2002 world cup in japan / korea , for instance , fifa tracked down nearly 2,000 cases of fraud in 88 different countries .
over three million products were confiscated . official brand names a particularly prickly subject bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : official fifa products carry licensed logos and authenticity tags fifa gets particularly picky with the brand names " 2006 fifa world cup germany " and " world cup 2006 . "
those slogans enjoy special trademark protection .
those who abuse the trademark rights face punishment , says trademark lawyer martin chakraborty . " if someone uses the trademark illegally , say , to print it on t-shirts or baseballs caps to be sold outside the stadiums , then he will face a restraining order and could have to pay damages to fifa , " he says . visitors who buy and wear the unlicensed products could be forced by personnel to remove them at the stadiums .
however , not only would that mean potentially thousands of semi-naked fans teeming through the turnstiles ; it would also infringe on personal rights and freedom of action . spectators would have to stand up to the personnel and insist on their right to wear what they want which could lead to confrontation fifa and the german organizers are eager to avoid . high street traders unaware of potential fifa wrath while fifa expects businesses across germany to adhere to its strong-arm trademark policies , it seems that its message has not spread far enough to reach those who may be affected by it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knock-off merchandise can get traders into trouble in the cologne suburb of vingst , a number of traders were still blissfully unaware that selling unlicensed world cup products featuring seemingly innocuous slogans such as " world cup 2006 " could land them in hot water with the global soccer body . " i know these baseball caps are not licensed but i 'm not selling them as such , " said achim b. , the proprietor of a discount store selling a range of soccer related products .
" i 'm not trying to con anyone .
if they want to pay an extra 20 euros for the real thing , that ’ s up to them . " when informed that even the slogan " world cup 06 " could contravene fifa trademark rules , achim replied , " what else are we going to call it ?
soccer world championships 2006 ?
no one will know what that is ?
it 's the world cup .
anyway , i 'd never be able to fit that on a cap . " " crazy " fifa going too far , say shop owners " it 's just stupid , " said another trader who wished to remain anonymous .
" what will they do next ?
stop us from selling footballs because they have something to do with the world cup ?
we 'd have to call them ' balls to be kicked by the feet ' .
people would think i was crazy - just like fifa . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : champ 06 unofficial merchandise many companies have gotten around the strict trademark rules by marketing their products under world cup related headings without actually using the protected brand names .
however , the products lack a certain credibility without the world cup in the title and are perceived as cheap as a result . businesses are not alone in suffering under fifa 's control-freakery .
local authorities have also found that organizing small scale world cup related events under certain trademarked slogans could incur fifa 's wrath . katja hartmann , the events director with the phoenix sports club near ostheim , was forced to rename her world cup opening day festivities in line with fifa rules . local opening gala forced to change its name " we intended to hold our gala on june 9 under the title ' world cup festival 2006 ' but after applying for the necessary licenses we were advised by lawyers that the name could infringe on fifa trademarks .
unless we were willing to pay lots of money to use it , we had to change the name or go ahead and face the consequences . " " it was not such a big deal to change it but we felt pressured .
people should be allowed to celebrate the fact the world cup is in germany and call it just that .
the world cup is about the people but it seems that they are being pushed out of the picture in favor of money-making and marketing , " she added .

" companies who have acquired these rights of course deserve to be protected against this so-called ‘ ambush marketing ’ by free-riders . " those who unofficially use the world cup to make money face tough consequences .

answer : the fifa world cup .
you can say it ... but you ca n't wear it .
not without a license anyway . nearly every company in germany wants to make money on the upcoming world cup in june .
but not everyone is allowed to advertise with the logo .
fifa , world soccer 's governing body , has laid down strict criteria for world cup 2006 slogans and advertising . while soccer fans are gearing up for the world cup , the biggest event the sport has to offer , others are dreaming about how to make big bucks from it . but far from being a free-for-all cash cow which benefits everyone , the soccer powers-that-be have stipulated that only official fifa sponsors are allowed to sell their goods using the world cup 2006 tag which puts some traders on the wrong side of the tournament organizers and potentially on the wrong side of the law . the official sponsors , companies like automaker hyundai and sports equipment giant adidas amongst others , are the only ones allowed to use certain trademarks copyrighted by fifa .
and they have certainly paid for the privilege . these " official " companies have paid around 45 million euros each for exclusive permission to use the world cup for advertising purposes .
in addition , there are the national sponsors like german railways , postbank and others who have each paid 13 million euros for the rights , but may only use the world cup logo for their advertising within germany . fifa believes that the high price for getting on the exclusive list is worth it and that those who intend to use the trademarks without acquiring these rights should be punished .
fifa spokesman andreas herren says it is only what official sponsors would expect .

she said that reunited germany was now assuming greater responsibility in line with united nations and european union requirements . success on the international scene , however , was not the main topic of the parliamentary debate .
as widespread protests against pay cuts and layoffs continue throughout the country , merkel and her grand coalition government said they were stepping up efforts to find solutions to the pressing social and economic problems . labor reforms the latest unemployment figures for germany , which are published this thursday , are good news for the government : the number of jobless has dropped below the 5 million mark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frustrated by some of his coalition partners : labor minister franz müntefering merkel , however , appeared exasperated after a rift in the grand coalition over labor reforms .
social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- labor minister franz müntefering 's announced he was halting the labor reforms because some members of merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- were taking steps away from the coalition agreement and asking for reforms that would go beyond the agreed-upon measures such as allowing companies to fire workers during the two-year probationary period . " let 's first of all do what we resolved to do , " merkel said .
" we made an agreement on this . " merkel asked everybody to stick to the agreement and revisit the issue of germany 's job protection rules in two years .
but some members of her own party remained impatient . " the section on employment law in the coalition agreement does not go far enough , " said christian wulff , the conservative premier of lower saxony .
" it does not adequately reflect the real need for reform . " the trade unions , on the other hand , are stepping up pressure on spd - traditionally seen as a champion of workers ' rights . " the trade union 's goal is for dismissal protection not to deteriorate , but rather to be maintained , or even improved , " said michael sommer , head of the dgb trade union federation for german daily die welt .
" not everything that is in the coalition agreement must be implemented . " energy reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opposition is not her main problem : german chancellor angela merkel merkel announced that her grand coalition government would introduce a new long-term energy strategy in the second half of next year .
this moves comes as a response to the growing concern about germany 's reliance on russian natural gas and the rekindled debate about the country 's nuclear phase out program . " just because we have a difference of opinion on this one issue does n't mean we can afford to ignore the question of how our energy strategy out to 2020 should look , " merkel said in her speech before the bundestag . one of the most crucial pieces of legislation passed by outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens , in the eyes of many , was a planned phase-out of germany 's atomic energy plants by 2020 . the idea , largely pressed by the environmentally-friendly greens , was to focus on renewable energy and away from a crippling dependence on oil .
it also found support at a time when safety concerns over nuclear power reactors were highlighted with accidents like the one in chernobyl in 1986 .
the social democrats in the current grand coalition government made the nuclear phase-out an important part of the coalition agreement which was signed before the new government took office . german economics minister michael gloss , who raised quite a few eyebrows when he suggested in january that germany should reconsider prolonging the use of nuclear energy , toned down his views . " the nuclear exist is written into law and at the present time i do n't believe that the majority necessary to change this agreement exists in the german bundestag , " glos said in an interview for german daily handelsblatt . health reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : staying healthy has become more expensive in germany the german chancellor reassured parliamentarians that her coalition government would now start working seriously on an overdue reform of the statutory health system .
she said she was confident that the current clash of concepts could be overcome in a constructive manner . at present , merkel 's conservatives are backing a flat monthly premium paid regardless of income , while the social democrats favor a broadening of the funding base by bringing in currently exempt groups of the population and making them pay in line with their earnings . next year the public health care system will have a budget hole between 8 and 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.6 billion to $ 12 billion -rrb- .
germans , who have long enjoyed one of the most beneficial health care systems in europe , will have to steel themselves for difficult changes ahead .
as is , workers and employers split the monthly premiums to health care providers .
about 10 percent of the population has elected out of the state-sponsored public system , preferring costlier , but some say better , private insurance . opposition strikes back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they did n't get enough votes to form a coaltion : merkel and fdp leader westerwelle -lrb- right -rrb- oposition free-market liberal party -lrb- fdp -rrb- chief guido westerwelle accused the government of planning to raise taxes further as of next year despite pre-election promises to the contrary .
he also demanded that the government should finally think hard about introducing a simpler tax system that citizens could relate to . " since you took office , you 've been telling us that this is the sort of tax policy you ca n't do in germany , " westerwelle said .
" you should finally defend your own ideas and convictions instead of pandering to the interests of your social democrat coalition partners . " the floor leader of the opposition left party , oskar lafontaine - himself a social democrat renegade - sharply criticized the government for what he described as grave budgetary neglect in the areas of education and research : " it 's outrageous that germany is among the poorest performers within oecd countries when it comes to investing in research and education , " lafontaine said .
" this is a situation that the new government seems unwilling to change .
but it has to be changed , if we 're serious about leading the country forward . " despite the attempts by the opposition to tear apart the government 's policy , the actors within the grand coalition do n't have much to fear since they have a comfortable majority of seats in both houses of parliament .
they can only self-destruct by engaging in internal struggles and failing to implement their own agreements . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany borrows heavily to balance 2006 budget germany 's grand coalition government has presented its 2006 budget plan to parliament to seek approval for a rise in spending and the creation of new debt in its efforts to boost the economy .

she said that reunited germany was now assuming greater responsibility in line with united nations and european union requirements . success on the international scene , however , was not the main topic of the parliamentary debate .
as widespread protests against pay cuts and layoffs continue throughout the country , merkel and her grand coalition government said they were stepping up efforts to find solutions to the pressing social and economic problems . labor reforms the latest unemployment figures for germany , which are published this thursday , are good news for the government : the number of jobless has dropped below the 5 million mark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frustrated by some of his coalition partners : labor minister franz müntefering merkel , however , appeared exasperated after a rift in the grand coalition over labor reforms .
social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- labor minister franz müntefering 's announced he was halting the labor reforms because some members of merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- were taking steps away from the coalition agreement and asking for reforms that would go beyond the agreed-upon measures such as allowing companies to fire workers during the two-year probationary period . " let 's first of all do what we resolved to do , " merkel said .
" we made an agreement on this . " merkel asked everybody to stick to the agreement and revisit the issue of germany 's job protection rules in two years .
but some members of her own party remained impatient . " the section on employment law in the coalition agreement does not go far enough , " said christian wulff , the conservative premier of lower saxony .
" it does not adequately reflect the real need for reform . " the trade unions , on the other hand , are stepping up pressure on spd - traditionally seen as a champion of workers ' rights . " the trade union 's goal is for dismissal protection not to deteriorate , but rather to be maintained , or even improved , " said michael sommer , head of the dgb trade union federation for german daily die welt .

unity is the order of the day . for the past two and a half weeks , the un security council members have been at loggerheads over iran .
great britain , france and the u.s. disagree with russia and china on how to tackle the volatile islamic republic 's nuclear ambitions .
with the need to take a unified stance on the issue pressing , the foreign ministers of the five world powers will meet with merkel and eu foreign policy chief javier solana on how best to proceed .
the goal is to come out of the meeting with a unified stance and , hopefully , a draft resolution on iran that can go before the un security council . a new , weaker resolution ?
the latter will be more difficult to present .
with china and russia so far against hanging economic sanctions on iran , great britain , france and the u.s. are scrambling to find areas on which to compromise . reports out of the un in new york suggest that a new resolution is making the rounds that still forbids iran to enrich a uranium - part of the process of making an atomic bomb - but takes out language that would slap it with sanctions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are sanctions still on the table in the un ? another proposal , by the international crisis group in belgium , would allow uranium enrichment , but force un inspections as well .
the proposal is favored by a deputy of german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who said the participants thursday would likely consider the idea . not at the finish line but a solid solution remains far off . " we have n't reached finish line yet , " foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier told the bundestag during a general debate on wednesday . iran has remained resolute in the face of international diplomatic pressure .
after more than two years of negotiations with britain , france and germany , it resumed uranium enrichment earlier this year .
the eu-3 broke off diplomatic negotiations soon after and u.s. representatives began looking for a way to refer the issue to the security council , where sanctions were possible . no military option , no talk of sanctions those plans appear abandoned given the stalemate at the moment - and any sort of military option against the islamic state seems far more unlikely .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uranium enrichment has been taken up again at isfahan " contrary to what has been said , there is no military option on the table .
there is no discussion of sanctions , " friedrich groenig , the head of arms control and disarmament at the german foreign minister told reuters . merkel is hoping for a resolution tomorrow , and says germany 's willingness to host the meeting is a sign of the country 's commitment to being a diplomatic player on the world stage .

a new recycling system for electronics has been kicked off and manufacturers are getting the bill . you see them in or beside trash dumpsters or just sitting forlornly next to the curb : bulky beige computer monitors or dot-matrix printers , answering machines , refrigerators or that mobile phone that was the hippest must-have last year but is a unloved dinosaur now . they are all part of germany 's growing pile of electronic waste , which , according to the country 's environment ministry , amounts to about 1.8 million tons annually .
the new recycling requirements that require consumers to take their waste electronics to collection centers or have them picked up , is aimed at getting the rushing river of burned out components , shot transformers and obsolete electronic gadgets under control . " no type of trash has grown so rapidly recently as electronic waste , which has tripled in just a few years , " said eva leonhardt , waste expert at the environmental group deutsche umwelthilfe , which has set up a hotline to help people out with the new recycling rules .
" twenty years ago , the development cycle for electronics was around four years , now it 's three months .
that has led to an enormous increase in the amount of electronic trash . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : full of hazardous materials while beige computer boxes and refrigerators left on city sidewalks are unsightly , they can also be dangerous .
circuit boards , batteries and crts can contain hazardous materials such as lead and mercury while televisions usually also contain lead .
brominated flame retardants are commonly added to plastics used in electronics .
all these toxins can be released into the environment through incinerator ash or leach into the soil at landfills . " there are also recyclable waste in these products , like copper , aluminum , steel and sometimes even precious metals , " said leonhardt .
" to not use these materials again is almost criminal . " do n't just toss it on friday , germany 's " act governing the sale , return and environmentally sound disposal of electrical and electronic equipment " went into force .
the rules , better know as the electronic equipment law , require manufacturers to cover the cost of collecting and recycling consumer electronics and appliances .
they are designed to conform to an eu directive on electronic waste passed in 2004 . consumers are now asked to take their old electronic equipment and appliances to central collection areas , where special containers have been set up to receive them .
if consumers continue to throw their electronic waste in the normal trash , they can be fined . after that , it 's up to manufacturers to take care of things , since the law requires them to pick up the cost of recycling their products no longer in use .
companies who put any of 10 categories of electronic equipment on the german market have had to register with a central clearing house , called ear , which coordinates the collection . that does not mean that , for example , siemens sends out collection trucks to pick up its own discarded mobile phones and other equipment in the 1,500 collection areas around the country .
rather , in a complicated process , ear calculates the quantities of old electronics that each registered producer is required to collect from waste management authorities based on the amount the company puts on the market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dumpsters like this are off-limits for electronics companies can then contract with private recycling firms or other groups to disassemble the electronic waste , or do it themselves .
they then must dispose of the toxic materials in environmentally sound ways , and can either re-use recyclable materials , or sell them abroad , as is often the case , since more and more electronics manufacturing is being done in asia . " no , you ca n't really say we were supporters of these regulations , since it is going to cost manufacturers between 300 and 500 million euros -lrb- $ 360 - $ 600 -rrb- a year , " said otmar frey of the german electrical and electronic manufacturers ' association , even though his group decided to take a role in helping german lawmakers write up rules for implementing the eu directive . " we decided it would be better not to wait until others came up with rules that we would have a hard time living with , " he said .
the association did not want a repeat of the fiasco that followed the introduction of a deposit system on beverage cans and bottles , which many experts say was poorly thought through . in fact , according to frey and others , the electronics recycling system , although operational for less than a week , is running smoothly so far . higher costs in the store ? while environmental groups are cheering the new rules , trade associations say consumers will likely pay a price , although they are not being directly charged for the new plan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these could get more expensive because of the new rules according to germany 's leading retail association hde , producers will pass along the new recycling costs to consumers eventually .
the disposal of a washing machine costs around eight euros -lrb- $ 9.60 -rrb- , a refrigerator 15 euros -lrb- $ 18 -rrb- , and a television set around 10 euros -lrb- $ 12 -rrb- .
those amounts could soon be incorporated into the price tag . slow going around europe the eu electronic waste directive was supposed to have been implemented by member states by august 2005 , but most countries missed that deadline , including germany . while austria did get a registration and collection system online on schedule , it had not yet figured out what do with the old electronics once they had been turned in .
for months , collection centers were full of growing piles of plastic , glass and circuitry . # b # holland , belgium and sweden have systems in place , as do the swiss , although they are not part of the eu .

the uk does not anticipate having a national system in place until 2007 . " several of these countries are facing proceedings because they are in breach of eu rules , " said frey . several of those countries with electronics recycling programs have organized them differently .
while germany separates its electronics according to functional category , austria does it by size , and hungary by tax number .

a new recycling system for electronics has been kicked off and manufacturers are getting the bill . you see them in or beside trash dumpsters or just sitting forlornly next to the curb : bulky beige computer monitors or dot-matrix printers , answering machines , refrigerators or that mobile phone that was the hippest must-have last year but is a unloved dinosaur now . they are all part of germany 's growing pile of electronic waste , which , according to the country 's environment ministry , amounts to about 1.8 million tons annually .
the new recycling requirements that require consumers to take their waste electronics to collection centers or have them picked up , is aimed at getting the rushing river of burned out components , shot transformers and obsolete electronic gadgets under control . " no type of trash has grown so rapidly recently as electronic waste , which has tripled in just a few years , " said eva leonhardt , waste expert at the environmental group deutsche umwelthilfe , which has set up a hotline to help people out with the new recycling rules .
" twenty years ago , the development cycle for electronics was around four years , now it 's three months .
that has led to an enormous increase in the amount of electronic trash . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : full of hazardous materials while beige computer boxes and refrigerators left on city sidewalks are unsightly , they can also be dangerous .
circuit boards , batteries and crts can contain hazardous materials such as lead and mercury while televisions usually also contain lead .
brominated flame retardants are commonly added to plastics used in electronics .
all these toxins can be released into the environment through incinerator ash or leach into the soil at landfills . " there are also recyclable waste in these products , like copper , aluminum , steel and sometimes even precious metals , " said leonhardt .
" to not use these materials again is almost criminal . " do n't just toss it on friday , germany 's " act governing the sale , return and environmentally sound disposal of electrical and electronic equipment " went into force .
the rules , better know as the electronic equipment law , require manufacturers to cover the cost of collecting and recycling consumer electronics and appliances .
they are designed to conform to an eu directive on electronic waste passed in 2004 . consumers are now asked to take their old electronic equipment and appliances to central collection areas , where special containers have been set up to receive them .
if consumers continue to throw their electronic waste in the normal trash , they can be fined . after that , it 's up to manufacturers to take care of things , since the law requires them to pick up the cost of recycling their products no longer in use .
companies who put any of 10 categories of electronic equipment on the german market have had to register with a central clearing house , called ear , which coordinates the collection . that does not mean that , for example , siemens sends out collection trucks to pick up its own discarded mobile phones and other equipment in the 1,500 collection areas around the country .
rather , in a complicated process , ear calculates the quantities of old electronics that each registered producer is required to collect from waste management authorities based on the amount the company puts on the market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dumpsters like this are off-limits for electronics companies can then contract with private recycling firms or other groups to disassemble the electronic waste , or do it themselves .
they then must dispose of the toxic materials in environmentally sound ways , and can either re-use recyclable materials , or sell them abroad , as is often the case , since more and more electronics manufacturing is being done in asia . " no , you ca n't really say we were supporters of these regulations , since it is going to cost manufacturers between 300 and 500 million euros -lrb- $ 360 - $ 600 -rrb- a year , " said otmar frey of the german electrical and electronic manufacturers ' association , even though his group decided to take a role in helping german lawmakers write up rules for implementing the eu directive . " we decided it would be better not to wait until others came up with rules that we would have a hard time living with , " he said .
the association did not want a repeat of the fiasco that followed the introduction of a deposit system on beverage cans and bottles , which many experts say was poorly thought through . in fact , according to frey and others , the electronics recycling system , although operational for less than a week , is running smoothly so far . higher costs in the store ? while environmental groups are cheering the new rules , trade associations say consumers will likely pay a price , although they are not being directly charged for the new plan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these could get more expensive because of the new rules according to germany 's leading retail association hde , producers will pass along the new recycling costs to consumers eventually .
the disposal of a washing machine costs around eight euros -lrb- $ 9.60 -rrb- , a refrigerator 15 euros -lrb- $ 18 -rrb- , and a television set around 10 euros -lrb- $ 12 -rrb- .

but while some call for sanctions , others say such measures will punish the wrong people . the eu must firmly condemn the belarus regime for its bloody crackdown on opposition supporters after presidential polls , but should not impose sanctions that hurt the people , polish prime minister kazimierz marcinkiewicz said in riga thursday . " belarus is our neighbor and what happens there touches us directly , " marcinkiewicz told reporters during a one-day visit .
" but economic sanctions or a blockade should not be applied as they would put pressure on the common people , not the ruling elite . " " a massive fraud " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riot police beat protesters in the belarusian capital minsk on saturday eu leaders agreed at a summit last week to widen a list of senior belarusian officials subject to a visa ban and said they were also considering financial sanctions .
poland has already imposed travel restrictions on belarusian officials it accused of falsifying results in the former soviet republic 's presidential election on march 19 in which " europe 's last dictator " won a landslide victory in a poll judged fraudulent by the eu , the u.s. and international observers . german chancellor angela merkel on wednesday denounced the belarus presidential election as marred by " massive fraud " as the lower house of parliament passed a resolution calling for the immediate release of arrested belarusian opposition activists and sanctions against the country by the european union . " this election was subject to massive fraud and somebody has to say so , " merkel told the bundestag . more than 500 arrested the german members of parliament are proposing to invite the main belarusian opposition candidate , alexander milinkevich , to the next meeting of eu foreign ministers in luxembourg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belarus ' opposition leader alexander milinkevich says he will return to belarus and continue to fight milinkevich , who led protests against the re-election of president alexander lukashenko , said he was going to poland thursday to tell the outside world what was going on in his country . " in the polish parliament i intend to say what is really happening in belarus , " alexander milinkevich told reuters .
he added that he had no plans to emigrate even though he faces jail if he returns to belarus in connection with the protests . so far , more than 500 people have been arrested in belarus after a wave of opposition demonstrations resulted in a bloody crackdown by pro-lukashenko security forces .

she said that reunited germany was now assuming greater responsibility in line with united nations and european union requirements . success on the international scene , however , was not the main topic of the parliamentary debate .
as widespread protests against pay cuts and layoffs continue throughout the country , merkel and her grand coalition government said they were stepping up efforts to find solutions to the pressing social and economic problems . labor reforms the latest unemployment figures for germany , which are published this thursday , are good news for the government : the number of jobless has dropped below the 5 million mark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frustrated by some of his coalition partners : labor minister franz müntefering merkel , however , appeared exasperated after a rift in the grand coalition over labor reforms .
social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- labor minister franz müntefering 's announced he was halting the labor reforms because some members of merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- were taking steps away from the coalition agreement and asking for reforms that would go beyond the agreed-upon measures such as allowing companies to fire workers during the two-year probationary period . " let 's first of all do what we resolved to do , " merkel said .
" we made an agreement on this . " merkel asked everybody to stick to the agreement and revisit the issue of germany 's job protection rules in two years .
but some members of her own party remained impatient . " the section on employment law in the coalition agreement does not go far enough , " said christian wulff , the conservative premier of lower saxony .
" it does not adequately reflect the real need for reform . " the trade unions , on the other hand , are stepping up pressure on spd - traditionally seen as a champion of workers ' rights . " the trade union 's goal is for dismissal protection not to deteriorate , but rather to be maintained , or even improved , " said michael sommer , head of the dgb trade union federation for german daily die welt .
" not everything that is in the coalition agreement must be implemented . " energy reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opposition is not her main problem : german chancellor angela merkel merkel announced that her grand coalition government would introduce a new long-term energy strategy in the second half of next year .
this moves comes as a response to the growing concern about germany 's reliance on russian natural gas and the rekindled debate about the country 's nuclear phase out program . " just because we have a difference of opinion on this one issue does n't mean we can afford to ignore the question of how our energy strategy out to 2020 should look , " merkel said in her speech before the bundestag . one of the most crucial pieces of legislation passed by outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens , in the eyes of many , was a planned phase-out of germany 's atomic energy plants by 2020 . the idea , largely pressed by the environmentally-friendly greens , was to focus on renewable energy and away from a crippling dependence on oil .
it also found support at a time when safety concerns over nuclear power reactors were highlighted with accidents like the one in chernobyl in 1986 .
the social democrats in the current grand coalition government made the nuclear phase-out an important part of the coalition agreement which was signed before the new government took office . german economics minister michael gloss , who raised quite a few eyebrows when he suggested in january that germany should reconsider prolonging the use of nuclear energy , toned down his views . " the nuclear exist is written into law and at the present time i do n't believe that the majority necessary to change this agreement exists in the german bundestag , " glos said in an interview for german daily handelsblatt . health reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : staying healthy has become more expensive in germany the german chancellor reassured parliamentarians that her coalition government would now start working seriously on an overdue reform of the statutory health system .
she said she was confident that the current clash of concepts could be overcome in a constructive manner . at present , merkel 's conservatives are backing a flat monthly premium paid regardless of income , while the social democrats favor a broadening of the funding base by bringing in currently exempt groups of the population and making them pay in line with their earnings . next year the public health care system will have a budget hole between 8 and 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.6 billion to $ 12 billion -rrb- .
germans , who have long enjoyed one of the most beneficial health care systems in europe , will have to steel themselves for difficult changes ahead .
as is , workers and employers split the monthly premiums to health care providers .
about 10 percent of the population has elected out of the state-sponsored public system , preferring costlier , but some say better , private insurance . opposition strikes back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they did n't get enough votes to form a coaltion : merkel and fdp leader westerwelle -lrb- right -rrb- oposition free-market liberal party -lrb- fdp -rrb- chief guido westerwelle accused the government of planning to raise taxes further as of next year despite pre-election promises to the contrary .
he also demanded that the government should finally think hard about introducing a simpler tax system that citizens could relate to . " since you took office , you 've been telling us that this is the sort of tax policy you ca n't do in germany , " westerwelle said .
" you should finally defend your own ideas and convictions instead of pandering to the interests of your social democrat coalition partners . " the floor leader of the opposition left party , oskar lafontaine - himself a social democrat renegade - sharply criticized the government for what he described as grave budgetary neglect in the areas of education and research : " it 's outrageous that germany is among the poorest performers within oecd countries when it comes to investing in research and education , " lafontaine said .
" this is a situation that the new government seems unwilling to change .
but it has to be changed , if we 're serious about leading the country forward . " despite the attempts by the opposition to tear apart the government 's policy , the actors within the grand coalition do n't have much to fear since they have a comfortable majority of seats in both houses of parliament .
they can only self-destruct by engaging in internal struggles and failing to implement their own agreements . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany borrows heavily to balance 2006 budget germany 's grand coalition government has presented its 2006 budget plan to parliament to seek approval for a rise in spending and the creation of new debt in its efforts to boost the economy .

she said she was confident that the current clash of concepts could be overcome in a constructive manner . at present , merkel 's conservatives are backing a flat monthly premium paid regardless of income , while the social democrats favor a broadening of the funding base by bringing in currently exempt groups of the population and making them pay in line with their earnings . next year the public health care system will have a budget hole between 8 and 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.6 billion to $ 12 billion -rrb- .
germans , who have long enjoyed one of the most beneficial health care systems in europe , will have to steel themselves for difficult changes ahead .
as is , workers and employers split the monthly premiums to health care providers .
about 10 percent of the population has elected out of the state-sponsored public system , preferring costlier , but some say better , private insurance . opposition strikes back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they did n't get enough votes to form a coaltion : merkel and fdp leader westerwelle -lrb- right -rrb- oposition free-market liberal party -lrb- fdp -rrb- chief guido westerwelle accused the government of planning to raise taxes further as of next year despite pre-election promises to the contrary .
he also demanded that the government should finally think hard about introducing a simpler tax system that citizens could relate to . " since you took office , you 've been telling us that this is the sort of tax policy you ca n't do in germany , " westerwelle said .
" you should finally defend your own ideas and convictions instead of pandering to the interests of your social democrat coalition partners . " the floor leader of the opposition left party , oskar lafontaine - himself a social democrat renegade - sharply criticized the government for what he described as grave budgetary neglect in the areas of education and research : " it 's outrageous that germany is among the poorest performers within oecd countries when it comes to investing in research and education , " lafontaine said .
" this is a situation that the new government seems unwilling to change .
but it has to be changed , if we 're serious about leading the country forward . " despite the attempts by the opposition to tear apart the government 's policy , the actors within the grand coalition do n't have much to fear since they have a comfortable majority of seats in both houses of parliament .

and business leaders , security experts and law enforcement gathering thursday and friday in london aim to change that . it has been quite a year for e-crime , say experts .
trojan horses have constantly bombarded banks and others in the financial sector .
phishing and identity theft attempts have risen to number about 8 million per day , according to security officials .
e-scams are costing businesses billions and that does n't include increasing funds - about 20 to 50 percent of total expenditures in the us and uk - to beef up security .
and it is only getting worse .
as a result , law enforcement , business and computer specialists have come together for the annual e-crime congress in london thursday and friday to find new methods to fight such cyber predators .
an illustrious group because it is such a growing problem internationally , the conference is attracting bigger names and from further afield , too .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : microsoft 's brad smith offered a reward of $ 5 million to those who help catch cyber criminals attendees include about 500 officials from governments , companies as amazon , ebay , skype and yahoo , bankers from scandinavia , the uk and the middle east and law enforcement such as the fbi , scotland yard and those from the china .
" the 2005 e-crime congress provided an excellent forum for us to interact with law enforcement agencies , security product vendors and others in the financial services industry to discuss the wider issues that affect us , " one british bank security official as quoted on the congress ' website .
e-crime remains a low priority e-crime , like white-collar crime , is low on the list of law enforcement priorities , experts say .
instead , police and intelligence agencies worldwide are busy grappling with violent crimes and terrorism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internet cafes in countries with few cyber or extradition laws are often used by cyber gangs in most countries , police officials are overworked and lack manpower and often expertise to investigate e-crime .
few prosecutors take on such cases and laws often lack teeth , experts say .
that lessens the already low deterrant power of law enforcement against cyber criminals , who already have very low odds of getting caught , especially if they are outside the us or europe .

the american software giant has one last chance to convince eu regulators it is complying with a two-year old ruling .
failure means 2 million euros in daily fines . facing the threat of daily fines , microsoft tried to convince eu anti-trust regulators thursday that the us software giant is meeting their demands to comply with a landmark 2004 competition ruling . even before the start of a two-day closed-door hearing , microsoft came out fighting , saying that new fines would not resolve the long-standing competition row .

answer : the fifa world cup .
you can say it ... but you ca n't wear it .
not without a license anyway . nearly every company in germany wants to make money on the upcoming world cup in june .
but not everyone is allowed to advertise with the logo .
fifa , world soccer 's governing body , has laid down strict criteria for world cup 2006 slogans and advertising . while soccer fans are gearing up for the world cup , the biggest event the sport has to offer , others are dreaming about how to make big bucks from it . but far from being a free-for-all cash cow which benefits everyone , the soccer powers-that-be have stipulated that only official fifa sponsors are allowed to sell their goods using the world cup 2006 tag which puts some traders on the wrong side of the tournament organizers and potentially on the wrong side of the law . the official sponsors , companies like automaker hyundai and sports equipment giant adidas amongst others , are the only ones allowed to use certain trademarks copyrighted by fifa .
and they have certainly paid for the privilege . these " official " companies have paid around 45 million euros each for exclusive permission to use the world cup for advertising purposes .
in addition , there are the national sponsors like german railways , postbank and others who have each paid 13 million euros for the rights , but may only use the world cup logo for their advertising within germany . fifa believes that the high price for getting on the exclusive list is worth it and that those who intend to use the trademarks without acquiring these rights should be punished .
fifa spokesman andreas herren says it is only what official sponsors would expect .
" companies who have acquired these rights of course deserve to be protected against this so-called ‘ ambush marketing ’ by free-riders . " those who unofficially use the world cup to make money face tough consequences .
during the 2002 world cup in japan / korea , for instance , fifa tracked down nearly 2,000 cases of fraud in 88 different countries .
over three million products were confiscated . official brand names a particularly prickly subject bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : official fifa products carry licensed logos and authenticity tags fifa gets particularly picky with the brand names " 2006 fifa world cup germany " and " world cup 2006 . "
those slogans enjoy special trademark protection .
those who abuse the trademark rights face punishment , says trademark lawyer martin chakraborty . " if someone uses the trademark illegally , say , to print it on t-shirts or baseballs caps to be sold outside the stadiums , then he will face a restraining order and could have to pay damages to fifa , " he says . visitors who buy and wear the unlicensed products could be forced by personnel to remove them at the stadiums .
however , not only would that mean potentially thousands of semi-naked fans teeming through the turnstiles ; it would also infringe on personal rights and freedom of action . spectators would have to stand up to the personnel and insist on their right to wear what they want which could lead to confrontation fifa and the german organizers are eager to avoid . high street traders unaware of potential fifa wrath while fifa expects businesses across germany to adhere to its strong-arm trademark policies , it seems that its message has not spread far enough to reach those who may be affected by it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knock-off merchandise can get traders into trouble in the cologne suburb of vingst , a number of traders were still blissfully unaware that selling unlicensed world cup products featuring seemingly innocuous slogans such as " world cup 2006 " could land them in hot water with the global soccer body . " i know these baseball caps are not licensed but i 'm not selling them as such , " said achim b. , the proprietor of a discount store selling a range of soccer related products .
" i 'm not trying to con anyone .
if they want to pay an extra 20 euros for the real thing , that ’ s up to them . " when informed that even the slogan " world cup 06 " could contravene fifa trademark rules , achim replied , " what else are we going to call it ?
soccer world championships 2006 ?
no one will know what that is ?
it 's the world cup .
anyway , i 'd never be able to fit that on a cap . " " crazy " fifa going too far , say shop owners " it 's just stupid , " said another trader who wished to remain anonymous .
" what will they do next ?
stop us from selling footballs because they have something to do with the world cup ?
we 'd have to call them ' balls to be kicked by the feet ' .
people would think i was crazy - just like fifa . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : champ 06 unofficial merchandise many companies have gotten around the strict trademark rules by marketing their products under world cup related headings without actually using the protected brand names .
however , the products lack a certain credibility without the world cup in the title and are perceived as cheap as a result . businesses are not alone in suffering under fifa 's control-freakery .
local authorities have also found that organizing small scale world cup related events under certain trademarked slogans could incur fifa 's wrath . katja hartmann , the events director with the phoenix sports club near ostheim , was forced to rename her world cup opening day festivities in line with fifa rules . local opening gala forced to change its name " we intended to hold our gala on june 9 under the title ' world cup festival 2006 ' but after applying for the necessary licenses we were advised by lawyers that the name could infringe on fifa trademarks .
unless we were willing to pay lots of money to use it , we had to change the name or go ahead and face the consequences . " " it was not such a big deal to change it but we felt pressured .
people should be allowed to celebrate the fact the world cup is in germany and call it just that .
the world cup is about the people but it seems that they are being pushed out of the picture in favor of money-making and marketing , " she added .

she said that reunited germany was now assuming greater responsibility in line with united nations and european union requirements . success on the international scene , however , was not the main topic of the parliamentary debate .
as widespread protests against pay cuts and layoffs continue throughout the country , merkel and her grand coalition government said they were stepping up efforts to find solutions to the pressing social and economic problems . labor reforms the latest unemployment figures for germany , which are published this thursday , are good news for the government : the number of jobless has dropped below the 5 million mark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frustrated by some of his coalition partners : labor minister franz müntefering merkel , however , appeared exasperated after a rift in the grand coalition over labor reforms .
social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- labor minister franz müntefering 's announced he was halting the labor reforms because some members of merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- were taking steps away from the coalition agreement and asking for reforms that would go beyond the agreed-upon measures such as allowing companies to fire workers during the two-year probationary period . " let 's first of all do what we resolved to do , " merkel said .
" we made an agreement on this . " merkel asked everybody to stick to the agreement and revisit the issue of germany 's job protection rules in two years .
but some members of her own party remained impatient . " the section on employment law in the coalition agreement does not go far enough , " said christian wulff , the conservative premier of lower saxony .
" it does not adequately reflect the real need for reform . " the trade unions , on the other hand , are stepping up pressure on spd - traditionally seen as a champion of workers ' rights . " the trade union 's goal is for dismissal protection not to deteriorate , but rather to be maintained , or even improved , " said michael sommer , head of the dgb trade union federation for german daily die welt .
" not everything that is in the coalition agreement must be implemented . " energy reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opposition is not her main problem : german chancellor angela merkel merkel announced that her grand coalition government would introduce a new long-term energy strategy in the second half of next year .
this moves comes as a response to the growing concern about germany 's reliance on russian natural gas and the rekindled debate about the country 's nuclear phase out program . " just because we have a difference of opinion on this one issue does n't mean we can afford to ignore the question of how our energy strategy out to 2020 should look , " merkel said in her speech before the bundestag . one of the most crucial pieces of legislation passed by outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens , in the eyes of many , was a planned phase-out of germany 's atomic energy plants by 2020 . the idea , largely pressed by the environmentally-friendly greens , was to focus on renewable energy and away from a crippling dependence on oil .
it also found support at a time when safety concerns over nuclear power reactors were highlighted with accidents like the one in chernobyl in 1986 .
the social democrats in the current grand coalition government made the nuclear phase-out an important part of the coalition agreement which was signed before the new government took office . german economics minister michael gloss , who raised quite a few eyebrows when he suggested in january that germany should reconsider prolonging the use of nuclear energy , toned down his views . " the nuclear exist is written into law and at the present time i do n't believe that the majority necessary to change this agreement exists in the german bundestag , " glos said in an interview for german daily handelsblatt . health reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : staying healthy has become more expensive in germany the german chancellor reassured parliamentarians that her coalition government would now start working seriously on an overdue reform of the statutory health system .
she said she was confident that the current clash of concepts could be overcome in a constructive manner . at present , merkel 's conservatives are backing a flat monthly premium paid regardless of income , while the social democrats favor a broadening of the funding base by bringing in currently exempt groups of the population and making them pay in line with their earnings . next year the public health care system will have a budget hole between 8 and 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.6 billion to $ 12 billion -rrb- .
germans , who have long enjoyed one of the most beneficial health care systems in europe , will have to steel themselves for difficult changes ahead .
as is , workers and employers split the monthly premiums to health care providers .
about 10 percent of the population has elected out of the state-sponsored public system , preferring costlier , but some say better , private insurance . opposition strikes back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they did n't get enough votes to form a coaltion : merkel and fdp leader westerwelle -lrb- right -rrb- oposition free-market liberal party -lrb- fdp -rrb- chief guido westerwelle accused the government of planning to raise taxes further as of next year despite pre-election promises to the contrary .
he also demanded that the government should finally think hard about introducing a simpler tax system that citizens could relate to . " since you took office , you 've been telling us that this is the sort of tax policy you ca n't do in germany , " westerwelle said .
" you should finally defend your own ideas and convictions instead of pandering to the interests of your social democrat coalition partners . " the floor leader of the opposition left party , oskar lafontaine - himself a social democrat renegade - sharply criticized the government for what he described as grave budgetary neglect in the areas of education and research : " it 's outrageous that germany is among the poorest performers within oecd countries when it comes to investing in research and education , " lafontaine said .
" this is a situation that the new government seems unwilling to change .
but it has to be changed , if we 're serious about leading the country forward . " despite the attempts by the opposition to tear apart the government 's policy , the actors within the grand coalition do n't have much to fear since they have a comfortable majority of seats in both houses of parliament .

" just because we have a difference of opinion on this one issue does n't mean we can afford to ignore the question of how our energy strategy out to 2020 should look , " merkel said in her speech before the bundestag . one of the most crucial pieces of legislation passed by outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens , in the eyes of many , was a planned phase-out of germany 's atomic energy plants by 2020 . the idea , largely pressed by the environmentally-friendly greens , was to focus on renewable energy and away from a crippling dependence on oil .
it also found support at a time when safety concerns over nuclear power reactors were highlighted with accidents like the one in chernobyl in 1986 .
the social democrats in the current grand coalition government made the nuclear phase-out an important part of the coalition agreement which was signed before the new government took office . german economics minister michael gloss , who raised quite a few eyebrows when he suggested in january that germany should reconsider prolonging the use of nuclear energy , toned down his views . " the nuclear exist is written into law and at the present time i do n't believe that the majority necessary to change this agreement exists in the german bundestag , " glos said in an interview for german daily handelsblatt . health reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : staying healthy has become more expensive in germany the german chancellor reassured parliamentarians that her coalition government would now start working seriously on an overdue reform of the statutory health system .
she said she was confident that the current clash of concepts could be overcome in a constructive manner . at present , merkel 's conservatives are backing a flat monthly premium paid regardless of income , while the social democrats favor a broadening of the funding base by bringing in currently exempt groups of the population and making them pay in line with their earnings . next year the public health care system will have a budget hole between 8 and 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.6 billion to $ 12 billion -rrb- .
germans , who have long enjoyed one of the most beneficial health care systems in europe , will have to steel themselves for difficult changes ahead .
as is , workers and employers split the monthly premiums to health care providers .
about 10 percent of the population has elected out of the state-sponsored public system , preferring costlier , but some say better , private insurance . opposition strikes back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they did n't get enough votes to form a coaltion : merkel and fdp leader westerwelle -lrb- right -rrb- oposition free-market liberal party -lrb- fdp -rrb- chief guido westerwelle accused the government of planning to raise taxes further as of next year despite pre-election promises to the contrary .
he also demanded that the government should finally think hard about introducing a simpler tax system that citizens could relate to . " since you took office , you 've been telling us that this is the sort of tax policy you ca n't do in germany , " westerwelle said .
" you should finally defend your own ideas and convictions instead of pandering to the interests of your social democrat coalition partners . " the floor leader of the opposition left party , oskar lafontaine - himself a social democrat renegade - sharply criticized the government for what he described as grave budgetary neglect in the areas of education and research : " it 's outrageous that germany is among the poorest performers within oecd countries when it comes to investing in research and education , " lafontaine said .
" this is a situation that the new government seems unwilling to change .
but it has to be changed , if we 're serious about leading the country forward . " despite the attempts by the opposition to tear apart the government 's policy , the actors within the grand coalition do n't have much to fear since they have a comfortable majority of seats in both houses of parliament .
they can only self-destruct by engaging in internal struggles and failing to implement their own agreements . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany borrows heavily to balance 2006 budget germany 's grand coalition government has presented its 2006 budget plan to parliament to seek approval for a rise in spending and the creation of new debt in its efforts to boost the economy .

a new recycling system for electronics has been kicked off and manufacturers are getting the bill . you see them in or beside trash dumpsters or just sitting forlornly next to the curb : bulky beige computer monitors or dot-matrix printers , answering machines , refrigerators or that mobile phone that was the hippest must-have last year but is a unloved dinosaur now . they are all part of germany 's growing pile of electronic waste , which , according to the country 's environment ministry , amounts to about 1.8 million tons annually .
the new recycling requirements that require consumers to take their waste electronics to collection centers or have them picked up , is aimed at getting the rushing river of burned out components , shot transformers and obsolete electronic gadgets under control . " no type of trash has grown so rapidly recently as electronic waste , which has tripled in just a few years , " said eva leonhardt , waste expert at the environmental group deutsche umwelthilfe , which has set up a hotline to help people out with the new recycling rules .
" twenty years ago , the development cycle for electronics was around four years , now it 's three months .
that has led to an enormous increase in the amount of electronic trash . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : full of hazardous materials while beige computer boxes and refrigerators left on city sidewalks are unsightly , they can also be dangerous .
circuit boards , batteries and crts can contain hazardous materials such as lead and mercury while televisions usually also contain lead .
brominated flame retardants are commonly added to plastics used in electronics .
all these toxins can be released into the environment through incinerator ash or leach into the soil at landfills . " there are also recyclable waste in these products , like copper , aluminum , steel and sometimes even precious metals , " said leonhardt .
" to not use these materials again is almost criminal . " do n't just toss it on friday , germany 's " act governing the sale , return and environmentally sound disposal of electrical and electronic equipment " went into force .
the rules , better know as the electronic equipment law , require manufacturers to cover the cost of collecting and recycling consumer electronics and appliances .
they are designed to conform to an eu directive on electronic waste passed in 2004 . consumers are now asked to take their old electronic equipment and appliances to central collection areas , where special containers have been set up to receive them .
if consumers continue to throw their electronic waste in the normal trash , they can be fined . after that , it 's up to manufacturers to take care of things , since the law requires them to pick up the cost of recycling their products no longer in use .
companies who put any of 10 categories of electronic equipment on the german market have had to register with a central clearing house , called ear , which coordinates the collection . that does not mean that , for example , siemens sends out collection trucks to pick up its own discarded mobile phones and other equipment in the 1,500 collection areas around the country .
rather , in a complicated process , ear calculates the quantities of old electronics that each registered producer is required to collect from waste management authorities based on the amount the company puts on the market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dumpsters like this are off-limits for electronics companies can then contract with private recycling firms or other groups to disassemble the electronic waste , or do it themselves .
they then must dispose of the toxic materials in environmentally sound ways , and can either re-use recyclable materials , or sell them abroad , as is often the case , since more and more electronics manufacturing is being done in asia . " no , you ca n't really say we were supporters of these regulations , since it is going to cost manufacturers between 300 and 500 million euros -lrb- $ 360 - $ 600 -rrb- a year , " said otmar frey of the german electrical and electronic manufacturers ' association , even though his group decided to take a role in helping german lawmakers write up rules for implementing the eu directive . " we decided it would be better not to wait until others came up with rules that we would have a hard time living with , " he said .
the association did not want a repeat of the fiasco that followed the introduction of a deposit system on beverage cans and bottles , which many experts say was poorly thought through . in fact , according to frey and others , the electronics recycling system , although operational for less than a week , is running smoothly so far . higher costs in the store ? while environmental groups are cheering the new rules , trade associations say consumers will likely pay a price , although they are not being directly charged for the new plan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these could get more expensive because of the new rules according to germany 's leading retail association hde , producers will pass along the new recycling costs to consumers eventually .
the disposal of a washing machine costs around eight euros -lrb- $ 9.60 -rrb- , a refrigerator 15 euros -lrb- $ 18 -rrb- , and a television set around 10 euros -lrb- $ 12 -rrb- .
those amounts could soon be incorporated into the price tag . slow going around europe the eu electronic waste directive was supposed to have been implemented by member states by august 2005 , but most countries missed that deadline , including germany . while austria did get a registration and collection system online on schedule , it had not yet figured out what do with the old electronics once they had been turned in .

a new recycling system for electronics has been kicked off and manufacturers are getting the bill . you see them in or beside trash dumpsters or just sitting forlornly next to the curb : bulky beige computer monitors or dot-matrix printers , answering machines , refrigerators or that mobile phone that was the hippest must-have last year but is a unloved dinosaur now . they are all part of germany 's growing pile of electronic waste , which , according to the country 's environment ministry , amounts to about 1.8 million tons annually .
the new recycling requirements that require consumers to take their waste electronics to collection centers or have them picked up , is aimed at getting the rushing river of burned out components , shot transformers and obsolete electronic gadgets under control . " no type of trash has grown so rapidly recently as electronic waste , which has tripled in just a few years , " said eva leonhardt , waste expert at the environmental group deutsche umwelthilfe , which has set up a hotline to help people out with the new recycling rules .
" twenty years ago , the development cycle for electronics was around four years , now it 's three months .
that has led to an enormous increase in the amount of electronic trash . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : full of hazardous materials while beige computer boxes and refrigerators left on city sidewalks are unsightly , they can also be dangerous .
circuit boards , batteries and crts can contain hazardous materials such as lead and mercury while televisions usually also contain lead .
brominated flame retardants are commonly added to plastics used in electronics .
all these toxins can be released into the environment through incinerator ash or leach into the soil at landfills . " there are also recyclable waste in these products , like copper , aluminum , steel and sometimes even precious metals , " said leonhardt .
" to not use these materials again is almost criminal . " do n't just toss it on friday , germany 's " act governing the sale , return and environmentally sound disposal of electrical and electronic equipment " went into force .
the rules , better know as the electronic equipment law , require manufacturers to cover the cost of collecting and recycling consumer electronics and appliances .
they are designed to conform to an eu directive on electronic waste passed in 2004 . consumers are now asked to take their old electronic equipment and appliances to central collection areas , where special containers have been set up to receive them .
if consumers continue to throw their electronic waste in the normal trash , they can be fined . after that , it 's up to manufacturers to take care of things , since the law requires them to pick up the cost of recycling their products no longer in use .
companies who put any of 10 categories of electronic equipment on the german market have had to register with a central clearing house , called ear , which coordinates the collection . that does not mean that , for example , siemens sends out collection trucks to pick up its own discarded mobile phones and other equipment in the 1,500 collection areas around the country .
rather , in a complicated process , ear calculates the quantities of old electronics that each registered producer is required to collect from waste management authorities based on the amount the company puts on the market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dumpsters like this are off-limits for electronics companies can then contract with private recycling firms or other groups to disassemble the electronic waste , or do it themselves .
they then must dispose of the toxic materials in environmentally sound ways , and can either re-use recyclable materials , or sell them abroad , as is often the case , since more and more electronics manufacturing is being done in asia . " no , you ca n't really say we were supporters of these regulations , since it is going to cost manufacturers between 300 and 500 million euros -lrb- $ 360 - $ 600 -rrb- a year , " said otmar frey of the german electrical and electronic manufacturers ' association , even though his group decided to take a role in helping german lawmakers write up rules for implementing the eu directive . " we decided it would be better not to wait until others came up with rules that we would have a hard time living with , " he said .
the association did not want a repeat of the fiasco that followed the introduction of a deposit system on beverage cans and bottles , which many experts say was poorly thought through . in fact , according to frey and others , the electronics recycling system , although operational for less than a week , is running smoothly so far . higher costs in the store ? while environmental groups are cheering the new rules , trade associations say consumers will likely pay a price , although they are not being directly charged for the new plan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these could get more expensive because of the new rules according to germany 's leading retail association hde , producers will pass along the new recycling costs to consumers eventually .
the disposal of a washing machine costs around eight euros -lrb- $ 9.60 -rrb- , a refrigerator 15 euros -lrb- $ 18 -rrb- , and a television set around 10 euros -lrb- $ 12 -rrb- .
those amounts could soon be incorporated into the price tag . slow going around europe the eu electronic waste directive was supposed to have been implemented by member states by august 2005 , but most countries missed that deadline , including germany . while austria did get a registration and collection system online on schedule , it had not yet figured out what do with the old electronics once they had been turned in .
for months , collection centers were full of growing piles of plastic , glass and circuitry . # b # holland , belgium and sweden have systems in place , as do the swiss , although they are not part of the eu .
some countries are halfway there , such as hungary , although others , such as france , italy and the uk , have done little or nothing to turn the eu guidelines into national law .
the uk does not anticipate having a national system in place until 2007 . " several of these countries are facing proceedings because they are in breach of eu rules , " said frey . several of those countries with electronics recycling programs have organized them differently .
while germany separates its electronics according to functional category , austria does it by size , and hungary by tax number .
that will make any kind of cross-border cooperation more difficult , especially for manufacturers active internationally , said waste expert leonhardt .

" iran 's decision on enrichment , particularly research and development is irreversible , " iranian ambassador to the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- aliasghar soltanieh in vienna told afp .
foreign minister manouchehr mottaki , speaking in geneva , described the un declaration as an " angry precedent " and a " bad move " . iran struck the defiant stance even as foreign ministers of the security council permanent members plus germany met in berlin to chart their next moves in the standoff . the un security council on wednesday unanimously approved a non-binding statement giving iran 30 days to abandon its uranium enrichment activities , ending a weeks-long impasse .

" iran 's decision on enrichment , particularly research and development is irreversible , " iranian ambassador to the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- aliasghar soltanieh in vienna told afp .
foreign minister manouchehr mottaki , speaking in geneva , described the un declaration as an " angry precedent " and a " bad move " . iran struck the defiant stance even as foreign ministers of the security council permanent members plus germany met in berlin to chart their next moves in the standoff . the un security council on wednesday unanimously approved a non-binding statement giving iran 30 days to abandon its uranium enrichment activities , ending a weeks-long impasse .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian foreign minister mottaki negotiation , not confrontation " this is a strong sign to iran that negotiation not confrontation should be their course , " us secretary of state condoleezza rice said . " it is now up to iran to make a choice ... between isolation brought about by its own actions or a return to the negotiating table , " added german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , the meeting 's host . but cracks appeared between the major powers here over how to act if iran does not comply . the un statement leaves open what consequences might follow if tehran does not halt uranium enrichment , and russia and china insisted that economic sanctions or military action did not belong on the table . un members still apart on sanctions " russia does not believe that sanctions would serve the purpose of settling the various issues , " lavrov said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier : it 's iran 's choice in a clear warning against any the use of force to settle the standoff , chinese deputy foreign minister dai bingguo said that any such move would unleash chaos in the region . " the chinese side feels there has already been enough turmoil in the middle east and we do not want to see more turmoil introduced into the region , " he said . the un talks had been marred by differences between the united states and its western allies on the one hand and russia and china on the other over how to coax tehran away from uranium enrichment , which could be used to build a nuclear bomb . watered-down solution the statement that finally prevailed is a watered-down version of a franco-british statement that calls on iran to meet demands from the un nuclear watchdog , the iaea . it expresses clear concern that iran is trying to acquire nuclear weapons secretly , demands that iran comply with the wishes of the iaea governing board and calls for an iaea report within 30 days . the non-binding un security council declaration was seen as a bid to placate russia and china , which have opposed any hint of punitive measures against iran , an ally and key trading partner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran and president mahmoud ahmadinejad are stubborn in a further concession , the co-sponsors extended the deadline to 30 days from the 14 days they had initially sought . fears of a bomb besides rice , lavrov , steinmeier and dai , the working lunch in berlin brought together foreign secretary jack straw of britain , foreign minister philippe douste-blazy of france and eu foreign policy chief javier solana . washington and european powers believe iran has ambitions of building a nuclear bomb , which they argue would destabilize the entire region . tehran vehemently denies the charge and says its nuclear program is purely peaceful .
it is unclear how the crisis will unfold if iran refuses to buckle before the 30 day deadline is up . mottaki , speaking to the un conference on disarmament in geneva said , iran would formally offer to set up a " regional consortium " to enrich fuel for its nuclear program , implying that it would be set up in iran . dw staff / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world powers meet in berlin to show unity on iran angela merkel will host an emergency meeting of un security council members in berlin on thursday to break the deadlock on a draft resolution regarding iran 's nuclear ambitions .

the american software giant has one last chance to convince eu regulators it is complying with a two-year old ruling .
failure means 2 million euros in daily fines . facing the threat of daily fines , microsoft tried to convince eu anti-trust regulators thursday that the us software giant is meeting their demands to comply with a landmark 2004 competition ruling . even before the start of a two-day closed-door hearing , microsoft came out fighting , saying that new fines would not resolve the long-standing competition row . " in our view , a fine is not the answer , " said microsoft 's top lawyer , brad smith , as he arrived for the hearing with the european commission . in response , commission spokesman for competition issues jonathan todd said that the commission had little choice but to brandish the threat of fines . " also from the commission 's perspective , fines are not the best way to resolve the conflict but two years after the decision , we have tried all other ways so that microsoft complies with the decision and it has still not done so , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new microsoft operating system vista may come under scrutiny also microsoft 's last chance the hearing is likely to be the microsoft 's last chance to prove it is complying with the european commission before regulators slap a daily fine of up to 2 million euros -lrb- $ 2.4 million -rrb- a day . smith , who is microsoft 's general counsel and is also third in command at the company , led a team of about 50 people including lawyers and computer scientists in its ranks . " we need clear guidance to find a solution , " he said .
" ultimately , the point i think we 'll underscore is this : we have complied and we 're willing to do more . " brussels growing impatient the commission is at pains to force microsoft to respect a march 2004 anti-trust ruling , in which the company was fined 497 million euros for abusing its dominant market position . microsoft was ordered to sell a version of its widely-used windows operating system unbundled from its media player software and to divulge information on its operating system needed by manufacturers of rival products . brussels has grown increasingly impatient for evidence that microsoft will comply and in december threatened to slap a fine , back-dated to december 15 , of up to 2 million euros a day on the company .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union commissioner for competition mario monti says microsoft is guilty of abusing its " near monopoly " but the company says that it has offered more than the commission has asked for by promising to reveal millions of lines of windows computer code for rivals to use to develop programs that work with it . however , an independent trustee advising the commission has deemed the offer to be " totally useless " . " it 's not necessary for microsoft to go beyond what we are asking for , " said todd .
" it would be quite sufficient for them to do what they are supposed to do in accordance with the decision of march 2004 . " he also said that although there were firms that found the offer to reveal computer code to be useful , " there are many companies that have told us that the information provided by microsoft is not suitable . " the european commission warned that it could open a new front in the standoff with microsoft if its new delay-plagued vista operating system did not respect anti-trust law . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de microsoft agrees to share source code in eu microsoft has said it will comply with the eu and license its source code - necessary for competitors to build compatible products .

answer : the fifa world cup .
you can say it ... but you ca n't wear it .
not without a license anyway . nearly every company in germany wants to make money on the upcoming world cup in june .
but not everyone is allowed to advertise with the logo .
fifa , world soccer 's governing body , has laid down strict criteria for world cup 2006 slogans and advertising . while soccer fans are gearing up for the world cup , the biggest event the sport has to offer , others are dreaming about how to make big bucks from it . but far from being a free-for-all cash cow which benefits everyone , the soccer powers-that-be have stipulated that only official fifa sponsors are allowed to sell their goods using the world cup 2006 tag which puts some traders on the wrong side of the tournament organizers and potentially on the wrong side of the law . the official sponsors , companies like automaker hyundai and sports equipment giant adidas amongst others , are the only ones allowed to use certain trademarks copyrighted by fifa .
and they have certainly paid for the privilege . these " official " companies have paid around 45 million euros each for exclusive permission to use the world cup for advertising purposes .
in addition , there are the national sponsors like german railways , postbank and others who have each paid 13 million euros for the rights , but may only use the world cup logo for their advertising within germany . fifa believes that the high price for getting on the exclusive list is worth it and that those who intend to use the trademarks without acquiring these rights should be punished .
fifa spokesman andreas herren says it is only what official sponsors would expect .
" companies who have acquired these rights of course deserve to be protected against this so-called ‘ ambush marketing ’ by free-riders . " those who unofficially use the world cup to make money face tough consequences .
during the 2002 world cup in japan / korea , for instance , fifa tracked down nearly 2,000 cases of fraud in 88 different countries .
over three million products were confiscated . official brand names a particularly prickly subject bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : official fifa products carry licensed logos and authenticity tags fifa gets particularly picky with the brand names " 2006 fifa world cup germany " and " world cup 2006 . "
those slogans enjoy special trademark protection .
those who abuse the trademark rights face punishment , says trademark lawyer martin chakraborty . " if someone uses the trademark illegally , say , to print it on t-shirts or baseballs caps to be sold outside the stadiums , then he will face a restraining order and could have to pay damages to fifa , " he says . visitors who buy and wear the unlicensed products could be forced by personnel to remove them at the stadiums .
however , not only would that mean potentially thousands of semi-naked fans teeming through the turnstiles ; it would also infringe on personal rights and freedom of action . spectators would have to stand up to the personnel and insist on their right to wear what they want which could lead to confrontation fifa and the german organizers are eager to avoid . high street traders unaware of potential fifa wrath while fifa expects businesses across germany to adhere to its strong-arm trademark policies , it seems that its message has not spread far enough to reach those who may be affected by it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knock-off merchandise can get traders into trouble in the cologne suburb of vingst , a number of traders were still blissfully unaware that selling unlicensed world cup products featuring seemingly innocuous slogans such as " world cup 2006 " could land them in hot water with the global soccer body . " i know these baseball caps are not licensed but i 'm not selling them as such , " said achim b. , the proprietor of a discount store selling a range of soccer related products .
" i 'm not trying to con anyone .
if they want to pay an extra 20 euros for the real thing , that ’ s up to them . " when informed that even the slogan " world cup 06 " could contravene fifa trademark rules , achim replied , " what else are we going to call it ?
soccer world championships 2006 ?
no one will know what that is ?
it 's the world cup .
anyway , i 'd never be able to fit that on a cap . " " crazy " fifa going too far , say shop owners " it 's just stupid , " said another trader who wished to remain anonymous .
" what will they do next ?
stop us from selling footballs because they have something to do with the world cup ?
we 'd have to call them ' balls to be kicked by the feet ' .
people would think i was crazy - just like fifa . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : champ 06 unofficial merchandise many companies have gotten around the strict trademark rules by marketing their products under world cup related headings without actually using the protected brand names .
however , the products lack a certain credibility without the world cup in the title and are perceived as cheap as a result . businesses are not alone in suffering under fifa 's control-freakery .
local authorities have also found that organizing small scale world cup related events under certain trademarked slogans could incur fifa 's wrath . katja hartmann , the events director with the phoenix sports club near ostheim , was forced to rename her world cup opening day festivities in line with fifa rules . local opening gala forced to change its name " we intended to hold our gala on june 9 under the title ' world cup festival 2006 ' but after applying for the necessary licenses we were advised by lawyers that the name could infringe on fifa trademarks .
unless we were willing to pay lots of money to use it , we had to change the name or go ahead and face the consequences . " " it was not such a big deal to change it but we felt pressured .
people should be allowed to celebrate the fact the world cup is in germany and call it just that .
the world cup is about the people but it seems that they are being pushed out of the picture in favor of money-making and marketing , " she added .
" our ' cup fest 06 ' will go ahead but it has lost its shine a bit .

not without a license anyway . nearly every company in germany wants to make money on the upcoming world cup in june .
but not everyone is allowed to advertise with the logo .
fifa , world soccer 's governing body , has laid down strict criteria for world cup 2006 slogans and advertising . while soccer fans are gearing up for the world cup , the biggest event the sport has to offer , others are dreaming about how to make big bucks from it . but far from being a free-for-all cash cow which benefits everyone , the soccer powers-that-be have stipulated that only official fifa sponsors are allowed to sell their goods using the world cup 2006 tag which puts some traders on the wrong side of the tournament organizers and potentially on the wrong side of the law . the official sponsors , companies like automaker hyundai and sports equipment giant adidas amongst others , are the only ones allowed to use certain trademarks copyrighted by fifa .
and they have certainly paid for the privilege . these " official " companies have paid around 45 million euros each for exclusive permission to use the world cup for advertising purposes .
in addition , there are the national sponsors like german railways , postbank and others who have each paid 13 million euros for the rights , but may only use the world cup logo for their advertising within germany . fifa believes that the high price for getting on the exclusive list is worth it and that those who intend to use the trademarks without acquiring these rights should be punished .
fifa spokesman andreas herren says it is only what official sponsors would expect .
" companies who have acquired these rights of course deserve to be protected against this so-called ‘ ambush marketing ’ by free-riders . " those who unofficially use the world cup to make money face tough consequences .
during the 2002 world cup in japan / korea , for instance , fifa tracked down nearly 2,000 cases of fraud in 88 different countries .
over three million products were confiscated . official brand names a particularly prickly subject bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : official fifa products carry licensed logos and authenticity tags fifa gets particularly picky with the brand names " 2006 fifa world cup germany " and " world cup 2006 . "
those slogans enjoy special trademark protection .
those who abuse the trademark rights face punishment , says trademark lawyer martin chakraborty . " if someone uses the trademark illegally , say , to print it on t-shirts or baseballs caps to be sold outside the stadiums , then he will face a restraining order and could have to pay damages to fifa , " he says . visitors who buy and wear the unlicensed products could be forced by personnel to remove them at the stadiums .
however , not only would that mean potentially thousands of semi-naked fans teeming through the turnstiles ; it would also infringe on personal rights and freedom of action . spectators would have to stand up to the personnel and insist on their right to wear what they want which could lead to confrontation fifa and the german organizers are eager to avoid . high street traders unaware of potential fifa wrath while fifa expects businesses across germany to adhere to its strong-arm trademark policies , it seems that its message has not spread far enough to reach those who may be affected by it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knock-off merchandise can get traders into trouble in the cologne suburb of vingst , a number of traders were still blissfully unaware that selling unlicensed world cup products featuring seemingly innocuous slogans such as " world cup 2006 " could land them in hot water with the global soccer body . " i know these baseball caps are not licensed but i 'm not selling them as such , " said achim b. , the proprietor of a discount store selling a range of soccer related products .
" i 'm not trying to con anyone .
if they want to pay an extra 20 euros for the real thing , that ’ s up to them . " when informed that even the slogan " world cup 06 " could contravene fifa trademark rules , achim replied , " what else are we going to call it ?
soccer world championships 2006 ?
no one will know what that is ?
it 's the world cup .
anyway , i 'd never be able to fit that on a cap . " " crazy " fifa going too far , say shop owners " it 's just stupid , " said another trader who wished to remain anonymous .
" what will they do next ?
stop us from selling footballs because they have something to do with the world cup ?
we 'd have to call them ' balls to be kicked by the feet ' .
people would think i was crazy - just like fifa . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : champ 06 unofficial merchandise many companies have gotten around the strict trademark rules by marketing their products under world cup related headings without actually using the protected brand names .
however , the products lack a certain credibility without the world cup in the title and are perceived as cheap as a result . businesses are not alone in suffering under fifa 's control-freakery .
local authorities have also found that organizing small scale world cup related events under certain trademarked slogans could incur fifa 's wrath . katja hartmann , the events director with the phoenix sports club near ostheim , was forced to rename her world cup opening day festivities in line with fifa rules . local opening gala forced to change its name " we intended to hold our gala on june 9 under the title ' world cup festival 2006 ' but after applying for the necessary licenses we were advised by lawyers that the name could infringe on fifa trademarks .
unless we were willing to pay lots of money to use it , we had to change the name or go ahead and face the consequences . " " it was not such a big deal to change it but we felt pressured .
people should be allowed to celebrate the fact the world cup is in germany and call it just that .

a new recycling system for electronics has been kicked off and manufacturers are getting the bill . you see them in or beside trash dumpsters or just sitting forlornly next to the curb : bulky beige computer monitors or dot-matrix printers , answering machines , refrigerators or that mobile phone that was the hippest must-have last year but is a unloved dinosaur now . they are all part of germany 's growing pile of electronic waste , which , according to the country 's environment ministry , amounts to about 1.8 million tons annually .
the new recycling requirements that require consumers to take their waste electronics to collection centers or have them picked up , is aimed at getting the rushing river of burned out components , shot transformers and obsolete electronic gadgets under control . " no type of trash has grown so rapidly recently as electronic waste , which has tripled in just a few years , " said eva leonhardt , waste expert at the environmental group deutsche umwelthilfe , which has set up a hotline to help people out with the new recycling rules .
" twenty years ago , the development cycle for electronics was around four years , now it 's three months .
that has led to an enormous increase in the amount of electronic trash . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : full of hazardous materials while beige computer boxes and refrigerators left on city sidewalks are unsightly , they can also be dangerous .
circuit boards , batteries and crts can contain hazardous materials such as lead and mercury while televisions usually also contain lead .
brominated flame retardants are commonly added to plastics used in electronics .
all these toxins can be released into the environment through incinerator ash or leach into the soil at landfills . " there are also recyclable waste in these products , like copper , aluminum , steel and sometimes even precious metals , " said leonhardt .
" to not use these materials again is almost criminal . " do n't just toss it on friday , germany 's " act governing the sale , return and environmentally sound disposal of electrical and electronic equipment " went into force .
the rules , better know as the electronic equipment law , require manufacturers to cover the cost of collecting and recycling consumer electronics and appliances .
they are designed to conform to an eu directive on electronic waste passed in 2004 . consumers are now asked to take their old electronic equipment and appliances to central collection areas , where special containers have been set up to receive them .
if consumers continue to throw their electronic waste in the normal trash , they can be fined . after that , it 's up to manufacturers to take care of things , since the law requires them to pick up the cost of recycling their products no longer in use .
companies who put any of 10 categories of electronic equipment on the german market have had to register with a central clearing house , called ear , which coordinates the collection . that does not mean that , for example , siemens sends out collection trucks to pick up its own discarded mobile phones and other equipment in the 1,500 collection areas around the country .
rather , in a complicated process , ear calculates the quantities of old electronics that each registered producer is required to collect from waste management authorities based on the amount the company puts on the market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dumpsters like this are off-limits for electronics companies can then contract with private recycling firms or other groups to disassemble the electronic waste , or do it themselves .
they then must dispose of the toxic materials in environmentally sound ways , and can either re-use recyclable materials , or sell them abroad , as is often the case , since more and more electronics manufacturing is being done in asia . " no , you ca n't really say we were supporters of these regulations , since it is going to cost manufacturers between 300 and 500 million euros -lrb- $ 360 - $ 600 -rrb- a year , " said otmar frey of the german electrical and electronic manufacturers ' association , even though his group decided to take a role in helping german lawmakers write up rules for implementing the eu directive . " we decided it would be better not to wait until others came up with rules that we would have a hard time living with , " he said .
the association did not want a repeat of the fiasco that followed the introduction of a deposit system on beverage cans and bottles , which many experts say was poorly thought through . in fact , according to frey and others , the electronics recycling system , although operational for less than a week , is running smoothly so far . higher costs in the store ? while environmental groups are cheering the new rules , trade associations say consumers will likely pay a price , although they are not being directly charged for the new plan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these could get more expensive because of the new rules according to germany 's leading retail association hde , producers will pass along the new recycling costs to consumers eventually .
the disposal of a washing machine costs around eight euros -lrb- $ 9.60 -rrb- , a refrigerator 15 euros -lrb- $ 18 -rrb- , and a television set around 10 euros -lrb- $ 12 -rrb- .
those amounts could soon be incorporated into the price tag . slow going around europe the eu electronic waste directive was supposed to have been implemented by member states by august 2005 , but most countries missed that deadline , including germany . while austria did get a registration and collection system online on schedule , it had not yet figured out what do with the old electronics once they had been turned in .
for months , collection centers were full of growing piles of plastic , glass and circuitry . # b # holland , belgium and sweden have systems in place , as do the swiss , although they are not part of the eu .
some countries are halfway there , such as hungary , although others , such as france , italy and the uk , have done little or nothing to turn the eu guidelines into national law .
the uk does not anticipate having a national system in place until 2007 . " several of these countries are facing proceedings because they are in breach of eu rules , " said frey . several of those countries with electronics recycling programs have organized them differently .
while germany separates its electronics according to functional category , austria does it by size , and hungary by tax number .
that will make any kind of cross-border cooperation more difficult , especially for manufacturers active internationally , said waste expert leonhardt . " there will be a surprise waiting for electronics producers in every eu country , " she said . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de car sharing picks up speed once the domain of the decidedly “ green ” crowd , the concept of car sharing is finding more fans in the mainstream .

" in 2005 , more journalists were imprisoned in nepal than in any other country , " the report pointed out , also criticizing countries like the us and france , in which journalists were prosecuted for refusing to reveal their sources . in africa , the institute said freedom of the press was " being swiftly eroded " and legislation was used to hinder the work of journalists , in particular in zimbabwe where the " government has used every means at its disposal to silence the media .

" this pipeline is not aimed against anyone but is aimed at ensuring the security of gas supplies to europe , " schröder said . " not only in germany but throughout western europe there is growing need for gas , while domestic production is falling , " he said .
" this project is in the interests of germany .
that is why it will be supported by every german government . " schröder added that he would be paid 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 300,000 -rrb- annually for holding the post . the 61-year old former chancellor is also an advisor to swiss media group ringier and international investment bank rothschild and has made lucrative public-speaking appearances . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life 's a gas : the old friends are reunited in business his acceptance of the job less than a month after he left the chancellor 's office last november prompted widespread criticism in germany .
he and russian president vladimir putin had worked closely on cementing german investment in the pipeline . earlier this month a lawyer acting for schröder said that he had won a temporary injunction against the leader of the liberal free democrats , guido westerwelle , preventing him from linking schröder 's post as chancellor to his involvement in the pipeline . appointment and pipeline project under fire the project has also prompted criticism from new eu members lithuania and poland , which complained that schröder had gone over their heads on a pipeline that is likely to pass through several baltic countries ' territorial waters . other members of the supervisory board include gazprom chief executive alexei miller as well as officials from germany 's e.on and basf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe hopes to keep the russian taps turned on gazprom has a 51.0 percent stake in the north european gas pipeline , while stakes of 24.5 percent are held by e.on and basf . matthias warnig , representative of dresdner bank in russia , was named as the pipeline 's managing director . miller on thursday appeared to give backing to the idea of possible involvement in the project by gaz de france .
" this decision could be taken if the new partner brings something new of strategic importance , " miller said in response to a question from journalists . schröder looking to use german links in new role earlier this week schröder paid a visit to gazprom production facilities in the siberian province of yamalo-nenets . he also confirmed that he plans to create a " german-russian think tank " but denied a russian press report that the body would be a lobbying agency for promoting the russian economy in germany . work on the pipeline has already begun onshore in russia that is planned to extend around 1,200 kilometers -lrb- 750 miles -rrb- under the baltic sea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pipeline managing director matthias warnig the pipeline is eventually expected to connect not only to germany but to other parts of western europe , including the netherlands , sweden and britain and is expected to come on stream in 2010 with an initial capacity of around 27.5 billion cubic meters of natural gas a year .
a second pipeline is expected to double capacity to 55 billion cubic meters annually . the first part of the project will cost two to 2.5 billion euros and the total cost of the offshore section of the project will be over four billion euros , management has said . european union officials have sought to reassure new eu members worried that they could be left without supplies if russia no longer has to ship gas through their territory to western europe .

unity is the order of the day . for the past two and a half weeks , the un security council members have been at loggerheads over iran .
great britain , france and the u.s. disagree with russia and china on how to tackle the volatile islamic republic 's nuclear ambitions .
with the need to take a unified stance on the issue pressing , the foreign ministers of the five world powers will meet with merkel and eu foreign policy chief javier solana on how best to proceed .
the goal is to come out of the meeting with a unified stance and , hopefully , a draft resolution on iran that can go before the un security council . a new , weaker resolution ?
the latter will be more difficult to present .
with china and russia so far against hanging economic sanctions on iran , great britain , france and the u.s. are scrambling to find areas on which to compromise . reports out of the un in new york suggest that a new resolution is making the rounds that still forbids iran to enrich a uranium - part of the process of making an atomic bomb - but takes out language that would slap it with sanctions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are sanctions still on the table in the un ? another proposal , by the international crisis group in belgium , would allow uranium enrichment , but force un inspections as well .

" we have n't reached finish line yet , " foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier told the bundestag during a general debate on wednesday . iran has remained resolute in the face of international diplomatic pressure .
after more than two years of negotiations with britain , france and germany , it resumed uranium enrichment earlier this year .
the eu-3 broke off diplomatic negotiations soon after and u.s. representatives began looking for a way to refer the issue to the security council , where sanctions were possible . no military option , no talk of sanctions those plans appear abandoned given the stalemate at the moment - and any sort of military option against the islamic state seems far more unlikely .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uranium enrichment has been taken up again at isfahan " contrary to what has been said , there is no military option on the table .
there is no discussion of sanctions , " friedrich groenig , the head of arms control and disarmament at the german foreign minister told reuters . merkel is hoping for a resolution tomorrow , and says germany 's willingness to host the meeting is a sign of the country 's commitment to being a diplomatic player on the world stage .

" this pipeline is not aimed against anyone but is aimed at ensuring the security of gas supplies to europe , " schröder said . " not only in germany but throughout western europe there is growing need for gas , while domestic production is falling , " he said .
" this project is in the interests of germany .
that is why it will be supported by every german government . " schröder added that he would be paid 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 300,000 -rrb- annually for holding the post . the 61-year old former chancellor is also an advisor to swiss media group ringier and international investment bank rothschild and has made lucrative public-speaking appearances . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life 's a gas : the old friends are reunited in business his acceptance of the job less than a month after he left the chancellor 's office last november prompted widespread criticism in germany .
he and russian president vladimir putin had worked closely on cementing german investment in the pipeline . earlier this month a lawyer acting for schröder said that he had won a temporary injunction against the leader of the liberal free democrats , guido westerwelle , preventing him from linking schröder 's post as chancellor to his involvement in the pipeline . appointment and pipeline project under fire the project has also prompted criticism from new eu members lithuania and poland , which complained that schröder had gone over their heads on a pipeline that is likely to pass through several baltic countries ' territorial waters . other members of the supervisory board include gazprom chief executive alexei miller as well as officials from germany 's e.on and basf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe hopes to keep the russian taps turned on gazprom has a 51.0 percent stake in the north european gas pipeline , while stakes of 24.5 percent are held by e.on and basf . matthias warnig , representative of dresdner bank in russia , was named as the pipeline 's managing director . miller on thursday appeared to give backing to the idea of possible involvement in the project by gaz de france .
" this decision could be taken if the new partner brings something new of strategic importance , " miller said in response to a question from journalists . schröder looking to use german links in new role earlier this week schröder paid a visit to gazprom production facilities in the siberian province of yamalo-nenets . he also confirmed that he plans to create a " german-russian think tank " but denied a russian press report that the body would be a lobbying agency for promoting the russian economy in germany . work on the pipeline has already begun onshore in russia that is planned to extend around 1,200 kilometers -lrb- 750 miles -rrb- under the baltic sea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pipeline managing director matthias warnig the pipeline is eventually expected to connect not only to germany but to other parts of western europe , including the netherlands , sweden and britain and is expected to come on stream in 2010 with an initial capacity of around 27.5 billion cubic meters of natural gas a year .
a second pipeline is expected to double capacity to 55 billion cubic meters annually . the first part of the project will cost two to 2.5 billion euros and the total cost of the offshore section of the project will be over four billion euros , management has said . european union officials have sought to reassure new eu members worried that they could be left without supplies if russia no longer has to ship gas through their territory to western europe .
the eu expects the pipeline to be used to increase supplies to europe rather than for rerouting existing deliveries , an eu official said recently . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's schröder bags top us public speaking deal former german chancellor schröder certainly knows how to stay in the headlines .

unity is the order of the day . for the past two and a half weeks , the un security council members have been at loggerheads over iran .
great britain , france and the u.s. disagree with russia and china on how to tackle the volatile islamic republic 's nuclear ambitions .
with the need to take a unified stance on the issue pressing , the foreign ministers of the five world powers will meet with merkel and eu foreign policy chief javier solana on how best to proceed .
the goal is to come out of the meeting with a unified stance and , hopefully , a draft resolution on iran that can go before the un security council . a new , weaker resolution ?
the latter will be more difficult to present .
with china and russia so far against hanging economic sanctions on iran , great britain , france and the u.s. are scrambling to find areas on which to compromise . reports out of the un in new york suggest that a new resolution is making the rounds that still forbids iran to enrich a uranium - part of the process of making an atomic bomb - but takes out language that would slap it with sanctions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are sanctions still on the table in the un ? another proposal , by the international crisis group in belgium , would allow uranium enrichment , but force un inspections as well .
the proposal is favored by a deputy of german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who said the participants thursday would likely consider the idea . not at the finish line but a solid solution remains far off . " we have n't reached finish line yet , " foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier told the bundestag during a general debate on wednesday . iran has remained resolute in the face of international diplomatic pressure .
after more than two years of negotiations with britain , france and germany , it resumed uranium enrichment earlier this year .
the eu-3 broke off diplomatic negotiations soon after and u.s. representatives began looking for a way to refer the issue to the security council , where sanctions were possible . no military option , no talk of sanctions those plans appear abandoned given the stalemate at the moment - and any sort of military option against the islamic state seems far more unlikely .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uranium enrichment has been taken up again at isfahan " contrary to what has been said , there is no military option on the table .
there is no discussion of sanctions , " friedrich groenig , the head of arms control and disarmament at the german foreign minister told reuters . merkel is hoping for a resolution tomorrow , and says germany 's willingness to host the meeting is a sign of the country 's commitment to being a diplomatic player on the world stage .
germany , she said , wants to contribute to the clear signal towards iran or " what works in international politics and what does n't .

" iran 's decision on enrichment , particularly research and development is irreversible , " iranian ambassador to the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- aliasghar soltanieh in vienna told afp .
foreign minister manouchehr mottaki , speaking in geneva , described the un declaration as an " angry precedent " and a " bad move " . iran struck the defiant stance even as foreign ministers of the security council permanent members plus germany met in berlin to chart their next moves in the standoff . the un security council on wednesday unanimously approved a non-binding statement giving iran 30 days to abandon its uranium enrichment activities , ending a weeks-long impasse .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian foreign minister mottaki negotiation , not confrontation " this is a strong sign to iran that negotiation not confrontation should be their course , " us secretary of state condoleezza rice said . " it is now up to iran to make a choice ... between isolation brought about by its own actions or a return to the negotiating table , " added german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , the meeting 's host . but cracks appeared between the major powers here over how to act if iran does not comply . the un statement leaves open what consequences might follow if tehran does not halt uranium enrichment , and russia and china insisted that economic sanctions or military action did not belong on the table . un members still apart on sanctions " russia does not believe that sanctions would serve the purpose of settling the various issues , " lavrov said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier : it 's iran 's choice in a clear warning against any the use of force to settle the standoff , chinese deputy foreign minister dai bingguo said that any such move would unleash chaos in the region . " the chinese side feels there has already been enough turmoil in the middle east and we do not want to see more turmoil introduced into the region , " he said . the un talks had been marred by differences between the united states and its western allies on the one hand and russia and china on the other over how to coax tehran away from uranium enrichment , which could be used to build a nuclear bomb . watered-down solution the statement that finally prevailed is a watered-down version of a franco-british statement that calls on iran to meet demands from the un nuclear watchdog , the iaea . it expresses clear concern that iran is trying to acquire nuclear weapons secretly , demands that iran comply with the wishes of the iaea governing board and calls for an iaea report within 30 days . the non-binding un security council declaration was seen as a bid to placate russia and china , which have opposed any hint of punitive measures against iran , an ally and key trading partner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran and president mahmoud ahmadinejad are stubborn in a further concession , the co-sponsors extended the deadline to 30 days from the 14 days they had initially sought . fears of a bomb besides rice , lavrov , steinmeier and dai , the working lunch in berlin brought together foreign secretary jack straw of britain , foreign minister philippe douste-blazy of france and eu foreign policy chief javier solana . washington and european powers believe iran has ambitions of building a nuclear bomb , which they argue would destabilize the entire region . tehran vehemently denies the charge and says its nuclear program is purely peaceful .
it is unclear how the crisis will unfold if iran refuses to buckle before the 30 day deadline is up . mottaki , speaking to the un conference on disarmament in geneva said , iran would formally offer to set up a " regional consortium " to enrich fuel for its nuclear program , implying that it would be set up in iran . dw staff / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world powers meet in berlin to show unity on iran angela merkel will host an emergency meeting of un security council members in berlin on thursday to break the deadlock on a draft resolution regarding iran 's nuclear ambitions .

but while some call for sanctions , others say such measures will punish the wrong people . the eu must firmly condemn the belarus regime for its bloody crackdown on opposition supporters after presidential polls , but should not impose sanctions that hurt the people , polish prime minister kazimierz marcinkiewicz said in riga thursday .

poland has already imposed travel restrictions on belarusian officials it accused of falsifying results in the former soviet republic 's presidential election on march 19 in which " europe 's last dictator " won a landslide victory in a poll judged fraudulent by the eu , the u.s. and international observers . german chancellor angela merkel on wednesday denounced the belarus presidential election as marred by " massive fraud " as the lower house of parliament passed a resolution calling for the immediate release of arrested belarusian opposition activists and sanctions against the country by the european union . " this election was subject to massive fraud and somebody has to say so , " merkel told the bundestag . more than 500 arrested the german members of parliament are proposing to invite the main belarusian opposition candidate , alexander milinkevich , to the next meeting of eu foreign ministers in luxembourg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belarus ' opposition leader alexander milinkevich says he will return to belarus and continue to fight milinkevich , who led protests against the re-election of president alexander lukashenko , said he was going to poland thursday to tell the outside world what was going on in his country . " in the polish parliament i intend to say what is really happening in belarus , " alexander milinkevich told reuters .
he added that he had no plans to emigrate even though he faces jail if he returns to belarus in connection with the protests . so far , more than 500 people have been arrested in belarus after a wave of opposition demonstrations resulted in a bloody crackdown by pro-lukashenko security forces .
alexander kozulin , another opposition figure who ran against the president and was detained after the protests , has been charged with hooliganism and faces up to six years in jail . meanwhile , lukashenko postponed his inauguration friday to april with some suggesting that the protests , which drew as many as 10,000 people , had scared him .

and business leaders , security experts and law enforcement gathering thursday and friday in london aim to change that . it has been quite a year for e-crime , say experts .
trojan horses have constantly bombarded banks and others in the financial sector .
phishing and identity theft attempts have risen to number about 8 million per day , according to security officials .
e-scams are costing businesses billions and that does n't include increasing funds - about 20 to 50 percent of total expenditures in the us and uk - to beef up security .
and it is only getting worse .
as a result , law enforcement , business and computer specialists have come together for the annual e-crime congress in london thursday and friday to find new methods to fight such cyber predators .
an illustrious group because it is such a growing problem internationally , the conference is attracting bigger names and from further afield , too .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : microsoft 's brad smith offered a reward of $ 5 million to those who help catch cyber criminals attendees include about 500 officials from governments , companies as amazon , ebay , skype and yahoo , bankers from scandinavia , the uk and the middle east and law enforcement such as the fbi , scotland yard and those from the china .
" the 2005 e-crime congress provided an excellent forum for us to interact with law enforcement agencies , security product vendors and others in the financial services industry to discuss the wider issues that affect us , " one british bank security official as quoted on the congress ' website .
e-crime remains a low priority e-crime , like white-collar crime , is low on the list of law enforcement priorities , experts say .
instead , police and intelligence agencies worldwide are busy grappling with violent crimes and terrorism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internet cafes in countries with few cyber or extradition laws are often used by cyber gangs in most countries , police officials are overworked and lack manpower and often expertise to investigate e-crime .
few prosecutors take on such cases and laws often lack teeth , experts say .
that lessens the already low deterrant power of law enforcement against cyber criminals , who already have very low odds of getting caught , especially if they are outside the us or europe .

answer : the fifa world cup .
you can say it ... but you ca n't wear it .
not without a license anyway . nearly every company in germany wants to make money on the upcoming world cup in june .
but not everyone is allowed to advertise with the logo .
fifa , world soccer 's governing body , has laid down strict criteria for world cup 2006 slogans and advertising . while soccer fans are gearing up for the world cup , the biggest event the sport has to offer , others are dreaming about how to make big bucks from it . but far from being a free-for-all cash cow which benefits everyone , the soccer powers-that-be have stipulated that only official fifa sponsors are allowed to sell their goods using the world cup 2006 tag which puts some traders on the wrong side of the tournament organizers and potentially on the wrong side of the law . the official sponsors , companies like automaker hyundai and sports equipment giant adidas amongst others , are the only ones allowed to use certain trademarks copyrighted by fifa .
and they have certainly paid for the privilege . these " official " companies have paid around 45 million euros each for exclusive permission to use the world cup for advertising purposes .
in addition , there are the national sponsors like german railways , postbank and others who have each paid 13 million euros for the rights , but may only use the world cup logo for their advertising within germany . fifa believes that the high price for getting on the exclusive list is worth it and that those who intend to use the trademarks without acquiring these rights should be punished .
fifa spokesman andreas herren says it is only what official sponsors would expect .
" companies who have acquired these rights of course deserve to be protected against this so-called ‘ ambush marketing ’ by free-riders . " those who unofficially use the world cup to make money face tough consequences .
during the 2002 world cup in japan / korea , for instance , fifa tracked down nearly 2,000 cases of fraud in 88 different countries .
over three million products were confiscated . official brand names a particularly prickly subject bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : official fifa products carry licensed logos and authenticity tags fifa gets particularly picky with the brand names " 2006 fifa world cup germany " and " world cup 2006 . "
those slogans enjoy special trademark protection .
those who abuse the trademark rights face punishment , says trademark lawyer martin chakraborty . " if someone uses the trademark illegally , say , to print it on t-shirts or baseballs caps to be sold outside the stadiums , then he will face a restraining order and could have to pay damages to fifa , " he says . visitors who buy and wear the unlicensed products could be forced by personnel to remove them at the stadiums .
however , not only would that mean potentially thousands of semi-naked fans teeming through the turnstiles ; it would also infringe on personal rights and freedom of action . spectators would have to stand up to the personnel and insist on their right to wear what they want which could lead to confrontation fifa and the german organizers are eager to avoid . high street traders unaware of potential fifa wrath while fifa expects businesses across germany to adhere to its strong-arm trademark policies , it seems that its message has not spread far enough to reach those who may be affected by it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knock-off merchandise can get traders into trouble in the cologne suburb of vingst , a number of traders were still blissfully unaware that selling unlicensed world cup products featuring seemingly innocuous slogans such as " world cup 2006 " could land them in hot water with the global soccer body . " i know these baseball caps are not licensed but i 'm not selling them as such , " said achim b. , the proprietor of a discount store selling a range of soccer related products .
" i 'm not trying to con anyone .
if they want to pay an extra 20 euros for the real thing , that ’ s up to them . " when informed that even the slogan " world cup 06 " could contravene fifa trademark rules , achim replied , " what else are we going to call it ?
soccer world championships 2006 ?
no one will know what that is ?
it 's the world cup .
anyway , i 'd never be able to fit that on a cap . " " crazy " fifa going too far , say shop owners " it 's just stupid , " said another trader who wished to remain anonymous .
" what will they do next ?
stop us from selling footballs because they have something to do with the world cup ?
we 'd have to call them ' balls to be kicked by the feet ' .
people would think i was crazy - just like fifa . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : champ 06 unofficial merchandise many companies have gotten around the strict trademark rules by marketing their products under world cup related headings without actually using the protected brand names .
however , the products lack a certain credibility without the world cup in the title and are perceived as cheap as a result . businesses are not alone in suffering under fifa 's control-freakery .
local authorities have also found that organizing small scale world cup related events under certain trademarked slogans could incur fifa 's wrath . katja hartmann , the events director with the phoenix sports club near ostheim , was forced to rename her world cup opening day festivities in line with fifa rules . local opening gala forced to change its name " we intended to hold our gala on june 9 under the title ' world cup festival 2006 ' but after applying for the necessary licenses we were advised by lawyers that the name could infringe on fifa trademarks .
unless we were willing to pay lots of money to use it , we had to change the name or go ahead and face the consequences . " " it was not such a big deal to change it but we felt pressured .
people should be allowed to celebrate the fact the world cup is in germany and call it just that .
the world cup is about the people but it seems that they are being pushed out of the picture in favor of money-making and marketing , " she added .

a new recycling system for electronics has been kicked off and manufacturers are getting the bill . you see them in or beside trash dumpsters or just sitting forlornly next to the curb : bulky beige computer monitors or dot-matrix printers , answering machines , refrigerators or that mobile phone that was the hippest must-have last year but is a unloved dinosaur now . they are all part of germany 's growing pile of electronic waste , which , according to the country 's environment ministry , amounts to about 1.8 million tons annually .
the new recycling requirements that require consumers to take their waste electronics to collection centers or have them picked up , is aimed at getting the rushing river of burned out components , shot transformers and obsolete electronic gadgets under control . " no type of trash has grown so rapidly recently as electronic waste , which has tripled in just a few years , " said eva leonhardt , waste expert at the environmental group deutsche umwelthilfe , which has set up a hotline to help people out with the new recycling rules .
" twenty years ago , the development cycle for electronics was around four years , now it 's three months .
that has led to an enormous increase in the amount of electronic trash . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : full of hazardous materials while beige computer boxes and refrigerators left on city sidewalks are unsightly , they can also be dangerous .
circuit boards , batteries and crts can contain hazardous materials such as lead and mercury while televisions usually also contain lead .
brominated flame retardants are commonly added to plastics used in electronics .
all these toxins can be released into the environment through incinerator ash or leach into the soil at landfills . " there are also recyclable waste in these products , like copper , aluminum , steel and sometimes even precious metals , " said leonhardt .
" to not use these materials again is almost criminal . " do n't just toss it on friday , germany 's " act governing the sale , return and environmentally sound disposal of electrical and electronic equipment " went into force .
the rules , better know as the electronic equipment law , require manufacturers to cover the cost of collecting and recycling consumer electronics and appliances .
they are designed to conform to an eu directive on electronic waste passed in 2004 . consumers are now asked to take their old electronic equipment and appliances to central collection areas , where special containers have been set up to receive them .

a new recycling system for electronics has been kicked off and manufacturers are getting the bill . you see them in or beside trash dumpsters or just sitting forlornly next to the curb : bulky beige computer monitors or dot-matrix printers , answering machines , refrigerators or that mobile phone that was the hippest must-have last year but is a unloved dinosaur now . they are all part of germany 's growing pile of electronic waste , which , according to the country 's environment ministry , amounts to about 1.8 million tons annually .
the new recycling requirements that require consumers to take their waste electronics to collection centers or have them picked up , is aimed at getting the rushing river of burned out components , shot transformers and obsolete electronic gadgets under control . " no type of trash has grown so rapidly recently as electronic waste , which has tripled in just a few years , " said eva leonhardt , waste expert at the environmental group deutsche umwelthilfe , which has set up a hotline to help people out with the new recycling rules .
" twenty years ago , the development cycle for electronics was around four years , now it 's three months .
that has led to an enormous increase in the amount of electronic trash . "

circuit boards , batteries and crts can contain hazardous materials such as lead and mercury while televisions usually also contain lead .

all these toxins can be released into the environment through incinerator ash or leach into the soil at landfills . " there are also recyclable waste in these products , like copper , aluminum , steel and sometimes even precious metals , " said leonhardt .
" to not use these materials again is almost criminal . " do n't just toss it on friday , germany 's " act governing the sale , return and environmentally sound disposal of electrical and electronic equipment " went into force .
the rules , better know as the electronic equipment law , require manufacturers to cover the cost of collecting and recycling consumer electronics and appliances .
they are designed to conform to an eu directive on electronic waste passed in 2004 . consumers are now asked to take their old electronic equipment and appliances to central collection areas , where special containers have been set up to receive them .
if consumers continue to throw their electronic waste in the normal trash , they can be fined . after that , it 's up to manufacturers to take care of things , since the law requires them to pick up the cost of recycling their products no longer in use .

a new recycling system for electronics has been kicked off and manufacturers are getting the bill . you see them in or beside trash dumpsters or just sitting forlornly next to the curb : bulky beige computer monitors or dot-matrix printers , answering machines , refrigerators or that mobile phone that was the hippest must-have last year but is a unloved dinosaur now . they are all part of germany 's growing pile of electronic waste , which , according to the country 's environment ministry , amounts to about 1.8 million tons annually .
the new recycling requirements that require consumers to take their waste electronics to collection centers or have them picked up , is aimed at getting the rushing river of burned out components , shot transformers and obsolete electronic gadgets under control . " no type of trash has grown so rapidly recently as electronic waste , which has tripled in just a few years , " said eva leonhardt , waste expert at the environmental group deutsche umwelthilfe , which has set up a hotline to help people out with the new recycling rules .
" twenty years ago , the development cycle for electronics was around four years , now it 's three months .
that has led to an enormous increase in the amount of electronic trash . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : full of hazardous materials while beige computer boxes and refrigerators left on city sidewalks are unsightly , they can also be dangerous .
circuit boards , batteries and crts can contain hazardous materials such as lead and mercury while televisions usually also contain lead .
brominated flame retardants are commonly added to plastics used in electronics .
all these toxins can be released into the environment through incinerator ash or leach into the soil at landfills . " there are also recyclable waste in these products , like copper , aluminum , steel and sometimes even precious metals , " said leonhardt .
" to not use these materials again is almost criminal . " do n't just toss it on friday , germany 's " act governing the sale , return and environmentally sound disposal of electrical and electronic equipment " went into force .
the rules , better know as the electronic equipment law , require manufacturers to cover the cost of collecting and recycling consumer electronics and appliances .
they are designed to conform to an eu directive on electronic waste passed in 2004 . consumers are now asked to take their old electronic equipment and appliances to central collection areas , where special containers have been set up to receive them .
if consumers continue to throw their electronic waste in the normal trash , they can be fined . after that , it 's up to manufacturers to take care of things , since the law requires them to pick up the cost of recycling their products no longer in use .
companies who put any of 10 categories of electronic equipment on the german market have had to register with a central clearing house , called ear , which coordinates the collection . that does not mean that , for example , siemens sends out collection trucks to pick up its own discarded mobile phones and other equipment in the 1,500 collection areas around the country .
rather , in a complicated process , ear calculates the quantities of old electronics that each registered producer is required to collect from waste management authorities based on the amount the company puts on the market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dumpsters like this are off-limits for electronics companies can then contract with private recycling firms or other groups to disassemble the electronic waste , or do it themselves .
they then must dispose of the toxic materials in environmentally sound ways , and can either re-use recyclable materials , or sell them abroad , as is often the case , since more and more electronics manufacturing is being done in asia . " no , you ca n't really say we were supporters of these regulations , since it is going to cost manufacturers between 300 and 500 million euros -lrb- $ 360 - $ 600 -rrb- a year , " said otmar frey of the german electrical and electronic manufacturers ' association , even though his group decided to take a role in helping german lawmakers write up rules for implementing the eu directive . " we decided it would be better not to wait until others came up with rules that we would have a hard time living with , " he said .
the association did not want a repeat of the fiasco that followed the introduction of a deposit system on beverage cans and bottles , which many experts say was poorly thought through . in fact , according to frey and others , the electronics recycling system , although operational for less than a week , is running smoothly so far . higher costs in the store ? while environmental groups are cheering the new rules , trade associations say consumers will likely pay a price , although they are not being directly charged for the new plan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these could get more expensive because of the new rules according to germany 's leading retail association hde , producers will pass along the new recycling costs to consumers eventually .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 30.03.2006 microsoft battles to avoid daily fines in eu standoff großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : microsoft concessions are unacceptable , eu officials say .
the american software giant has one last chance to convince eu regulators it is complying with a two-year old ruling .
failure means 2 million euros in daily fines . facing the threat of daily fines , microsoft tried to convince eu anti-trust regulators thursday that the us software giant is meeting their demands to comply with a landmark 2004 competition ruling . even before the start of a two-day closed-door hearing , microsoft came out fighting , saying that new fines would not resolve the long-standing competition row . " in our view , a fine is not the answer , " said microsoft 's top lawyer , brad smith , as he arrived for the hearing with the european commission . in response , commission spokesman for competition issues jonathan todd said that the commission had little choice but to brandish the threat of fines . " also from the commission 's perspective , fines are not the best way to resolve the conflict but two years after the decision , we have tried all other ways so that microsoft complies with the decision and it has still not done so , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new microsoft operating system vista may come under scrutiny also microsoft 's last chance the hearing is likely to be the microsoft 's last chance to prove it is complying with the european commission before regulators slap a daily fine of up to 2 million euros -lrb- $ 2.4 million -rrb- a day . smith , who is microsoft 's general counsel and is also third in command at the company , led a team of about 50 people including lawyers and computer scientists in its ranks . " we need clear guidance to find a solution , " he said .
" ultimately , the point i think we 'll underscore is this : we have complied and we 're willing to do more . " brussels growing impatient the commission is at pains to force microsoft to respect a march 2004 anti-trust ruling , in which the company was fined 497 million euros for abusing its dominant market position . microsoft was ordered to sell a version of its widely-used windows operating system unbundled from its media player software and to divulge information on its operating system needed by manufacturers of rival products . brussels has grown increasingly impatient for evidence that microsoft will comply and in december threatened to slap a fine , back-dated to december 15 , of up to 2 million euros a day on the company .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union commissioner for competition mario monti says microsoft is guilty of abusing its " near monopoly " but the company says that it has offered more than the commission has asked for by promising to reveal millions of lines of windows computer code for rivals to use to develop programs that work with it . however , an independent trustee advising the commission has deemed the offer to be " totally useless " . " it 's not necessary for microsoft to go beyond what we are asking for , " said todd .
" it would be quite sufficient for them to do what they are supposed to do in accordance with the decision of march 2004 . " he also said that although there were firms that found the offer to reveal computer code to be useful , " there are many companies that have told us that the information provided by microsoft is not suitable . " the european commission warned that it could open a new front in the standoff with microsoft if its new delay-plagued vista operating system did not respect anti-trust law . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de microsoft agrees to share source code in eu microsoft has said it will comply with the eu and license its source code - necessary for competitors to build compatible products .

a new recycling system for electronics has been kicked off and manufacturers are getting the bill . you see them in or beside trash dumpsters or just sitting forlornly next to the curb : bulky beige computer monitors or dot-matrix printers , answering machines , refrigerators or that mobile phone that was the hippest must-have last year but is a unloved dinosaur now . they are all part of germany 's growing pile of electronic waste , which , according to the country 's environment ministry , amounts to about 1.8 million tons annually .
the new recycling requirements that require consumers to take their waste electronics to collection centers or have them picked up , is aimed at getting the rushing river of burned out components , shot transformers and obsolete electronic gadgets under control . " no type of trash has grown so rapidly recently as electronic waste , which has tripled in just a few years , " said eva leonhardt , waste expert at the environmental group deutsche umwelthilfe , which has set up a hotline to help people out with the new recycling rules .
" twenty years ago , the development cycle for electronics was around four years , now it 's three months .
that has led to an enormous increase in the amount of electronic trash . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : full of hazardous materials while beige computer boxes and refrigerators left on city sidewalks are unsightly , they can also be dangerous .
circuit boards , batteries and crts can contain hazardous materials such as lead and mercury while televisions usually also contain lead .
brominated flame retardants are commonly added to plastics used in electronics .
all these toxins can be released into the environment through incinerator ash or leach into the soil at landfills . " there are also recyclable waste in these products , like copper , aluminum , steel and sometimes even precious metals , " said leonhardt .
" to not use these materials again is almost criminal . " do n't just toss it on friday , germany 's " act governing the sale , return and environmentally sound disposal of electrical and electronic equipment " went into force .
the rules , better know as the electronic equipment law , require manufacturers to cover the cost of collecting and recycling consumer electronics and appliances .
they are designed to conform to an eu directive on electronic waste passed in 2004 . consumers are now asked to take their old electronic equipment and appliances to central collection areas , where special containers have been set up to receive them .
if consumers continue to throw their electronic waste in the normal trash , they can be fined . after that , it 's up to manufacturers to take care of things , since the law requires them to pick up the cost of recycling their products no longer in use .
companies who put any of 10 categories of electronic equipment on the german market have had to register with a central clearing house , called ear , which coordinates the collection . that does not mean that , for example , siemens sends out collection trucks to pick up its own discarded mobile phones and other equipment in the 1,500 collection areas around the country .
rather , in a complicated process , ear calculates the quantities of old electronics that each registered producer is required to collect from waste management authorities based on the amount the company puts on the market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dumpsters like this are off-limits for electronics companies can then contract with private recycling firms or other groups to disassemble the electronic waste , or do it themselves .
they then must dispose of the toxic materials in environmentally sound ways , and can either re-use recyclable materials , or sell them abroad , as is often the case , since more and more electronics manufacturing is being done in asia . " no , you ca n't really say we were supporters of these regulations , since it is going to cost manufacturers between 300 and 500 million euros -lrb- $ 360 - $ 600 -rrb- a year , " said otmar frey of the german electrical and electronic manufacturers ' association , even though his group decided to take a role in helping german lawmakers write up rules for implementing the eu directive . " we decided it would be better not to wait until others came up with rules that we would have a hard time living with , " he said .
the association did not want a repeat of the fiasco that followed the introduction of a deposit system on beverage cans and bottles , which many experts say was poorly thought through . in fact , according to frey and others , the electronics recycling system , although operational for less than a week , is running smoothly so far . higher costs in the store ? while environmental groups are cheering the new rules , trade associations say consumers will likely pay a price , although they are not being directly charged for the new plan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these could get more expensive because of the new rules according to germany 's leading retail association hde , producers will pass along the new recycling costs to consumers eventually .

those amounts could soon be incorporated into the price tag . slow going around europe the eu electronic waste directive was supposed to have been implemented by member states by august 2005 , but most countries missed that deadline , including germany . while austria did get a registration and collection system online on schedule , it had not yet figured out what do with the old electronics once they had been turned in .

answer : the fifa world cup .
you can say it ... but you ca n't wear it .
not without a license anyway . nearly every company in germany wants to make money on the upcoming world cup in june .
but not everyone is allowed to advertise with the logo .
fifa , world soccer 's governing body , has laid down strict criteria for world cup 2006 slogans and advertising . while soccer fans are gearing up for the world cup , the biggest event the sport has to offer , others are dreaming about how to make big bucks from it . but far from being a free-for-all cash cow which benefits everyone , the soccer powers-that-be have stipulated that only official fifa sponsors are allowed to sell their goods using the world cup 2006 tag which puts some traders on the wrong side of the tournament organizers and potentially on the wrong side of the law . the official sponsors , companies like automaker hyundai and sports equipment giant adidas amongst others , are the only ones allowed to use certain trademarks copyrighted by fifa .
and they have certainly paid for the privilege . these " official " companies have paid around 45 million euros each for exclusive permission to use the world cup for advertising purposes .
in addition , there are the national sponsors like german railways , postbank and others who have each paid 13 million euros for the rights , but may only use the world cup logo for their advertising within germany . fifa believes that the high price for getting on the exclusive list is worth it and that those who intend to use the trademarks without acquiring these rights should be punished .
fifa spokesman andreas herren says it is only what official sponsors would expect .
" companies who have acquired these rights of course deserve to be protected against this so-called ‘ ambush marketing ’ by free-riders . " those who unofficially use the world cup to make money face tough consequences .
during the 2002 world cup in japan / korea , for instance , fifa tracked down nearly 2,000 cases of fraud in 88 different countries .
over three million products were confiscated . official brand names a particularly prickly subject bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : official fifa products carry licensed logos and authenticity tags fifa gets particularly picky with the brand names " 2006 fifa world cup germany " and " world cup 2006 . "
those slogans enjoy special trademark protection .

answer : the fifa world cup .
you can say it ... but you ca n't wear it .
not without a license anyway . nearly every company in germany wants to make money on the upcoming world cup in june .
but not everyone is allowed to advertise with the logo .
fifa , world soccer 's governing body , has laid down strict criteria for world cup 2006 slogans and advertising . while soccer fans are gearing up for the world cup , the biggest event the sport has to offer , others are dreaming about how to make big bucks from it . but far from being a free-for-all cash cow which benefits everyone , the soccer powers-that-be have stipulated that only official fifa sponsors are allowed to sell their goods using the world cup 2006 tag which puts some traders on the wrong side of the tournament organizers and potentially on the wrong side of the law . the official sponsors , companies like automaker hyundai and sports equipment giant adidas amongst others , are the only ones allowed to use certain trademarks copyrighted by fifa .
and they have certainly paid for the privilege . these " official " companies have paid around 45 million euros each for exclusive permission to use the world cup for advertising purposes .
in addition , there are the national sponsors like german railways , postbank and others who have each paid 13 million euros for the rights , but may only use the world cup logo for their advertising within germany . fifa believes that the high price for getting on the exclusive list is worth it and that those who intend to use the trademarks without acquiring these rights should be punished .
fifa spokesman andreas herren says it is only what official sponsors would expect .
" companies who have acquired these rights of course deserve to be protected against this so-called ‘ ambush marketing ’ by free-riders . " those who unofficially use the world cup to make money face tough consequences .
during the 2002 world cup in japan / korea , for instance , fifa tracked down nearly 2,000 cases of fraud in 88 different countries .
over three million products were confiscated . official brand names a particularly prickly subject bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : official fifa products carry licensed logos and authenticity tags fifa gets particularly picky with the brand names " 2006 fifa world cup germany " and " world cup 2006 . "
those slogans enjoy special trademark protection .
those who abuse the trademark rights face punishment , says trademark lawyer martin chakraborty . " if someone uses the trademark illegally , say , to print it on t-shirts or baseballs caps to be sold outside the stadiums , then he will face a restraining order and could have to pay damages to fifa , " he says . visitors who buy and wear the unlicensed products could be forced by personnel to remove them at the stadiums .

answer : the fifa world cup .
you can say it ... but you ca n't wear it .
not without a license anyway . nearly every company in germany wants to make money on the upcoming world cup in june .
but not everyone is allowed to advertise with the logo .
fifa , world soccer 's governing body , has laid down strict criteria for world cup 2006 slogans and advertising . while soccer fans are gearing up for the world cup , the biggest event the sport has to offer , others are dreaming about how to make big bucks from it . but far from being a free-for-all cash cow which benefits everyone , the soccer powers-that-be have stipulated that only official fifa sponsors are allowed to sell their goods using the world cup 2006 tag which puts some traders on the wrong side of the tournament organizers and potentially on the wrong side of the law . the official sponsors , companies like automaker hyundai and sports equipment giant adidas amongst others , are the only ones allowed to use certain trademarks copyrighted by fifa .
and they have certainly paid for the privilege . these " official " companies have paid around 45 million euros each for exclusive permission to use the world cup for advertising purposes .
in addition , there are the national sponsors like german railways , postbank and others who have each paid 13 million euros for the rights , but may only use the world cup logo for their advertising within germany . fifa believes that the high price for getting on the exclusive list is worth it and that those who intend to use the trademarks without acquiring these rights should be punished .
fifa spokesman andreas herren says it is only what official sponsors would expect .
" companies who have acquired these rights of course deserve to be protected against this so-called ‘ ambush marketing ’ by free-riders . " those who unofficially use the world cup to make money face tough consequences .
during the 2002 world cup in japan / korea , for instance , fifa tracked down nearly 2,000 cases of fraud in 88 different countries .
over three million products were confiscated . official brand names a particularly prickly subject bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : official fifa products carry licensed logos and authenticity tags fifa gets particularly picky with the brand names " 2006 fifa world cup germany " and " world cup 2006 . "
those slogans enjoy special trademark protection .
those who abuse the trademark rights face punishment , says trademark lawyer martin chakraborty . " if someone uses the trademark illegally , say , to print it on t-shirts or baseballs caps to be sold outside the stadiums , then he will face a restraining order and could have to pay damages to fifa , " he says . visitors who buy and wear the unlicensed products could be forced by personnel to remove them at the stadiums .
however , not only would that mean potentially thousands of semi-naked fans teeming through the turnstiles ; it would also infringe on personal rights and freedom of action . spectators would have to stand up to the personnel and insist on their right to wear what they want which could lead to confrontation fifa and the german organizers are eager to avoid . high street traders unaware of potential fifa wrath while fifa expects businesses across germany to adhere to its strong-arm trademark policies , it seems that its message has not spread far enough to reach those who may be affected by it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knock-off merchandise can get traders into trouble in the cologne suburb of vingst , a number of traders were still blissfully unaware that selling unlicensed world cup products featuring seemingly innocuous slogans such as " world cup 2006 " could land them in hot water with the global soccer body . " i know these baseball caps are not licensed but i 'm not selling them as such , " said achim b. , the proprietor of a discount store selling a range of soccer related products .
" i 'm not trying to con anyone .
if they want to pay an extra 20 euros for the real thing , that ’ s up to them . " when informed that even the slogan " world cup 06 " could contravene fifa trademark rules , achim replied , " what else are we going to call it ?
soccer world championships 2006 ?
no one will know what that is ?
it 's the world cup .
anyway , i 'd never be able to fit that on a cap . " " crazy " fifa going too far , say shop owners " it 's just stupid , " said another trader who wished to remain anonymous .
" what will they do next ?
stop us from selling footballs because they have something to do with the world cup ?
we 'd have to call them ' balls to be kicked by the feet ' .
people would think i was crazy - just like fifa . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : champ 06 unofficial merchandise many companies have gotten around the strict trademark rules by marketing their products under world cup related headings without actually using the protected brand names .
however , the products lack a certain credibility without the world cup in the title and are perceived as cheap as a result . businesses are not alone in suffering under fifa 's control-freakery .
local authorities have also found that organizing small scale world cup related events under certain trademarked slogans could incur fifa 's wrath . katja hartmann , the events director with the phoenix sports club near ostheim , was forced to rename her world cup opening day festivities in line with fifa rules . local opening gala forced to change its name " we intended to hold our gala on june 9 under the title ' world cup festival 2006 ' but after applying for the necessary licenses we were advised by lawyers that the name could infringe on fifa trademarks .
unless we were willing to pay lots of money to use it , we had to change the name or go ahead and face the consequences . " " it was not such a big deal to change it but we felt pressured .
people should be allowed to celebrate the fact the world cup is in germany and call it just that .
the world cup is about the people but it seems that they are being pushed out of the picture in favor of money-making and marketing , " she added .

a new recycling system for electronics has been kicked off and manufacturers are getting the bill . you see them in or beside trash dumpsters or just sitting forlornly next to the curb : bulky beige computer monitors or dot-matrix printers , answering machines , refrigerators or that mobile phone that was the hippest must-have last year but is a unloved dinosaur now . they are all part of germany 's growing pile of electronic waste , which , according to the country 's environment ministry , amounts to about 1.8 million tons annually .
the new recycling requirements that require consumers to take their waste electronics to collection centers or have them picked up , is aimed at getting the rushing river of burned out components , shot transformers and obsolete electronic gadgets under control . " no type of trash has grown so rapidly recently as electronic waste , which has tripled in just a few years , " said eva leonhardt , waste expert at the environmental group deutsche umwelthilfe , which has set up a hotline to help people out with the new recycling rules .
" twenty years ago , the development cycle for electronics was around four years , now it 's three months .
that has led to an enormous increase in the amount of electronic trash . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : full of hazardous materials while beige computer boxes and refrigerators left on city sidewalks are unsightly , they can also be dangerous .
circuit boards , batteries and crts can contain hazardous materials such as lead and mercury while televisions usually also contain lead .
brominated flame retardants are commonly added to plastics used in electronics .
all these toxins can be released into the environment through incinerator ash or leach into the soil at landfills . " there are also recyclable waste in these products , like copper , aluminum , steel and sometimes even precious metals , " said leonhardt .
" to not use these materials again is almost criminal . " do n't just toss it on friday , germany 's " act governing the sale , return and environmentally sound disposal of electrical and electronic equipment " went into force .
the rules , better know as the electronic equipment law , require manufacturers to cover the cost of collecting and recycling consumer electronics and appliances .
they are designed to conform to an eu directive on electronic waste passed in 2004 . consumers are now asked to take their old electronic equipment and appliances to central collection areas , where special containers have been set up to receive them .
if consumers continue to throw their electronic waste in the normal trash , they can be fined . after that , it 's up to manufacturers to take care of things , since the law requires them to pick up the cost of recycling their products no longer in use .
companies who put any of 10 categories of electronic equipment on the german market have had to register with a central clearing house , called ear , which coordinates the collection . that does not mean that , for example , siemens sends out collection trucks to pick up its own discarded mobile phones and other equipment in the 1,500 collection areas around the country .
rather , in a complicated process , ear calculates the quantities of old electronics that each registered producer is required to collect from waste management authorities based on the amount the company puts on the market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dumpsters like this are off-limits for electronics companies can then contract with private recycling firms or other groups to disassemble the electronic waste , or do it themselves .
they then must dispose of the toxic materials in environmentally sound ways , and can either re-use recyclable materials , or sell them abroad , as is often the case , since more and more electronics manufacturing is being done in asia . " no , you ca n't really say we were supporters of these regulations , since it is going to cost manufacturers between 300 and 500 million euros -lrb- $ 360 - $ 600 -rrb- a year , " said otmar frey of the german electrical and electronic manufacturers ' association , even though his group decided to take a role in helping german lawmakers write up rules for implementing the eu directive . " we decided it would be better not to wait until others came up with rules that we would have a hard time living with , " he said .
the association did not want a repeat of the fiasco that followed the introduction of a deposit system on beverage cans and bottles , which many experts say was poorly thought through . in fact , according to frey and others , the electronics recycling system , although operational for less than a week , is running smoothly so far . higher costs in the store ? while environmental groups are cheering the new rules , trade associations say consumers will likely pay a price , although they are not being directly charged for the new plan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these could get more expensive because of the new rules according to germany 's leading retail association hde , producers will pass along the new recycling costs to consumers eventually .
the disposal of a washing machine costs around eight euros -lrb- $ 9.60 -rrb- , a refrigerator 15 euros -lrb- $ 18 -rrb- , and a television set around 10 euros -lrb- $ 12 -rrb- .
those amounts could soon be incorporated into the price tag . slow going around europe the eu electronic waste directive was supposed to have been implemented by member states by august 2005 , but most countries missed that deadline , including germany . while austria did get a registration and collection system online on schedule , it had not yet figured out what do with the old electronics once they had been turned in .
for months , collection centers were full of growing piles of plastic , glass and circuitry . # b # holland , belgium and sweden have systems in place , as do the swiss , although they are not part of the eu .
some countries are halfway there , such as hungary , although others , such as france , italy and the uk , have done little or nothing to turn the eu guidelines into national law .
the uk does not anticipate having a national system in place until 2007 . " several of these countries are facing proceedings because they are in breach of eu rules , " said frey . several of those countries with electronics recycling programs have organized them differently .
while germany separates its electronics according to functional category , austria does it by size , and hungary by tax number .
that will make any kind of cross-border cooperation more difficult , especially for manufacturers active internationally , said waste expert leonhardt . " there will be a surprise waiting for electronics producers in every eu country , " she said . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de car sharing picks up speed once the domain of the decidedly “ green ” crowd , the concept of car sharing is finding more fans in the mainstream .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : full of hazardous materials while beige computer boxes and refrigerators left on city sidewalks are unsightly , they can also be dangerous .
circuit boards , batteries and crts can contain hazardous materials such as lead and mercury while televisions usually also contain lead .
brominated flame retardants are commonly added to plastics used in electronics .
all these toxins can be released into the environment through incinerator ash or leach into the soil at landfills . " there are also recyclable waste in these products , like copper , aluminum , steel and sometimes even precious metals , " said leonhardt .
" to not use these materials again is almost criminal . " do n't just toss it on friday , germany 's " act governing the sale , return and environmentally sound disposal of electrical and electronic equipment " went into force .
the rules , better know as the electronic equipment law , require manufacturers to cover the cost of collecting and recycling consumer electronics and appliances .
they are designed to conform to an eu directive on electronic waste passed in 2004 . consumers are now asked to take their old electronic equipment and appliances to central collection areas , where special containers have been set up to receive them .
if consumers continue to throw their electronic waste in the normal trash , they can be fined . after that , it 's up to manufacturers to take care of things , since the law requires them to pick up the cost of recycling their products no longer in use .
companies who put any of 10 categories of electronic equipment on the german market have had to register with a central clearing house , called ear , which coordinates the collection . that does not mean that , for example , siemens sends out collection trucks to pick up its own discarded mobile phones and other equipment in the 1,500 collection areas around the country .
rather , in a complicated process , ear calculates the quantities of old electronics that each registered producer is required to collect from waste management authorities based on the amount the company puts on the market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dumpsters like this are off-limits for electronics companies can then contract with private recycling firms or other groups to disassemble the electronic waste , or do it themselves .
they then must dispose of the toxic materials in environmentally sound ways , and can either re-use recyclable materials , or sell them abroad , as is often the case , since more and more electronics manufacturing is being done in asia . " no , you ca n't really say we were supporters of these regulations , since it is going to cost manufacturers between 300 and 500 million euros -lrb- $ 360 - $ 600 -rrb- a year , " said otmar frey of the german electrical and electronic manufacturers ' association , even though his group decided to take a role in helping german lawmakers write up rules for implementing the eu directive . " we decided it would be better not to wait until others came up with rules that we would have a hard time living with , " he said .
the association did not want a repeat of the fiasco that followed the introduction of a deposit system on beverage cans and bottles , which many experts say was poorly thought through . in fact , according to frey and others , the electronics recycling system , although operational for less than a week , is running smoothly so far . higher costs in the store ? while environmental groups are cheering the new rules , trade associations say consumers will likely pay a price , although they are not being directly charged for the new plan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these could get more expensive because of the new rules according to germany 's leading retail association hde , producers will pass along the new recycling costs to consumers eventually .
the disposal of a washing machine costs around eight euros -lrb- $ 9.60 -rrb- , a refrigerator 15 euros -lrb- $ 18 -rrb- , and a television set around 10 euros -lrb- $ 12 -rrb- .
those amounts could soon be incorporated into the price tag . slow going around europe the eu electronic waste directive was supposed to have been implemented by member states by august 2005 , but most countries missed that deadline , including germany . while austria did get a registration and collection system online on schedule , it had not yet figured out what do with the old electronics once they had been turned in .
for months , collection centers were full of growing piles of plastic , glass and circuitry . # b # holland , belgium and sweden have systems in place , as do the swiss , although they are not part of the eu .
some countries are halfway there , such as hungary , although others , such as france , italy and the uk , have done little or nothing to turn the eu guidelines into national law .
the uk does not anticipate having a national system in place until 2007 . " several of these countries are facing proceedings because they are in breach of eu rules , " said frey . several of those countries with electronics recycling programs have organized them differently .
while germany separates its electronics according to functional category , austria does it by size , and hungary by tax number .
that will make any kind of cross-border cooperation more difficult , especially for manufacturers active internationally , said waste expert leonhardt .

trojan horses have constantly bombarded banks and others in the financial sector .
phishing and identity theft attempts have risen to number about 8 million per day , according to security officials .
e-scams are costing businesses billions and that does n't include increasing funds - about 20 to 50 percent of total expenditures in the us and uk - to beef up security .
and it is only getting worse .

" this pipeline is not aimed against anyone but is aimed at ensuring the security of gas supplies to europe , " schröder said . " not only in germany but throughout western europe there is growing need for gas , while domestic production is falling , " he said .
" this project is in the interests of germany .
that is why it will be supported by every german government . " schröder added that he would be paid 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 300,000 -rrb- annually for holding the post . the 61-year old former chancellor is also an advisor to swiss media group ringier and international investment bank rothschild and has made lucrative public-speaking appearances . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life 's a gas : the old friends are reunited in business his acceptance of the job less than a month after he left the chancellor 's office last november prompted widespread criticism in germany .
he and russian president vladimir putin had worked closely on cementing german investment in the pipeline . earlier this month a lawyer acting for schröder said that he had won a temporary injunction against the leader of the liberal free democrats , guido westerwelle , preventing him from linking schröder 's post as chancellor to his involvement in the pipeline . appointment and pipeline project under fire the project has also prompted criticism from new eu members lithuania and poland , which complained that schröder had gone over their heads on a pipeline that is likely to pass through several baltic countries ' territorial waters . other members of the supervisory board include gazprom chief executive alexei miller as well as officials from germany 's e.on and basf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe hopes to keep the russian taps turned on gazprom has a 51.0 percent stake in the north european gas pipeline , while stakes of 24.5 percent are held by e.on and basf . matthias warnig , representative of dresdner bank in russia , was named as the pipeline 's managing director . miller on thursday appeared to give backing to the idea of possible involvement in the project by gaz de france .
" this decision could be taken if the new partner brings something new of strategic importance , " miller said in response to a question from journalists . schröder looking to use german links in new role earlier this week schröder paid a visit to gazprom production facilities in the siberian province of yamalo-nenets . he also confirmed that he plans to create a " german-russian think tank " but denied a russian press report that the body would be a lobbying agency for promoting the russian economy in germany . work on the pipeline has already begun onshore in russia that is planned to extend around 1,200 kilometers -lrb- 750 miles -rrb- under the baltic sea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pipeline managing director matthias warnig the pipeline is eventually expected to connect not only to germany but to other parts of western europe , including the netherlands , sweden and britain and is expected to come on stream in 2010 with an initial capacity of around 27.5 billion cubic meters of natural gas a year .
a second pipeline is expected to double capacity to 55 billion cubic meters annually . the first part of the project will cost two to 2.5 billion euros and the total cost of the offshore section of the project will be over four billion euros , management has said . european union officials have sought to reassure new eu members worried that they could be left without supplies if russia no longer has to ship gas through their territory to western europe .

" this pipeline is not aimed against anyone but is aimed at ensuring the security of gas supplies to europe , " schröder said . " not only in germany but throughout western europe there is growing need for gas , while domestic production is falling , " he said .
" this project is in the interests of germany .
that is why it will be supported by every german government . " schröder added that he would be paid 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 300,000 -rrb- annually for holding the post . the 61-year old former chancellor is also an advisor to swiss media group ringier and international investment bank rothschild and has made lucrative public-speaking appearances . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life 's a gas : the old friends are reunited in business his acceptance of the job less than a month after he left the chancellor 's office last november prompted widespread criticism in germany .

a second pipeline is expected to double capacity to 55 billion cubic meters annually . the first part of the project will cost two to 2.5 billion euros and the total cost of the offshore section of the project will be over four billion euros , management has said . european union officials have sought to reassure new eu members worried that they could be left without supplies if russia no longer has to ship gas through their territory to western europe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 30.03.2006 microsoft battles to avoid daily fines in eu standoff großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : microsoft concessions are unacceptable , eu officials say .
the american software giant has one last chance to convince eu regulators it is complying with a two-year old ruling .
failure means 2 million euros in daily fines . facing the threat of daily fines , microsoft tried to convince eu anti-trust regulators thursday that the us software giant is meeting their demands to comply with a landmark 2004 competition ruling . even before the start of a two-day closed-door hearing , microsoft came out fighting , saying that new fines would not resolve the long-standing competition row . " in our view , a fine is not the answer , " said microsoft 's top lawyer , brad smith , as he arrived for the hearing with the european commission . in response , commission spokesman for competition issues jonathan todd said that the commission had little choice but to brandish the threat of fines . " also from the commission 's perspective , fines are not the best way to resolve the conflict but two years after the decision , we have tried all other ways so that microsoft complies with the decision and it has still not done so , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new microsoft operating system vista may come under scrutiny also microsoft 's last chance the hearing is likely to be the microsoft 's last chance to prove it is complying with the european commission before regulators slap a daily fine of up to 2 million euros -lrb- $ 2.4 million -rrb- a day . smith , who is microsoft 's general counsel and is also third in command at the company , led a team of about 50 people including lawyers and computer scientists in its ranks . " we need clear guidance to find a solution , " he said .
" ultimately , the point i think we 'll underscore is this : we have complied and we 're willing to do more . " brussels growing impatient the commission is at pains to force microsoft to respect a march 2004 anti-trust ruling , in which the company was fined 497 million euros for abusing its dominant market position . microsoft was ordered to sell a version of its widely-used windows operating system unbundled from its media player software and to divulge information on its operating system needed by manufacturers of rival products . brussels has grown increasingly impatient for evidence that microsoft will comply and in december threatened to slap a fine , back-dated to december 15 , of up to 2 million euros a day on the company .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union commissioner for competition mario monti says microsoft is guilty of abusing its " near monopoly " but the company says that it has offered more than the commission has asked for by promising to reveal millions of lines of windows computer code for rivals to use to develop programs that work with it . however , an independent trustee advising the commission has deemed the offer to be " totally useless " . " it 's not necessary for microsoft to go beyond what we are asking for , " said todd .

the american software giant has one last chance to convince eu regulators it is complying with a two-year old ruling .
failure means 2 million euros in daily fines . facing the threat of daily fines , microsoft tried to convince eu anti-trust regulators thursday that the us software giant is meeting their demands to comply with a landmark 2004 competition ruling . even before the start of a two-day closed-door hearing , microsoft came out fighting , saying that new fines would not resolve the long-standing competition row . " in our view , a fine is not the answer , " said microsoft 's top lawyer , brad smith , as he arrived for the hearing with the european commission . in response , commission spokesman for competition issues jonathan todd said that the commission had little choice but to brandish the threat of fines . " also from the commission 's perspective , fines are not the best way to resolve the conflict but two years after the decision , we have tried all other ways so that microsoft complies with the decision and it has still not done so , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 30.03.2006 german parliament debates reforms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government has a safe majority in the parliament using wednesday 's debate about the chancellery 's budget for 2006 as a peg , german parliamentarians engaged in a general exchange of arguments and opinions about the grand coalition 's policies . german conservative chancellor angela merkel , who has won widespread praise for her appearances in the international arena and on the foreign policy front , started her address to the parliament on wednesday with an optimistic assessment of the country 's role in peace-keeping missions .
she said that reunited germany was now assuming greater responsibility in line with united nations and european union requirements . success on the international scene , however , was not the main topic of the parliamentary debate .
as widespread protests against pay cuts and layoffs continue throughout the country , merkel and her grand coalition government said they were stepping up efforts to find solutions to the pressing social and economic problems . labor reforms the latest unemployment figures for germany , which are published this thursday , are good news for the government : the number of jobless has dropped below the 5 million mark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frustrated by some of his coalition partners : labor minister franz müntefering merkel , however , appeared exasperated after a rift in the grand coalition over labor reforms .
social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- labor minister franz müntefering 's announced he was halting the labor reforms because some members of merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- were taking steps away from the coalition agreement and asking for reforms that would go beyond the agreed-upon measures such as allowing companies to fire workers during the two-year probationary period . " let 's first of all do what we resolved to do , " merkel said .
" we made an agreement on this . " merkel asked everybody to stick to the agreement and revisit the issue of germany 's job protection rules in two years .
but some members of her own party remained impatient . " the section on employment law in the coalition agreement does not go far enough , " said christian wulff , the conservative premier of lower saxony .
" it does not adequately reflect the real need for reform . " the trade unions , on the other hand , are stepping up pressure on spd - traditionally seen as a champion of workers ' rights . " the trade union 's goal is for dismissal protection not to deteriorate , but rather to be maintained , or even improved , " said michael sommer , head of the dgb trade union federation for german daily die welt .
" not everything that is in the coalition agreement must be implemented . " energy reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opposition is not her main problem : german chancellor angela merkel merkel announced that her grand coalition government would introduce a new long-term energy strategy in the second half of next year .
this moves comes as a response to the growing concern about germany 's reliance on russian natural gas and the rekindled debate about the country 's nuclear phase out program . " just because we have a difference of opinion on this one issue does n't mean we can afford to ignore the question of how our energy strategy out to 2020 should look , " merkel said in her speech before the bundestag . one of the most crucial pieces of legislation passed by outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens , in the eyes of many , was a planned phase-out of germany 's atomic energy plants by 2020 . the idea , largely pressed by the environmentally-friendly greens , was to focus on renewable energy and away from a crippling dependence on oil .
it also found support at a time when safety concerns over nuclear power reactors were highlighted with accidents like the one in chernobyl in 1986 .
the social democrats in the current grand coalition government made the nuclear phase-out an important part of the coalition agreement which was signed before the new government took office . german economics minister michael gloss , who raised quite a few eyebrows when he suggested in january that germany should reconsider prolonging the use of nuclear energy , toned down his views . " the nuclear exist is written into law and at the present time i do n't believe that the majority necessary to change this agreement exists in the german bundestag , " glos said in an interview for german daily handelsblatt . health reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : staying healthy has become more expensive in germany the german chancellor reassured parliamentarians that her coalition government would now start working seriously on an overdue reform of the statutory health system .
she said she was confident that the current clash of concepts could be overcome in a constructive manner . at present , merkel 's conservatives are backing a flat monthly premium paid regardless of income , while the social democrats favor a broadening of the funding base by bringing in currently exempt groups of the population and making them pay in line with their earnings . next year the public health care system will have a budget hole between 8 and 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.6 billion to $ 12 billion -rrb- .
germans , who have long enjoyed one of the most beneficial health care systems in europe , will have to steel themselves for difficult changes ahead .
as is , workers and employers split the monthly premiums to health care providers .
about 10 percent of the population has elected out of the state-sponsored public system , preferring costlier , but some say better , private insurance . opposition strikes back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they did n't get enough votes to form a coaltion : merkel and fdp leader westerwelle -lrb- right -rrb- oposition free-market liberal party -lrb- fdp -rrb- chief guido westerwelle accused the government of planning to raise taxes further as of next year despite pre-election promises to the contrary .
he also demanded that the government should finally think hard about introducing a simpler tax system that citizens could relate to . " since you took office , you 've been telling us that this is the sort of tax policy you ca n't do in germany , " westerwelle said .
" you should finally defend your own ideas and convictions instead of pandering to the interests of your social democrat coalition partners . " the floor leader of the opposition left party , oskar lafontaine - himself a social democrat renegade - sharply criticized the government for what he described as grave budgetary neglect in the areas of education and research : " it 's outrageous that germany is among the poorest performers within oecd countries when it comes to investing in research and education , " lafontaine said .
" this is a situation that the new government seems unwilling to change .
but it has to be changed , if we 're serious about leading the country forward . " despite the attempts by the opposition to tear apart the government 's policy , the actors within the grand coalition do n't have much to fear since they have a comfortable majority of seats in both houses of parliament .
they can only self-destruct by engaging in internal struggles and failing to implement their own agreements . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany borrows heavily to balance 2006 budget germany 's grand coalition government has presented its 2006 budget plan to parliament to seek approval for a rise in spending and the creation of new debt in its efforts to boost the economy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 30.03.2006 german parliament debates reforms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government has a safe majority in the parliament using wednesday 's debate about the chancellery 's budget for 2006 as a peg , german parliamentarians engaged in a general exchange of arguments and opinions about the grand coalition 's policies . german conservative chancellor angela merkel , who has won widespread praise for her appearances in the international arena and on the foreign policy front , started her address to the parliament on wednesday with an optimistic assessment of the country 's role in peace-keeping missions .
she said that reunited germany was now assuming greater responsibility in line with united nations and european union requirements . success on the international scene , however , was not the main topic of the parliamentary debate .
as widespread protests against pay cuts and layoffs continue throughout the country , merkel and her grand coalition government said they were stepping up efforts to find solutions to the pressing social and economic problems . labor reforms the latest unemployment figures for germany , which are published this thursday , are good news for the government : the number of jobless has dropped below the 5 million mark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frustrated by some of his coalition partners : labor minister franz müntefering merkel , however , appeared exasperated after a rift in the grand coalition over labor reforms .
social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- labor minister franz müntefering 's announced he was halting the labor reforms because some members of merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- were taking steps away from the coalition agreement and asking for reforms that would go beyond the agreed-upon measures such as allowing companies to fire workers during the two-year probationary period . " let 's first of all do what we resolved to do , " merkel said .
" we made an agreement on this . " merkel asked everybody to stick to the agreement and revisit the issue of germany 's job protection rules in two years .
but some members of her own party remained impatient . " the section on employment law in the coalition agreement does not go far enough , " said christian wulff , the conservative premier of lower saxony .
" it does not adequately reflect the real need for reform . " the trade unions , on the other hand , are stepping up pressure on spd - traditionally seen as a champion of workers ' rights . " the trade union 's goal is for dismissal protection not to deteriorate , but rather to be maintained , or even improved , " said michael sommer , head of the dgb trade union federation for german daily die welt .
" not everything that is in the coalition agreement must be implemented . " energy reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opposition is not her main problem : german chancellor angela merkel merkel announced that her grand coalition government would introduce a new long-term energy strategy in the second half of next year .
this moves comes as a response to the growing concern about germany 's reliance on russian natural gas and the rekindled debate about the country 's nuclear phase out program . " just because we have a difference of opinion on this one issue does n't mean we can afford to ignore the question of how our energy strategy out to 2020 should look , " merkel said in her speech before the bundestag . one of the most crucial pieces of legislation passed by outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens , in the eyes of many , was a planned phase-out of germany 's atomic energy plants by 2020 . the idea , largely pressed by the environmentally-friendly greens , was to focus on renewable energy and away from a crippling dependence on oil .
it also found support at a time when safety concerns over nuclear power reactors were highlighted with accidents like the one in chernobyl in 1986 .
the social democrats in the current grand coalition government made the nuclear phase-out an important part of the coalition agreement which was signed before the new government took office . german economics minister michael gloss , who raised quite a few eyebrows when he suggested in january that germany should reconsider prolonging the use of nuclear energy , toned down his views . " the nuclear exist is written into law and at the present time i do n't believe that the majority necessary to change this agreement exists in the german bundestag , " glos said in an interview for german daily handelsblatt . health reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : staying healthy has become more expensive in germany the german chancellor reassured parliamentarians that her coalition government would now start working seriously on an overdue reform of the statutory health system .
she said she was confident that the current clash of concepts could be overcome in a constructive manner . at present , merkel 's conservatives are backing a flat monthly premium paid regardless of income , while the social democrats favor a broadening of the funding base by bringing in currently exempt groups of the population and making them pay in line with their earnings . next year the public health care system will have a budget hole between 8 and 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.6 billion to $ 12 billion -rrb- .
germans , who have long enjoyed one of the most beneficial health care systems in europe , will have to steel themselves for difficult changes ahead .
as is , workers and employers split the monthly premiums to health care providers .
about 10 percent of the population has elected out of the state-sponsored public system , preferring costlier , but some say better , private insurance . opposition strikes back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they did n't get enough votes to form a coaltion : merkel and fdp leader westerwelle -lrb- right -rrb- oposition free-market liberal party -lrb- fdp -rrb- chief guido westerwelle accused the government of planning to raise taxes further as of next year despite pre-election promises to the contrary .
he also demanded that the government should finally think hard about introducing a simpler tax system that citizens could relate to . " since you took office , you 've been telling us that this is the sort of tax policy you ca n't do in germany , " westerwelle said .
" you should finally defend your own ideas and convictions instead of pandering to the interests of your social democrat coalition partners . " the floor leader of the opposition left party , oskar lafontaine - himself a social democrat renegade - sharply criticized the government for what he described as grave budgetary neglect in the areas of education and research : " it 's outrageous that germany is among the poorest performers within oecd countries when it comes to investing in research and education , " lafontaine said .
" this is a situation that the new government seems unwilling to change .
but it has to be changed , if we 're serious about leading the country forward . " despite the attempts by the opposition to tear apart the government 's policy , the actors within the grand coalition do n't have much to fear since they have a comfortable majority of seats in both houses of parliament .

she said that reunited germany was now assuming greater responsibility in line with united nations and european union requirements . success on the international scene , however , was not the main topic of the parliamentary debate .
as widespread protests against pay cuts and layoffs continue throughout the country , merkel and her grand coalition government said they were stepping up efforts to find solutions to the pressing social and economic problems . labor reforms the latest unemployment figures for germany , which are published this thursday , are good news for the government : the number of jobless has dropped below the 5 million mark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frustrated by some of his coalition partners : labor minister franz müntefering merkel , however , appeared exasperated after a rift in the grand coalition over labor reforms .
social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- labor minister franz müntefering 's announced he was halting the labor reforms because some members of merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- were taking steps away from the coalition agreement and asking for reforms that would go beyond the agreed-upon measures such as allowing companies to fire workers during the two-year probationary period . " let 's first of all do what we resolved to do , " merkel said .
" we made an agreement on this . " merkel asked everybody to stick to the agreement and revisit the issue of germany 's job protection rules in two years .
but some members of her own party remained impatient . " the section on employment law in the coalition agreement does not go far enough , " said christian wulff , the conservative premier of lower saxony .
" it does not adequately reflect the real need for reform . " the trade unions , on the other hand , are stepping up pressure on spd - traditionally seen as a champion of workers ' rights . " the trade union 's goal is for dismissal protection not to deteriorate , but rather to be maintained , or even improved , " said michael sommer , head of the dgb trade union federation for german daily die welt .
" not everything that is in the coalition agreement must be implemented . " energy reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opposition is not her main problem : german chancellor angela merkel merkel announced that her grand coalition government would introduce a new long-term energy strategy in the second half of next year .
this moves comes as a response to the growing concern about germany 's reliance on russian natural gas and the rekindled debate about the country 's nuclear phase out program . " just because we have a difference of opinion on this one issue does n't mean we can afford to ignore the question of how our energy strategy out to 2020 should look , " merkel said in her speech before the bundestag . one of the most crucial pieces of legislation passed by outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens , in the eyes of many , was a planned phase-out of germany 's atomic energy plants by 2020 . the idea , largely pressed by the environmentally-friendly greens , was to focus on renewable energy and away from a crippling dependence on oil .
it also found support at a time when safety concerns over nuclear power reactors were highlighted with accidents like the one in chernobyl in 1986 .
the social democrats in the current grand coalition government made the nuclear phase-out an important part of the coalition agreement which was signed before the new government took office . german economics minister michael gloss , who raised quite a few eyebrows when he suggested in january that germany should reconsider prolonging the use of nuclear energy , toned down his views . " the nuclear exist is written into law and at the present time i do n't believe that the majority necessary to change this agreement exists in the german bundestag , " glos said in an interview for german daily handelsblatt . health reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : staying healthy has become more expensive in germany the german chancellor reassured parliamentarians that her coalition government would now start working seriously on an overdue reform of the statutory health system .
she said she was confident that the current clash of concepts could be overcome in a constructive manner . at present , merkel 's conservatives are backing a flat monthly premium paid regardless of income , while the social democrats favor a broadening of the funding base by bringing in currently exempt groups of the population and making them pay in line with their earnings . next year the public health care system will have a budget hole between 8 and 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.6 billion to $ 12 billion -rrb- .
germans , who have long enjoyed one of the most beneficial health care systems in europe , will have to steel themselves for difficult changes ahead .
as is , workers and employers split the monthly premiums to health care providers .
about 10 percent of the population has elected out of the state-sponsored public system , preferring costlier , but some say better , private insurance . opposition strikes back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they did n't get enough votes to form a coaltion : merkel and fdp leader westerwelle -lrb- right -rrb- oposition free-market liberal party -lrb- fdp -rrb- chief guido westerwelle accused the government of planning to raise taxes further as of next year despite pre-election promises to the contrary .
he also demanded that the government should finally think hard about introducing a simpler tax system that citizens could relate to . " since you took office , you 've been telling us that this is the sort of tax policy you ca n't do in germany , " westerwelle said .
" you should finally defend your own ideas and convictions instead of pandering to the interests of your social democrat coalition partners . " the floor leader of the opposition left party , oskar lafontaine - himself a social democrat renegade - sharply criticized the government for what he described as grave budgetary neglect in the areas of education and research : " it 's outrageous that germany is among the poorest performers within oecd countries when it comes to investing in research and education , " lafontaine said .
" this is a situation that the new government seems unwilling to change .
but it has to be changed , if we 're serious about leading the country forward . " despite the attempts by the opposition to tear apart the government 's policy , the actors within the grand coalition do n't have much to fear since they have a comfortable majority of seats in both houses of parliament .
they can only self-destruct by engaging in internal struggles and failing to implement their own agreements . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany borrows heavily to balance 2006 budget germany 's grand coalition government has presented its 2006 budget plan to parliament to seek approval for a rise in spending and the creation of new debt in its efforts to boost the economy .

foreign minister manouchehr mottaki , speaking in geneva , described the un declaration as an " angry precedent " and a " bad move " . iran struck the defiant stance even as foreign ministers of the security council permanent members plus germany met in berlin to chart their next moves in the standoff . the un security council on wednesday unanimously approved a non-binding statement giving iran 30 days to abandon its uranium enrichment activities , ending a weeks-long impasse .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 30.03.2006 german parliament debates reforms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government has a safe majority in the parliament using wednesday 's debate about the chancellery 's budget for 2006 as a peg , german parliamentarians engaged in a general exchange of arguments and opinions about the grand coalition 's policies . german conservative chancellor angela merkel , who has won widespread praise for her appearances in the international arena and on the foreign policy front , started her address to the parliament on wednesday with an optimistic assessment of the country 's role in peace-keeping missions .
she said that reunited germany was now assuming greater responsibility in line with united nations and european union requirements . success on the international scene , however , was not the main topic of the parliamentary debate .
as widespread protests against pay cuts and layoffs continue throughout the country , merkel and her grand coalition government said they were stepping up efforts to find solutions to the pressing social and economic problems . labor reforms the latest unemployment figures for germany , which are published this thursday , are good news for the government : the number of jobless has dropped below the 5 million mark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frustrated by some of his coalition partners : labor minister franz müntefering merkel , however , appeared exasperated after a rift in the grand coalition over labor reforms .
social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- labor minister franz müntefering 's announced he was halting the labor reforms because some members of merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- were taking steps away from the coalition agreement and asking for reforms that would go beyond the agreed-upon measures such as allowing companies to fire workers during the two-year probationary period . " let 's first of all do what we resolved to do , " merkel said .
" we made an agreement on this . " merkel asked everybody to stick to the agreement and revisit the issue of germany 's job protection rules in two years .
but some members of her own party remained impatient . " the section on employment law in the coalition agreement does not go far enough , " said christian wulff , the conservative premier of lower saxony .
" it does not adequately reflect the real need for reform . " the trade unions , on the other hand , are stepping up pressure on spd - traditionally seen as a champion of workers ' rights . " the trade union 's goal is for dismissal protection not to deteriorate , but rather to be maintained , or even improved , " said michael sommer , head of the dgb trade union federation for german daily die welt .
" not everything that is in the coalition agreement must be implemented . " energy reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opposition is not her main problem : german chancellor angela merkel merkel announced that her grand coalition government would introduce a new long-term energy strategy in the second half of next year .
this moves comes as a response to the growing concern about germany 's reliance on russian natural gas and the rekindled debate about the country 's nuclear phase out program . " just because we have a difference of opinion on this one issue does n't mean we can afford to ignore the question of how our energy strategy out to 2020 should look , " merkel said in her speech before the bundestag . one of the most crucial pieces of legislation passed by outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens , in the eyes of many , was a planned phase-out of germany 's atomic energy plants by 2020 . the idea , largely pressed by the environmentally-friendly greens , was to focus on renewable energy and away from a crippling dependence on oil .
it also found support at a time when safety concerns over nuclear power reactors were highlighted with accidents like the one in chernobyl in 1986 .
the social democrats in the current grand coalition government made the nuclear phase-out an important part of the coalition agreement which was signed before the new government took office . german economics minister michael gloss , who raised quite a few eyebrows when he suggested in january that germany should reconsider prolonging the use of nuclear energy , toned down his views . " the nuclear exist is written into law and at the present time i do n't believe that the majority necessary to change this agreement exists in the german bundestag , " glos said in an interview for german daily handelsblatt . health reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : staying healthy has become more expensive in germany the german chancellor reassured parliamentarians that her coalition government would now start working seriously on an overdue reform of the statutory health system .
she said she was confident that the current clash of concepts could be overcome in a constructive manner . at present , merkel 's conservatives are backing a flat monthly premium paid regardless of income , while the social democrats favor a broadening of the funding base by bringing in currently exempt groups of the population and making them pay in line with their earnings . next year the public health care system will have a budget hole between 8 and 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.6 billion to $ 12 billion -rrb- .
germans , who have long enjoyed one of the most beneficial health care systems in europe , will have to steel themselves for difficult changes ahead .
as is , workers and employers split the monthly premiums to health care providers .
about 10 percent of the population has elected out of the state-sponsored public system , preferring costlier , but some say better , private insurance . opposition strikes back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they did n't get enough votes to form a coaltion : merkel and fdp leader westerwelle -lrb- right -rrb- oposition free-market liberal party -lrb- fdp -rrb- chief guido westerwelle accused the government of planning to raise taxes further as of next year despite pre-election promises to the contrary .
he also demanded that the government should finally think hard about introducing a simpler tax system that citizens could relate to . " since you took office , you 've been telling us that this is the sort of tax policy you ca n't do in germany , " westerwelle said .
" you should finally defend your own ideas and convictions instead of pandering to the interests of your social democrat coalition partners . " the floor leader of the opposition left party , oskar lafontaine - himself a social democrat renegade - sharply criticized the government for what he described as grave budgetary neglect in the areas of education and research : " it 's outrageous that germany is among the poorest performers within oecd countries when it comes to investing in research and education , " lafontaine said .
" this is a situation that the new government seems unwilling to change .
but it has to be changed , if we 're serious about leading the country forward . " despite the attempts by the opposition to tear apart the government 's policy , the actors within the grand coalition do n't have much to fear since they have a comfortable majority of seats in both houses of parliament .
they can only self-destruct by engaging in internal struggles and failing to implement their own agreements . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany borrows heavily to balance 2006 budget germany 's grand coalition government has presented its 2006 budget plan to parliament to seek approval for a rise in spending and the creation of new debt in its efforts to boost the economy .

it also found support at a time when safety concerns over nuclear power reactors were highlighted with accidents like the one in chernobyl in 1986 .
the social democrats in the current grand coalition government made the nuclear phase-out an important part of the coalition agreement which was signed before the new government took office . german economics minister michael gloss , who raised quite a few eyebrows when he suggested in january that germany should reconsider prolonging the use of nuclear energy , toned down his views . " the nuclear exist is written into law and at the present time i do n't believe that the majority necessary to change this agreement exists in the german bundestag , " glos said in an interview for german daily handelsblatt . health reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : staying healthy has become more expensive in germany the german chancellor reassured parliamentarians that her coalition government would now start working seriously on an overdue reform of the statutory health system .
she said she was confident that the current clash of concepts could be overcome in a constructive manner . at present , merkel 's conservatives are backing a flat monthly premium paid regardless of income , while the social democrats favor a broadening of the funding base by bringing in currently exempt groups of the population and making them pay in line with their earnings . next year the public health care system will have a budget hole between 8 and 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.6 billion to $ 12 billion -rrb- .
germans , who have long enjoyed one of the most beneficial health care systems in europe , will have to steel themselves for difficult changes ahead .
as is , workers and employers split the monthly premiums to health care providers .
about 10 percent of the population has elected out of the state-sponsored public system , preferring costlier , but some say better , private insurance . opposition strikes back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they did n't get enough votes to form a coaltion : merkel and fdp leader westerwelle -lrb- right -rrb- oposition free-market liberal party -lrb- fdp -rrb- chief guido westerwelle accused the government of planning to raise taxes further as of next year despite pre-election promises to the contrary .
he also demanded that the government should finally think hard about introducing a simpler tax system that citizens could relate to . " since you took office , you 've been telling us that this is the sort of tax policy you ca n't do in germany , " westerwelle said .
" you should finally defend your own ideas and convictions instead of pandering to the interests of your social democrat coalition partners . " the floor leader of the opposition left party , oskar lafontaine - himself a social democrat renegade - sharply criticized the government for what he described as grave budgetary neglect in the areas of education and research : " it 's outrageous that germany is among the poorest performers within oecd countries when it comes to investing in research and education , " lafontaine said .
" this is a situation that the new government seems unwilling to change .
but it has to be changed , if we 're serious about leading the country forward . " despite the attempts by the opposition to tear apart the government 's policy , the actors within the grand coalition do n't have much to fear since they have a comfortable majority of seats in both houses of parliament .

answer : the fifa world cup .
you can say it ... but you ca n't wear it .
not without a license anyway . nearly every company in germany wants to make money on the upcoming world cup in june .
but not everyone is allowed to advertise with the logo .
fifa , world soccer 's governing body , has laid down strict criteria for world cup 2006 slogans and advertising . while soccer fans are gearing up for the world cup , the biggest event the sport has to offer , others are dreaming about how to make big bucks from it . but far from being a free-for-all cash cow which benefits everyone , the soccer powers-that-be have stipulated that only official fifa sponsors are allowed to sell their goods using the world cup 2006 tag which puts some traders on the wrong side of the tournament organizers and potentially on the wrong side of the law . the official sponsors , companies like automaker hyundai and sports equipment giant adidas amongst others , are the only ones allowed to use certain trademarks copyrighted by fifa .
and they have certainly paid for the privilege . these " official " companies have paid around 45 million euros each for exclusive permission to use the world cup for advertising purposes .
in addition , there are the national sponsors like german railways , postbank and others who have each paid 13 million euros for the rights , but may only use the world cup logo for their advertising within germany . fifa believes that the high price for getting on the exclusive list is worth it and that those who intend to use the trademarks without acquiring these rights should be punished .
fifa spokesman andreas herren says it is only what official sponsors would expect .
" companies who have acquired these rights of course deserve to be protected against this so-called ‘ ambush marketing ’ by free-riders . " those who unofficially use the world cup to make money face tough consequences .
during the 2002 world cup in japan / korea , for instance , fifa tracked down nearly 2,000 cases of fraud in 88 different countries .
over three million products were confiscated . official brand names a particularly prickly subject bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : official fifa products carry licensed logos and authenticity tags fifa gets particularly picky with the brand names " 2006 fifa world cup germany " and " world cup 2006 . "
those slogans enjoy special trademark protection .
those who abuse the trademark rights face punishment , says trademark lawyer martin chakraborty . " if someone uses the trademark illegally , say , to print it on t-shirts or baseballs caps to be sold outside the stadiums , then he will face a restraining order and could have to pay damages to fifa , " he says . visitors who buy and wear the unlicensed products could be forced by personnel to remove them at the stadiums .
however , not only would that mean potentially thousands of semi-naked fans teeming through the turnstiles ; it would also infringe on personal rights and freedom of action . spectators would have to stand up to the personnel and insist on their right to wear what they want which could lead to confrontation fifa and the german organizers are eager to avoid . high street traders unaware of potential fifa wrath while fifa expects businesses across germany to adhere to its strong-arm trademark policies , it seems that its message has not spread far enough to reach those who may be affected by it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knock-off merchandise can get traders into trouble in the cologne suburb of vingst , a number of traders were still blissfully unaware that selling unlicensed world cup products featuring seemingly innocuous slogans such as " world cup 2006 " could land them in hot water with the global soccer body . " i know these baseball caps are not licensed but i 'm not selling them as such , " said achim b. , the proprietor of a discount store selling a range of soccer related products .
" i 'm not trying to con anyone .
if they want to pay an extra 20 euros for the real thing , that ’ s up to them . " when informed that even the slogan " world cup 06 " could contravene fifa trademark rules , achim replied , " what else are we going to call it ?
soccer world championships 2006 ?
no one will know what that is ?
it 's the world cup .
anyway , i 'd never be able to fit that on a cap . " " crazy " fifa going too far , say shop owners " it 's just stupid , " said another trader who wished to remain anonymous .
" what will they do next ?
stop us from selling footballs because they have something to do with the world cup ?
we 'd have to call them ' balls to be kicked by the feet ' .
people would think i was crazy - just like fifa . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : champ 06 unofficial merchandise many companies have gotten around the strict trademark rules by marketing their products under world cup related headings without actually using the protected brand names .
however , the products lack a certain credibility without the world cup in the title and are perceived as cheap as a result . businesses are not alone in suffering under fifa 's control-freakery .
local authorities have also found that organizing small scale world cup related events under certain trademarked slogans could incur fifa 's wrath . katja hartmann , the events director with the phoenix sports club near ostheim , was forced to rename her world cup opening day festivities in line with fifa rules . local opening gala forced to change its name " we intended to hold our gala on june 9 under the title ' world cup festival 2006 ' but after applying for the necessary licenses we were advised by lawyers that the name could infringe on fifa trademarks .
unless we were willing to pay lots of money to use it , we had to change the name or go ahead and face the consequences . " " it was not such a big deal to change it but we felt pressured .
people should be allowed to celebrate the fact the world cup is in germany and call it just that .
the world cup is about the people but it seems that they are being pushed out of the picture in favor of money-making and marketing , " she added .
" our ' cup fest 06 ' will go ahead but it has lost its shine a bit .

unity is the order of the day . for the past two and a half weeks , the un security council members have been at loggerheads over iran .
great britain , france and the u.s. disagree with russia and china on how to tackle the volatile islamic republic 's nuclear ambitions .
with the need to take a unified stance on the issue pressing , the foreign ministers of the five world powers will meet with merkel and eu foreign policy chief javier solana on how best to proceed .
the goal is to come out of the meeting with a unified stance and , hopefully , a draft resolution on iran that can go before the un security council . a new , weaker resolution ?
the latter will be more difficult to present .
with china and russia so far against hanging economic sanctions on iran , great britain , france and the u.s. are scrambling to find areas on which to compromise . reports out of the un in new york suggest that a new resolution is making the rounds that still forbids iran to enrich a uranium - part of the process of making an atomic bomb - but takes out language that would slap it with sanctions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are sanctions still on the table in the un ? another proposal , by the international crisis group in belgium , would allow uranium enrichment , but force un inspections as well .
the proposal is favored by a deputy of german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who said the participants thursday would likely consider the idea . not at the finish line but a solid solution remains far off . " we have n't reached finish line yet , " foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier told the bundestag during a general debate on wednesday . iran has remained resolute in the face of international diplomatic pressure .
after more than two years of negotiations with britain , france and germany , it resumed uranium enrichment earlier this year .
the eu-3 broke off diplomatic negotiations soon after and u.s. representatives began looking for a way to refer the issue to the security council , where sanctions were possible . no military option , no talk of sanctions those plans appear abandoned given the stalemate at the moment - and any sort of military option against the islamic state seems far more unlikely .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uranium enrichment has been taken up again at isfahan " contrary to what has been said , there is no military option on the table .
there is no discussion of sanctions , " friedrich groenig , the head of arms control and disarmament at the german foreign minister told reuters . merkel is hoping for a resolution tomorrow , and says germany 's willingness to host the meeting is a sign of the country 's commitment to being a diplomatic player on the world stage .

but while some call for sanctions , others say such measures will punish the wrong people . the eu must firmly condemn the belarus regime for its bloody crackdown on opposition supporters after presidential polls , but should not impose sanctions that hurt the people , polish prime minister kazimierz marcinkiewicz said in riga thursday .

" this pipeline is not aimed against anyone but is aimed at ensuring the security of gas supplies to europe , " schröder said . " not only in germany but throughout western europe there is growing need for gas , while domestic production is falling , " he said .
" this project is in the interests of germany .
that is why it will be supported by every german government . " schröder added that he would be paid 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 300,000 -rrb- annually for holding the post . the 61-year old former chancellor is also an advisor to swiss media group ringier and international investment bank rothschild and has made lucrative public-speaking appearances . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life 's a gas : the old friends are reunited in business his acceptance of the job less than a month after he left the chancellor 's office last november prompted widespread criticism in germany .
he and russian president vladimir putin had worked closely on cementing german investment in the pipeline . earlier this month a lawyer acting for schröder said that he had won a temporary injunction against the leader of the liberal free democrats , guido westerwelle , preventing him from linking schröder 's post as chancellor to his involvement in the pipeline . appointment and pipeline project under fire the project has also prompted criticism from new eu members lithuania and poland , which complained that schröder had gone over their heads on a pipeline that is likely to pass through several baltic countries ' territorial waters . other members of the supervisory board include gazprom chief executive alexei miller as well as officials from germany 's e.on and basf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe hopes to keep the russian taps turned on gazprom has a 51.0 percent stake in the north european gas pipeline , while stakes of 24.5 percent are held by e.on and basf . matthias warnig , representative of dresdner bank in russia , was named as the pipeline 's managing director . miller on thursday appeared to give backing to the idea of possible involvement in the project by gaz de france .
" this decision could be taken if the new partner brings something new of strategic importance , " miller said in response to a question from journalists . schröder looking to use german links in new role earlier this week schröder paid a visit to gazprom production facilities in the siberian province of yamalo-nenets . he also confirmed that he plans to create a " german-russian think tank " but denied a russian press report that the body would be a lobbying agency for promoting the russian economy in germany . work on the pipeline has already begun onshore in russia that is planned to extend around 1,200 kilometers -lrb- 750 miles -rrb- under the baltic sea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pipeline managing director matthias warnig the pipeline is eventually expected to connect not only to germany but to other parts of western europe , including the netherlands , sweden and britain and is expected to come on stream in 2010 with an initial capacity of around 27.5 billion cubic meters of natural gas a year .
a second pipeline is expected to double capacity to 55 billion cubic meters annually . the first part of the project will cost two to 2.5 billion euros and the total cost of the offshore section of the project will be over four billion euros , management has said . european union officials have sought to reassure new eu members worried that they could be left without supplies if russia no longer has to ship gas through their territory to western europe .

unity is the order of the day . for the past two and a half weeks , the un security council members have been at loggerheads over iran .
great britain , france and the u.s. disagree with russia and china on how to tackle the volatile islamic republic 's nuclear ambitions .
with the need to take a unified stance on the issue pressing , the foreign ministers of the five world powers will meet with merkel and eu foreign policy chief javier solana on how best to proceed .
the goal is to come out of the meeting with a unified stance and , hopefully , a draft resolution on iran that can go before the un security council . a new , weaker resolution ?
the latter will be more difficult to present .
with china and russia so far against hanging economic sanctions on iran , great britain , france and the u.s. are scrambling to find areas on which to compromise . reports out of the un in new york suggest that a new resolution is making the rounds that still forbids iran to enrich a uranium - part of the process of making an atomic bomb - but takes out language that would slap it with sanctions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are sanctions still on the table in the un ? another proposal , by the international crisis group in belgium , would allow uranium enrichment , but force un inspections as well .
the proposal is favored by a deputy of german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who said the participants thursday would likely consider the idea . not at the finish line but a solid solution remains far off . " we have n't reached finish line yet , " foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier told the bundestag during a general debate on wednesday . iran has remained resolute in the face of international diplomatic pressure .
after more than two years of negotiations with britain , france and germany , it resumed uranium enrichment earlier this year .
the eu-3 broke off diplomatic negotiations soon after and u.s. representatives began looking for a way to refer the issue to the security council , where sanctions were possible . no military option , no talk of sanctions those plans appear abandoned given the stalemate at the moment - and any sort of military option against the islamic state seems far more unlikely .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uranium enrichment has been taken up again at isfahan " contrary to what has been said , there is no military option on the table .
there is no discussion of sanctions , " friedrich groenig , the head of arms control and disarmament at the german foreign minister told reuters . merkel is hoping for a resolution tomorrow , and says germany 's willingness to host the meeting is a sign of the country 's commitment to being a diplomatic player on the world stage .
germany , she said , wants to contribute to the clear signal towards iran or " what works in international politics and what does n't .

" in many countries , the institutions of government refuse to provide up-to-date information , ministers decline to be interviewed and individual journalists or media organizations are excluded from press conferences . " ipi director johann fritz pointed out a british draft legislation " prohibiting the ' glorification ' of terrorism " following the july bombings in london and an eu discussion over the role of the media in " radicalizing " terrorism . these steps " signaled a shift in the balance between liberty and security and shaped the political debate over the controversial cartoons of mohammed published by the danish newspaper , jyllands posten , " he wrote in his foreword to the latest report . us and france not exempt fritz criticized china which " is embracing capitalism without introducing the requisite freedoms " and " american computer companies -lrb- who -rrb- helpfully censored their internet software " in compliance with beijing to establish themselves in the country .

the american software giant has one last chance to convince eu regulators it is complying with a two-year old ruling .
failure means 2 million euros in daily fines . facing the threat of daily fines , microsoft tried to convince eu anti-trust regulators thursday that the us software giant is meeting their demands to comply with a landmark 2004 competition ruling . even before the start of a two-day closed-door hearing , microsoft came out fighting , saying that new fines would not resolve the long-standing competition row . " in our view , a fine is not the answer , " said microsoft 's top lawyer , brad smith , as he arrived for the hearing with the european commission . in response , commission spokesman for competition issues jonathan todd said that the commission had little choice but to brandish the threat of fines . " also from the commission 's perspective , fines are not the best way to resolve the conflict but two years after the decision , we have tried all other ways so that microsoft complies with the decision and it has still not done so , " he said .

the american software giant has one last chance to convince eu regulators it is complying with a two-year old ruling .
failure means 2 million euros in daily fines . facing the threat of daily fines , microsoft tried to convince eu anti-trust regulators thursday that the us software giant is meeting their demands to comply with a landmark 2004 competition ruling . even before the start of a two-day closed-door hearing , microsoft came out fighting , saying that new fines would not resolve the long-standing competition row . " in our view , a fine is not the answer , " said microsoft 's top lawyer , brad smith , as he arrived for the hearing with the european commission . in response , commission spokesman for competition issues jonathan todd said that the commission had little choice but to brandish the threat of fines . " also from the commission 's perspective , fines are not the best way to resolve the conflict but two years after the decision , we have tried all other ways so that microsoft complies with the decision and it has still not done so , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new microsoft operating system vista may come under scrutiny also microsoft 's last chance the hearing is likely to be the microsoft 's last chance to prove it is complying with the european commission before regulators slap a daily fine of up to 2 million euros -lrb- $ 2.4 million -rrb- a day . smith , who is microsoft 's general counsel and is also third in command at the company , led a team of about 50 people including lawyers and computer scientists in its ranks . " we need clear guidance to find a solution , " he said .
" ultimately , the point i think we 'll underscore is this : we have complied and we 're willing to do more . " brussels growing impatient the commission is at pains to force microsoft to respect a march 2004 anti-trust ruling , in which the company was fined 497 million euros for abusing its dominant market position . microsoft was ordered to sell a version of its widely-used windows operating system unbundled from its media player software and to divulge information on its operating system needed by manufacturers of rival products . brussels has grown increasingly impatient for evidence that microsoft will comply and in december threatened to slap a fine , back-dated to december 15 , of up to 2 million euros a day on the company .

answer : the fifa world cup .
you can say it ... but you ca n't wear it .
not without a license anyway . nearly every company in germany wants to make money on the upcoming world cup in june .
but not everyone is allowed to advertise with the logo .
fifa , world soccer 's governing body , has laid down strict criteria for world cup 2006 slogans and advertising . while soccer fans are gearing up for the world cup , the biggest event the sport has to offer , others are dreaming about how to make big bucks from it . but far from being a free-for-all cash cow which benefits everyone , the soccer powers-that-be have stipulated that only official fifa sponsors are allowed to sell their goods using the world cup 2006 tag which puts some traders on the wrong side of the tournament organizers and potentially on the wrong side of the law . the official sponsors , companies like automaker hyundai and sports equipment giant adidas amongst others , are the only ones allowed to use certain trademarks copyrighted by fifa .
and they have certainly paid for the privilege . these " official " companies have paid around 45 million euros each for exclusive permission to use the world cup for advertising purposes .
in addition , there are the national sponsors like german railways , postbank and others who have each paid 13 million euros for the rights , but may only use the world cup logo for their advertising within germany . fifa believes that the high price for getting on the exclusive list is worth it and that those who intend to use the trademarks without acquiring these rights should be punished .
fifa spokesman andreas herren says it is only what official sponsors would expect .

answer : the fifa world cup .
you can say it ... but you ca n't wear it .
not without a license anyway . nearly every company in germany wants to make money on the upcoming world cup in june .
but not everyone is allowed to advertise with the logo .
fifa , world soccer 's governing body , has laid down strict criteria for world cup 2006 slogans and advertising . while soccer fans are gearing up for the world cup , the biggest event the sport has to offer , others are dreaming about how to make big bucks from it . but far from being a free-for-all cash cow which benefits everyone , the soccer powers-that-be have stipulated that only official fifa sponsors are allowed to sell their goods using the world cup 2006 tag which puts some traders on the wrong side of the tournament organizers and potentially on the wrong side of the law . the official sponsors , companies like automaker hyundai and sports equipment giant adidas amongst others , are the only ones allowed to use certain trademarks copyrighted by fifa .
and they have certainly paid for the privilege . these " official " companies have paid around 45 million euros each for exclusive permission to use the world cup for advertising purposes .
in addition , there are the national sponsors like german railways , postbank and others who have each paid 13 million euros for the rights , but may only use the world cup logo for their advertising within germany . fifa believes that the high price for getting on the exclusive list is worth it and that those who intend to use the trademarks without acquiring these rights should be punished .
fifa spokesman andreas herren says it is only what official sponsors would expect .
" companies who have acquired these rights of course deserve to be protected against this so-called ‘ ambush marketing ’ by free-riders . " those who unofficially use the world cup to make money face tough consequences .
during the 2002 world cup in japan / korea , for instance , fifa tracked down nearly 2,000 cases of fraud in 88 different countries .

answer : the fifa world cup .
you can say it ... but you ca n't wear it .
not without a license anyway . nearly every company in germany wants to make money on the upcoming world cup in june .
but not everyone is allowed to advertise with the logo .
fifa , world soccer 's governing body , has laid down strict criteria for world cup 2006 slogans and advertising . while soccer fans are gearing up for the world cup , the biggest event the sport has to offer , others are dreaming about how to make big bucks from it . but far from being a free-for-all cash cow which benefits everyone , the soccer powers-that-be have stipulated that only official fifa sponsors are allowed to sell their goods using the world cup 2006 tag which puts some traders on the wrong side of the tournament organizers and potentially on the wrong side of the law . the official sponsors , companies like automaker hyundai and sports equipment giant adidas amongst others , are the only ones allowed to use certain trademarks copyrighted by fifa .
and they have certainly paid for the privilege . these " official " companies have paid around 45 million euros each for exclusive permission to use the world cup for advertising purposes .
in addition , there are the national sponsors like german railways , postbank and others who have each paid 13 million euros for the rights , but may only use the world cup logo for their advertising within germany . fifa believes that the high price for getting on the exclusive list is worth it and that those who intend to use the trademarks without acquiring these rights should be punished .
fifa spokesman andreas herren says it is only what official sponsors would expect .
" companies who have acquired these rights of course deserve to be protected against this so-called ‘ ambush marketing ’ by free-riders . " those who unofficially use the world cup to make money face tough consequences .
during the 2002 world cup in japan / korea , for instance , fifa tracked down nearly 2,000 cases of fraud in 88 different countries .
over three million products were confiscated . official brand names a particularly prickly subject bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : official fifa products carry licensed logos and authenticity tags fifa gets particularly picky with the brand names " 2006 fifa world cup germany " and " world cup 2006 . "
those slogans enjoy special trademark protection .
those who abuse the trademark rights face punishment , says trademark lawyer martin chakraborty . " if someone uses the trademark illegally , say , to print it on t-shirts or baseballs caps to be sold outside the stadiums , then he will face a restraining order and could have to pay damages to fifa , " he says . visitors who buy and wear the unlicensed products could be forced by personnel to remove them at the stadiums .
however , not only would that mean potentially thousands of semi-naked fans teeming through the turnstiles ; it would also infringe on personal rights and freedom of action . spectators would have to stand up to the personnel and insist on their right to wear what they want which could lead to confrontation fifa and the german organizers are eager to avoid . high street traders unaware of potential fifa wrath while fifa expects businesses across germany to adhere to its strong-arm trademark policies , it seems that its message has not spread far enough to reach those who may be affected by it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knock-off merchandise can get traders into trouble in the cologne suburb of vingst , a number of traders were still blissfully unaware that selling unlicensed world cup products featuring seemingly innocuous slogans such as " world cup 2006 " could land them in hot water with the global soccer body . " i know these baseball caps are not licensed but i 'm not selling them as such , " said achim b. , the proprietor of a discount store selling a range of soccer related products .
" i 'm not trying to con anyone .
if they want to pay an extra 20 euros for the real thing , that ’ s up to them . " when informed that even the slogan " world cup 06 " could contravene fifa trademark rules , achim replied , " what else are we going to call it ?
soccer world championships 2006 ?
no one will know what that is ?
it 's the world cup .
anyway , i 'd never be able to fit that on a cap . " " crazy " fifa going too far , say shop owners " it 's just stupid , " said another trader who wished to remain anonymous .
" what will they do next ?
stop us from selling footballs because they have something to do with the world cup ?
we 'd have to call them ' balls to be kicked by the feet ' .
people would think i was crazy - just like fifa . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : champ 06 unofficial merchandise many companies have gotten around the strict trademark rules by marketing their products under world cup related headings without actually using the protected brand names .
however , the products lack a certain credibility without the world cup in the title and are perceived as cheap as a result . businesses are not alone in suffering under fifa 's control-freakery .
local authorities have also found that organizing small scale world cup related events under certain trademarked slogans could incur fifa 's wrath . katja hartmann , the events director with the phoenix sports club near ostheim , was forced to rename her world cup opening day festivities in line with fifa rules . local opening gala forced to change its name " we intended to hold our gala on june 9 under the title ' world cup festival 2006 ' but after applying for the necessary licenses we were advised by lawyers that the name could infringe on fifa trademarks .
unless we were willing to pay lots of money to use it , we had to change the name or go ahead and face the consequences . " " it was not such a big deal to change it but we felt pressured .

answer : the fifa world cup .
you can say it ... but you ca n't wear it .
not without a license anyway . nearly every company in germany wants to make money on the upcoming world cup in june .
but not everyone is allowed to advertise with the logo .
fifa , world soccer 's governing body , has laid down strict criteria for world cup 2006 slogans and advertising . while soccer fans are gearing up for the world cup , the biggest event the sport has to offer , others are dreaming about how to make big bucks from it . but far from being a free-for-all cash cow which benefits everyone , the soccer powers-that-be have stipulated that only official fifa sponsors are allowed to sell their goods using the world cup 2006 tag which puts some traders on the wrong side of the tournament organizers and potentially on the wrong side of the law . the official sponsors , companies like automaker hyundai and sports equipment giant adidas amongst others , are the only ones allowed to use certain trademarks copyrighted by fifa .
and they have certainly paid for the privilege . these " official " companies have paid around 45 million euros each for exclusive permission to use the world cup for advertising purposes .
in addition , there are the national sponsors like german railways , postbank and others who have each paid 13 million euros for the rights , but may only use the world cup logo for their advertising within germany . fifa believes that the high price for getting on the exclusive list is worth it and that those who intend to use the trademarks without acquiring these rights should be punished .
fifa spokesman andreas herren says it is only what official sponsors would expect .
" companies who have acquired these rights of course deserve to be protected against this so-called ‘ ambush marketing ’ by free-riders . " those who unofficially use the world cup to make money face tough consequences .
during the 2002 world cup in japan / korea , for instance , fifa tracked down nearly 2,000 cases of fraud in 88 different countries .
over three million products were confiscated . official brand names a particularly prickly subject bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : official fifa products carry licensed logos and authenticity tags fifa gets particularly picky with the brand names " 2006 fifa world cup germany " and " world cup 2006 . "
those slogans enjoy special trademark protection .
those who abuse the trademark rights face punishment , says trademark lawyer martin chakraborty . " if someone uses the trademark illegally , say , to print it on t-shirts or baseballs caps to be sold outside the stadiums , then he will face a restraining order and could have to pay damages to fifa , " he says . visitors who buy and wear the unlicensed products could be forced by personnel to remove them at the stadiums .
however , not only would that mean potentially thousands of semi-naked fans teeming through the turnstiles ; it would also infringe on personal rights and freedom of action . spectators would have to stand up to the personnel and insist on their right to wear what they want which could lead to confrontation fifa and the german organizers are eager to avoid . high street traders unaware of potential fifa wrath while fifa expects businesses across germany to adhere to its strong-arm trademark policies , it seems that its message has not spread far enough to reach those who may be affected by it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knock-off merchandise can get traders into trouble in the cologne suburb of vingst , a number of traders were still blissfully unaware that selling unlicensed world cup products featuring seemingly innocuous slogans such as " world cup 2006 " could land them in hot water with the global soccer body . " i know these baseball caps are not licensed but i 'm not selling them as such , " said achim b. , the proprietor of a discount store selling a range of soccer related products .
" i 'm not trying to con anyone .
if they want to pay an extra 20 euros for the real thing , that ’ s up to them . " when informed that even the slogan " world cup 06 " could contravene fifa trademark rules , achim replied , " what else are we going to call it ?
soccer world championships 2006 ?
no one will know what that is ?
it 's the world cup .
anyway , i 'd never be able to fit that on a cap . " " crazy " fifa going too far , say shop owners " it 's just stupid , " said another trader who wished to remain anonymous .
" what will they do next ?

we 'd have to call them ' balls to be kicked by the feet ' .
people would think i was crazy - just like fifa . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : champ 06 unofficial merchandise many companies have gotten around the strict trademark rules by marketing their products under world cup related headings without actually using the protected brand names .
however , the products lack a certain credibility without the world cup in the title and are perceived as cheap as a result . businesses are not alone in suffering under fifa 's control-freakery .
local authorities have also found that organizing small scale world cup related events under certain trademarked slogans could incur fifa 's wrath . katja hartmann , the events director with the phoenix sports club near ostheim , was forced to rename her world cup opening day festivities in line with fifa rules . local opening gala forced to change its name " we intended to hold our gala on june 9 under the title ' world cup festival 2006 ' but after applying for the necessary licenses we were advised by lawyers that the name could infringe on fifa trademarks .
unless we were willing to pay lots of money to use it , we had to change the name or go ahead and face the consequences . " " it was not such a big deal to change it but we felt pressured .

she said that reunited germany was now assuming greater responsibility in line with united nations and european union requirements . success on the international scene , however , was not the main topic of the parliamentary debate .
as widespread protests against pay cuts and layoffs continue throughout the country , merkel and her grand coalition government said they were stepping up efforts to find solutions to the pressing social and economic problems . labor reforms the latest unemployment figures for germany , which are published this thursday , are good news for the government : the number of jobless has dropped below the 5 million mark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frustrated by some of his coalition partners : labor minister franz müntefering merkel , however , appeared exasperated after a rift in the grand coalition over labor reforms .
social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- labor minister franz müntefering 's announced he was halting the labor reforms because some members of merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- were taking steps away from the coalition agreement and asking for reforms that would go beyond the agreed-upon measures such as allowing companies to fire workers during the two-year probationary period . " let 's first of all do what we resolved to do , " merkel said .
" we made an agreement on this . " merkel asked everybody to stick to the agreement and revisit the issue of germany 's job protection rules in two years .
but some members of her own party remained impatient . " the section on employment law in the coalition agreement does not go far enough , " said christian wulff , the conservative premier of lower saxony .
" it does not adequately reflect the real need for reform . " the trade unions , on the other hand , are stepping up pressure on spd - traditionally seen as a champion of workers ' rights . " the trade union 's goal is for dismissal protection not to deteriorate , but rather to be maintained , or even improved , " said michael sommer , head of the dgb trade union federation for german daily die welt .
" not everything that is in the coalition agreement must be implemented . " energy reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opposition is not her main problem : german chancellor angela merkel merkel announced that her grand coalition government would introduce a new long-term energy strategy in the second half of next year .
this moves comes as a response to the growing concern about germany 's reliance on russian natural gas and the rekindled debate about the country 's nuclear phase out program . " just because we have a difference of opinion on this one issue does n't mean we can afford to ignore the question of how our energy strategy out to 2020 should look , " merkel said in her speech before the bundestag . one of the most crucial pieces of legislation passed by outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens , in the eyes of many , was a planned phase-out of germany 's atomic energy plants by 2020 . the idea , largely pressed by the environmentally-friendly greens , was to focus on renewable energy and away from a crippling dependence on oil .
it also found support at a time when safety concerns over nuclear power reactors were highlighted with accidents like the one in chernobyl in 1986 .
the social democrats in the current grand coalition government made the nuclear phase-out an important part of the coalition agreement which was signed before the new government took office . german economics minister michael gloss , who raised quite a few eyebrows when he suggested in january that germany should reconsider prolonging the use of nuclear energy , toned down his views . " the nuclear exist is written into law and at the present time i do n't believe that the majority necessary to change this agreement exists in the german bundestag , " glos said in an interview for german daily handelsblatt . health reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : staying healthy has become more expensive in germany the german chancellor reassured parliamentarians that her coalition government would now start working seriously on an overdue reform of the statutory health system .
she said she was confident that the current clash of concepts could be overcome in a constructive manner . at present , merkel 's conservatives are backing a flat monthly premium paid regardless of income , while the social democrats favor a broadening of the funding base by bringing in currently exempt groups of the population and making them pay in line with their earnings . next year the public health care system will have a budget hole between 8 and 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.6 billion to $ 12 billion -rrb- .
germans , who have long enjoyed one of the most beneficial health care systems in europe , will have to steel themselves for difficult changes ahead .
as is , workers and employers split the monthly premiums to health care providers .
about 10 percent of the population has elected out of the state-sponsored public system , preferring costlier , but some say better , private insurance . opposition strikes back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they did n't get enough votes to form a coaltion : merkel and fdp leader westerwelle -lrb- right -rrb- oposition free-market liberal party -lrb- fdp -rrb- chief guido westerwelle accused the government of planning to raise taxes further as of next year despite pre-election promises to the contrary .
he also demanded that the government should finally think hard about introducing a simpler tax system that citizens could relate to . " since you took office , you 've been telling us that this is the sort of tax policy you ca n't do in germany , " westerwelle said .
" you should finally defend your own ideas and convictions instead of pandering to the interests of your social democrat coalition partners . " the floor leader of the opposition left party , oskar lafontaine - himself a social democrat renegade - sharply criticized the government for what he described as grave budgetary neglect in the areas of education and research : " it 's outrageous that germany is among the poorest performers within oecd countries when it comes to investing in research and education , " lafontaine said .
" this is a situation that the new government seems unwilling to change .
but it has to be changed , if we 're serious about leading the country forward . " despite the attempts by the opposition to tear apart the government 's policy , the actors within the grand coalition do n't have much to fear since they have a comfortable majority of seats in both houses of parliament .
they can only self-destruct by engaging in internal struggles and failing to implement their own agreements . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany borrows heavily to balance 2006 budget germany 's grand coalition government has presented its 2006 budget plan to parliament to seek approval for a rise in spending and the creation of new debt in its efforts to boost the economy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 30.03.2006 german parliament debates reforms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government has a safe majority in the parliament using wednesday 's debate about the chancellery 's budget for 2006 as a peg , german parliamentarians engaged in a general exchange of arguments and opinions about the grand coalition 's policies . german conservative chancellor angela merkel , who has won widespread praise for her appearances in the international arena and on the foreign policy front , started her address to the parliament on wednesday with an optimistic assessment of the country 's role in peace-keeping missions .
she said that reunited germany was now assuming greater responsibility in line with united nations and european union requirements . success on the international scene , however , was not the main topic of the parliamentary debate .
as widespread protests against pay cuts and layoffs continue throughout the country , merkel and her grand coalition government said they were stepping up efforts to find solutions to the pressing social and economic problems . labor reforms the latest unemployment figures for germany , which are published this thursday , are good news for the government : the number of jobless has dropped below the 5 million mark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frustrated by some of his coalition partners : labor minister franz müntefering merkel , however , appeared exasperated after a rift in the grand coalition over labor reforms .
social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- labor minister franz müntefering 's announced he was halting the labor reforms because some members of merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- were taking steps away from the coalition agreement and asking for reforms that would go beyond the agreed-upon measures such as allowing companies to fire workers during the two-year probationary period . " let 's first of all do what we resolved to do , " merkel said .
" we made an agreement on this . " merkel asked everybody to stick to the agreement and revisit the issue of germany 's job protection rules in two years .
but some members of her own party remained impatient . " the section on employment law in the coalition agreement does not go far enough , " said christian wulff , the conservative premier of lower saxony .
" it does not adequately reflect the real need for reform . " the trade unions , on the other hand , are stepping up pressure on spd - traditionally seen as a champion of workers ' rights . " the trade union 's goal is for dismissal protection not to deteriorate , but rather to be maintained , or even improved , " said michael sommer , head of the dgb trade union federation for german daily die welt .
" not everything that is in the coalition agreement must be implemented . " energy reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opposition is not her main problem : german chancellor angela merkel merkel announced that her grand coalition government would introduce a new long-term energy strategy in the second half of next year .
this moves comes as a response to the growing concern about germany 's reliance on russian natural gas and the rekindled debate about the country 's nuclear phase out program . " just because we have a difference of opinion on this one issue does n't mean we can afford to ignore the question of how our energy strategy out to 2020 should look , " merkel said in her speech before the bundestag . one of the most crucial pieces of legislation passed by outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens , in the eyes of many , was a planned phase-out of germany 's atomic energy plants by 2020 . the idea , largely pressed by the environmentally-friendly greens , was to focus on renewable energy and away from a crippling dependence on oil .
it also found support at a time when safety concerns over nuclear power reactors were highlighted with accidents like the one in chernobyl in 1986 .
the social democrats in the current grand coalition government made the nuclear phase-out an important part of the coalition agreement which was signed before the new government took office . german economics minister michael gloss , who raised quite a few eyebrows when he suggested in january that germany should reconsider prolonging the use of nuclear energy , toned down his views . " the nuclear exist is written into law and at the present time i do n't believe that the majority necessary to change this agreement exists in the german bundestag , " glos said in an interview for german daily handelsblatt . health reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : staying healthy has become more expensive in germany the german chancellor reassured parliamentarians that her coalition government would now start working seriously on an overdue reform of the statutory health system .
she said she was confident that the current clash of concepts could be overcome in a constructive manner . at present , merkel 's conservatives are backing a flat monthly premium paid regardless of income , while the social democrats favor a broadening of the funding base by bringing in currently exempt groups of the population and making them pay in line with their earnings . next year the public health care system will have a budget hole between 8 and 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.6 billion to $ 12 billion -rrb- .
germans , who have long enjoyed one of the most beneficial health care systems in europe , will have to steel themselves for difficult changes ahead .
as is , workers and employers split the monthly premiums to health care providers .

he also demanded that the government should finally think hard about introducing a simpler tax system that citizens could relate to . " since you took office , you 've been telling us that this is the sort of tax policy you ca n't do in germany , " westerwelle said .
" you should finally defend your own ideas and convictions instead of pandering to the interests of your social democrat coalition partners . " the floor leader of the opposition left party , oskar lafontaine - himself a social democrat renegade - sharply criticized the government for what he described as grave budgetary neglect in the areas of education and research : " it 's outrageous that germany is among the poorest performers within oecd countries when it comes to investing in research and education , " lafontaine said .
" this is a situation that the new government seems unwilling to change .
but it has to be changed , if we 're serious about leading the country forward . " despite the attempts by the opposition to tear apart the government 's policy , the actors within the grand coalition do n't have much to fear since they have a comfortable majority of seats in both houses of parliament .

unity is the order of the day . for the past two and a half weeks , the un security council members have been at loggerheads over iran .
great britain , france and the u.s. disagree with russia and china on how to tackle the volatile islamic republic 's nuclear ambitions .
with the need to take a unified stance on the issue pressing , the foreign ministers of the five world powers will meet with merkel and eu foreign policy chief javier solana on how best to proceed .
the goal is to come out of the meeting with a unified stance and , hopefully , a draft resolution on iran that can go before the un security council . a new , weaker resolution ?
the latter will be more difficult to present .
with china and russia so far against hanging economic sanctions on iran , great britain , france and the u.s. are scrambling to find areas on which to compromise . reports out of the un in new york suggest that a new resolution is making the rounds that still forbids iran to enrich a uranium - part of the process of making an atomic bomb - but takes out language that would slap it with sanctions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are sanctions still on the table in the un ? another proposal , by the international crisis group in belgium , would allow uranium enrichment , but force un inspections as well .
the proposal is favored by a deputy of german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who said the participants thursday would likely consider the idea . not at the finish line but a solid solution remains far off . " we have n't reached finish line yet , " foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier told the bundestag during a general debate on wednesday . iran has remained resolute in the face of international diplomatic pressure .
after more than two years of negotiations with britain , france and germany , it resumed uranium enrichment earlier this year .
the eu-3 broke off diplomatic negotiations soon after and u.s. representatives began looking for a way to refer the issue to the security council , where sanctions were possible . no military option , no talk of sanctions those plans appear abandoned given the stalemate at the moment - and any sort of military option against the islamic state seems far more unlikely .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uranium enrichment has been taken up again at isfahan " contrary to what has been said , there is no military option on the table .
there is no discussion of sanctions , " friedrich groenig , the head of arms control and disarmament at the german foreign minister told reuters . merkel is hoping for a resolution tomorrow , and says germany 's willingness to host the meeting is a sign of the country 's commitment to being a diplomatic player on the world stage .
germany , she said , wants to contribute to the clear signal towards iran or " what works in international politics and what does n't .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 30.03.2006 german parliament debates reforms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government has a safe majority in the parliament using wednesday 's debate about the chancellery 's budget for 2006 as a peg , german parliamentarians engaged in a general exchange of arguments and opinions about the grand coalition 's policies . german conservative chancellor angela merkel , who has won widespread praise for her appearances in the international arena and on the foreign policy front , started her address to the parliament on wednesday with an optimistic assessment of the country 's role in peace-keeping missions .
she said that reunited germany was now assuming greater responsibility in line with united nations and european union requirements . success on the international scene , however , was not the main topic of the parliamentary debate .
as widespread protests against pay cuts and layoffs continue throughout the country , merkel and her grand coalition government said they were stepping up efforts to find solutions to the pressing social and economic problems . labor reforms the latest unemployment figures for germany , which are published this thursday , are good news for the government : the number of jobless has dropped below the 5 million mark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frustrated by some of his coalition partners : labor minister franz müntefering merkel , however , appeared exasperated after a rift in the grand coalition over labor reforms .
social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- labor minister franz müntefering 's announced he was halting the labor reforms because some members of merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- were taking steps away from the coalition agreement and asking for reforms that would go beyond the agreed-upon measures such as allowing companies to fire workers during the two-year probationary period . " let 's first of all do what we resolved to do , " merkel said .
" we made an agreement on this . " merkel asked everybody to stick to the agreement and revisit the issue of germany 's job protection rules in two years .
but some members of her own party remained impatient . " the section on employment law in the coalition agreement does not go far enough , " said christian wulff , the conservative premier of lower saxony .
" it does not adequately reflect the real need for reform . " the trade unions , on the other hand , are stepping up pressure on spd - traditionally seen as a champion of workers ' rights . " the trade union 's goal is for dismissal protection not to deteriorate , but rather to be maintained , or even improved , " said michael sommer , head of the dgb trade union federation for german daily die welt .
" not everything that is in the coalition agreement must be implemented . " energy reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opposition is not her main problem : german chancellor angela merkel merkel announced that her grand coalition government would introduce a new long-term energy strategy in the second half of next year .
this moves comes as a response to the growing concern about germany 's reliance on russian natural gas and the rekindled debate about the country 's nuclear phase out program . " just because we have a difference of opinion on this one issue does n't mean we can afford to ignore the question of how our energy strategy out to 2020 should look , " merkel said in her speech before the bundestag . one of the most crucial pieces of legislation passed by outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens , in the eyes of many , was a planned phase-out of germany 's atomic energy plants by 2020 . the idea , largely pressed by the environmentally-friendly greens , was to focus on renewable energy and away from a crippling dependence on oil .
it also found support at a time when safety concerns over nuclear power reactors were highlighted with accidents like the one in chernobyl in 1986 .
the social democrats in the current grand coalition government made the nuclear phase-out an important part of the coalition agreement which was signed before the new government took office . german economics minister michael gloss , who raised quite a few eyebrows when he suggested in january that germany should reconsider prolonging the use of nuclear energy , toned down his views . " the nuclear exist is written into law and at the present time i do n't believe that the majority necessary to change this agreement exists in the german bundestag , " glos said in an interview for german daily handelsblatt . health reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : staying healthy has become more expensive in germany the german chancellor reassured parliamentarians that her coalition government would now start working seriously on an overdue reform of the statutory health system .
she said she was confident that the current clash of concepts could be overcome in a constructive manner . at present , merkel 's conservatives are backing a flat monthly premium paid regardless of income , while the social democrats favor a broadening of the funding base by bringing in currently exempt groups of the population and making them pay in line with their earnings . next year the public health care system will have a budget hole between 8 and 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.6 billion to $ 12 billion -rrb- .
germans , who have long enjoyed one of the most beneficial health care systems in europe , will have to steel themselves for difficult changes ahead .
as is , workers and employers split the monthly premiums to health care providers .
about 10 percent of the population has elected out of the state-sponsored public system , preferring costlier , but some say better , private insurance . opposition strikes back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they did n't get enough votes to form a coaltion : merkel and fdp leader westerwelle -lrb- right -rrb- oposition free-market liberal party -lrb- fdp -rrb- chief guido westerwelle accused the government of planning to raise taxes further as of next year despite pre-election promises to the contrary .
he also demanded that the government should finally think hard about introducing a simpler tax system that citizens could relate to . " since you took office , you 've been telling us that this is the sort of tax policy you ca n't do in germany , " westerwelle said .
" you should finally defend your own ideas and convictions instead of pandering to the interests of your social democrat coalition partners . " the floor leader of the opposition left party , oskar lafontaine - himself a social democrat renegade - sharply criticized the government for what he described as grave budgetary neglect in the areas of education and research : " it 's outrageous that germany is among the poorest performers within oecd countries when it comes to investing in research and education , " lafontaine said .
" this is a situation that the new government seems unwilling to change .
but it has to be changed , if we 're serious about leading the country forward . " despite the attempts by the opposition to tear apart the government 's policy , the actors within the grand coalition do n't have much to fear since they have a comfortable majority of seats in both houses of parliament .
they can only self-destruct by engaging in internal struggles and failing to implement their own agreements . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany borrows heavily to balance 2006 budget germany 's grand coalition government has presented its 2006 budget plan to parliament to seek approval for a rise in spending and the creation of new debt in its efforts to boost the economy .

but while some call for sanctions , others say such measures will punish the wrong people . the eu must firmly condemn the belarus regime for its bloody crackdown on opposition supporters after presidential polls , but should not impose sanctions that hurt the people , polish prime minister kazimierz marcinkiewicz said in riga thursday . " belarus is our neighbor and what happens there touches us directly , " marcinkiewicz told reporters during a one-day visit .
" but economic sanctions or a blockade should not be applied as they would put pressure on the common people , not the ruling elite . " " a massive fraud " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riot police beat protesters in the belarusian capital minsk on saturday eu leaders agreed at a summit last week to widen a list of senior belarusian officials subject to a visa ban and said they were also considering financial sanctions .
poland has already imposed travel restrictions on belarusian officials it accused of falsifying results in the former soviet republic 's presidential election on march 19 in which " europe 's last dictator " won a landslide victory in a poll judged fraudulent by the eu , the u.s. and international observers . german chancellor angela merkel on wednesday denounced the belarus presidential election as marred by " massive fraud " as the lower house of parliament passed a resolution calling for the immediate release of arrested belarusian opposition activists and sanctions against the country by the european union . " this election was subject to massive fraud and somebody has to say so , " merkel told the bundestag . more than 500 arrested the german members of parliament are proposing to invite the main belarusian opposition candidate , alexander milinkevich , to the next meeting of eu foreign ministers in luxembourg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belarus ' opposition leader alexander milinkevich says he will return to belarus and continue to fight milinkevich , who led protests against the re-election of president alexander lukashenko , said he was going to poland thursday to tell the outside world what was going on in his country . " in the polish parliament i intend to say what is really happening in belarus , " alexander milinkevich told reuters .
he added that he had no plans to emigrate even though he faces jail if he returns to belarus in connection with the protests . so far , more than 500 people have been arrested in belarus after a wave of opposition demonstrations resulted in a bloody crackdown by pro-lukashenko security forces .
alexander kozulin , another opposition figure who ran against the president and was detained after the protests , has been charged with hooliganism and faces up to six years in jail . meanwhile , lukashenko postponed his inauguration friday to april with some suggesting that the protests , which drew as many as 10,000 people , had scared him . " maybe the main reason is lukashenko 's psychological mood , " milinkevich told reporters .

and business leaders , security experts and law enforcement gathering thursday and friday in london aim to change that . it has been quite a year for e-crime , say experts .
trojan horses have constantly bombarded banks and others in the financial sector .
phishing and identity theft attempts have risen to number about 8 million per day , according to security officials .
e-scams are costing businesses billions and that does n't include increasing funds - about 20 to 50 percent of total expenditures in the us and uk - to beef up security .
and it is only getting worse .
as a result , law enforcement , business and computer specialists have come together for the annual e-crime congress in london thursday and friday to find new methods to fight such cyber predators .
an illustrious group because it is such a growing problem internationally , the conference is attracting bigger names and from further afield , too .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : microsoft 's brad smith offered a reward of $ 5 million to those who help catch cyber criminals attendees include about 500 officials from governments , companies as amazon , ebay , skype and yahoo , bankers from scandinavia , the uk and the middle east and law enforcement such as the fbi , scotland yard and those from the china .
" the 2005 e-crime congress provided an excellent forum for us to interact with law enforcement agencies , security product vendors and others in the financial services industry to discuss the wider issues that affect us , " one british bank security official as quoted on the congress ' website .
e-crime remains a low priority e-crime , like white-collar crime , is low on the list of law enforcement priorities , experts say .
instead , police and intelligence agencies worldwide are busy grappling with violent crimes and terrorism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internet cafes in countries with few cyber or extradition laws are often used by cyber gangs in most countries , police officials are overworked and lack manpower and often expertise to investigate e-crime .
few prosecutors take on such cases and laws often lack teeth , experts say .
that lessens the already low deterrant power of law enforcement against cyber criminals , who already have very low odds of getting caught , especially if they are outside the us or europe .

" this pipeline is not aimed against anyone but is aimed at ensuring the security of gas supplies to europe , " schröder said . " not only in germany but throughout western europe there is growing need for gas , while domestic production is falling , " he said .
" this project is in the interests of germany .
that is why it will be supported by every german government . " schröder added that he would be paid 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 300,000 -rrb- annually for holding the post . the 61-year old former chancellor is also an advisor to swiss media group ringier and international investment bank rothschild and has made lucrative public-speaking appearances . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life 's a gas : the old friends are reunited in business his acceptance of the job less than a month after he left the chancellor 's office last november prompted widespread criticism in germany .
he and russian president vladimir putin had worked closely on cementing german investment in the pipeline . earlier this month a lawyer acting for schröder said that he had won a temporary injunction against the leader of the liberal free democrats , guido westerwelle , preventing him from linking schröder 's post as chancellor to his involvement in the pipeline . appointment and pipeline project under fire the project has also prompted criticism from new eu members lithuania and poland , which complained that schröder had gone over their heads on a pipeline that is likely to pass through several baltic countries ' territorial waters . other members of the supervisory board include gazprom chief executive alexei miller as well as officials from germany 's e.on and basf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe hopes to keep the russian taps turned on gazprom has a 51.0 percent stake in the north european gas pipeline , while stakes of 24.5 percent are held by e.on and basf . matthias warnig , representative of dresdner bank in russia , was named as the pipeline 's managing director . miller on thursday appeared to give backing to the idea of possible involvement in the project by gaz de france .

" this pipeline is not aimed against anyone but is aimed at ensuring the security of gas supplies to europe , " schröder said . " not only in germany but throughout western europe there is growing need for gas , while domestic production is falling , " he said .
" this project is in the interests of germany .
that is why it will be supported by every german government . " schröder added that he would be paid 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 300,000 -rrb- annually for holding the post . the 61-year old former chancellor is also an advisor to swiss media group ringier and international investment bank rothschild and has made lucrative public-speaking appearances . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life 's a gas : the old friends are reunited in business his acceptance of the job less than a month after he left the chancellor 's office last november prompted widespread criticism in germany .
he and russian president vladimir putin had worked closely on cementing german investment in the pipeline . earlier this month a lawyer acting for schröder said that he had won a temporary injunction against the leader of the liberal free democrats , guido westerwelle , preventing him from linking schröder 's post as chancellor to his involvement in the pipeline . appointment and pipeline project under fire the project has also prompted criticism from new eu members lithuania and poland , which complained that schröder had gone over their heads on a pipeline that is likely to pass through several baltic countries ' territorial waters . other members of the supervisory board include gazprom chief executive alexei miller as well as officials from germany 's e.on and basf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe hopes to keep the russian taps turned on gazprom has a 51.0 percent stake in the north european gas pipeline , while stakes of 24.5 percent are held by e.on and basf . matthias warnig , representative of dresdner bank in russia , was named as the pipeline 's managing director . miller on thursday appeared to give backing to the idea of possible involvement in the project by gaz de france .
" this decision could be taken if the new partner brings something new of strategic importance , " miller said in response to a question from journalists . schröder looking to use german links in new role earlier this week schröder paid a visit to gazprom production facilities in the siberian province of yamalo-nenets . he also confirmed that he plans to create a " german-russian think tank " but denied a russian press report that the body would be a lobbying agency for promoting the russian economy in germany . work on the pipeline has already begun onshore in russia that is planned to extend around 1,200 kilometers -lrb- 750 miles -rrb- under the baltic sea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pipeline managing director matthias warnig the pipeline is eventually expected to connect not only to germany but to other parts of western europe , including the netherlands , sweden and britain and is expected to come on stream in 2010 with an initial capacity of around 27.5 billion cubic meters of natural gas a year .

the year long inquiry , for the independent think tank the king 's fund , has highlighted serious short-comings in social care for elderly people .
and it 's warning that britain will have to spend far more of its national income on care for the elderly over the next two decades , as the population grows older .
this morning on breakfast : we asked : who cares for the elderly ?
watch our interview with the minister responsible for care liam byrne mp from the link to the right he said care in the home was being expanded and that was the best place for people to be looked after .
we heard harry 's story : how one family faced the problem of looking after their elderly father , after he had a stroke - watch again from the link to the right and we heard from the report 's author , derek wanless , the former natwest bank executive who 's been leading the king 's fund 's inquiry and : we want to hear your stories too : jump straight to our e-mail form the king 's fund report calls for the current means-tested care system to be scrapped .
in its place , everyone in need would be entitled to an agreed level of free care , which they could top up if they wanted .
if this system were in place at the moment , the wanless report reckons that half a million more elderly people would be getting some form of care from social services , such as home care , day care or a place in a residential home .
but it would mean almost doubling the amount of britain 's national income spent on caring for the elderly over the next two decades - to nearly 2 % of our entire economic output .
ageing population as a nation , we 're living longer .
generally , that 's good news - but it will put a huge burden on today 's generation of children as a they struggle to look after their parents .
in two decades ' time , experts predict that the number of people aged over 85 will have doubled .
those needing high levels of care are expected to rise by 50 % .
but the birth rate is falling , which means there will be fewer young people to look after them the wanless report points to widespread levels of dissatisfaction with the current system , which is patchy and difficult to understand .
means-testing can mean that those with modest savings or assets - such as the family home - end up losing out .

the california-based internet search firm outlined its plans in a filing to the us securities commission .
the news also coincided with google finalising the details of its $ 1bn strategic alliance with time warner 's aol unit .
google unveiled its plans just two days before it is due to join standard & poor 's index of 500 leading us shares .
google said it expected to sell shares mainly to index funds who will have to own a stake in the firm when it joins the s & p 500 .
if sold at wednesday 's closing price of $ 394.98 , google could raise as much as $ 2.1bn through its sale of extra shares .
however , shareholders fear google 's plan could mean the company will miss high earnings per share targets set by analysts .
as a result , the group 's shares slipped in after-hours trade .
official documents it filed with us market watchdogs gave little information about why the group wanted to raise the extra cash .
advertising expansion the plans for the share sale were revealed as google finalised the details of its tie-up with aol , which was announced late last year .
under the deal , google will take a 5 % stake in its biggest advertising partner in return for a $ 1bn investment to be made some time in the three months to the end of june .
aol will also receive a $ 300m credit to advertise its products and services on google , in return aol is expected to sell more graphical adverts .
so far google has mainly relied on adverts made up of a few words of text and a link .
in 2005 , aol accounted for about $ 550m , or 9 % , of google 's total revenue .

prime minister john howard said he did not intend to allow the institution of marriage " to be in any way undermined " .
the authorities in the australian capital territory -lrb- act -rrb- , which includes the capital canberra , introduced a bill on same-sex civil unions last week .
if the legislation is passed , it will be the first such law in australia , but federal government can overturn it .
australian law formally defines marriage as a union between a man and a woman .
" there is a special place in australian society for the institution of marriage , as historically understood , " said mr howard .
attorney general philip ruddock added that if the act authorities " seek to portray civil unions as a marriage , in our view , that is quite inappropriate " .
" it suggests to people who might be interested in civil union that what they have is a marriage , when in fact it is not , " mr ruddock said .
the head of the act government , john stanhope , said mr ruddock 's reaction revealed homophobia in the howard administration .
" one has to pose the question of whether or not the real reason -lrb- for mr ruddock 's stance -rrb- is that there is no place in john howard 's australia for homosexuals , " he told abc radio .

" there is a special place in australian society for the institution of marriage , as historically understood , " said mr howard .
attorney general philip ruddock added that if the act authorities " seek to portray civil unions as a marriage , in our view , that is quite inappropriate " .
" it suggests to people who might be interested in civil union that what they have is a marriage , when in fact it is not , " mr ruddock said .
the head of the act government , john stanhope , said mr ruddock 's reaction revealed homophobia in the howard administration .
" one has to pose the question of whether or not the real reason -lrb- for mr ruddock 's stance -rrb- is that there is no place in john howard 's australia for homosexuals , " he told abc radio .

investigators will focus on why the pilots failed to identify the correct airfield despite clear weather and warnings about the ballykelly airstrip .
eirjet said the pilot is " not flying " until the incident is thoroughly investigated by aviation authorities .
the liverpool-londonderry flight was carrying 39 passengers at the time .
eirjet , which was operating the flight on behalf of ryanair on wednesday , apologised but said the safety of the passengers was not compromised .
ballykelly and city of derry runways are aligned in the same direction .
pilots ' manuals outline the possibility of confusion in flight manuals over the airports , which are five miles apart .
eirjet said the incident " involved the aircraft landing at a runway exactly in line " with the airport 's runway .
human beings are fallible - from simple things like putting teabags in a milk jug to the other end of the spectrum of landing at the wrong runway captain mervyn granshaw british air line pilots ' association on thursday , the manager of city of derry airport said it was too early to conclude what the reason was for the incident .
seamus devine said it may have been a case of the pilot relying on what he could see , rather than on his instruments .
" an error took place somewhere and an aircraft ended up at an airfield it should n't have gone into , " said mr devine , who was a pilot for 20 years .
he added : " a pilot looks at the window , sees a runway , the human instinct - the visual cortex - takes over and you see a runway immediately below you , distrust your instruments , and go around and land on that runway . "
' plug those gaps ' captain mervyn granshaw , chairman of the british air line pilots ' association , said there were several reasons why such an incident could occur .
" clearly , it is a very worrying issue , " he said .
" human beings are fallible - from simple things like putting teabags in a milk jug to the other end of the spectrum of landing at the wrong runway .
" we know this in aviation , but we try to put in place processes , checks , balances to make sure we plug all those gaps . "
in over seven years of ryanair flights into city of derry airport , and over 20 years of ryanair-operated flights , such a mistake has never occurred before ryanair ryanair said in a statement it was due to an " error by the eirjet pilot who mistakenly believed he was on a visual approach to city of derry airport " .
the passengers were taken by coach from ballykelly to the airport .
the airstrip at ballykelly is primarily used by army helicopters and light aircraft .
it was built for huge military planes , making it one of the longest on the island .
eirjet said it would begin a full investigation , working in consultation with the department of transport , the irish aviation authority and the civil aviation authority .
the airline said it placed " paramount importance on passenger safety " .
ryanair said it would be carrying out its own investigation into the incident .

investigators will focus on why the pilots failed to identify the correct airfield despite clear weather and warnings about the ballykelly airstrip .
eirjet said the pilot is " not flying " until the incident is thoroughly investigated by aviation authorities .
the liverpool-londonderry flight was carrying 39 passengers at the time .
eirjet , which was operating the flight on behalf of ryanair on wednesday , apologised but said the safety of the passengers was not compromised .
ballykelly and city of derry runways are aligned in the same direction .
pilots ' manuals outline the possibility of confusion in flight manuals over the airports , which are five miles apart .
eirjet said the incident " involved the aircraft landing at a runway exactly in line " with the airport 's runway .
human beings are fallible - from simple things like putting teabags in a milk jug to the other end of the spectrum of landing at the wrong runway captain mervyn granshaw british air line pilots ' association on thursday , the manager of city of derry airport said it was too early to conclude what the reason was for the incident .
seamus devine said it may have been a case of the pilot relying on what he could see , rather than on his instruments .
" an error took place somewhere and an aircraft ended up at an airfield it should n't have gone into , " said mr devine , who was a pilot for 20 years .
he added : " a pilot looks at the window , sees a runway , the human instinct - the visual cortex - takes over and you see a runway immediately below you , distrust your instruments , and go around and land on that runway . "
' plug those gaps ' captain mervyn granshaw , chairman of the british air line pilots ' association , said there were several reasons why such an incident could occur .
" clearly , it is a very worrying issue , " he said .
" human beings are fallible - from simple things like putting teabags in a milk jug to the other end of the spectrum of landing at the wrong runway .
" we know this in aviation , but we try to put in place processes , checks , balances to make sure we plug all those gaps . "
in over seven years of ryanair flights into city of derry airport , and over 20 years of ryanair-operated flights , such a mistake has never occurred before ryanair ryanair said in a statement it was due to an " error by the eirjet pilot who mistakenly believed he was on a visual approach to city of derry airport " .
the passengers were taken by coach from ballykelly to the airport .
the airstrip at ballykelly is primarily used by army helicopters and light aircraft .
it was built for huge military planes , making it one of the longest on the island .
eirjet said it would begin a full investigation , working in consultation with the department of transport , the irish aviation authority and the civil aviation authority .
the airline said it placed " paramount importance on passenger safety " .
ryanair said it would be carrying out its own investigation into the incident .
in a statement , the company said : " in over seven years of ryanair flights into city of derry airport , and over 20 years of ryanair-operated flights , such a mistake has never occurred before . "
