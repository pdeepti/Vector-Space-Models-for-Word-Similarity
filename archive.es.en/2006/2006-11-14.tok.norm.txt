program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.11.2006 german court tries man for denying the holocaust großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rudolf 's lawyers are well known for repesenting far-right causes chemist germar rudolf is one of the most often cited holocaust deniers of the past decade , and now he 'll have to answer for his contention that there were no auschwitz gas chambers . the 42-year-old rudolf was arraigned at a regional court in mannheim on monday .
prosecutors accuse him of " representing the holocaust as a myth , " which is forbidden under german law .
he faces a second charge of disturbing the peace of the dead . rudolf called the holocaust " a gigantic fraud , " at the start of proceedings in mannheim . rudolf , who has a degree in chemistry , first attracted attention in the early 1990s , when he was called as an expert witness for the defense in the trial of a former german military general accused of denying the holocaust .
the report rudolf submitted to the court claimed that chemical tests carried out on material from the auschwitz concentration camp proved that there were no gas chambers there . rudolf was fired by his employer , the max planck institute , when that institution found out he had used his position to carry out the tests .
in 1996 , a court in the german city of tübingen found him guilty of public incitement for denying the holocaust and sentenced him to 14 months in jail . rudolf fled germany to escape that sentence , traveling first to spain , then england .
he eventually landed in the united states , where he unsuccessfully applied for political asylum . in november 2005 , he was deported to germany , where the authorities immediately arrested him . pseudonyms as sources bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the evidence for the holocuats is overwhelming , but denial remains a problem rudolf has been linked with the german far right , in particular with the republican party .
in 1998 , he submitted expert testimony on behalf of british holocaust denier david irving in the latter 's libel lawsuit against penguin books .
irving lost that suit . rudolf has published a number of works disputing the reality of the holocaust .
he has used half a dozen pseudonyms and had admitted to citing works published under his assumed names in order to create the impression that others support his theses .
he also gave an interview with an islamic radio station in which he disputes central facts concerning the holocaust . rudolf is the second prominent holocaust denier to face charges in mannheim this year .
this trial of the first , ernst zündel , got underway in june and is still going on . a verdict in rudolf 's case is not expected until 2007 . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts : banning german neo-nazi party is counterproductive leading german politicians have again called for a ban on germany 's national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , but neither this nor financial problems are likely to hurt the country 's far right , experts say .

they 've lived in germany because the country tolerates them without offering them the prospect of obtaining full-fledged residence permits . at least once a year they have to see the authorities who may or may not decide to prolong their stay in germany .
the foreigners ' undefined status is coupled with many disadvantages on the labor market and problems in social integration . on tuesday , germany 's ruling christian and social democrats said they had reached a deal on new and clearer legislation .
it will make the granting of residence status dependent on the number of years someone has been in germany .
aside from any other requirements , individuals will be able to receive a two-year residence permit if they 've lived here for at least eight years , or six years if they have children . during those two years , they will have to prove that they can find gainful employment and support themselves .
should they fail to do so , they will lose their residence permit and fall back to tolerated status .
social democrats had pushed for giving people residence permits first before asking them to find employment . broader access to labor market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social democrats hope the new regulation will make job applications easier " we just have to face the realities , " said dieter wiefelspütz , the domestic policy spokesman for the social democrats .
" the people we 're talking about are confronted with enormous difficulties in finding employment .
after all , it 's the state itself which has set up all sorts of hurdles .
so let 's look to the future and help them to broaden their access to the labor market instead of telling them that a job is a prerequisite for staying here . " christian democrats on the other hand had called for granting permits only once people have found work . strain on welfare system ? bavarian interior minister günther beckstein of the christian social union , the sister party of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union , has insisted that permanent residence status must only be granted to those who can support their families without having to fall back on state welfare money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservatives want to prevent additional cases of welfare recipients " we just wo n't accept tens of thousands of people more to strain the country 's already overburdened social systems , " he said on german public television .
" so it would be strange to grant residence status to someone who 's just not able to look after his family .
and it 's no solution for them to be working illegally .
they do n't pay any taxes , and should not be rewarded for this now .
it would be like saying that it 's okay to give somebody a driving license just because he 's been driving a car illegally for many years . " protecting children members of germany 's main opposition party , the free-market , liberal free democrats , meanwhile said they were most interested in finding a humane solution for affected school-age children who were born in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deporting children to a country that 's strange to them is inhumane , leutheusser-schnarrenberger says " these kids do n't know the countries of their parents ' origin at all , " said sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , a former federal justice minister .
" all they know is germany , here is where they live .
do you want to send them to , say , afghanistan or iraq ?
that would be ridiculous .
after all , we 're talking about human beings with real biographies , and not just about figures and quota . " the interior ministers of germany 's 16 states are expected to fine-tune the agreement at a meeting on thursday and friday . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin 's naturalization campaign defies dismal citizenship trend despite recent integration initiatives in germany , naturalization , considered the most effective way to become part of society , is proving unpopular .
fewer foreigners have become german citizens in the last five years .

the plan would allow migrants from non-eu country to work in the eu for a limited time .

prosecutors accuse him of " representing the holocaust as a myth , " which is forbidden under german law .
he faces a second charge of disturbing the peace of the dead . rudolf called the holocaust " a gigantic fraud , " at the start of proceedings in mannheim . rudolf , who has a degree in chemistry , first attracted attention in the early 1990s , when he was called as an expert witness for the defense in the trial of a former german military general accused of denying the holocaust .
the report rudolf submitted to the court claimed that chemical tests carried out on material from the auschwitz concentration camp proved that there were no gas chambers there . rudolf was fired by his employer , the max planck institute , when that institution found out he had used his position to carry out the tests .
in 1996 , a court in the german city of tübingen found him guilty of public incitement for denying the holocaust and sentenced him to 14 months in jail . rudolf fled germany to escape that sentence , traveling first to spain , then england .

they 've lived in germany because the country tolerates them without offering them the prospect of obtaining full-fledged residence permits . at least once a year they have to see the authorities who may or may not decide to prolong their stay in germany .
the foreigners ' undefined status is coupled with many disadvantages on the labor market and problems in social integration . on tuesday , germany 's ruling christian and social democrats said they had reached a deal on new and clearer legislation .
it will make the granting of residence status dependent on the number of years someone has been in germany .
aside from any other requirements , individuals will be able to receive a two-year residence permit if they 've lived here for at least eight years , or six years if they have children . during those two years , they will have to prove that they can find gainful employment and support themselves .
should they fail to do so , they will lose their residence permit and fall back to tolerated status .
social democrats had pushed for giving people residence permits first before asking them to find employment . broader access to labor market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social democrats hope the new regulation will make job applications easier " we just have to face the realities , " said dieter wiefelspütz , the domestic policy spokesman for the social democrats .
" the people we 're talking about are confronted with enormous difficulties in finding employment .
after all , it 's the state itself which has set up all sorts of hurdles .
so let 's look to the future and help them to broaden their access to the labor market instead of telling them that a job is a prerequisite for staying here . " christian democrats on the other hand had called for granting permits only once people have found work . strain on welfare system ? bavarian interior minister günther beckstein of the christian social union , the sister party of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union , has insisted that permanent residence status must only be granted to those who can support their families without having to fall back on state welfare money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservatives want to prevent additional cases of welfare recipients " we just wo n't accept tens of thousands of people more to strain the country 's already overburdened social systems , " he said on german public television .
" so it would be strange to grant residence status to someone who 's just not able to look after his family .
and it 's no solution for them to be working illegally .
they do n't pay any taxes , and should not be rewarded for this now .
it would be like saying that it 's okay to give somebody a driving license just because he 's been driving a car illegally for many years .

" all they know is germany , here is where they live .
do you want to send them to , say , afghanistan or iraq ?
that would be ridiculous .

the foreigners ' undefined status is coupled with many disadvantages on the labor market and problems in social integration . on tuesday , germany 's ruling christian and social democrats said they had reached a deal on new and clearer legislation .
it will make the granting of residence status dependent on the number of years someone has been in germany .
aside from any other requirements , individuals will be able to receive a two-year residence permit if they 've lived here for at least eight years , or six years if they have children . during those two years , they will have to prove that they can find gainful employment and support themselves .
should they fail to do so , they will lose their residence permit and fall back to tolerated status .
social democrats had pushed for giving people residence permits first before asking them to find employment . broader access to labor market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social democrats hope the new regulation will make job applications easier " we just have to face the realities , " said dieter wiefelspütz , the domestic policy spokesman for the social democrats .
" the people we 're talking about are confronted with enormous difficulties in finding employment .
after all , it 's the state itself which has set up all sorts of hurdles .
so let 's look to the future and help them to broaden their access to the labor market instead of telling them that a job is a prerequisite for staying here . " christian democrats on the other hand had called for granting permits only once people have found work . strain on welfare system ? bavarian interior minister günther beckstein of the christian social union , the sister party of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union , has insisted that permanent residence status must only be granted to those who can support their families without having to fall back on state welfare money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservatives want to prevent additional cases of welfare recipients " we just wo n't accept tens of thousands of people more to strain the country 's already overburdened social systems , " he said on german public television .
" so it would be strange to grant residence status to someone who 's just not able to look after his family .
and it 's no solution for them to be working illegally .
they do n't pay any taxes , and should not be rewarded for this now .
it would be like saying that it 's okay to give somebody a driving license just because he 's been driving a car illegally for many years . " protecting children members of germany 's main opposition party , the free-market , liberal free democrats , meanwhile said they were most interested in finding a humane solution for affected school-age children who were born in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deporting children to a country that 's strange to them is inhumane , leutheusser-schnarrenberger says " these kids do n't know the countries of their parents ' origin at all , " said sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , a former federal justice minister .
" all they know is germany , here is where they live .
do you want to send them to , say , afghanistan or iraq ?
that would be ridiculous .
after all , we 're talking about human beings with real biographies , and not just about figures and quota . " the interior ministers of germany 's 16 states are expected to fine-tune the agreement at a meeting on thursday and friday . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin 's naturalization campaign defies dismal citizenship trend despite recent integration initiatives in germany , naturalization , considered the most effective way to become part of society , is proving unpopular .

but now there 's a logical explanation . there 's no way around it .
merkel is , in her own words , " a bad driver . " she took so long to get her driving license back when she was a 26-year-old student that she had to resort to bribing her instructor to speed up the process . speaking to a celebrity audience at the golden steering wheel awards last week , merkel said that after 38 lessons she still was n't any closer to taking her test .
so she acted on advice from a friend who said she should offer her instructor cash " tips " in exchange for driving tips . " after that i got my license right away , " merkel said of the early practice she received in under-the-table deal making that may have come in handy as she climbed the political ladder . though she is seldom willing to give ground politically , it seems that merkel is at least a considerate driver - she has n't gotten behind the wheel since taking office . chancellor has parking problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maybe a sport mini is more merkel 's speed ?
the chancellor , currently the most powerful woman in the world , also admitted to needing a diminutive car because she ca n't park . currently the happy owner of an audi , she said if she had a lot of money , she 'd buy a mini .
" it 's practical , small and pleasant to look at and yet has a certain rakish style , " merkel said of the car . experts can not agree if this was wise comment in a country where size really does matter - the bigger -lrb- and faster -rrb- the car , the better . merkel , however , is certainly differentiating herself from her predecessor gerhard schröder .
he was nicknamed the " car chancellor " because of his love of cars and pro-automobile industry policies . if she does n't watch out , the current chancellor could be tagged " mini merkel .

the question is : will hamas ever accept israel 's right to exist ? the prospect of hamas and fatah forming a new unity cabinet - with mohammad shbair unofficially named to succeed hamas member ismail haniya as palestinian prime minister - was welcome news to european foreign ministers at their monthly meeting in brussels .
" such a government , " they said in a joint statement released on monday , " would also be a partner for the international community to support the re-launching of the peace process . "
the eu 's commissioner for external relations , benita ferrero-waldner , said she believed a new palestinian leadership could break the current impasse in the middle east .
" those seeking a new government need our support and a calm environment , " commented ferrero-waldner .
" let 's hope they have a good government with which we can work . "
germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier also welcomed the prospect of change .
" the talks between fatah and hamas seem to indicate that a national unity government could be possible , " steinmeier said .
" that would get the process of negotiations moving . "
and the eu 's foreign policy coordinator javier solana added that he was " optimistic " there would soon be a new palestinian government .
the middle east peace process ground to a halt this march , when hamas , whose charter calls for the destruction of israel , won palestinian elections .
a new government of technocrats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shbair is currently a palestinian mp and the former head of the islamic university in gaza shbair - a us-educated biologist who is not a member of either hamas or fatah - has not been officially nominated , but spokespeople from both factions say he has a good chance of becoming the next palestinian prime minister .
shbair has said he would accept the job .
his prospective appointment is widely seen as a move to put together a new government of experts and technocrats and downplay ideological figures such as haniya .
hamas and fatah are currently negotiating over the make-up of a new cabinet .
if a new government is formed , its first task will be to tackle the disastrous state of the palestinian authority 's finances .
after hamas ' election victory in march , the eu and the us froze aid payments to the palestinian government , demanding that hamas recognize israel .
as a result , the palestinian authority has had difficulty paying the salaries of most of its 165,000 workers since april .
the boycott has devastated the palestinian economy .
hamas hardliners bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu and the us consider hamas a terrorist organization but the eu and us will not resume aid payments until palestinians have a government that accepts the existence of israel - something hamas has consistently refused to do .
" our position in this regard remains unchanged , " hamas spokesman fawzi barhoum stated on tuesday .
" we reject joining in any government that recognizes israel . "
some hamas officials say a new government 's platform might be kept vague enough to get around the conflict .
but israel and the us are likely to press for an endorsement of the two-state solution , agreed by the so-called quartet of the us , the eu , russia and the un as the basis for middle east peace negotiations .

the question is : will hamas ever accept israel 's right to exist ? the prospect of hamas and fatah forming a new unity cabinet - with mohammad shbair unofficially named to succeed hamas member ismail haniya as palestinian prime minister - was welcome news to european foreign ministers at their monthly meeting in brussels .
" such a government , " they said in a joint statement released on monday , " would also be a partner for the international community to support the re-launching of the peace process . "
the eu 's commissioner for external relations , benita ferrero-waldner , said she believed a new palestinian leadership could break the current impasse in the middle east .
" those seeking a new government need our support and a calm environment , " commented ferrero-waldner .
" let 's hope they have a good government with which we can work . "
germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier also welcomed the prospect of change .
" the talks between fatah and hamas seem to indicate that a national unity government could be possible , " steinmeier said .
" that would get the process of negotiations moving . "
and the eu 's foreign policy coordinator javier solana added that he was " optimistic " there would soon be a new palestinian government .
the middle east peace process ground to a halt this march , when hamas , whose charter calls for the destruction of israel , won palestinian elections .
a new government of technocrats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shbair is currently a palestinian mp and the former head of the islamic university in gaza shbair - a us-educated biologist who is not a member of either hamas or fatah - has not been officially nominated , but spokespeople from both factions say he has a good chance of becoming the next palestinian prime minister .
shbair has said he would accept the job .
his prospective appointment is widely seen as a move to put together a new government of experts and technocrats and downplay ideological figures such as haniya .
hamas and fatah are currently negotiating over the make-up of a new cabinet .
if a new government is formed , its first task will be to tackle the disastrous state of the palestinian authority 's finances .
after hamas ' election victory in march , the eu and the us froze aid payments to the palestinian government , demanding that hamas recognize israel .
as a result , the palestinian authority has had difficulty paying the salaries of most of its 165,000 workers since april .
the boycott has devastated the palestinian economy .
hamas hardliners bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu and the us consider hamas a terrorist organization but the eu and us will not resume aid payments until palestinians have a government that accepts the existence of israel - something hamas has consistently refused to do .
" our position in this regard remains unchanged , " hamas spokesman fawzi barhoum stated on tuesday .
" we reject joining in any government that recognizes israel . "
some hamas officials say a new government 's platform might be kept vague enough to get around the conflict .
but israel and the us are likely to press for an endorsement of the two-state solution , agreed by the so-called quartet of the us , the eu , russia and the un as the basis for middle east peace negotiations .
officials from the quartet are scheduled to meet in cairo on wednesday to discuss the prospects of a new palestinian government . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de solana calls for return to mideast peace road map during a visit to the middle east , eu foreign policy chief javier solana expressed concern at the absence of peace talks between israel and the palestinians and said the european union was ready to offer its help .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european ties -pipe- 14.11.2006 poland scuppers eu talks on russia deal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has been accused of using its gas supplies as political leverage poland on monday blocked eu attempts to hold talks with russia over a new cooperation pact , demanding first a clear sign from moscow that its demands on trade and energy will be met . warsaw is taking a tough line , insisting that the eu pressure moscow to ratify an international energy charter and lift its embargoes on polish meat and plant products , before negotiations on a broader agreement can start . " we are unwilling to back off ... without a clear political signal from russia , " polish foreign minister anna fotyga told reporters after a meeting with her eu counterparts in brussels . fotyga did not indicate what poland would consider to be a clear political signal .
however she said she was " cautiously optimistic " of the chances of breaking the impasse . " russia uses energy as a political tool , it uses trade restrictions as a political tool , so there should be no surprise we are using the tools we have at our disposal , " she added . the 24 other eu member states are hoping to formulate an initial position on a new partnership and cooperation agreement with moscow ahead of a european union-russia summit on november 24 in helsinki . finnish foreign minister erkki tuomioja told a press conference after the talks that they have not ruled out an agreement before the eu-russia summit . " i would expect that we can finalize the mandate and have it adopted by the council -lrb- eu summit in mid-december -rrb- , " he said . embargo to stay until poland fixes food bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has insisted poland improve meat standards russia will not lift its embargo on certain polish foodstuffs until veterinary services put an end to continued " violations " a russian food security official said in moscow . " we can not guarantee the safety of these deliveries because we regularly detect violations in the import of various meat and other foodstuffs , " from poland , the spokesman was quoted as saying by russia 's interfax news agency . france and germany , among others , argued at an eu summit in finland last month that the tactics be changed , and that the bloc attempt to include as many of the energy charter 's main points as possible in the new partnership accord , even if russia has only signed and not ratified the document . these could include reliable access to russian energy supplies and pipelines , security of investments and transparency within the massive russian energy market . " i hope that between now and the eu-russia summit we can reach a common position , " said eu external affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner , while acknowledging the continued polish stance . the current eu-russia partnership accord runs out late next year but eu officials are playing down any talk of a deadline as the two sides agree that the existing deal will remain in place until a new agreement is reached . eu leaders had a chance for wide-ranging talks with russian president vladimir putin last month at an informal dinner in lahti , finland , when they appeared split over their attitude to moscow . although putin gave the leaders assurances that russia would continue to steadily and reliably pump oil and gas westward to eu consumers , he did not hesitate to take a swipe at georgia . even though eu-russia relations increasingly revolve around russia 's massive energy supplies , the europeans insist they will not shy away in talks with moscow from more prickly issues such as moscow 's hard-nosed approach to georgia . russia has cut off transport ties , deported hundreds of georgian citizens , and cracked down on georgian businesses in the worst dispute between the two since a 2003 revolution brought a pro-western leadership to power in georgia . russian ambassador ' not surprised ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin with european commission president jose manuel barroso russia 's ambassador to the european union said on monday that the european union should not be surprised that poland has become a stumbling block to a new eu-russia accord . " there is truly a need for consensus here , and it has been blocked by poland .
but i ca n't say that it came as a surprise , " vladimir chizhov said in comments on the rossiya television station . " we warned our partners in the eu about the difficulties the eu expansion of two years ago might bring , " he said .

" we failed two years ago because there was an ongoing investigation in the united states , but it is now clear that there is no chance of prosecuting high-ranking officials in the us , " kaleck told a press conference in berlin called to present the complaint . " we are not expecting that rumsfeld will appear in a court , but we are hoping investigators will begin looking into the case , " he said .
" if we fail here , we will try in france , or in spain .
we want to show that there will be no safe haven anywhere in the world for him . " the lawyer for the guantanamo detainee , mohammed al-qahtani , claims rumsfeld approved special " tactics " when he failed to break under interrogation .
the measures included sleep deprivation and a ban on praying , lawyer gitanjali gutierrez said . " this is not just allegations , it is supported by government documentation , " she added . the complaint asks harms to open an investigation and , ultimately , a criminal prosecution that will look into the responsibility of high-ranking us officials for allegedly authorizing war crimes in the context of the war on terror , according to the lawyers . rumsfeld resigned last week after republicans lost control of the us congress to the opposition democrats in mid-term elections seen as a referendum on the war in iraq . former abu ghraib commander as defense witness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : janis karpinski at the berlin press conference the groups have former us army brigadier general janis karpinski , who commanded 17 us-run jails in iraq including abu ghraib , as a witness on their behalf . " what i see as my obligation is to provide the truth about what i saw and what i experienced in iraq , " karpinski said at a press conference .
" when i was getting too close to what was happening they took me out of the equation - they removed abu ghraib from my control . " hopefully my testimony will stop this sort of thing ever happening again .
i feel we have an obligation to the rest of the world because if the us does something it gives permission to the rest of the world , but it does n't mean it is right , " karpinski added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other top-ranking us officials are named in the lawsuit former white house counsel and current attorney general alberto gonzales , former director of the central intelligence agency george tenet , and other high-ranking us officials are also charged in the complaint . other groups involved in the suit include the us-based center for constitutional rights and the paris-based international federation for human rights . the abu ghraib scandal erupted in 2004 after photographs were leaked to the press showing us guards mistreating and sexually humiliating prisoners .

" we are unwilling to back off ... without a clear political signal from russia , " polish foreign minister anna fotyga told reporters after a meeting with her eu counterparts in brussels . fotyga did not indicate what poland would consider to be a clear political signal .
however she said she was " cautiously optimistic " of the chances of breaking the impasse . " russia uses energy as a political tool , it uses trade restrictions as a political tool , so there should be no surprise we are using the tools we have at our disposal , " she added . the 24 other eu member states are hoping to formulate an initial position on a new partnership and cooperation agreement with moscow ahead of a european union-russia summit on november 24 in helsinki . finnish foreign minister erkki tuomioja told a press conference after the talks that they have not ruled out an agreement before the eu-russia summit . " i would expect that we can finalize the mandate and have it adopted by the council -lrb- eu summit in mid-december -rrb- , " he said . embargo to stay until poland fixes food bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has insisted poland improve meat standards russia will not lift its embargo on certain polish foodstuffs until veterinary services put an end to continued " violations " a russian food security official said in moscow . " we can not guarantee the safety of these deliveries because we regularly detect violations in the import of various meat and other foodstuffs , " from poland , the spokesman was quoted as saying by russia 's interfax news agency . france and germany , among others , argued at an eu summit in finland last month that the tactics be changed , and that the bloc attempt to include as many of the energy charter 's main points as possible in the new partnership accord , even if russia has only signed and not ratified the document . these could include reliable access to russian energy supplies and pipelines , security of investments and transparency within the massive russian energy market . " i hope that between now and the eu-russia summit we can reach a common position , " said eu external affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner , while acknowledging the continued polish stance . the current eu-russia partnership accord runs out late next year but eu officials are playing down any talk of a deadline as the two sides agree that the existing deal will remain in place until a new agreement is reached . eu leaders had a chance for wide-ranging talks with russian president vladimir putin last month at an informal dinner in lahti , finland , when they appeared split over their attitude to moscow . although putin gave the leaders assurances that russia would continue to steadily and reliably pump oil and gas westward to eu consumers , he did not hesitate to take a swipe at georgia . even though eu-russia relations increasingly revolve around russia 's massive energy supplies , the europeans insist they will not shy away in talks with moscow from more prickly issues such as moscow 's hard-nosed approach to georgia . russia has cut off transport ties , deported hundreds of georgian citizens , and cracked down on georgian businesses in the worst dispute between the two since a 2003 revolution brought a pro-western leadership to power in georgia . russian ambassador ' not surprised ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin with european commission president jose manuel barroso russia 's ambassador to the european union said on monday that the european union should not be surprised that poland has become a stumbling block to a new eu-russia accord . " there is truly a need for consensus here , and it has been blocked by poland .
but i ca n't say that it came as a surprise , " vladimir chizhov said in comments on the rossiya television station . " we warned our partners in the eu about the difficulties the eu expansion of two years ago might bring , " he said .

the question is : will hamas ever accept israel 's right to exist ? the prospect of hamas and fatah forming a new unity cabinet - with mohammad shbair unofficially named to succeed hamas member ismail haniya as palestinian prime minister - was welcome news to european foreign ministers at their monthly meeting in brussels .
" such a government , " they said in a joint statement released on monday , " would also be a partner for the international community to support the re-launching of the peace process . "
the eu 's commissioner for external relations , benita ferrero-waldner , said she believed a new palestinian leadership could break the current impasse in the middle east .
" those seeking a new government need our support and a calm environment , " commented ferrero-waldner .
" let 's hope they have a good government with which we can work . "
germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier also welcomed the prospect of change .
" the talks between fatah and hamas seem to indicate that a national unity government could be possible , " steinmeier said .
" that would get the process of negotiations moving . "
and the eu 's foreign policy coordinator javier solana added that he was " optimistic " there would soon be a new palestinian government .
the middle east peace process ground to a halt this march , when hamas , whose charter calls for the destruction of israel , won palestinian elections .
a new government of technocrats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shbair is currently a palestinian mp and the former head of the islamic university in gaza shbair - a us-educated biologist who is not a member of either hamas or fatah - has not been officially nominated , but spokespeople from both factions say he has a good chance of becoming the next palestinian prime minister .
shbair has said he would accept the job .
his prospective appointment is widely seen as a move to put together a new government of experts and technocrats and downplay ideological figures such as haniya .
hamas and fatah are currently negotiating over the make-up of a new cabinet .
if a new government is formed , its first task will be to tackle the disastrous state of the palestinian authority 's finances .
after hamas ' election victory in march , the eu and the us froze aid payments to the palestinian government , demanding that hamas recognize israel .
as a result , the palestinian authority has had difficulty paying the salaries of most of its 165,000 workers since april .
the boycott has devastated the palestinian economy .
hamas hardliners bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu and the us consider hamas a terrorist organization but the eu and us will not resume aid payments until palestinians have a government that accepts the existence of israel - something hamas has consistently refused to do .
" our position in this regard remains unchanged , " hamas spokesman fawzi barhoum stated on tuesday .
" we reject joining in any government that recognizes israel . "
some hamas officials say a new government 's platform might be kept vague enough to get around the conflict .
but israel and the us are likely to press for an endorsement of the two-state solution , agreed by the so-called quartet of the us , the eu , russia and the un as the basis for middle east peace negotiations .
officials from the quartet are scheduled to meet in cairo on wednesday to discuss the prospects of a new palestinian government . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de solana calls for return to mideast peace road map during a visit to the middle east , eu foreign policy chief javier solana expressed concern at the absence of peace talks between israel and the palestinians and said the european union was ready to offer its help .

the question is : will hamas ever accept israel 's right to exist ? the prospect of hamas and fatah forming a new unity cabinet - with mohammad shbair unofficially named to succeed hamas member ismail haniya as palestinian prime minister - was welcome news to european foreign ministers at their monthly meeting in brussels .

prosecutors accuse him of " representing the holocaust as a myth , " which is forbidden under german law .
he faces a second charge of disturbing the peace of the dead . rudolf called the holocaust " a gigantic fraud , " at the start of proceedings in mannheim . rudolf , who has a degree in chemistry , first attracted attention in the early 1990s , when he was called as an expert witness for the defense in the trial of a former german military general accused of denying the holocaust .
the report rudolf submitted to the court claimed that chemical tests carried out on material from the auschwitz concentration camp proved that there were no gas chambers there . rudolf was fired by his employer , the max planck institute , when that institution found out he had used his position to carry out the tests .
in 1996 , a court in the german city of tübingen found him guilty of public incitement for denying the holocaust and sentenced him to 14 months in jail . rudolf fled germany to escape that sentence , traveling first to spain , then england .
he eventually landed in the united states , where he unsuccessfully applied for political asylum . in november 2005 , he was deported to germany , where the authorities immediately arrested him . pseudonyms as sources bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the evidence for the holocuats is overwhelming , but denial remains a problem rudolf has been linked with the german far right , in particular with the republican party .

they 've lived in germany because the country tolerates them without offering them the prospect of obtaining full-fledged residence permits . at least once a year they have to see the authorities who may or may not decide to prolong their stay in germany .
the foreigners ' undefined status is coupled with many disadvantages on the labor market and problems in social integration . on tuesday , germany 's ruling christian and social democrats said they had reached a deal on new and clearer legislation .
it will make the granting of residence status dependent on the number of years someone has been in germany .
aside from any other requirements , individuals will be able to receive a two-year residence permit if they 've lived here for at least eight years , or six years if they have children . during those two years , they will have to prove that they can find gainful employment and support themselves .

" so it would be strange to grant residence status to someone who 's just not able to look after his family .
and it 's no solution for them to be working illegally .
they do n't pay any taxes , and should not be rewarded for this now .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 14.11.2006 eu cautiously optimistic on possible new palestinian government großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the palestinian authority has been under an eu aid embargo since march eu foreign policy leaders expressed hope that a new palestinian government could help revive middle east peace negotiations .
the question is : will hamas ever accept israel 's right to exist ? the prospect of hamas and fatah forming a new unity cabinet - with mohammad shbair unofficially named to succeed hamas member ismail haniya as palestinian prime minister - was welcome news to european foreign ministers at their monthly meeting in brussels .
" such a government , " they said in a joint statement released on monday , " would also be a partner for the international community to support the re-launching of the peace process . "
the eu 's commissioner for external relations , benita ferrero-waldner , said she believed a new palestinian leadership could break the current impasse in the middle east .
" those seeking a new government need our support and a calm environment , " commented ferrero-waldner .
" let 's hope they have a good government with which we can work . "
germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier also welcomed the prospect of change .
" the talks between fatah and hamas seem to indicate that a national unity government could be possible , " steinmeier said .
" that would get the process of negotiations moving . "
and the eu 's foreign policy coordinator javier solana added that he was " optimistic " there would soon be a new palestinian government .
the middle east peace process ground to a halt this march , when hamas , whose charter calls for the destruction of israel , won palestinian elections .
a new government of technocrats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shbair is currently a palestinian mp and the former head of the islamic university in gaza shbair - a us-educated biologist who is not a member of either hamas or fatah - has not been officially nominated , but spokespeople from both factions say he has a good chance of becoming the next palestinian prime minister .
shbair has said he would accept the job .
his prospective appointment is widely seen as a move to put together a new government of experts and technocrats and downplay ideological figures such as haniya .
hamas and fatah are currently negotiating over the make-up of a new cabinet .
if a new government is formed , its first task will be to tackle the disastrous state of the palestinian authority 's finances .
after hamas ' election victory in march , the eu and the us froze aid payments to the palestinian government , demanding that hamas recognize israel .
as a result , the palestinian authority has had difficulty paying the salaries of most of its 165,000 workers since april .
the boycott has devastated the palestinian economy .
hamas hardliners bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu and the us consider hamas a terrorist organization but the eu and us will not resume aid payments until palestinians have a government that accepts the existence of israel - something hamas has consistently refused to do .
" our position in this regard remains unchanged , " hamas spokesman fawzi barhoum stated on tuesday .
" we reject joining in any government that recognizes israel . "
some hamas officials say a new government 's platform might be kept vague enough to get around the conflict .
but israel and the us are likely to press for an endorsement of the two-state solution , agreed by the so-called quartet of the us , the eu , russia and the un as the basis for middle east peace negotiations .
officials from the quartet are scheduled to meet in cairo on wednesday to discuss the prospects of a new palestinian government . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de solana calls for return to mideast peace road map during a visit to the middle east , eu foreign policy chief javier solana expressed concern at the absence of peace talks between israel and the palestinians and said the european union was ready to offer its help .

" we failed two years ago because there was an ongoing investigation in the united states , but it is now clear that there is no chance of prosecuting high-ranking officials in the us , " kaleck told a press conference in berlin called to present the complaint . " we are not expecting that rumsfeld will appear in a court , but we are hoping investigators will begin looking into the case , " he said .
" if we fail here , we will try in france , or in spain .
we want to show that there will be no safe haven anywhere in the world for him . " the lawyer for the guantanamo detainee , mohammed al-qahtani , claims rumsfeld approved special " tactics " when he failed to break under interrogation .
the measures included sleep deprivation and a ban on praying , lawyer gitanjali gutierrez said . " this is not just allegations , it is supported by government documentation , " she added . the complaint asks harms to open an investigation and , ultimately , a criminal prosecution that will look into the responsibility of high-ranking us officials for allegedly authorizing war crimes in the context of the war on terror , according to the lawyers . rumsfeld resigned last week after republicans lost control of the us congress to the opposition democrats in mid-term elections seen as a referendum on the war in iraq . former abu ghraib commander as defense witness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : janis karpinski at the berlin press conference the groups have former us army brigadier general janis karpinski , who commanded 17 us-run jails in iraq including abu ghraib , as a witness on their behalf . " what i see as my obligation is to provide the truth about what i saw and what i experienced in iraq , " karpinski said at a press conference .
" when i was getting too close to what was happening they took me out of the equation - they removed abu ghraib from my control . " hopefully my testimony will stop this sort of thing ever happening again .
i feel we have an obligation to the rest of the world because if the us does something it gives permission to the rest of the world , but it does n't mean it is right , " karpinski added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other top-ranking us officials are named in the lawsuit former white house counsel and current attorney general alberto gonzales , former director of the central intelligence agency george tenet , and other high-ranking us officials are also charged in the complaint . other groups involved in the suit include the us-based center for constitutional rights and the paris-based international federation for human rights . the abu ghraib scandal erupted in 2004 after photographs were leaked to the press showing us guards mistreating and sexually humiliating prisoners .

" we are unwilling to back off ... without a clear political signal from russia , " polish foreign minister anna fotyga told reporters after a meeting with her eu counterparts in brussels . fotyga did not indicate what poland would consider to be a clear political signal .
however she said she was " cautiously optimistic " of the chances of breaking the impasse . " russia uses energy as a political tool , it uses trade restrictions as a political tool , so there should be no surprise we are using the tools we have at our disposal , " she added . the 24 other eu member states are hoping to formulate an initial position on a new partnership and cooperation agreement with moscow ahead of a european union-russia summit on november 24 in helsinki . finnish foreign minister erkki tuomioja told a press conference after the talks that they have not ruled out an agreement before the eu-russia summit .

" i hope that between now and the eu-russia summit we can reach a common position , " said eu external affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner , while acknowledging the continued polish stance . the current eu-russia partnership accord runs out late next year but eu officials are playing down any talk of a deadline as the two sides agree that the existing deal will remain in place until a new agreement is reached . eu leaders had a chance for wide-ranging talks with russian president vladimir putin last month at an informal dinner in lahti , finland , when they appeared split over their attitude to moscow . although putin gave the leaders assurances that russia would continue to steadily and reliably pump oil and gas westward to eu consumers , he did not hesitate to take a swipe at georgia . even though eu-russia relations increasingly revolve around russia 's massive energy supplies , the europeans insist they will not shy away in talks with moscow from more prickly issues such as moscow 's hard-nosed approach to georgia . russia has cut off transport ties , deported hundreds of georgian citizens , and cracked down on georgian businesses in the worst dispute between the two since a 2003 revolution brought a pro-western leadership to power in georgia . russian ambassador ' not surprised ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin with european commission president jose manuel barroso russia 's ambassador to the european union said on monday that the european union should not be surprised that poland has become a stumbling block to a new eu-russia accord .

the question is : will hamas ever accept israel 's right to exist ? the prospect of hamas and fatah forming a new unity cabinet - with mohammad shbair unofficially named to succeed hamas member ismail haniya as palestinian prime minister - was welcome news to european foreign ministers at their monthly meeting in brussels .
" such a government , " they said in a joint statement released on monday , " would also be a partner for the international community to support the re-launching of the peace process . "
the eu 's commissioner for external relations , benita ferrero-waldner , said she believed a new palestinian leadership could break the current impasse in the middle east .
" those seeking a new government need our support and a calm environment , " commented ferrero-waldner .
" let 's hope they have a good government with which we can work . "
germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier also welcomed the prospect of change .
" the talks between fatah and hamas seem to indicate that a national unity government could be possible , " steinmeier said .
" that would get the process of negotiations moving . "
and the eu 's foreign policy coordinator javier solana added that he was " optimistic " there would soon be a new palestinian government .
the middle east peace process ground to a halt this march , when hamas , whose charter calls for the destruction of israel , won palestinian elections .
a new government of technocrats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shbair is currently a palestinian mp and the former head of the islamic university in gaza shbair - a us-educated biologist who is not a member of either hamas or fatah - has not been officially nominated , but spokespeople from both factions say he has a good chance of becoming the next palestinian prime minister .
shbair has said he would accept the job .
his prospective appointment is widely seen as a move to put together a new government of experts and technocrats and downplay ideological figures such as haniya .
hamas and fatah are currently negotiating over the make-up of a new cabinet .
if a new government is formed , its first task will be to tackle the disastrous state of the palestinian authority 's finances .
after hamas ' election victory in march , the eu and the us froze aid payments to the palestinian government , demanding that hamas recognize israel .
as a result , the palestinian authority has had difficulty paying the salaries of most of its 165,000 workers since april .
the boycott has devastated the palestinian economy .
hamas hardliners bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu and the us consider hamas a terrorist organization but the eu and us will not resume aid payments until palestinians have a government that accepts the existence of israel - something hamas has consistently refused to do .
" our position in this regard remains unchanged , " hamas spokesman fawzi barhoum stated on tuesday .
" we reject joining in any government that recognizes israel . "
some hamas officials say a new government 's platform might be kept vague enough to get around the conflict .
but israel and the us are likely to press for an endorsement of the two-state solution , agreed by the so-called quartet of the us , the eu , russia and the un as the basis for middle east peace negotiations .
officials from the quartet are scheduled to meet in cairo on wednesday to discuss the prospects of a new palestinian government . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de solana calls for return to mideast peace road map during a visit to the middle east , eu foreign policy chief javier solana expressed concern at the absence of peace talks between israel and the palestinians and said the european union was ready to offer its help .

the question is : will hamas ever accept israel 's right to exist ? the prospect of hamas and fatah forming a new unity cabinet - with mohammad shbair unofficially named to succeed hamas member ismail haniya as palestinian prime minister - was welcome news to european foreign ministers at their monthly meeting in brussels .
" such a government , " they said in a joint statement released on monday , " would also be a partner for the international community to support the re-launching of the peace process . "
the eu 's commissioner for external relations , benita ferrero-waldner , said she believed a new palestinian leadership could break the current impasse in the middle east .
" those seeking a new government need our support and a calm environment , " commented ferrero-waldner .
" let 's hope they have a good government with which we can work . "
germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier also welcomed the prospect of change .
" the talks between fatah and hamas seem to indicate that a national unity government could be possible , " steinmeier said .
" that would get the process of negotiations moving . "
and the eu 's foreign policy coordinator javier solana added that he was " optimistic " there would soon be a new palestinian government .
the middle east peace process ground to a halt this march , when hamas , whose charter calls for the destruction of israel , won palestinian elections .
a new government of technocrats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shbair is currently a palestinian mp and the former head of the islamic university in gaza shbair - a us-educated biologist who is not a member of either hamas or fatah - has not been officially nominated , but spokespeople from both factions say he has a good chance of becoming the next palestinian prime minister .
shbair has said he would accept the job .
his prospective appointment is widely seen as a move to put together a new government of experts and technocrats and downplay ideological figures such as haniya .
hamas and fatah are currently negotiating over the make-up of a new cabinet .
if a new government is formed , its first task will be to tackle the disastrous state of the palestinian authority 's finances .
after hamas ' election victory in march , the eu and the us froze aid payments to the palestinian government , demanding that hamas recognize israel .
as a result , the palestinian authority has had difficulty paying the salaries of most of its 165,000 workers since april .
the boycott has devastated the palestinian economy .
hamas hardliners bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu and the us consider hamas a terrorist organization but the eu and us will not resume aid payments until palestinians have a government that accepts the existence of israel - something hamas has consistently refused to do .
" our position in this regard remains unchanged , " hamas spokesman fawzi barhoum stated on tuesday .
" we reject joining in any government that recognizes israel . "
some hamas officials say a new government 's platform might be kept vague enough to get around the conflict .
but israel and the us are likely to press for an endorsement of the two-state solution , agreed by the so-called quartet of the us , the eu , russia and the un as the basis for middle east peace negotiations .
officials from the quartet are scheduled to meet in cairo on wednesday to discuss the prospects of a new palestinian government . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de solana calls for return to mideast peace road map during a visit to the middle east , eu foreign policy chief javier solana expressed concern at the absence of peace talks between israel and the palestinians and said the european union was ready to offer its help .
-lrb- 26.10.2006 -rrb- eu , us present united front ahead of vienna summit vienna is gearing up to host the next eu-us summit on wednesday .
while the relationship between the two powers is often described as " complex , " this time , it seems there is consensus on the main issues up for discussion .
-lrb- 20.06.2006 -rrb- eu says it will help palestinians the eu is trying to create a special aid fund for palestinians that would bypass the hamas-led palestinian government .

prosecutors accuse him of " representing the holocaust as a myth , " which is forbidden under german law .
he faces a second charge of disturbing the peace of the dead . rudolf called the holocaust " a gigantic fraud , " at the start of proceedings in mannheim . rudolf , who has a degree in chemistry , first attracted attention in the early 1990s , when he was called as an expert witness for the defense in the trial of a former german military general accused of denying the holocaust .
the report rudolf submitted to the court claimed that chemical tests carried out on material from the auschwitz concentration camp proved that there were no gas chambers there . rudolf was fired by his employer , the max planck institute , when that institution found out he had used his position to carry out the tests .
in 1996 , a court in the german city of tübingen found him guilty of public incitement for denying the holocaust and sentenced him to 14 months in jail . rudolf fled germany to escape that sentence , traveling first to spain , then england .
he eventually landed in the united states , where he unsuccessfully applied for political asylum . in november 2005 , he was deported to germany , where the authorities immediately arrested him . pseudonyms as sources bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the evidence for the holocuats is overwhelming , but denial remains a problem rudolf has been linked with the german far right , in particular with the republican party .
in 1998 , he submitted expert testimony on behalf of british holocaust denier david irving in the latter 's libel lawsuit against penguin books .
irving lost that suit . rudolf has published a number of works disputing the reality of the holocaust .
he has used half a dozen pseudonyms and had admitted to citing works published under his assumed names in order to create the impression that others support his theses .
he also gave an interview with an islamic radio station in which he disputes central facts concerning the holocaust . rudolf is the second prominent holocaust denier to face charges in mannheim this year .
this trial of the first , ernst zündel , got underway in june and is still going on . a verdict in rudolf 's case is not expected until 2007 . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts : banning german neo-nazi party is counterproductive leading german politicians have again called for a ban on germany 's national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , but neither this nor financial problems are likely to hurt the country 's far right , experts say .

while germany 's association of tax payers claims that the government wastes 30 billion euros annually -lrb- $ 38.5 billion -rrb- , engels said about 2.2 billion could be saved by adopting some changes .

industrial investment was also stronger , providing additional support for the traditionally export-led economy . low domestic consumption has been a chronic weak point in germany , and analysts said they expected consumption to peak between now and the end of the year as shoppers make major purchases before a 3 percent increase in value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- takes effect at the start of 2007 . investor confidence drops slightly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is it just temporary or are some serious clouds on the way ?

he also gave examples of tax waste . saying that it was far from certain that germany 's budding economic growth would continue , brh president dieter engels warned the government against using extra tax revenue for purposes other than debt reduction . " according to brh estimates , it 's not clear that tax revenues will develop favorably when compared to expectations , " engels said in berlin , adding that the government had also failed to consider potentially higher subsidies for pension funds and health insurances as well as a rise in interest rates in its tax calculations . " take financial planning more serious than you do right now , " engels told those in power , adding that the government also had to continue cutting expenditures to keep new debt at a bearable level . room for improvement like every year , engels also presented a list of potential measures to save taxes and increase revenues as his agency uncovered wasteful tax spending .
while germany 's association of tax payers claims that the government wastes 30 billion euros annually -lrb- $ 38.5 billion -rrb- , engels said about 2.2 billion could be saved by adopting some changes .
they include : * using private driving schools in the military rather than keeping the bundeswehr 's own program -lrb- savings of about 17 million euros . -rrb- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could burgers like this one help solve germany 's problems ? * introducing a flat sales tax in fast food restaurants .
currently , food consumed on the premises carries a 16 percent tax while take-away orders are taxed 7 percent .
according to brh officials , this has led some restaurants to register sit-down orders as take-away to increase their profit .
-lrb- estimated additional revenue of about 400 million euros . -rrb- * auditing those with an annual income of 500,000 euros or more on a regular basis , as required by law .
currently , only 15 percent are audited regularly despite the fact that each audit brings additional tax revenues of 135,000 euros on average , according to engels . economy keeps growing germany 's statisticians on tuesday meanwhile had some good news for germany 's leaders : the country is on track to deliver its best economic performance since the 2000 boom , when the german economy expanded by 3.1 percent . germany 's economy grew by 0.6 percent in the third quarter of 2006 from the previous three months , according to preliminary , seasonally corrected figures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christmas shopping and a looming sales tax increase are driving germans to the stores overall annual growth seems set to meet forecasts of more than 2 percent for the year owing to an upward revision of figures for the first two quarters . " the recovery of the german economy continues , " federal statistics officials said in a statement . exports continued to increase from the second quarter to the third to underpin growth , as did greater domestic demand , the office added .
industrial investment was also stronger , providing additional support for the traditionally export-led economy . low domestic consumption has been a chronic weak point in germany , and analysts said they expected consumption to peak between now and the end of the year as shoppers make major purchases before a 3 percent increase in value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- takes effect at the start of 2007 . investor confidence drops slightly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is it just temporary or are some serious clouds on the way ?
analysts also said that the economy was not only expanding but showing healthy progress that was investment-driven .
but german investor confidence fell for the 10th month in a row in november .
the drop , however , was not as steep as in previous months . the zew index , compiled by the mannheim-based center for european economic research and released tuesday , dipped 1.1 points to minus 28.5 after a 5.2 percent drop in october and a 22.2 percent decline in september . it was the lowest level since 1993 and the 10th consecutive fall in the index , which measures sentiment among investors and analysts six months down the track . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german government predicts robust growth germany 's clouds are lifting as the government heralds a spurt of economic growth and the largest fall in unemployment since reunification .

they 've lived in germany because the country tolerates them without offering them the prospect of obtaining full-fledged residence permits . at least once a year they have to see the authorities who may or may not decide to prolong their stay in germany .
the foreigners ' undefined status is coupled with many disadvantages on the labor market and problems in social integration . on tuesday , germany 's ruling christian and social democrats said they had reached a deal on new and clearer legislation .
it will make the granting of residence status dependent on the number of years someone has been in germany .

they 've lived in germany because the country tolerates them without offering them the prospect of obtaining full-fledged residence permits . at least once a year they have to see the authorities who may or may not decide to prolong their stay in germany .
the foreigners ' undefined status is coupled with many disadvantages on the labor market and problems in social integration . on tuesday , germany 's ruling christian and social democrats said they had reached a deal on new and clearer legislation .
it will make the granting of residence status dependent on the number of years someone has been in germany .
aside from any other requirements , individuals will be able to receive a two-year residence permit if they 've lived here for at least eight years , or six years if they have children . during those two years , they will have to prove that they can find gainful employment and support themselves .
should they fail to do so , they will lose their residence permit and fall back to tolerated status .
social democrats had pushed for giving people residence permits first before asking them to find employment . broader access to labor market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social democrats hope the new regulation will make job applications easier " we just have to face the realities , " said dieter wiefelspütz , the domestic policy spokesman for the social democrats .

" so it would be strange to grant residence status to someone who 's just not able to look after his family .
and it 's no solution for them to be working illegally .
they do n't pay any taxes , and should not be rewarded for this now .

so she acted on advice from a friend who said she should offer her instructor cash " tips " in exchange for driving tips . " after that i got my license right away , " merkel said of the early practice she received in under-the-table deal making that may have come in handy as she climbed the political ladder . though she is seldom willing to give ground politically , it seems that merkel is at least a considerate driver - she has n't gotten behind the wheel since taking office . chancellor has parking problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maybe a sport mini is more merkel 's speed ?

" from electric shocks to having one 's head submerged in water , -lrb- subjection to -rrb- hunger and thirst , or being shackled and suspended , " kurnaz said , listing the alleged abuses he faced while a detainee at camp x-ray in cuba . a burly man with long reddish hair and a thick beard stretching down to his belly , kurnaz spoke without emotion to cnn turk television from his home in bremen , northern germany . tales of torture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been numerous torture claims by guantanamo prisoners " they tell you ' you are from al-qaeda ' and when you say ' no ' they give the -lrb- electric -rrb- current to your feet .
as you keep saying ' no ' this goes on for two or three hours , " he said , adding he had several times lost consciousness , " kurnaz said . he claimed he was once shackled to a ceiling for " four or five days . " " they take you down in the mornings when a doctor comes to see whether you can endure more , " he said .
" they let you sit when the interrogator comes .
they take you down about three times a day so you do not die . " kurnaz also alleged prisoners were locked up in cells into which frigid or hot air was pumped . " i saw several people die , " he said .

they argue that rumsfeld 's resignation last week means prosecutors may be under less political pressure to shun the case . wolfgang kaleck , the german attorney who is leading the litigation , said the suit 's backers would appeal if prosecutors refuse to take up the case , and raised the prospect of further attempts in other european countries . dw staff / afp -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de guantanamo lawyers file lawsuit against rumsfeld in germany lawyers defending detainees at the us naval base in guantanamo bay , cuba , will file a law suit in germany on tuesday against outgoing us defense secretary donald rumsfeld for his alleged role in sanctioning torture .

" from electric shocks to having one 's head submerged in water , -lrb- subjection to -rrb- hunger and thirst , or being shackled and suspended , " kurnaz said , listing the alleged abuses he faced while a detainee at camp x-ray in cuba . a burly man with long reddish hair and a thick beard stretching down to his belly , kurnaz spoke without emotion to cnn turk television from his home in bremen , northern germany . tales of torture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been numerous torture claims by guantanamo prisoners " they tell you ' you are from al-qaeda ' and when you say ' no ' they give the -lrb- electric -rrb- current to your feet .
as you keep saying ' no ' this goes on for two or three hours , " he said , adding he had several times lost consciousness , " kurnaz said . he claimed he was once shackled to a ceiling for " four or five days . " " they take you down in the mornings when a doctor comes to see whether you can endure more , " he said .
" they let you sit when the interrogator comes .
they take you down about three times a day so you do not die . " kurnaz also alleged prisoners were locked up in cells into which frigid or hot air was pumped . " i saw several people die , " he said .
" sometimes i thought i could no longer stand it and would also die . " he claimed he was once left without food for 20 days and spoke of psychological abuse , including " religious insults " such as the koran being kicked on the ground . arrested , but still no proof of terrorist links a turkish citizen with permanent residency in germany , kurnaz was arrested in pakistan after the september 11 , 2001 attacks and turned over to us forces , who took him to a prison in the afghan city of kandahar before transferring him to guantanamo in 2002 . he says he went to pakistan to visit holy places and take religious courses .

they argue that rumsfeld 's resignation last week means prosecutors may be under less political pressure to shun the case . wolfgang kaleck , the german attorney who is leading the litigation , said the suit 's backers would appeal if prosecutors refuse to take up the case , and raised the prospect of further attempts in other european countries . dw staff / afp -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de guantanamo lawyers file lawsuit against rumsfeld in germany lawyers defending detainees at the us naval base in guantanamo bay , cuba , will file a law suit in germany on tuesday against outgoing us defense secretary donald rumsfeld for his alleged role in sanctioning torture .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 14.11.2006 compromise reached on " tolerated " foreigners in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of those affected by the compromise fled kosovo in 1999 the german government on tuesday reached a compromise on how to deal with some 200,000 foreigners whose applications for asylum have been turned down , but who are not deported for humanitarian reasons . most of the 200,000 people in question come from afghanistan , iraq and kosovo .
they 've lived in germany because the country tolerates them without offering them the prospect of obtaining full-fledged residence permits . at least once a year they have to see the authorities who may or may not decide to prolong their stay in germany .
the foreigners ' undefined status is coupled with many disadvantages on the labor market and problems in social integration . on tuesday , germany 's ruling christian and social democrats said they had reached a deal on new and clearer legislation .
it will make the granting of residence status dependent on the number of years someone has been in germany .
aside from any other requirements , individuals will be able to receive a two-year residence permit if they 've lived here for at least eight years , or six years if they have children . during those two years , they will have to prove that they can find gainful employment and support themselves .
should they fail to do so , they will lose their residence permit and fall back to tolerated status .
social democrats had pushed for giving people residence permits first before asking them to find employment . broader access to labor market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social democrats hope the new regulation will make job applications easier " we just have to face the realities , " said dieter wiefelspütz , the domestic policy spokesman for the social democrats .
" the people we 're talking about are confronted with enormous difficulties in finding employment .
after all , it 's the state itself which has set up all sorts of hurdles .
so let 's look to the future and help them to broaden their access to the labor market instead of telling them that a job is a prerequisite for staying here . " christian democrats on the other hand had called for granting permits only once people have found work . strain on welfare system ? bavarian interior minister günther beckstein of the christian social union , the sister party of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union , has insisted that permanent residence status must only be granted to those who can support their families without having to fall back on state welfare money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservatives want to prevent additional cases of welfare recipients " we just wo n't accept tens of thousands of people more to strain the country 's already overburdened social systems , " he said on german public television .
" so it would be strange to grant residence status to someone who 's just not able to look after his family .
and it 's no solution for them to be working illegally .
they do n't pay any taxes , and should not be rewarded for this now .
it would be like saying that it 's okay to give somebody a driving license just because he 's been driving a car illegally for many years . " protecting children members of germany 's main opposition party , the free-market , liberal free democrats , meanwhile said they were most interested in finding a humane solution for affected school-age children who were born in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deporting children to a country that 's strange to them is inhumane , leutheusser-schnarrenberger says " these kids do n't know the countries of their parents ' origin at all , " said sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , a former federal justice minister .
" all they know is germany , here is where they live .
do you want to send them to , say , afghanistan or iraq ?
that would be ridiculous .
after all , we 're talking about human beings with real biographies , and not just about figures and quota . " the interior ministers of germany 's 16 states are expected to fine-tune the agreement at a meeting on thursday and friday . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin 's naturalization campaign defies dismal citizenship trend despite recent integration initiatives in germany , naturalization , considered the most effective way to become part of society , is proving unpopular .

" we are unwilling to back off ... without a clear political signal from russia , " polish foreign minister anna fotyga told reporters after a meeting with her eu counterparts in brussels . fotyga did not indicate what poland would consider to be a clear political signal .
however she said she was " cautiously optimistic " of the chances of breaking the impasse . " russia uses energy as a political tool , it uses trade restrictions as a political tool , so there should be no surprise we are using the tools we have at our disposal , " she added . the 24 other eu member states are hoping to formulate an initial position on a new partnership and cooperation agreement with moscow ahead of a european union-russia summit on november 24 in helsinki . finnish foreign minister erkki tuomioja told a press conference after the talks that they have not ruled out an agreement before the eu-russia summit .

" we can not guarantee the safety of these deliveries because we regularly detect violations in the import of various meat and other foodstuffs , " from poland , the spokesman was quoted as saying by russia 's interfax news agency . france and germany , among others , argued at an eu summit in finland last month that the tactics be changed , and that the bloc attempt to include as many of the energy charter 's main points as possible in the new partnership accord , even if russia has only signed and not ratified the document . these could include reliable access to russian energy supplies and pipelines , security of investments and transparency within the massive russian energy market . " i hope that between now and the eu-russia summit we can reach a common position , " said eu external affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner , while acknowledging the continued polish stance . the current eu-russia partnership accord runs out late next year but eu officials are playing down any talk of a deadline as the two sides agree that the existing deal will remain in place until a new agreement is reached . eu leaders had a chance for wide-ranging talks with russian president vladimir putin last month at an informal dinner in lahti , finland , when they appeared split over their attitude to moscow . although putin gave the leaders assurances that russia would continue to steadily and reliably pump oil and gas westward to eu consumers , he did not hesitate to take a swipe at georgia . even though eu-russia relations increasingly revolve around russia 's massive energy supplies , the europeans insist they will not shy away in talks with moscow from more prickly issues such as moscow 's hard-nosed approach to georgia . russia has cut off transport ties , deported hundreds of georgian citizens , and cracked down on georgian businesses in the worst dispute between the two since a 2003 revolution brought a pro-western leadership to power in georgia . russian ambassador ' not surprised ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin with european commission president jose manuel barroso russia 's ambassador to the european union said on monday that the european union should not be surprised that poland has become a stumbling block to a new eu-russia accord .

" i think it 's a done deal , " said german social democrat evelyne gebhardt , the text 's rapporteur , on friday although the plans , which affect a sector generating at least half the eu 's economic activity and 60 percent of its jobs , are expected to sail smoothly through the parliament , in its earlier forms they proved to be deeply controversial . known in previous versions as the bolkestein directive after the former internal market commissioner frits bolkestein of the netherlands , the original plans proposed that companies offering services in the eu be allowed to operate under the laws and regulations of their country of origin . fears of social dumping but many western european countries and trade unions feared that companies from countries with fewer taxes and regulations , in particular in eastern europe , would be able to operate in higher-cost economies without paying their employees the local rate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : countries with fewer taxes and rules were sees as a threat critics warned the directive would lead to " social dumping " - companies and jobs relocating to eastern europe or using low-cost labor in jobs like construction throughout the rest of the european union . anti-globalization and left-wing demonstrators took to the streets in france , germany and greece to oppose the reform and opponents of the eu 's draft constitution cast it as a threat to workers ' jobs in france ahead of the country 's rejection of the charter in a referendum in may 2005 . the european parliament in february threw out the original draft and approved their own watered-down version with the offending country-of-origin principle axed . they also reduced the scope to cover mainly commercial activities and not services such as healthcare and security , which are deemed to benefit the public good . new text nothing like bolkenstein directive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evelyne gebhardt in april the european commission - the eu 's executive arm - produced a draft that largely echoed the parliament 's version , and served as the basis for an agreement between member states in may . " the work over these last few years was worth it , " said gebhardt .
" the text now has nothing in common with the bolkestein directive , " she added . eager not to upset the delicate compromise due to go before the parliament on wednesday , the three biggest political groups in the parliament have not proposed amendments to it , significantly raising the odds that it will be easily passed . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debating the damage of high labor costs for german business a study by the cologne institute for economic research says that german workers are the third-most expensive worldwide .

the question is : will hamas ever accept israel 's right to exist ? the prospect of hamas and fatah forming a new unity cabinet - with mohammad shbair unofficially named to succeed hamas member ismail haniya as palestinian prime minister - was welcome news to european foreign ministers at their monthly meeting in brussels .
" such a government , " they said in a joint statement released on monday , " would also be a partner for the international community to support the re-launching of the peace process . "
the eu 's commissioner for external relations , benita ferrero-waldner , said she believed a new palestinian leadership could break the current impasse in the middle east .
" those seeking a new government need our support and a calm environment , " commented ferrero-waldner .
" let 's hope they have a good government with which we can work . "
germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier also welcomed the prospect of change .
" the talks between fatah and hamas seem to indicate that a national unity government could be possible , " steinmeier said .
" that would get the process of negotiations moving . "
and the eu 's foreign policy coordinator javier solana added that he was " optimistic " there would soon be a new palestinian government .
the middle east peace process ground to a halt this march , when hamas , whose charter calls for the destruction of israel , won palestinian elections .
a new government of technocrats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shbair is currently a palestinian mp and the former head of the islamic university in gaza shbair - a us-educated biologist who is not a member of either hamas or fatah - has not been officially nominated , but spokespeople from both factions say he has a good chance of becoming the next palestinian prime minister .
shbair has said he would accept the job .
his prospective appointment is widely seen as a move to put together a new government of experts and technocrats and downplay ideological figures such as haniya .
hamas and fatah are currently negotiating over the make-up of a new cabinet .
if a new government is formed , its first task will be to tackle the disastrous state of the palestinian authority 's finances .
after hamas ' election victory in march , the eu and the us froze aid payments to the palestinian government , demanding that hamas recognize israel .
as a result , the palestinian authority has had difficulty paying the salaries of most of its 165,000 workers since april .
the boycott has devastated the palestinian economy .
hamas hardliners bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu and the us consider hamas a terrorist organization but the eu and us will not resume aid payments until palestinians have a government that accepts the existence of israel - something hamas has consistently refused to do .
" our position in this regard remains unchanged , " hamas spokesman fawzi barhoum stated on tuesday .
" we reject joining in any government that recognizes israel . "
some hamas officials say a new government 's platform might be kept vague enough to get around the conflict .
but israel and the us are likely to press for an endorsement of the two-state solution , agreed by the so-called quartet of the us , the eu , russia and the un as the basis for middle east peace negotiations .

he also gave examples of tax waste . saying that it was far from certain that germany 's budding economic growth would continue , brh president dieter engels warned the government against using extra tax revenue for purposes other than debt reduction . " according to brh estimates , it 's not clear that tax revenues will develop favorably when compared to expectations , " engels said in berlin , adding that the government had also failed to consider potentially higher subsidies for pension funds and health insurances as well as a rise in interest rates in its tax calculations . " take financial planning more serious than you do right now , " engels told those in power , adding that the government also had to continue cutting expenditures to keep new debt at a bearable level . room for improvement like every year , engels also presented a list of potential measures to save taxes and increase revenues as his agency uncovered wasteful tax spending .
while germany 's association of tax payers claims that the government wastes 30 billion euros annually -lrb- $ 38.5 billion -rrb- , engels said about 2.2 billion could be saved by adopting some changes .
they include : * using private driving schools in the military rather than keeping the bundeswehr 's own program -lrb- savings of about 17 million euros . -rrb- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could burgers like this one help solve germany 's problems ? * introducing a flat sales tax in fast food restaurants .
currently , food consumed on the premises carries a 16 percent tax while take-away orders are taxed 7 percent .
according to brh officials , this has led some restaurants to register sit-down orders as take-away to increase their profit .
-lrb- estimated additional revenue of about 400 million euros . -rrb- * auditing those with an annual income of 500,000 euros or more on a regular basis , as required by law .
currently , only 15 percent are audited regularly despite the fact that each audit brings additional tax revenues of 135,000 euros on average , according to engels . economy keeps growing germany 's statisticians on tuesday meanwhile had some good news for germany 's leaders : the country is on track to deliver its best economic performance since the 2000 boom , when the german economy expanded by 3.1 percent . germany 's economy grew by 0.6 percent in the third quarter of 2006 from the previous three months , according to preliminary , seasonally corrected figures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christmas shopping and a looming sales tax increase are driving germans to the stores overall annual growth seems set to meet forecasts of more than 2 percent for the year owing to an upward revision of figures for the first two quarters . " the recovery of the german economy continues , " federal statistics officials said in a statement . exports continued to increase from the second quarter to the third to underpin growth , as did greater domestic demand , the office added .
industrial investment was also stronger , providing additional support for the traditionally export-led economy . low domestic consumption has been a chronic weak point in germany , and analysts said they expected consumption to peak between now and the end of the year as shoppers make major purchases before a 3 percent increase in value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- takes effect at the start of 2007 . investor confidence drops slightly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is it just temporary or are some serious clouds on the way ?
analysts also said that the economy was not only expanding but showing healthy progress that was investment-driven .

he also gave examples of tax waste . saying that it was far from certain that germany 's budding economic growth would continue , brh president dieter engels warned the government against using extra tax revenue for purposes other than debt reduction . " according to brh estimates , it 's not clear that tax revenues will develop favorably when compared to expectations , " engels said in berlin , adding that the government had also failed to consider potentially higher subsidies for pension funds and health insurances as well as a rise in interest rates in its tax calculations . " take financial planning more serious than you do right now , " engels told those in power , adding that the government also had to continue cutting expenditures to keep new debt at a bearable level . room for improvement like every year , engels also presented a list of potential measures to save taxes and increase revenues as his agency uncovered wasteful tax spending .
while germany 's association of tax payers claims that the government wastes 30 billion euros annually -lrb- $ 38.5 billion -rrb- , engels said about 2.2 billion could be saved by adopting some changes .

industrial investment was also stronger , providing additional support for the traditionally export-led economy . low domestic consumption has been a chronic weak point in germany , and analysts said they expected consumption to peak between now and the end of the year as shoppers make major purchases before a 3 percent increase in value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- takes effect at the start of 2007 . investor confidence drops slightly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is it just temporary or are some serious clouds on the way ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 14.11.2006 eu cautiously optimistic on possible new palestinian government großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the palestinian authority has been under an eu aid embargo since march eu foreign policy leaders expressed hope that a new palestinian government could help revive middle east peace negotiations .
the question is : will hamas ever accept israel 's right to exist ? the prospect of hamas and fatah forming a new unity cabinet - with mohammad shbair unofficially named to succeed hamas member ismail haniya as palestinian prime minister - was welcome news to european foreign ministers at their monthly meeting in brussels .
" such a government , " they said in a joint statement released on monday , " would also be a partner for the international community to support the re-launching of the peace process . "
the eu 's commissioner for external relations , benita ferrero-waldner , said she believed a new palestinian leadership could break the current impasse in the middle east .
" those seeking a new government need our support and a calm environment , " commented ferrero-waldner .
" let 's hope they have a good government with which we can work . "
germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier also welcomed the prospect of change .
" the talks between fatah and hamas seem to indicate that a national unity government could be possible , " steinmeier said .
" that would get the process of negotiations moving . "
and the eu 's foreign policy coordinator javier solana added that he was " optimistic " there would soon be a new palestinian government .
the middle east peace process ground to a halt this march , when hamas , whose charter calls for the destruction of israel , won palestinian elections .
a new government of technocrats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shbair is currently a palestinian mp and the former head of the islamic university in gaza shbair - a us-educated biologist who is not a member of either hamas or fatah - has not been officially nominated , but spokespeople from both factions say he has a good chance of becoming the next palestinian prime minister .
shbair has said he would accept the job .
his prospective appointment is widely seen as a move to put together a new government of experts and technocrats and downplay ideological figures such as haniya .
hamas and fatah are currently negotiating over the make-up of a new cabinet .
if a new government is formed , its first task will be to tackle the disastrous state of the palestinian authority 's finances .
after hamas ' election victory in march , the eu and the us froze aid payments to the palestinian government , demanding that hamas recognize israel .
as a result , the palestinian authority has had difficulty paying the salaries of most of its 165,000 workers since april .
the boycott has devastated the palestinian economy .
hamas hardliners bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu and the us consider hamas a terrorist organization but the eu and us will not resume aid payments until palestinians have a government that accepts the existence of israel - something hamas has consistently refused to do .
" our position in this regard remains unchanged , " hamas spokesman fawzi barhoum stated on tuesday .
" we reject joining in any government that recognizes israel . "
some hamas officials say a new government 's platform might be kept vague enough to get around the conflict .
but israel and the us are likely to press for an endorsement of the two-state solution , agreed by the so-called quartet of the us , the eu , russia and the un as the basis for middle east peace negotiations .
officials from the quartet are scheduled to meet in cairo on wednesday to discuss the prospects of a new palestinian government . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de solana calls for return to mideast peace road map during a visit to the middle east , eu foreign policy chief javier solana expressed concern at the absence of peace talks between israel and the palestinians and said the european union was ready to offer its help .
-lrb- 26.10.2006 -rrb- eu , us present united front ahead of vienna summit vienna is gearing up to host the next eu-us summit on wednesday .
while the relationship between the two powers is often described as " complex , " this time , it seems there is consensus on the main issues up for discussion .

the question is : will hamas ever accept israel 's right to exist ? the prospect of hamas and fatah forming a new unity cabinet - with mohammad shbair unofficially named to succeed hamas member ismail haniya as palestinian prime minister - was welcome news to european foreign ministers at their monthly meeting in brussels .
" such a government , " they said in a joint statement released on monday , " would also be a partner for the international community to support the re-launching of the peace process . "
the eu 's commissioner for external relations , benita ferrero-waldner , said she believed a new palestinian leadership could break the current impasse in the middle east .
" those seeking a new government need our support and a calm environment , " commented ferrero-waldner .
" let 's hope they have a good government with which we can work . "
germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier also welcomed the prospect of change .
" the talks between fatah and hamas seem to indicate that a national unity government could be possible , " steinmeier said .
" that would get the process of negotiations moving . "
and the eu 's foreign policy coordinator javier solana added that he was " optimistic " there would soon be a new palestinian government .
the middle east peace process ground to a halt this march , when hamas , whose charter calls for the destruction of israel , won palestinian elections .
a new government of technocrats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shbair is currently a palestinian mp and the former head of the islamic university in gaza shbair - a us-educated biologist who is not a member of either hamas or fatah - has not been officially nominated , but spokespeople from both factions say he has a good chance of becoming the next palestinian prime minister .
shbair has said he would accept the job .
his prospective appointment is widely seen as a move to put together a new government of experts and technocrats and downplay ideological figures such as haniya .
hamas and fatah are currently negotiating over the make-up of a new cabinet .
if a new government is formed , its first task will be to tackle the disastrous state of the palestinian authority 's finances .
after hamas ' election victory in march , the eu and the us froze aid payments to the palestinian government , demanding that hamas recognize israel .
as a result , the palestinian authority has had difficulty paying the salaries of most of its 165,000 workers since april .
the boycott has devastated the palestinian economy .
hamas hardliners bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu and the us consider hamas a terrorist organization but the eu and us will not resume aid payments until palestinians have a government that accepts the existence of israel - something hamas has consistently refused to do .
" our position in this regard remains unchanged , " hamas spokesman fawzi barhoum stated on tuesday .
" we reject joining in any government that recognizes israel . "
some hamas officials say a new government 's platform might be kept vague enough to get around the conflict .
but israel and the us are likely to press for an endorsement of the two-state solution , agreed by the so-called quartet of the us , the eu , russia and the un as the basis for middle east peace negotiations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.11.2006 german court tries man for denying the holocaust großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rudolf 's lawyers are well known for repesenting far-right causes chemist germar rudolf is one of the most often cited holocaust deniers of the past decade , and now he 'll have to answer for his contention that there were no auschwitz gas chambers . the 42-year-old rudolf was arraigned at a regional court in mannheim on monday .
prosecutors accuse him of " representing the holocaust as a myth , " which is forbidden under german law .
he faces a second charge of disturbing the peace of the dead . rudolf called the holocaust " a gigantic fraud , " at the start of proceedings in mannheim . rudolf , who has a degree in chemistry , first attracted attention in the early 1990s , when he was called as an expert witness for the defense in the trial of a former german military general accused of denying the holocaust .
the report rudolf submitted to the court claimed that chemical tests carried out on material from the auschwitz concentration camp proved that there were no gas chambers there . rudolf was fired by his employer , the max planck institute , when that institution found out he had used his position to carry out the tests .
in 1996 , a court in the german city of tübingen found him guilty of public incitement for denying the holocaust and sentenced him to 14 months in jail . rudolf fled germany to escape that sentence , traveling first to spain , then england .
he eventually landed in the united states , where he unsuccessfully applied for political asylum . in november 2005 , he was deported to germany , where the authorities immediately arrested him . pseudonyms as sources bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the evidence for the holocuats is overwhelming , but denial remains a problem rudolf has been linked with the german far right , in particular with the republican party .
in 1998 , he submitted expert testimony on behalf of british holocaust denier david irving in the latter 's libel lawsuit against penguin books .
irving lost that suit . rudolf has published a number of works disputing the reality of the holocaust .
he has used half a dozen pseudonyms and had admitted to citing works published under his assumed names in order to create the impression that others support his theses .
he also gave an interview with an islamic radio station in which he disputes central facts concerning the holocaust . rudolf is the second prominent holocaust denier to face charges in mannheim this year .
this trial of the first , ernst zündel , got underway in june and is still going on . a verdict in rudolf 's case is not expected until 2007 . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts : banning german neo-nazi party is counterproductive leading german politicians have again called for a ban on germany 's national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , but neither this nor financial problems are likely to hurt the country 's far right , experts say .

das kapital , volume i " , hildegard haug and daniel wetzel from rimini protokoll talked to 100 people about their experiences and concepts of capitalism , and chose eight for the stage . the pieces are portrayed by so-called " everyday experts " - ordinary people who relate their story on stage .
one of these is thomas kuczynski , who used to be an economic historian in former east germany .
he recounts how time is money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the piece explores the themes of capitalism " the german version of das kapital has 25 chapters , or 750 pages of text , or 1,957 200 characters including spaces .
we have 100 minutes of time , that means four minutes pro chapter , or we read seven and a half pages per minute or 544 characters a second .

but now there 's a logical explanation . there 's no way around it .
merkel is , in her own words , " a bad driver . " she took so long to get her driving license back when she was a 26-year-old student that she had to resort to bribing her instructor to speed up the process . speaking to a celebrity audience at the golden steering wheel awards last week , merkel said that after 38 lessons she still was n't any closer to taking her test .
so she acted on advice from a friend who said she should offer her instructor cash " tips " in exchange for driving tips . " after that i got my license right away , " merkel said of the early practice she received in under-the-table deal making that may have come in handy as she climbed the political ladder . though she is seldom willing to give ground politically , it seems that merkel is at least a considerate driver - she has n't gotten behind the wheel since taking office . chancellor has parking problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maybe a sport mini is more merkel 's speed ?
the chancellor , currently the most powerful woman in the world , also admitted to needing a diminutive car because she ca n't park . currently the happy owner of an audi , she said if she had a lot of money , she 'd buy a mini .
" it 's practical , small and pleasant to look at and yet has a certain rakish style , " merkel said of the car . experts can not agree if this was wise comment in a country where size really does matter - the bigger -lrb- and faster -rrb- the car , the better . merkel , however , is certainly differentiating herself from her predecessor gerhard schröder .

they 've lived in germany because the country tolerates them without offering them the prospect of obtaining full-fledged residence permits . at least once a year they have to see the authorities who may or may not decide to prolong their stay in germany .
the foreigners ' undefined status is coupled with many disadvantages on the labor market and problems in social integration . on tuesday , germany 's ruling christian and social democrats said they had reached a deal on new and clearer legislation .
it will make the granting of residence status dependent on the number of years someone has been in germany .
aside from any other requirements , individuals will be able to receive a two-year residence permit if they 've lived here for at least eight years , or six years if they have children . during those two years , they will have to prove that they can find gainful employment and support themselves .
should they fail to do so , they will lose their residence permit and fall back to tolerated status .
social democrats had pushed for giving people residence permits first before asking them to find employment . broader access to labor market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social democrats hope the new regulation will make job applications easier " we just have to face the realities , " said dieter wiefelspütz , the domestic policy spokesman for the social democrats .
" the people we 're talking about are confronted with enormous difficulties in finding employment .
after all , it 's the state itself which has set up all sorts of hurdles .
so let 's look to the future and help them to broaden their access to the labor market instead of telling them that a job is a prerequisite for staying here . " christian democrats on the other hand had called for granting permits only once people have found work . strain on welfare system ? bavarian interior minister günther beckstein of the christian social union , the sister party of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union , has insisted that permanent residence status must only be granted to those who can support their families without having to fall back on state welfare money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservatives want to prevent additional cases of welfare recipients " we just wo n't accept tens of thousands of people more to strain the country 's already overburdened social systems , " he said on german public television .
" so it would be strange to grant residence status to someone who 's just not able to look after his family .
and it 's no solution for them to be working illegally .
they do n't pay any taxes , and should not be rewarded for this now .
it would be like saying that it 's okay to give somebody a driving license just because he 's been driving a car illegally for many years . " protecting children members of germany 's main opposition party , the free-market , liberal free democrats , meanwhile said they were most interested in finding a humane solution for affected school-age children who were born in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deporting children to a country that 's strange to them is inhumane , leutheusser-schnarrenberger says " these kids do n't know the countries of their parents ' origin at all , " said sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , a former federal justice minister .
" all they know is germany , here is where they live .
do you want to send them to , say , afghanistan or iraq ?
that would be ridiculous .
after all , we 're talking about human beings with real biographies , and not just about figures and quota .

" we failed two years ago because there was an ongoing investigation in the united states , but it is now clear that there is no chance of prosecuting high-ranking officials in the us , " kaleck told a press conference in berlin called to present the complaint . " we are not expecting that rumsfeld will appear in a court , but we are hoping investigators will begin looking into the case , " he said .
" if we fail here , we will try in france , or in spain .
we want to show that there will be no safe haven anywhere in the world for him . " the lawyer for the guantanamo detainee , mohammed al-qahtani , claims rumsfeld approved special " tactics " when he failed to break under interrogation .
the measures included sleep deprivation and a ban on praying , lawyer gitanjali gutierrez said . " this is not just allegations , it is supported by government documentation , " she added . the complaint asks harms to open an investigation and , ultimately , a criminal prosecution that will look into the responsibility of high-ranking us officials for allegedly authorizing war crimes in the context of the war on terror , according to the lawyers . rumsfeld resigned last week after republicans lost control of the us congress to the opposition democrats in mid-term elections seen as a referendum on the war in iraq . former abu ghraib commander as defense witness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : janis karpinski at the berlin press conference the groups have former us army brigadier general janis karpinski , who commanded 17 us-run jails in iraq including abu ghraib , as a witness on their behalf . " what i see as my obligation is to provide the truth about what i saw and what i experienced in iraq , " karpinski said at a press conference .
" when i was getting too close to what was happening they took me out of the equation - they removed abu ghraib from my control . " hopefully my testimony will stop this sort of thing ever happening again .
i feel we have an obligation to the rest of the world because if the us does something it gives permission to the rest of the world , but it does n't mean it is right , " karpinski added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other top-ranking us officials are named in the lawsuit former white house counsel and current attorney general alberto gonzales , former director of the central intelligence agency george tenet , and other high-ranking us officials are also charged in the complaint . other groups involved in the suit include the us-based center for constitutional rights and the paris-based international federation for human rights . the abu ghraib scandal erupted in 2004 after photographs were leaked to the press showing us guards mistreating and sexually humiliating prisoners .

" what i see as my obligation is to provide the truth about what i saw and what i experienced in iraq , " karpinski said at a press conference .
" when i was getting too close to what was happening they took me out of the equation - they removed abu ghraib from my control . " hopefully my testimony will stop this sort of thing ever happening again .
i feel we have an obligation to the rest of the world because if the us does something it gives permission to the rest of the world , but it does n't mean it is right , " karpinski added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other top-ranking us officials are named in the lawsuit former white house counsel and current attorney general alberto gonzales , former director of the central intelligence agency george tenet , and other high-ranking us officials are also charged in the complaint . other groups involved in the suit include the us-based center for constitutional rights and the paris-based international federation for human rights . the abu ghraib scandal erupted in 2004 after photographs were leaked to the press showing us guards mistreating and sexually humiliating prisoners .

" we are unwilling to back off ... without a clear political signal from russia , " polish foreign minister anna fotyga told reporters after a meeting with her eu counterparts in brussels . fotyga did not indicate what poland would consider to be a clear political signal .
however she said she was " cautiously optimistic " of the chances of breaking the impasse . " russia uses energy as a political tool , it uses trade restrictions as a political tool , so there should be no surprise we are using the tools we have at our disposal , " she added . the 24 other eu member states are hoping to formulate an initial position on a new partnership and cooperation agreement with moscow ahead of a european union-russia summit on november 24 in helsinki . finnish foreign minister erkki tuomioja told a press conference after the talks that they have not ruled out an agreement before the eu-russia summit . " i would expect that we can finalize the mandate and have it adopted by the council -lrb- eu summit in mid-december -rrb- , " he said . embargo to stay until poland fixes food bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has insisted poland improve meat standards russia will not lift its embargo on certain polish foodstuffs until veterinary services put an end to continued " violations " a russian food security official said in moscow . " we can not guarantee the safety of these deliveries because we regularly detect violations in the import of various meat and other foodstuffs , " from poland , the spokesman was quoted as saying by russia 's interfax news agency . france and germany , among others , argued at an eu summit in finland last month that the tactics be changed , and that the bloc attempt to include as many of the energy charter 's main points as possible in the new partnership accord , even if russia has only signed and not ratified the document . these could include reliable access to russian energy supplies and pipelines , security of investments and transparency within the massive russian energy market . " i hope that between now and the eu-russia summit we can reach a common position , " said eu external affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner , while acknowledging the continued polish stance . the current eu-russia partnership accord runs out late next year but eu officials are playing down any talk of a deadline as the two sides agree that the existing deal will remain in place until a new agreement is reached . eu leaders had a chance for wide-ranging talks with russian president vladimir putin last month at an informal dinner in lahti , finland , when they appeared split over their attitude to moscow . although putin gave the leaders assurances that russia would continue to steadily and reliably pump oil and gas westward to eu consumers , he did not hesitate to take a swipe at georgia . even though eu-russia relations increasingly revolve around russia 's massive energy supplies , the europeans insist they will not shy away in talks with moscow from more prickly issues such as moscow 's hard-nosed approach to georgia . russia has cut off transport ties , deported hundreds of georgian citizens , and cracked down on georgian businesses in the worst dispute between the two since a 2003 revolution brought a pro-western leadership to power in georgia . russian ambassador ' not surprised ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin with european commission president jose manuel barroso russia 's ambassador to the european union said on monday that the european union should not be surprised that poland has become a stumbling block to a new eu-russia accord . " there is truly a need for consensus here , and it has been blocked by poland .
but i ca n't say that it came as a surprise , " vladimir chizhov said in comments on the rossiya television station . " we warned our partners in the eu about the difficulties the eu expansion of two years ago might bring , " he said .

they 've lived in germany because the country tolerates them without offering them the prospect of obtaining full-fledged residence permits . at least once a year they have to see the authorities who may or may not decide to prolong their stay in germany .
the foreigners ' undefined status is coupled with many disadvantages on the labor market and problems in social integration . on tuesday , germany 's ruling christian and social democrats said they had reached a deal on new and clearer legislation .
it will make the granting of residence status dependent on the number of years someone has been in germany .
aside from any other requirements , individuals will be able to receive a two-year residence permit if they 've lived here for at least eight years , or six years if they have children . during those two years , they will have to prove that they can find gainful employment and support themselves .

" the people we 're talking about are confronted with enormous difficulties in finding employment .
after all , it 's the state itself which has set up all sorts of hurdles .

" so it would be strange to grant residence status to someone who 's just not able to look after his family .
and it 's no solution for them to be working illegally .
they do n't pay any taxes , and should not be rewarded for this now .
it would be like saying that it 's okay to give somebody a driving license just because he 's been driving a car illegally for many years .

they 've lived in germany because the country tolerates them without offering them the prospect of obtaining full-fledged residence permits . at least once a year they have to see the authorities who may or may not decide to prolong their stay in germany .
the foreigners ' undefined status is coupled with many disadvantages on the labor market and problems in social integration . on tuesday , germany 's ruling christian and social democrats said they had reached a deal on new and clearer legislation .
it will make the granting of residence status dependent on the number of years someone has been in germany .
aside from any other requirements , individuals will be able to receive a two-year residence permit if they 've lived here for at least eight years , or six years if they have children . during those two years , they will have to prove that they can find gainful employment and support themselves .

" so it would be strange to grant residence status to someone who 's just not able to look after his family .
and it 's no solution for them to be working illegally .

das kapital , volume i " , hildegard haug and daniel wetzel from rimini protokoll talked to 100 people about their experiences and concepts of capitalism , and chose eight for the stage . the pieces are portrayed by so-called " everyday experts " - ordinary people who relate their story on stage .
one of these is thomas kuczynski , who used to be an economic historian in former east germany .
he recounts how time is money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the piece explores the themes of capitalism " the german version of das kapital has 25 chapters , or 750 pages of text , or 1,957 200 characters including spaces .

" we are unwilling to back off ... without a clear political signal from russia , " polish foreign minister anna fotyga told reporters after a meeting with her eu counterparts in brussels . fotyga did not indicate what poland would consider to be a clear political signal .
however she said she was " cautiously optimistic " of the chances of breaking the impasse . " russia uses energy as a political tool , it uses trade restrictions as a political tool , so there should be no surprise we are using the tools we have at our disposal , " she added . the 24 other eu member states are hoping to formulate an initial position on a new partnership and cooperation agreement with moscow ahead of a european union-russia summit on november 24 in helsinki . finnish foreign minister erkki tuomioja told a press conference after the talks that they have not ruled out an agreement before the eu-russia summit . " i would expect that we can finalize the mandate and have it adopted by the council -lrb- eu summit in mid-december -rrb- , " he said . embargo to stay until poland fixes food bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has insisted poland improve meat standards russia will not lift its embargo on certain polish foodstuffs until veterinary services put an end to continued " violations " a russian food security official said in moscow . " we can not guarantee the safety of these deliveries because we regularly detect violations in the import of various meat and other foodstuffs , " from poland , the spokesman was quoted as saying by russia 's interfax news agency . france and germany , among others , argued at an eu summit in finland last month that the tactics be changed , and that the bloc attempt to include as many of the energy charter 's main points as possible in the new partnership accord , even if russia has only signed and not ratified the document . these could include reliable access to russian energy supplies and pipelines , security of investments and transparency within the massive russian energy market . " i hope that between now and the eu-russia summit we can reach a common position , " said eu external affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner , while acknowledging the continued polish stance . the current eu-russia partnership accord runs out late next year but eu officials are playing down any talk of a deadline as the two sides agree that the existing deal will remain in place until a new agreement is reached . eu leaders had a chance for wide-ranging talks with russian president vladimir putin last month at an informal dinner in lahti , finland , when they appeared split over their attitude to moscow . although putin gave the leaders assurances that russia would continue to steadily and reliably pump oil and gas westward to eu consumers , he did not hesitate to take a swipe at georgia . even though eu-russia relations increasingly revolve around russia 's massive energy supplies , the europeans insist they will not shy away in talks with moscow from more prickly issues such as moscow 's hard-nosed approach to georgia . russia has cut off transport ties , deported hundreds of georgian citizens , and cracked down on georgian businesses in the worst dispute between the two since a 2003 revolution brought a pro-western leadership to power in georgia . russian ambassador ' not surprised ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin with european commission president jose manuel barroso russia 's ambassador to the european union said on monday that the european union should not be surprised that poland has become a stumbling block to a new eu-russia accord . " there is truly a need for consensus here , and it has been blocked by poland .

but now there 's a logical explanation . there 's no way around it .
merkel is , in her own words , " a bad driver . " she took so long to get her driving license back when she was a 26-year-old student that she had to resort to bribing her instructor to speed up the process . speaking to a celebrity audience at the golden steering wheel awards last week , merkel said that after 38 lessons she still was n't any closer to taking her test .
so she acted on advice from a friend who said she should offer her instructor cash " tips " in exchange for driving tips . " after that i got my license right away , " merkel said of the early practice she received in under-the-table deal making that may have come in handy as she climbed the political ladder . though she is seldom willing to give ground politically , it seems that merkel is at least a considerate driver - she has n't gotten behind the wheel since taking office . chancellor has parking problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maybe a sport mini is more merkel 's speed ?
the chancellor , currently the most powerful woman in the world , also admitted to needing a diminutive car because she ca n't park . currently the happy owner of an audi , she said if she had a lot of money , she 'd buy a mini .
" it 's practical , small and pleasant to look at and yet has a certain rakish style , " merkel said of the car . experts can not agree if this was wise comment in a country where size really does matter - the bigger -lrb- and faster -rrb- the car , the better . merkel , however , is certainly differentiating herself from her predecessor gerhard schröder .
he was nicknamed the " car chancellor " because of his love of cars and pro-automobile industry policies . if she does n't watch out , the current chancellor could be tagged " mini merkel .

" i hope that between now and the eu-russia summit we can reach a common position , " said eu external affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner , while acknowledging the continued polish stance . the current eu-russia partnership accord runs out late next year but eu officials are playing down any talk of a deadline as the two sides agree that the existing deal will remain in place until a new agreement is reached . eu leaders had a chance for wide-ranging talks with russian president vladimir putin last month at an informal dinner in lahti , finland , when they appeared split over their attitude to moscow . although putin gave the leaders assurances that russia would continue to steadily and reliably pump oil and gas westward to eu consumers , he did not hesitate to take a swipe at georgia . even though eu-russia relations increasingly revolve around russia 's massive energy supplies , the europeans insist they will not shy away in talks with moscow from more prickly issues such as moscow 's hard-nosed approach to georgia . russia has cut off transport ties , deported hundreds of georgian citizens , and cracked down on georgian businesses in the worst dispute between the two since a 2003 revolution brought a pro-western leadership to power in georgia . russian ambassador ' not surprised ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin with european commission president jose manuel barroso russia 's ambassador to the european union said on monday that the european union should not be surprised that poland has become a stumbling block to a new eu-russia accord . " there is truly a need for consensus here , and it has been blocked by poland .
but i ca n't say that it came as a surprise , " vladimir chizhov said in comments on the rossiya television station . " we warned our partners in the eu about the difficulties the eu expansion of two years ago might bring , " he said .

the question is : will hamas ever accept israel 's right to exist ? the prospect of hamas and fatah forming a new unity cabinet - with mohammad shbair unofficially named to succeed hamas member ismail haniya as palestinian prime minister - was welcome news to european foreign ministers at their monthly meeting in brussels .
" such a government , " they said in a joint statement released on monday , " would also be a partner for the international community to support the re-launching of the peace process . "
the eu 's commissioner for external relations , benita ferrero-waldner , said she believed a new palestinian leadership could break the current impasse in the middle east .
" those seeking a new government need our support and a calm environment , " commented ferrero-waldner .
" let 's hope they have a good government with which we can work . "
germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier also welcomed the prospect of change .
" the talks between fatah and hamas seem to indicate that a national unity government could be possible , " steinmeier said .
" that would get the process of negotiations moving . "
and the eu 's foreign policy coordinator javier solana added that he was " optimistic " there would soon be a new palestinian government .
the middle east peace process ground to a halt this march , when hamas , whose charter calls for the destruction of israel , won palestinian elections .
a new government of technocrats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shbair is currently a palestinian mp and the former head of the islamic university in gaza shbair - a us-educated biologist who is not a member of either hamas or fatah - has not been officially nominated , but spokespeople from both factions say he has a good chance of becoming the next palestinian prime minister .
shbair has said he would accept the job .
his prospective appointment is widely seen as a move to put together a new government of experts and technocrats and downplay ideological figures such as haniya .
hamas and fatah are currently negotiating over the make-up of a new cabinet .
if a new government is formed , its first task will be to tackle the disastrous state of the palestinian authority 's finances .
after hamas ' election victory in march , the eu and the us froze aid payments to the palestinian government , demanding that hamas recognize israel .
as a result , the palestinian authority has had difficulty paying the salaries of most of its 165,000 workers since april .
the boycott has devastated the palestinian economy .
hamas hardliners bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu and the us consider hamas a terrorist organization but the eu and us will not resume aid payments until palestinians have a government that accepts the existence of israel - something hamas has consistently refused to do .
" our position in this regard remains unchanged , " hamas spokesman fawzi barhoum stated on tuesday .
" we reject joining in any government that recognizes israel . "
some hamas officials say a new government 's platform might be kept vague enough to get around the conflict .
but israel and the us are likely to press for an endorsement of the two-state solution , agreed by the so-called quartet of the us , the eu , russia and the un as the basis for middle east peace negotiations .

the question is : will hamas ever accept israel 's right to exist ? the prospect of hamas and fatah forming a new unity cabinet - with mohammad shbair unofficially named to succeed hamas member ismail haniya as palestinian prime minister - was welcome news to european foreign ministers at their monthly meeting in brussels .
" such a government , " they said in a joint statement released on monday , " would also be a partner for the international community to support the re-launching of the peace process . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 14.11.2006 eu cautiously optimistic on possible new palestinian government großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the palestinian authority has been under an eu aid embargo since march eu foreign policy leaders expressed hope that a new palestinian government could help revive middle east peace negotiations .
the question is : will hamas ever accept israel 's right to exist ? the prospect of hamas and fatah forming a new unity cabinet - with mohammad shbair unofficially named to succeed hamas member ismail haniya as palestinian prime minister - was welcome news to european foreign ministers at their monthly meeting in brussels .
" such a government , " they said in a joint statement released on monday , " would also be a partner for the international community to support the re-launching of the peace process . "
the eu 's commissioner for external relations , benita ferrero-waldner , said she believed a new palestinian leadership could break the current impasse in the middle east .
" those seeking a new government need our support and a calm environment , " commented ferrero-waldner .
" let 's hope they have a good government with which we can work . "
germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier also welcomed the prospect of change .
" the talks between fatah and hamas seem to indicate that a national unity government could be possible , " steinmeier said .
" that would get the process of negotiations moving . "
and the eu 's foreign policy coordinator javier solana added that he was " optimistic " there would soon be a new palestinian government .
the middle east peace process ground to a halt this march , when hamas , whose charter calls for the destruction of israel , won palestinian elections .
a new government of technocrats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shbair is currently a palestinian mp and the former head of the islamic university in gaza shbair - a us-educated biologist who is not a member of either hamas or fatah - has not been officially nominated , but spokespeople from both factions say he has a good chance of becoming the next palestinian prime minister .
shbair has said he would accept the job .
his prospective appointment is widely seen as a move to put together a new government of experts and technocrats and downplay ideological figures such as haniya .
hamas and fatah are currently negotiating over the make-up of a new cabinet .
if a new government is formed , its first task will be to tackle the disastrous state of the palestinian authority 's finances .
after hamas ' election victory in march , the eu and the us froze aid payments to the palestinian government , demanding that hamas recognize israel .
as a result , the palestinian authority has had difficulty paying the salaries of most of its 165,000 workers since april .
the boycott has devastated the palestinian economy .
hamas hardliners bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu and the us consider hamas a terrorist organization but the eu and us will not resume aid payments until palestinians have a government that accepts the existence of israel - something hamas has consistently refused to do .
" our position in this regard remains unchanged , " hamas spokesman fawzi barhoum stated on tuesday .
" we reject joining in any government that recognizes israel . "
some hamas officials say a new government 's platform might be kept vague enough to get around the conflict .
but israel and the us are likely to press for an endorsement of the two-state solution , agreed by the so-called quartet of the us , the eu , russia and the un as the basis for middle east peace negotiations .
officials from the quartet are scheduled to meet in cairo on wednesday to discuss the prospects of a new palestinian government . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de solana calls for return to mideast peace road map during a visit to the middle east , eu foreign policy chief javier solana expressed concern at the absence of peace talks between israel and the palestinians and said the european union was ready to offer its help .
-lrb- 26.10.2006 -rrb- eu , us present united front ahead of vienna summit vienna is gearing up to host the next eu-us summit on wednesday .
while the relationship between the two powers is often described as " complex , " this time , it seems there is consensus on the main issues up for discussion .

the question is : will hamas ever accept israel 's right to exist ? the prospect of hamas and fatah forming a new unity cabinet - with mohammad shbair unofficially named to succeed hamas member ismail haniya as palestinian prime minister - was welcome news to european foreign ministers at their monthly meeting in brussels .
" such a government , " they said in a joint statement released on monday , " would also be a partner for the international community to support the re-launching of the peace process . "
the eu 's commissioner for external relations , benita ferrero-waldner , said she believed a new palestinian leadership could break the current impasse in the middle east .
" those seeking a new government need our support and a calm environment , " commented ferrero-waldner .
" let 's hope they have a good government with which we can work . "
germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier also welcomed the prospect of change .
" the talks between fatah and hamas seem to indicate that a national unity government could be possible , " steinmeier said .

shbair has said he would accept the job .
his prospective appointment is widely seen as a move to put together a new government of experts and technocrats and downplay ideological figures such as haniya .
hamas and fatah are currently negotiating over the make-up of a new cabinet .
if a new government is formed , its first task will be to tackle the disastrous state of the palestinian authority 's finances .
after hamas ' election victory in march , the eu and the us froze aid payments to the palestinian government , demanding that hamas recognize israel .

" from electric shocks to having one 's head submerged in water , -lrb- subjection to -rrb- hunger and thirst , or being shackled and suspended , " kurnaz said , listing the alleged abuses he faced while a detainee at camp x-ray in cuba . a burly man with long reddish hair and a thick beard stretching down to his belly , kurnaz spoke without emotion to cnn turk television from his home in bremen , northern germany . tales of torture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been numerous torture claims by guantanamo prisoners " they tell you ' you are from al-qaeda ' and when you say ' no ' they give the -lrb- electric -rrb- current to your feet .
as you keep saying ' no ' this goes on for two or three hours , " he said , adding he had several times lost consciousness , " kurnaz said . he claimed he was once shackled to a ceiling for " four or five days . " " they take you down in the mornings when a doctor comes to see whether you can endure more , " he said .
" they let you sit when the interrogator comes .
they take you down about three times a day so you do not die . " kurnaz also alleged prisoners were locked up in cells into which frigid or hot air was pumped . " i saw several people die , " he said .

they argue that rumsfeld 's resignation last week means prosecutors may be under less political pressure to shun the case . wolfgang kaleck , the german attorney who is leading the litigation , said the suit 's backers would appeal if prosecutors refuse to take up the case , and raised the prospect of further attempts in other european countries . dw staff / afp -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de guantanamo lawyers file lawsuit against rumsfeld in germany lawyers defending detainees at the us naval base in guantanamo bay , cuba , will file a law suit in germany on tuesday against outgoing us defense secretary donald rumsfeld for his alleged role in sanctioning torture .

prosecutors accuse him of " representing the holocaust as a myth , " which is forbidden under german law .
he faces a second charge of disturbing the peace of the dead . rudolf called the holocaust " a gigantic fraud , " at the start of proceedings in mannheim . rudolf , who has a degree in chemistry , first attracted attention in the early 1990s , when he was called as an expert witness for the defense in the trial of a former german military general accused of denying the holocaust .
the report rudolf submitted to the court claimed that chemical tests carried out on material from the auschwitz concentration camp proved that there were no gas chambers there . rudolf was fired by his employer , the max planck institute , when that institution found out he had used his position to carry out the tests .
in 1996 , a court in the german city of tübingen found him guilty of public incitement for denying the holocaust and sentenced him to 14 months in jail . rudolf fled germany to escape that sentence , traveling first to spain , then england .
he eventually landed in the united states , where he unsuccessfully applied for political asylum . in november 2005 , he was deported to germany , where the authorities immediately arrested him . pseudonyms as sources bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the evidence for the holocuats is overwhelming , but denial remains a problem rudolf has been linked with the german far right , in particular with the republican party .
in 1998 , he submitted expert testimony on behalf of british holocaust denier david irving in the latter 's libel lawsuit against penguin books .
irving lost that suit . rudolf has published a number of works disputing the reality of the holocaust .
he has used half a dozen pseudonyms and had admitted to citing works published under his assumed names in order to create the impression that others support his theses .
he also gave an interview with an islamic radio station in which he disputes central facts concerning the holocaust . rudolf is the second prominent holocaust denier to face charges in mannheim this year .
this trial of the first , ernst zündel , got underway in june and is still going on . a verdict in rudolf 's case is not expected until 2007 . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts : banning german neo-nazi party is counterproductive leading german politicians have again called for a ban on germany 's national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , but neither this nor financial problems are likely to hurt the country 's far right , experts say .

" from electric shocks to having one 's head submerged in water , -lrb- subjection to -rrb- hunger and thirst , or being shackled and suspended , " kurnaz said , listing the alleged abuses he faced while a detainee at camp x-ray in cuba . a burly man with long reddish hair and a thick beard stretching down to his belly , kurnaz spoke without emotion to cnn turk television from his home in bremen , northern germany . tales of torture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been numerous torture claims by guantanamo prisoners " they tell you ' you are from al-qaeda ' and when you say ' no ' they give the -lrb- electric -rrb- current to your feet .
as you keep saying ' no ' this goes on for two or three hours , " he said , adding he had several times lost consciousness , " kurnaz said . he claimed he was once shackled to a ceiling for " four or five days . " " they take you down in the mornings when a doctor comes to see whether you can endure more , " he said .
" they let you sit when the interrogator comes .
they take you down about three times a day so you do not die . " kurnaz also alleged prisoners were locked up in cells into which frigid or hot air was pumped . " i saw several people die , " he said .
" sometimes i thought i could no longer stand it and would also die . " he claimed he was once left without food for 20 days and spoke of psychological abuse , including " religious insults " such as the koran being kicked on the ground . arrested , but still no proof of terrorist links a turkish citizen with permanent residency in germany , kurnaz was arrested in pakistan after the september 11 , 2001 attacks and turned over to us forces , who took him to a prison in the afghan city of kandahar before transferring him to guantanamo in 2002 . he says he went to pakistan to visit holy places and take religious courses . ' germany conspired with us ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and bush - cooperation over guantanamo ?
german prosecutors have also dropped a long-running probe into kurnaz on the grounds they failed to find any firm proof he belonged to a terrorist group . kurnaz has insisted throughout he was innocent , and on his return to germany accused the government of former chancellor gerhard schroeder of colluding with the us forces . around 450 prisoners are being held at guantanamo bay - some for years - without charges being brought .
human rights lawyers have brought suits on behalf of the detainees , many of them picked up as suspected al-qaeda or taliban fighters from afghanistan . rumsfeld sued over guantanamo kurnaz 's statements come at a time when civil rights lawyers are hoping german prosecutors will open a war crimes investigation into the role of outgoing us secretary of defense donald rumsfeld and a host of other officials in the abuse at iraq 's abu ghraib prison and guantanamo bay . the suit is brought on behalf of 12 alleged torture victims including mohamad al-qahtani , a saudi being held at the u.s. military prison in guantanamo bay , cuba , who has been identified by the us as a would-be participant in the sept .
11 attacks . after fbi agents raised concerns , military investigators began reviewing the case and in july 2005 said they confirmed abusive and degrading treatment . german prosecutors already declined to investigate a more limited suit in 2004 , arguing that it was up to the u.s. to launch any inquiry . the attorneys involved think they have a better case this time .
they argue that rumsfeld 's resignation last week means prosecutors may be under less political pressure to shun the case . wolfgang kaleck , the german attorney who is leading the litigation , said the suit 's backers would appeal if prosecutors refuse to take up the case , and raised the prospect of further attempts in other european countries . dw staff / afp -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de guantanamo lawyers file lawsuit against rumsfeld in germany lawyers defending detainees at the us naval base in guantanamo bay , cuba , will file a law suit in germany on tuesday against outgoing us defense secretary donald rumsfeld for his alleged role in sanctioning torture .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 14.11.2006 compromise reached on " tolerated " foreigners in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of those affected by the compromise fled kosovo in 1999 the german government on tuesday reached a compromise on how to deal with some 200,000 foreigners whose applications for asylum have been turned down , but who are not deported for humanitarian reasons . most of the 200,000 people in question come from afghanistan , iraq and kosovo .
they 've lived in germany because the country tolerates them without offering them the prospect of obtaining full-fledged residence permits . at least once a year they have to see the authorities who may or may not decide to prolong their stay in germany .
the foreigners ' undefined status is coupled with many disadvantages on the labor market and problems in social integration . on tuesday , germany 's ruling christian and social democrats said they had reached a deal on new and clearer legislation .
it will make the granting of residence status dependent on the number of years someone has been in germany .
aside from any other requirements , individuals will be able to receive a two-year residence permit if they 've lived here for at least eight years , or six years if they have children . during those two years , they will have to prove that they can find gainful employment and support themselves .
should they fail to do so , they will lose their residence permit and fall back to tolerated status .
social democrats had pushed for giving people residence permits first before asking them to find employment . broader access to labor market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social democrats hope the new regulation will make job applications easier " we just have to face the realities , " said dieter wiefelspütz , the domestic policy spokesman for the social democrats .
" the people we 're talking about are confronted with enormous difficulties in finding employment .
after all , it 's the state itself which has set up all sorts of hurdles .
so let 's look to the future and help them to broaden their access to the labor market instead of telling them that a job is a prerequisite for staying here . " christian democrats on the other hand had called for granting permits only once people have found work . strain on welfare system ? bavarian interior minister günther beckstein of the christian social union , the sister party of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union , has insisted that permanent residence status must only be granted to those who can support their families without having to fall back on state welfare money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservatives want to prevent additional cases of welfare recipients " we just wo n't accept tens of thousands of people more to strain the country 's already overburdened social systems , " he said on german public television .
" so it would be strange to grant residence status to someone who 's just not able to look after his family .
and it 's no solution for them to be working illegally .
they do n't pay any taxes , and should not be rewarded for this now .
it would be like saying that it 's okay to give somebody a driving license just because he 's been driving a car illegally for many years . " protecting children members of germany 's main opposition party , the free-market , liberal free democrats , meanwhile said they were most interested in finding a humane solution for affected school-age children who were born in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deporting children to a country that 's strange to them is inhumane , leutheusser-schnarrenberger says " these kids do n't know the countries of their parents ' origin at all , " said sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , a former federal justice minister .
" all they know is germany , here is where they live .
do you want to send them to , say , afghanistan or iraq ?
that would be ridiculous .
after all , we 're talking about human beings with real biographies , and not just about figures and quota . " the interior ministers of germany 's 16 states are expected to fine-tune the agreement at a meeting on thursday and friday . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin 's naturalization campaign defies dismal citizenship trend despite recent integration initiatives in germany , naturalization , considered the most effective way to become part of society , is proving unpopular .
fewer foreigners have become german citizens in the last five years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 14.11.2006 compromise reached on " tolerated " foreigners in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of those affected by the compromise fled kosovo in 1999 the german government on tuesday reached a compromise on how to deal with some 200,000 foreigners whose applications for asylum have been turned down , but who are not deported for humanitarian reasons . most of the 200,000 people in question come from afghanistan , iraq and kosovo .
they 've lived in germany because the country tolerates them without offering them the prospect of obtaining full-fledged residence permits . at least once a year they have to see the authorities who may or may not decide to prolong their stay in germany .
the foreigners ' undefined status is coupled with many disadvantages on the labor market and problems in social integration . on tuesday , germany 's ruling christian and social democrats said they had reached a deal on new and clearer legislation .
it will make the granting of residence status dependent on the number of years someone has been in germany .
aside from any other requirements , individuals will be able to receive a two-year residence permit if they 've lived here for at least eight years , or six years if they have children . during those two years , they will have to prove that they can find gainful employment and support themselves .
should they fail to do so , they will lose their residence permit and fall back to tolerated status .
social democrats had pushed for giving people residence permits first before asking them to find employment . broader access to labor market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social democrats hope the new regulation will make job applications easier " we just have to face the realities , " said dieter wiefelspütz , the domestic policy spokesman for the social democrats .
" the people we 're talking about are confronted with enormous difficulties in finding employment .
after all , it 's the state itself which has set up all sorts of hurdles .
so let 's look to the future and help them to broaden their access to the labor market instead of telling them that a job is a prerequisite for staying here . " christian democrats on the other hand had called for granting permits only once people have found work . strain on welfare system ? bavarian interior minister günther beckstein of the christian social union , the sister party of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union , has insisted that permanent residence status must only be granted to those who can support their families without having to fall back on state welfare money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservatives want to prevent additional cases of welfare recipients " we just wo n't accept tens of thousands of people more to strain the country 's already overburdened social systems , " he said on german public television .
" so it would be strange to grant residence status to someone who 's just not able to look after his family .
and it 's no solution for them to be working illegally .
they do n't pay any taxes , and should not be rewarded for this now .
it would be like saying that it 's okay to give somebody a driving license just because he 's been driving a car illegally for many years . " protecting children members of germany 's main opposition party , the free-market , liberal free democrats , meanwhile said they were most interested in finding a humane solution for affected school-age children who were born in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deporting children to a country that 's strange to them is inhumane , leutheusser-schnarrenberger says " these kids do n't know the countries of their parents ' origin at all , " said sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , a former federal justice minister .
" all they know is germany , here is where they live .
do you want to send them to , say , afghanistan or iraq ?
that would be ridiculous .
after all , we 're talking about human beings with real biographies , and not just about figures and quota . " the interior ministers of germany 's 16 states are expected to fine-tune the agreement at a meeting on thursday and friday . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin 's naturalization campaign defies dismal citizenship trend despite recent integration initiatives in germany , naturalization , considered the most effective way to become part of society , is proving unpopular .

they 've lived in germany because the country tolerates them without offering them the prospect of obtaining full-fledged residence permits . at least once a year they have to see the authorities who may or may not decide to prolong their stay in germany .
the foreigners ' undefined status is coupled with many disadvantages on the labor market and problems in social integration . on tuesday , germany 's ruling christian and social democrats said they had reached a deal on new and clearer legislation .
it will make the granting of residence status dependent on the number of years someone has been in germany .
aside from any other requirements , individuals will be able to receive a two-year residence permit if they 've lived here for at least eight years , or six years if they have children . during those two years , they will have to prove that they can find gainful employment and support themselves .
should they fail to do so , they will lose their residence permit and fall back to tolerated status .
social democrats had pushed for giving people residence permits first before asking them to find employment . broader access to labor market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social democrats hope the new regulation will make job applications easier " we just have to face the realities , " said dieter wiefelspütz , the domestic policy spokesman for the social democrats .
" the people we 're talking about are confronted with enormous difficulties in finding employment .
after all , it 's the state itself which has set up all sorts of hurdles .
so let 's look to the future and help them to broaden their access to the labor market instead of telling them that a job is a prerequisite for staying here . " christian democrats on the other hand had called for granting permits only once people have found work . strain on welfare system ? bavarian interior minister günther beckstein of the christian social union , the sister party of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union , has insisted that permanent residence status must only be granted to those who can support their families without having to fall back on state welfare money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservatives want to prevent additional cases of welfare recipients " we just wo n't accept tens of thousands of people more to strain the country 's already overburdened social systems , " he said on german public television .
" so it would be strange to grant residence status to someone who 's just not able to look after his family .
and it 's no solution for them to be working illegally .
they do n't pay any taxes , and should not be rewarded for this now .
it would be like saying that it 's okay to give somebody a driving license just because he 's been driving a car illegally for many years . " protecting children members of germany 's main opposition party , the free-market , liberal free democrats , meanwhile said they were most interested in finding a humane solution for affected school-age children who were born in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deporting children to a country that 's strange to them is inhumane , leutheusser-schnarrenberger says " these kids do n't know the countries of their parents ' origin at all , " said sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , a former federal justice minister .
" all they know is germany , here is where they live .
do you want to send them to , say , afghanistan or iraq ?
that would be ridiculous .
after all , we 're talking about human beings with real biographies , and not just about figures and quota . " the interior ministers of germany 's 16 states are expected to fine-tune the agreement at a meeting on thursday and friday . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin 's naturalization campaign defies dismal citizenship trend despite recent integration initiatives in germany , naturalization , considered the most effective way to become part of society , is proving unpopular .

but now there 's a logical explanation . there 's no way around it .
merkel is , in her own words , " a bad driver . " she took so long to get her driving license back when she was a 26-year-old student that she had to resort to bribing her instructor to speed up the process . speaking to a celebrity audience at the golden steering wheel awards last week , merkel said that after 38 lessons she still was n't any closer to taking her test .
so she acted on advice from a friend who said she should offer her instructor cash " tips " in exchange for driving tips . " after that i got my license right away , " merkel said of the early practice she received in under-the-table deal making that may have come in handy as she climbed the political ladder . though she is seldom willing to give ground politically , it seems that merkel is at least a considerate driver - she has n't gotten behind the wheel since taking office . chancellor has parking problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maybe a sport mini is more merkel 's speed ?
the chancellor , currently the most powerful woman in the world , also admitted to needing a diminutive car because she ca n't park . currently the happy owner of an audi , she said if she had a lot of money , she 'd buy a mini .
" it 's practical , small and pleasant to look at and yet has a certain rakish style , " merkel said of the car . experts can not agree if this was wise comment in a country where size really does matter - the bigger -lrb- and faster -rrb- the car , the better . merkel , however , is certainly differentiating herself from her predecessor gerhard schröder .
he was nicknamed the " car chancellor " because of his love of cars and pro-automobile industry policies . if she does n't watch out , the current chancellor could be tagged " mini merkel . " dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de battling plummeting popularity , merkel vows reform drive german chancellor angela merkel plans to reverse her coalition government 's sinking popularity ratings with a renewed stab at controversial reforms .

the question is : will hamas ever accept israel 's right to exist ? the prospect of hamas and fatah forming a new unity cabinet - with mohammad shbair unofficially named to succeed hamas member ismail haniya as palestinian prime minister - was welcome news to european foreign ministers at their monthly meeting in brussels .
" such a government , " they said in a joint statement released on monday , " would also be a partner for the international community to support the re-launching of the peace process . "
the eu 's commissioner for external relations , benita ferrero-waldner , said she believed a new palestinian leadership could break the current impasse in the middle east .
" those seeking a new government need our support and a calm environment , " commented ferrero-waldner .
" let 's hope they have a good government with which we can work . "
germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier also welcomed the prospect of change .
" the talks between fatah and hamas seem to indicate that a national unity government could be possible , " steinmeier said .
" that would get the process of negotiations moving . "
and the eu 's foreign policy coordinator javier solana added that he was " optimistic " there would soon be a new palestinian government .
the middle east peace process ground to a halt this march , when hamas , whose charter calls for the destruction of israel , won palestinian elections .
a new government of technocrats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shbair is currently a palestinian mp and the former head of the islamic university in gaza shbair - a us-educated biologist who is not a member of either hamas or fatah - has not been officially nominated , but spokespeople from both factions say he has a good chance of becoming the next palestinian prime minister .
shbair has said he would accept the job .
his prospective appointment is widely seen as a move to put together a new government of experts and technocrats and downplay ideological figures such as haniya .
hamas and fatah are currently negotiating over the make-up of a new cabinet .
if a new government is formed , its first task will be to tackle the disastrous state of the palestinian authority 's finances .
after hamas ' election victory in march , the eu and the us froze aid payments to the palestinian government , demanding that hamas recognize israel .
as a result , the palestinian authority has had difficulty paying the salaries of most of its 165,000 workers since april .
the boycott has devastated the palestinian economy .
hamas hardliners bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu and the us consider hamas a terrorist organization but the eu and us will not resume aid payments until palestinians have a government that accepts the existence of israel - something hamas has consistently refused to do .
" our position in this regard remains unchanged , " hamas spokesman fawzi barhoum stated on tuesday .
" we reject joining in any government that recognizes israel . "
some hamas officials say a new government 's platform might be kept vague enough to get around the conflict .
but israel and the us are likely to press for an endorsement of the two-state solution , agreed by the so-called quartet of the us , the eu , russia and the un as the basis for middle east peace negotiations .
officials from the quartet are scheduled to meet in cairo on wednesday to discuss the prospects of a new palestinian government . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de solana calls for return to mideast peace road map during a visit to the middle east , eu foreign policy chief javier solana expressed concern at the absence of peace talks between israel and the palestinians and said the european union was ready to offer its help .

prosecutors accuse him of " representing the holocaust as a myth , " which is forbidden under german law .
he faces a second charge of disturbing the peace of the dead . rudolf called the holocaust " a gigantic fraud , " at the start of proceedings in mannheim . rudolf , who has a degree in chemistry , first attracted attention in the early 1990s , when he was called as an expert witness for the defense in the trial of a former german military general accused of denying the holocaust .

irving lost that suit . rudolf has published a number of works disputing the reality of the holocaust .
he has used half a dozen pseudonyms and had admitted to citing works published under his assumed names in order to create the impression that others support his theses .

" we failed two years ago because there was an ongoing investigation in the united states , but it is now clear that there is no chance of prosecuting high-ranking officials in the us , " kaleck told a press conference in berlin called to present the complaint . " we are not expecting that rumsfeld will appear in a court , but we are hoping investigators will begin looking into the case , " he said .
" if we fail here , we will try in france , or in spain .
we want to show that there will be no safe haven anywhere in the world for him . " the lawyer for the guantanamo detainee , mohammed al-qahtani , claims rumsfeld approved special " tactics " when he failed to break under interrogation .
the measures included sleep deprivation and a ban on praying , lawyer gitanjali gutierrez said . " this is not just allegations , it is supported by government documentation , " she added . the complaint asks harms to open an investigation and , ultimately , a criminal prosecution that will look into the responsibility of high-ranking us officials for allegedly authorizing war crimes in the context of the war on terror , according to the lawyers . rumsfeld resigned last week after republicans lost control of the us congress to the opposition democrats in mid-term elections seen as a referendum on the war in iraq . former abu ghraib commander as defense witness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : janis karpinski at the berlin press conference the groups have former us army brigadier general janis karpinski , who commanded 17 us-run jails in iraq including abu ghraib , as a witness on their behalf . " what i see as my obligation is to provide the truth about what i saw and what i experienced in iraq , " karpinski said at a press conference .
" when i was getting too close to what was happening they took me out of the equation - they removed abu ghraib from my control . " hopefully my testimony will stop this sort of thing ever happening again .
i feel we have an obligation to the rest of the world because if the us does something it gives permission to the rest of the world , but it does n't mean it is right , " karpinski added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other top-ranking us officials are named in the lawsuit former white house counsel and current attorney general alberto gonzales , former director of the central intelligence agency george tenet , and other high-ranking us officials are also charged in the complaint . other groups involved in the suit include the us-based center for constitutional rights and the paris-based international federation for human rights . the abu ghraib scandal erupted in 2004 after photographs were leaked to the press showing us guards mistreating and sexually humiliating prisoners .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 14.11.2006 eu service sector plans face final obstacle großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reform bill is expected to be passed with the sector opening up for all workers plans to free up europe 's vast services sector face a final obstacle on wednesday with a vote before the eu parliament , which is set to end three years of fierce debate . the reform comes before eu lawmakers in a second reading , but there are few doubts that it will be passed after a compromise was hammered out with member states in may . the aim is to create a huge service market which will make it much easier for a plumber or architect to set up shop in another eu member and boost competition . " i think it 's a done deal , " said german social democrat evelyne gebhardt , the text 's rapporteur , on friday although the plans , which affect a sector generating at least half the eu 's economic activity and 60 percent of its jobs , are expected to sail smoothly through the parliament , in its earlier forms they proved to be deeply controversial . known in previous versions as the bolkestein directive after the former internal market commissioner frits bolkestein of the netherlands , the original plans proposed that companies offering services in the eu be allowed to operate under the laws and regulations of their country of origin . fears of social dumping but many western european countries and trade unions feared that companies from countries with fewer taxes and regulations , in particular in eastern europe , would be able to operate in higher-cost economies without paying their employees the local rate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : countries with fewer taxes and rules were sees as a threat critics warned the directive would lead to " social dumping " - companies and jobs relocating to eastern europe or using low-cost labor in jobs like construction throughout the rest of the european union . anti-globalization and left-wing demonstrators took to the streets in france , germany and greece to oppose the reform and opponents of the eu 's draft constitution cast it as a threat to workers ' jobs in france ahead of the country 's rejection of the charter in a referendum in may 2005 . the european parliament in february threw out the original draft and approved their own watered-down version with the offending country-of-origin principle axed . they also reduced the scope to cover mainly commercial activities and not services such as healthcare and security , which are deemed to benefit the public good . new text nothing like bolkenstein directive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evelyne gebhardt in april the european commission - the eu 's executive arm - produced a draft that largely echoed the parliament 's version , and served as the basis for an agreement between member states in may . " the work over these last few years was worth it , " said gebhardt .
" the text now has nothing in common with the bolkestein directive , " she added . eager not to upset the delicate compromise due to go before the parliament on wednesday , the three biggest political groups in the parliament have not proposed amendments to it , significantly raising the odds that it will be easily passed . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debating the damage of high labor costs for german business a study by the cologne institute for economic research says that german workers are the third-most expensive worldwide .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european ties -pipe- 14.11.2006 poland scuppers eu talks on russia deal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has been accused of using its gas supplies as political leverage poland on monday blocked eu attempts to hold talks with russia over a new cooperation pact , demanding first a clear sign from moscow that its demands on trade and energy will be met . warsaw is taking a tough line , insisting that the eu pressure moscow to ratify an international energy charter and lift its embargoes on polish meat and plant products , before negotiations on a broader agreement can start . " we are unwilling to back off ... without a clear political signal from russia , " polish foreign minister anna fotyga told reporters after a meeting with her eu counterparts in brussels . fotyga did not indicate what poland would consider to be a clear political signal .
however she said she was " cautiously optimistic " of the chances of breaking the impasse . " russia uses energy as a political tool , it uses trade restrictions as a political tool , so there should be no surprise we are using the tools we have at our disposal , " she added . the 24 other eu member states are hoping to formulate an initial position on a new partnership and cooperation agreement with moscow ahead of a european union-russia summit on november 24 in helsinki . finnish foreign minister erkki tuomioja told a press conference after the talks that they have not ruled out an agreement before the eu-russia summit . " i would expect that we can finalize the mandate and have it adopted by the council -lrb- eu summit in mid-december -rrb- , " he said . embargo to stay until poland fixes food bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has insisted poland improve meat standards russia will not lift its embargo on certain polish foodstuffs until veterinary services put an end to continued " violations " a russian food security official said in moscow . " we can not guarantee the safety of these deliveries because we regularly detect violations in the import of various meat and other foodstuffs , " from poland , the spokesman was quoted as saying by russia 's interfax news agency . france and germany , among others , argued at an eu summit in finland last month that the tactics be changed , and that the bloc attempt to include as many of the energy charter 's main points as possible in the new partnership accord , even if russia has only signed and not ratified the document . these could include reliable access to russian energy supplies and pipelines , security of investments and transparency within the massive russian energy market . " i hope that between now and the eu-russia summit we can reach a common position , " said eu external affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner , while acknowledging the continued polish stance . the current eu-russia partnership accord runs out late next year but eu officials are playing down any talk of a deadline as the two sides agree that the existing deal will remain in place until a new agreement is reached . eu leaders had a chance for wide-ranging talks with russian president vladimir putin last month at an informal dinner in lahti , finland , when they appeared split over their attitude to moscow . although putin gave the leaders assurances that russia would continue to steadily and reliably pump oil and gas westward to eu consumers , he did not hesitate to take a swipe at georgia . even though eu-russia relations increasingly revolve around russia 's massive energy supplies , the europeans insist they will not shy away in talks with moscow from more prickly issues such as moscow 's hard-nosed approach to georgia . russia has cut off transport ties , deported hundreds of georgian citizens , and cracked down on georgian businesses in the worst dispute between the two since a 2003 revolution brought a pro-western leadership to power in georgia . russian ambassador ' not surprised ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin with european commission president jose manuel barroso russia 's ambassador to the european union said on monday that the european union should not be surprised that poland has become a stumbling block to a new eu-russia accord . " there is truly a need for consensus here , and it has been blocked by poland .
but i ca n't say that it came as a surprise , " vladimir chizhov said in comments on the rossiya television station . " we warned our partners in the eu about the difficulties the eu expansion of two years ago might bring , " he said .
" we wish success to our partners in this problem .

" we are unwilling to back off ... without a clear political signal from russia , " polish foreign minister anna fotyga told reporters after a meeting with her eu counterparts in brussels . fotyga did not indicate what poland would consider to be a clear political signal .
however she said she was " cautiously optimistic " of the chances of breaking the impasse . " russia uses energy as a political tool , it uses trade restrictions as a political tool , so there should be no surprise we are using the tools we have at our disposal , " she added . the 24 other eu member states are hoping to formulate an initial position on a new partnership and cooperation agreement with moscow ahead of a european union-russia summit on november 24 in helsinki . finnish foreign minister erkki tuomioja told a press conference after the talks that they have not ruled out an agreement before the eu-russia summit .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 14.11.2006 eu cautiously optimistic on possible new palestinian government großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the palestinian authority has been under an eu aid embargo since march eu foreign policy leaders expressed hope that a new palestinian government could help revive middle east peace negotiations .
the question is : will hamas ever accept israel 's right to exist ? the prospect of hamas and fatah forming a new unity cabinet - with mohammad shbair unofficially named to succeed hamas member ismail haniya as palestinian prime minister - was welcome news to european foreign ministers at their monthly meeting in brussels .
" such a government , " they said in a joint statement released on monday , " would also be a partner for the international community to support the re-launching of the peace process . "
the eu 's commissioner for external relations , benita ferrero-waldner , said she believed a new palestinian leadership could break the current impasse in the middle east .
" those seeking a new government need our support and a calm environment , " commented ferrero-waldner .
" let 's hope they have a good government with which we can work . "
germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier also welcomed the prospect of change .
" the talks between fatah and hamas seem to indicate that a national unity government could be possible , " steinmeier said .
" that would get the process of negotiations moving . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 14.11.2006 compromise reached on " tolerated " foreigners in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of those affected by the compromise fled kosovo in 1999 the german government on tuesday reached a compromise on how to deal with some 200,000 foreigners whose applications for asylum have been turned down , but who are not deported for humanitarian reasons . most of the 200,000 people in question come from afghanistan , iraq and kosovo .
they 've lived in germany because the country tolerates them without offering them the prospect of obtaining full-fledged residence permits . at least once a year they have to see the authorities who may or may not decide to prolong their stay in germany .
the foreigners ' undefined status is coupled with many disadvantages on the labor market and problems in social integration . on tuesday , germany 's ruling christian and social democrats said they had reached a deal on new and clearer legislation .
it will make the granting of residence status dependent on the number of years someone has been in germany .
aside from any other requirements , individuals will be able to receive a two-year residence permit if they 've lived here for at least eight years , or six years if they have children . during those two years , they will have to prove that they can find gainful employment and support themselves .
should they fail to do so , they will lose their residence permit and fall back to tolerated status .
social democrats had pushed for giving people residence permits first before asking them to find employment . broader access to labor market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social democrats hope the new regulation will make job applications easier " we just have to face the realities , " said dieter wiefelspütz , the domestic policy spokesman for the social democrats .
" the people we 're talking about are confronted with enormous difficulties in finding employment .

it will make the granting of residence status dependent on the number of years someone has been in germany .
aside from any other requirements , individuals will be able to receive a two-year residence permit if they 've lived here for at least eight years , or six years if they have children . during those two years , they will have to prove that they can find gainful employment and support themselves .

emma taylor will take over as headteacher of christ college , brecon , in september 2007 , when the present head phillip jones retires .
oxford graduate ms taylor , 40 , said she was looking forward to the challenge of leading the school .
the powys independent school was founded by a royal charter from king henry viii in 1541 .
it is on the site of a dominican friary dissolved by the king after the pope refused to annul his marriage to catherine of aragon so he would be free to marry anne boleyn .
ms taylor is currently senior mistress and admissions tutor at dean close school in cheltenham .
she said : " it ought n't to be as uncommon as it is for women to be appointed as heads in schools like this , but it is still fairly rare so i guess it 's unusual .
the school was founded in 1541 " it does n't feel very different to me to be female - i 've always been female , but i guess it will be a new thing for them here . "
and the mother-of-two , who is originally from dorset , said she was ready to meet the challenge of leading one of wales ' oldest schools .
" i think independent schools long since stopped resting on their laurels and recognised that they 're going to have to provide excellent education and things which are different and special in order to attract people to them , rather than to the maintained sector .
' thrilled ' " christ 's brecon already provides a fantastically rich and varied education and really broad , rounded way of preparing people for their future .
" so in a sense one could say there is n't a challenge , but of course one ca n't be complacent and there will be lots of new changes in education around the corner which we 've got to adapt to and indeed lead . "
the co-educational boarding school has just over 300 pupils .
last year , it was able to set up a series of science scholarships after being left £ 2m by the family of former pupil david hubert jones - a pharmacist who was at the school from 1917 to 1921 .
current head mr jones , who is retiring after 11 years in the post , said ms taylor was one of 50 applicants .
he added : " the school governors were delighted with the outstanding quality of applications .
" it made their job extremely difficult , and we are thrilled that mrs taylor has accepted the position and will take up her new post next year . "

the mayor 's personal visit to venezuela to sign an oil deal was cancelled , and he returned from cuba leaving his officials to go on to venezuela .
a preliminary estimate of the total costs was made public after calls by members of the london assembly .
mr livingstone said the cost of the trip was " modest " .
the mayor and four officials stopped in cuba , at a cost of about £ 20,000 , including £ 16,991 in flight tickets .
when mr livingstone 's plans to go to venezuela fell through , four other officials who had travelled from london to venezuela at a cost of nearly £ 16,000 , including £ 12,948 on flights , returned home .
' modest ' expenses the mayor 's office said it had yet to calculate the costs of unused tickets and other facilities used by the entourage .
mr livingstone 's political opponents have told bbc london political editor tim donovan the tour raised questions about judgement and was " humiliating and embarrassing " .
they are also asking how londoners are going to benefit from the visit .
the mayor 's office said mr livingstone was invited by lord moynihan - chair of the british olympic association - to attend a sports congress in cuba .
after cuba , the mayor was scheduled to fly to venezuela to sign an oil deal with president hugo chavez , which will ensure subsidised venezuelan oil for london .
the mayor said : " since i was first elected in 2000 , i have spent an average of just ten days a year - less than 3 % of the time - on mayoral trips abroad .
" given that cuba plays a central role in the international olympic and sporting movement , particularly in fields like boxing , the costs of my visit to cuba are modest and in line with the costs incurred on other mayoral trips .
" similarly , the costs of the advance trip by key staff to venezuela to prepare for the visit were also modest . "

the mayor 's personal visit to venezuela to sign an oil deal was cancelled , and he returned from cuba leaving his officials to go on to venezuela .
a preliminary estimate of the total costs was made public after calls by members of the london assembly .
mr livingstone said the cost of the trip was " modest " .
the mayor and four officials stopped in cuba , at a cost of about £ 20,000 , including £ 16,991 in flight tickets .
when mr livingstone 's plans to go to venezuela fell through , four other officials who had travelled from london to venezuela at a cost of nearly £ 16,000 , including £ 12,948 on flights , returned home .
' modest ' expenses the mayor 's office said it had yet to calculate the costs of unused tickets and other facilities used by the entourage .
mr livingstone 's political opponents have told bbc london political editor tim donovan the tour raised questions about judgement and was " humiliating and embarrassing " .
they are also asking how londoners are going to benefit from the visit .
the mayor 's office said mr livingstone was invited by lord moynihan - chair of the british olympic association - to attend a sports congress in cuba .
after cuba , the mayor was scheduled to fly to venezuela to sign an oil deal with president hugo chavez , which will ensure subsidised venezuelan oil for london .
the mayor said : " since i was first elected in 2000 , i have spent an average of just ten days a year - less than 3 % of the time - on mayoral trips abroad .

the list is published annually by the state department and includes china , north korea , iran and sudan .
vietnam was removed just days before president george w bush travels to hanoi for a meeting of the asia pacific economic co-operation -lrb- apec -rrb- forum .
however , a us bill to normalise trade relations with vietnam failed to get approval in congress .
another attempt to pass the bill is expected to be made later this week .
announcing vietnam 's removal from its countries of concern list , the us state department said there had been " significant improvements toward advancing religious freedom " in the country .
the decision was welcomed by vietnamese officials .
" it is a right decision which accurately reflects reality in vietnam in accordance with the principles in the vietnam-us relationship and positive progress , " foreign ministry spokesman le dung said in a statement .
the decision comes amid a warming in us-vietnam ties , and as vietnam prepares to host the apec forum , which it hopes will be a showcase for its economic reforms .
' subduing ' protestantism there is little doubt that religious freedom has increased in vietnam in the two years it has been on the list , the bbc 's bill hayton in hanoi says .
but critics question whether it has increased enough , our correspondent adds . "
if vietnam wants to participate fully on the world stage , she must respect international law by protecting the full religious freedom of her citizens " mervyn thomas christian solidarity worldwide there has been a revival of religious feeling in the country .
new buddhist pagodas are springing up and the catholic church has ordained new priests .
but there are limits .
only religious organisations that pledge loyalty to the state enjoy freedoms and dissidents , both buddhist and christian , face harassment .
the rights group christian solidarity worldwide said this week it had evidence of a crackdown on protestantism among ethnic minorities in the north-west highlands .
the uk-based group said it had acquired an internal government training manual outlining a plan to " to resolutely subdue the abnormally rapid and spontaneous development of the protestant religion " in that region .
" if vietnam wants to participate fully on the world stage , she must respect international law by protecting the full religious freedom of her citizens , " chief executive , mervyn thomas said .
uzbekistan correspondents say there has been a us effort to normalise diplomatic and trade relations with vietnam .
but the house of representatives ' failure to pass the bill establishing permanent trade relations with vietnam with a two-thirds majority on monday surprised many .
the bill would allow us farmers , bankers and businesses to share in the benefits of vietnam 's fast-growing economy now it has joined the world trade organisation .
however , republicans are hoping they can get it passed later this week , before president bush travels to hanoi .
while vietnam has been taken off the us list of countries of particular concern -lrb- cpc -rrb- regarding religious freedoms , uzbekistan has been added .
the state department said observant muslims are targeted as extremists .
the department said burma , china , north korea , eritrea , iran , saudi arabia and sudan would remain on the list .

" it is a right decision which accurately reflects reality in vietnam in accordance with the principles in the vietnam-us relationship and positive progress , " foreign ministry spokesman le dung said in a statement .
the decision comes amid a warming in us-vietnam ties , and as vietnam prepares to host the apec forum , which it hopes will be a showcase for its economic reforms .
' subduing ' protestantism there is little doubt that religious freedom has increased in vietnam in the two years it has been on the list , the bbc 's bill hayton in hanoi says .
but critics question whether it has increased enough , our correspondent adds .
if vietnam wants to participate fully on the world stage , she must respect international law by protecting the full religious freedom of her citizens mervyn thomas christian solidarity worldwide there has been a revival of religious feeling in the country .
new buddhist pagodas are springing up and the catholic church has ordained new priests .
but there are limits .
only religious organisations that pledge loyalty to the state enjoy freedoms and dissidents , both buddhist and christian , face harassment .
the rights group christian solidarity worldwide said this week it had evidence of a crackdown on protestantism among ethnic minorities in the north-west highlands .
the uk-based group said it had acquired an internal government training manual outlining a plan to " to resolutely subdue the abnormally rapid and spontaneous development of the protestant religion " in that region .
" if vietnam wants to participate fully on the world stage , she must respect international law by protecting the full religious freedom of her citizens , " chief executive , mervyn thomas said .
uzbekistan correspondents say there has been a us effort to normalise diplomatic and trade relations with vietnam .
but the house of representatives ' failure to pass the bill establishing permanent trade relations with vietnam with a two-thirds majority on monday surprised many .
the bill would allow us farmers , bankers and businesses to share in the benefits of vietnam 's fast-growing economy now it has joined the world trade organisation .
however , republicans are hoping they can get it passed later this week , before president bush travels to hanoi .
while vietnam has been taken off the us list of countries of particular concern -lrb- cpc -rrb- regarding religious freedoms , uzbekistan has been added .
the state department said observant muslims are targeted as extremists .
the department said burma , china , north korea , eritrea , iran , saudi arabia and sudan would remain on the list .

however , it said that it was " on track " to meet key targets , with a pre-tax profit of £ 4.8bn before the one-off costs of £ 8bn were taken into account .
the company reiterated full-year predictions for a rise of about 5 % in income from mobile calls .
it also announced an alliance with yahoo on mobile phone advertising .
under the partnership , yahoo will use its technology to provide a range of mobile advertising formats across vodafone 's services .
and vodafone customers who accept targeted advertising will get savings on some services .
emerging markets chief executive arun sarin said that the european market remained very competitive , with falling revenue in the uk , germany and italy .
however , this had been offset with by a strong performance in developing markets - including egypt , south africa and romania - as well as its spanish operation .
overall revenues increased by 4 % to £ 15.6bn , compared with the same period last year .
its loss was the result of an £ 8.1bn impairment charge - caused by higher interest rates , regulatory pressures in the german market and the writing-down of some of the value of its italian division and of its mannesmann business in germany .
vodafone made a £ 14.9bn loss in the 12 months to april 2006 - a record for a uk firm - after it admitted some of its assets were worth less than it thought .
and bbc business editor robert peston said that the latest results highlighted " yet again " how vodafone had spent too much on the wrong companies in the past .
" revenues in its main european markets , the uk , germany and italy , are all flat , " he said .
" they generate billions in cash flow , of course , but there 's no growth from all the spending on 3g licences and the mannesmann deal . "
he added that the mobile phone operations of the us firm verizon wireless - in which vodafone has a minority stake - was , by contrast , performing " brilliantly " .
" what a difference there would be to vodafone 's share price if it had invested more on acquiring control of a us operation and less on europe , " he said .

only 48 % of eligible homes in the region use the agency 's free floodline warnings direct service which sends out alerts when flooding is imminent .
that means more than 18,000 properties have yet to sign up .
" some people living in flood risk areas are clearly in denial about the dangers flooding can cause , " the agency said .
it estimates that homeowners face an average bill of £ 28,000 for repairing flood damage .
the agency 's floodline offers warnings by phone , text , fax or pager to those who sign up .
increasing risk take-up of the service varies around the region , with hambleton -lrb- 80 % -rrb- and ryedale -lrb- 79 % -rrb- - both in north yorkshire - highlighted as two of the most flood-aware locations .
awareness in those areas has been raised following devastating floods in the north york moors in june 2005 .
in sheffield , south yorkshire , only 17 % of properties use the service and in hull , east yorkshire , the figure was just 33 % .
a spokesman for the agency 's flood forecasting team said : " we all have locks on our doors and many of us install alarms to protect our home and possessions against burglary , but surprisingly , so few people are taking steps to safeguard their home against the increasing risk of flooding .

only 48 % of eligible homes in the region use the agency 's free floodline warnings direct service which sends out alerts when flooding is imminent .
that means more than 18,000 properties have yet to sign up .
" some people living in flood risk areas are clearly in denial about the dangers flooding can cause , " the agency said .
it estimates that homeowners face an average bill of £ 28,000 for repairing flood damage .

a spokesman for the agency 's flood forecasting team said : " we all have locks on our doors and many of us install alarms to protect our home and possessions against burglary , but surprisingly , so few people are taking steps to safeguard their home against the increasing risk of flooding .
