program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 19.10.2006 german schools search for solutions to absentee teachers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without a teacher , he probably wo n't get far berlin 's christian democrats have drawn attention to a problem that disrupts learning in the city 's schools and could contribute to germany 's comparatively low educational standards . the problem , which is by no means endemic to berlin , is the number of classes which have to be cut every year due to a simple lack of staff .
principals up and down the country are practiced in the chaotic art of last-minute reorganization of timetables and redistribution of their teachers in order to provide as much education as they possibly can .
but for all their efforts , it remains the case that each week children across germany are granted extra playtime , because there simply are n't enough teachers around to teach them .
for the most part , the teachers are absent as a result of little more than minor ailments , and though the consequences might seem significant to an average nine-year old , parents , unions and political opponents would beg to differ .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : packing up time - the joys of sick teachers according to official figures , which vary from one state to another , an average of between 2 and 3 percent of all school classes fall by the wayside annually .
but that is by no means the whole picture .
last year , teachers in berlin were absent for a total of 10.1 percent of scheduled classes , and although three-quarters were spared cancellation by having other staff fill in , the replacements were not always teachers .
too many timetable irregularities katrin schulze-bernt , the berlin christian democrats ' education spokeswoman , said she was concerned that , as things stand , children are not getting their full quota of prescribed learning .
" every 10th hour is not taught by the regular teacher , and i 'm concerned that the replacements used are not always professionals , but are sometimes just after-school carers who can not actually teach . "
indeed primary schools in berlin do regularly have to fall back on the help of after-school carers to keep the children entertained throughout the course of the school day .
high schools students , meanwhile , must be prepared to accept whichever teacher and subject their moveable timetables serve up .
neither scenario is ideal , and both lead to unwanted disruptions for which there appears to be no quick-fix cure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education , school , learning !
across the board , the problem is a combination of job-for-life contracts , teacher burnout syndrome , strapped-for-cash local authorities , and no established culture of working with substitute teachers .
and it 's likely to get worse before it gets better , according to jens stiller , a spokesman for berlin 's department of education .
" three percent of our teachers are on long-term sick leave , " he said .
" and since the average age of our workforce is 49 , we are dealing with a lot of staff sickness .
what we need here is a greater balance between old and young teachers . "
testing new waters given that no such balance can be injected into the existing system , the educational powers that be have launched a trial scheme whereby a number of schools budget for their own needs .
" each school is allocated a certain budget from which they can employ substitute teachers as required , " stiller said .
" they use retired teachers , those on maternity leave or those in the final stages of their teacher training . "
it 's a novel scheme , which stiller said was working well , but it remains to be seen how well it would fare were it expanded to schools across the city .
" there are only so many trained teachers out there available to work as substitute staff , and they might be too few to go around , " he pointed out .
" guaranteed teaching " earlier this year , the state of hesse launched an initiative to tackle that very problem .
under its " guaranteed-teaching " scheme , it has created pools of substitute staff - only in this instance , teaching qualifications and experience are not a prerequisite .
nonetheless , christian boergen of hesse 's department of education said it was an improvement over the days when cut classes were a run-of-the-mill occurrence .
" it 's good for teachers to know someone will cover for them when they are sick , and for parents to know their children wo n't be walking the streets because a class has been cancelled , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hesse advertises for substitutes the project has been widely criticized for its randomness - not least by the regional teaching union , gew hesse .
hartwig schröder , the head of the union 's legal department , is horrified by the department of education 's willingness to use retired teachers , students and housewives to take over at the blackboard .
" the majority of those employed as part of the guaranteed-teaching project do not have the qualifications which used to be required to be able to teach , " he said .
" it is a slap in the face for the profession . "
unlike the test project in berlin , guaranteed teaching has not been restricted to a handful of schools , but has already been put into practice across the state .
schröder said it would ultimately do more harm than good .
" what we need is simple : more teachers , smaller class sizes , less stress and , consequently , a greater sense of satisfaction among the teachers .
and what we do n't need is this kind of patchwork solution . tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin school wants to profit from education phorms , a new private school in berlin , opened its doors in august .

but for all their efforts , it remains the case that each week children across germany are granted extra playtime , because there simply are n't enough teachers around to teach them .

" three percent of our teachers are on long-term sick leave , " he said .
" and since the average age of our workforce is 49 , we are dealing with a lot of staff sickness .
what we need here is a greater balance between old and young teachers . "
testing new waters given that no such balance can be injected into the existing system , the educational powers that be have launched a trial scheme whereby a number of schools budget for their own needs .
" each school is allocated a certain budget from which they can employ substitute teachers as required , " stiller said .
" they use retired teachers , those on maternity leave or those in the final stages of their teacher training . "
it 's a novel scheme , which stiller said was working well , but it remains to be seen how well it would fare were it expanded to schools across the city .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 19.10.2006 german schools search for solutions to absentee teachers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without a teacher , he probably wo n't get far berlin 's christian democrats have drawn attention to a problem that disrupts learning in the city 's schools and could contribute to germany 's comparatively low educational standards . the problem , which is by no means endemic to berlin , is the number of classes which have to be cut every year due to a simple lack of staff .
principals up and down the country are practiced in the chaotic art of last-minute reorganization of timetables and redistribution of their teachers in order to provide as much education as they possibly can .
but for all their efforts , it remains the case that each week children across germany are granted extra playtime , because there simply are n't enough teachers around to teach them .
for the most part , the teachers are absent as a result of little more than minor ailments , and though the consequences might seem significant to an average nine-year old , parents , unions and political opponents would beg to differ .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : packing up time - the joys of sick teachers according to official figures , which vary from one state to another , an average of between 2 and 3 percent of all school classes fall by the wayside annually .
but that is by no means the whole picture .
last year , teachers in berlin were absent for a total of 10.1 percent of scheduled classes , and although three-quarters were spared cancellation by having other staff fill in , the replacements were not always teachers .
too many timetable irregularities katrin schulze-bernt , the berlin christian democrats ' education spokeswoman , said she was concerned that , as things stand , children are not getting their full quota of prescribed learning .
" every 10th hour is not taught by the regular teacher , and i 'm concerned that the replacements used are not always professionals , but are sometimes just after-school carers who can not actually teach . "
indeed primary schools in berlin do regularly have to fall back on the help of after-school carers to keep the children entertained throughout the course of the school day .
high schools students , meanwhile , must be prepared to accept whichever teacher and subject their moveable timetables serve up .
neither scenario is ideal , and both lead to unwanted disruptions for which there appears to be no quick-fix cure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education , school , learning !
across the board , the problem is a combination of job-for-life contracts , teacher burnout syndrome , strapped-for-cash local authorities , and no established culture of working with substitute teachers .
and it 's likely to get worse before it gets better , according to jens stiller , a spokesman for berlin 's department of education .
" three percent of our teachers are on long-term sick leave , " he said .
" and since the average age of our workforce is 49 , we are dealing with a lot of staff sickness .
what we need here is a greater balance between old and young teachers . "
testing new waters given that no such balance can be injected into the existing system , the educational powers that be have launched a trial scheme whereby a number of schools budget for their own needs .
" each school is allocated a certain budget from which they can employ substitute teachers as required , " stiller said .
" they use retired teachers , those on maternity leave or those in the final stages of their teacher training . "
it 's a novel scheme , which stiller said was working well , but it remains to be seen how well it would fare were it expanded to schools across the city .
" there are only so many trained teachers out there available to work as substitute staff , and they might be too few to go around , " he pointed out .
" guaranteed teaching " earlier this year , the state of hesse launched an initiative to tackle that very problem .
under its " guaranteed-teaching " scheme , it has created pools of substitute staff - only in this instance , teaching qualifications and experience are not a prerequisite .
nonetheless , christian boergen of hesse 's department of education said it was an improvement over the days when cut classes were a run-of-the-mill occurrence .
" it 's good for teachers to know someone will cover for them when they are sick , and for parents to know their children wo n't be walking the streets because a class has been cancelled , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hesse advertises for substitutes the project has been widely criticized for its randomness - not least by the regional teaching union , gew hesse .
hartwig schröder , the head of the union 's legal department , is horrified by the department of education 's willingness to use retired teachers , students and housewives to take over at the blackboard .
" the majority of those employed as part of the guaranteed-teaching project do not have the qualifications which used to be required to be able to teach , " he said .
" it is a slap in the face for the profession . "
unlike the test project in berlin , guaranteed teaching has not been restricted to a handful of schools , but has already been put into practice across the state .
schröder said it would ultimately do more harm than good .
" what we need is simple : more teachers , smaller class sizes , less stress and , consequently , a greater sense of satisfaction among the teachers .
and what we do n't need is this kind of patchwork solution . tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin school wants to profit from education phorms , a new private school in berlin , opened its doors in august .

" it is highly probable that berlin can sort out its budget difficulties itself , " said winfried hassemer , vice-president of the court . government duty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin is the seat of germany 's federal government and parliament legally , the government is obliged to bail out a cash-strapped state so long as it has made the requisite budget savings and undertaken sufficient austerity measures .
states that have been on the receiving end of government aid include bremen and the saarland in 1992 . but in the 1990s , it was that the capital which bore the brunt of reunification 's cost . public spending was scaled back as unemployment soared , with some 100,000 industrial jobs lost over the last 16 years .
cultural spending has seen massive cuts and civil servant salaries have been reduced .
but major business investments have have been few . according to the city authorities , berlin is not to blame for its spiraling debt .
they argue that the government slashed its post-reunification aid too soon - before the city had time to stabilize . resentment in the south bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber but the government as well as a number of other states argued that berlin did not meet the criteria for aid , and that with seven of germany 's 16 states are currently in debt , it is not the only one in financial dire straits . other states , including bavaria and baden-württemberg , point out that berlin has consistently overspent and failed to privatize state holdings . " berlin could have done far more to tighten its belt , " said baden-württemberg 's finance minister gerhard stratthaus -lrb- cdu -rrb- in an interview with weekly magazine der spiegel . bavarian state premier edmund stoiber , meanwhile , has insisted that " solidarity has its limits .

a norwegian student on a field trip to berlin though he had made the deal of his life - until he got arrested buying deodorant . what some people call growing up is really no more than an endless series of gaffes , blunders and embarrassing missteps .
possessed by the ultimate fear of being left out of the fun , overconfident and dysfunctionally competitive teenagers simply ca n't help getting into trouble . earlier this week , a 16-year-old norwegian student struck a conversation with a stranger on alexanderplatz , a large square in the heart of former east berlin dominated by communist-era architecture and vague attempts to hide it behind renovated facades . aside from the fact that the norwegian student should have known better than to talk to strangers in general , a little bit of curiosity for the cultural milieu of his surroundings would have opened his eyes to the fact that many people were leaving the square in tears . why do people usually cry on alexanderplatz ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's always something fun to do at alexanderplatz the matchbox mafia is one of the most lucrative sections of the international brotherhood of charlatans .

a norwegian student on a field trip to berlin though he had made the deal of his life - until he got arrested buying deodorant . what some people call growing up is really no more than an endless series of gaffes , blunders and embarrassing missteps .
possessed by the ultimate fear of being left out of the fun , overconfident and dysfunctionally competitive teenagers simply ca n't help getting into trouble . earlier this week , a 16-year-old norwegian student struck a conversation with a stranger on alexanderplatz , a large square in the heart of former east berlin dominated by communist-era architecture and vague attempts to hide it behind renovated facades . aside from the fact that the norwegian student should have known better than to talk to strangers in general , a little bit of curiosity for the cultural milieu of his surroundings would have opened his eyes to the fact that many people were leaving the square in tears . why do people usually cry on alexanderplatz ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's always something fun to do at alexanderplatz the matchbox mafia is one of the most lucrative sections of the international brotherhood of charlatans .
their brilliant idea of cheating people out of their money by making them play a guessing game with matchboxes and a 50-euro banknote never seems to fail to attract an army of gullible lost souls . berlin 's alexanderplatz practically serves as the matchbox swindlers ' headquarters . the young norwegian , however , was oblivious to this fact .
he was also - as he later admitted - a little tipsy .
but that 's what teenagers do on their field trips , after all .
getting to know a foreign country and culture is always more difficult when you 're completely sober . here 's the deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lesson number one should be : do not engage in money laundering the man who approached the inebriated norwegian student asked him if he wanted to change some money for him .
usually , when people ask for change , they need a few euros to buy cigarettes , a subway ticket or a drink .
this time , however , the sum in question was a little larger .
in fact , it was larger than life . the man agreed to pay 400 euros -lrb- $ 500 -rrb- to the mysterious stranger .
in return , he got a big , fat wad of 200 euro bills , totaling 20,400 euros -lrb- $ 25,577 -rrb- . what a great deal , he must have thought to himself , almost too good to be true ! the sad thing in life that most teenagers learn about as they grow older and more bitter is that those things which sound too good to be true generally are . it was n't me , really bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it may look like 200 euros , but it 's probably not worth the paper it 's printed on on the following day , the young man took one of his crisp 200 euro notes and went to buy some deodorant .

at most , bulk clients could expect rebates , but normal customers will see little , if any , benefit .
it could even be the case that business clients get price cuts at the expense of individual users . but eu commissioner mccreevy tried to assuage these fears , saying the postal system will continue to deliver the mail universally after liberalization .
deutsche post and other ex-monopolies in the eu are required to " deliver and pick up letters and packages at least five times a week , at good quality and competitive prices , " he reiterated . not just packages " when the market opens completely in 2009 , we can expect more innovation , better service , and higher cost efficiency , " mccreevy said .
he said this was the case for postal services in great britain , sweden and finland , which already made the switch . the current plan follows earlier waves of postal liberalization : in 1997 and 2002 .

" without -lrb- liberalization -rrb- , eu postal markets will be increasingly unable to meet the challenges of the communications revolution , " the irish commissioner said . the proposal to fully liberalize the postal market will need the backing of member state governments and the european parliament to go into effect .
past efforts to liberalize the postal market have met fierce opposition in some countries , and this time is likely to be no different . states complain last week 10 national postal services voiced concern about how , under the reform , they would be allowed to cover the considerable cost of meeting universal delivery obligations without the backing of the state . the belgian , cypriot , french , greek , hungarian , italian , luxembourg , maltese , polish and spanish postal services said in a joint statement there was " no proof of the efficiency of the measures planned by the commission " to finance the obligation . in response to such concerns , the commission proposed a range of funding options as well as the possibility of dividing the responsibility to provide full geographic coverage among different postal services . " growing industry " " i 'm well aware that there will be considerable lobbying on all sides but it 's hardly fair to have some very large markets opened up to competition and other markets that are not , " mccreevy said . he added : " this industry is not a dying industry , it 's a growing one , it 's a very dynamic one and it 's a very profitable for those who operate it efficiently .

germany 's highest court ruled thursday that berlin is not getting a helping hand from the federal government to put its financial house in order .
what does that mean for the capital ? it seems as if every week , there is a new expensive museum or monument or refurbished relic opening in germany 's capital .
amid such lavish spending , it might appear odd to hear berlin officials complaining over a mountain of debt , even taking the federal government to court for more money .
berlin officials have long argued they are entitled to federal help with at least 60 percent of their 62-billion-euro -lrb- $ 77 billion -rrb- debt under a law that requires transfer payments between german states and the federal government in times of financial need .
after all , they have cut costs and sold off assets , they say .
and there is precedent - a 1992 court ruling forced the federal government to help bremen and saarland with their debt .
" we can not climb down from this debt mountain alone , " berlin mayor klaus wowereit told the german constitutional court in karlsruhe .
" we have done everything we can and now need federal solidarity .
berlin is a sexy but poor city . "
thursday , however , the court disagreed saying that berlin failed to qualify for emergency aid under the constitution rules .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal goverment is struggling to put the entire house in order " berlin adorns itself with the slogan ' poor but sexy ' but it is n't so poor , " said presiding judge winfried hassemer .
" berlin does n't have a budget emergency .
significant indicators point only to a budget that is under stress which berlin can in all probability overcome on its own . "
so what now ? christian schmidt of the berlin-based industrial investment council , an agency that promotes investment in the east , says he was surprised by the court decision and thinks people did n't expect it would be so harsh .
" ' poor but sexy ' obviously failed to impress the judges , " he said .
" berlin has even tougher times ahead . "
experts say things looks pretty bleak for the city of 3.4 million known for its vibrant arts , academic and cultural life , one in which the tourism and building sectors are growing .
that is because the city is burdened by massive debt and interest payments of 2.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.1 billion -rrb- annually .
the city has a very small industrial base and little hope of expanding it .
the unemployment rate is the third highest of any of germany 's 16 states , at 17 percent .
most of the problems date back to the end of world war ii when most large companies moved their headquarters to west germany - for example , siemens moved to munich and the banking industry fled to frankfurt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bode museum was just the latest new offering after german reunification in 1990 , east german industry collapsed when state subsidies were cut .
also , berlin failed to stop spending at a rate it was used to , especially when federal payments were slashed in 1995 from almost 8 million euros to 2 million euros .
as a result , since 1991 , berlin 's debt has risen nearly six-fold , from 10 billion to 61 billion euros , giving it the highest per capita debt level of any state in germany .
the city has lost about 100,000 industrial jobs since 1990 .
" in 15 years , we are going to be showing people from china around and hoping for a euro in tip , " said one economic expert .
" wealth is going south and i am not optimistic about berlin 's situation . "
tougher measures needed the judges said that poor political decision-making led to berlin 's financial situation , something that " federal aid is n't there to remedy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin : all that glitters is not gold they wrote that berlin needs to increase the local commercial tax rate and sell more of its assets , such as the state 's 270,000 housing units estimated to be worth about 4 billion euros and the landesbank berlin holding ag , worth 5 billion euros .
reducing wages for its civil servants is another area in need of attention - berlin employees are paid 50 percent more than those in hamburg , for example .
another issue is cutting subsidies that fund redundancies such as the city 's three operas , two zoos and six housing authorities , something that arose because berlin was divided . " to reconcile the two cities , well that was a tough thing , " said schmidt .
" but it took too long and no one had the guts cut into the meat . "
only way out schmidt says , however , that even so , berlin is in a tough predicament because even if it sold off a lot of its assets , it would n't cover the debt .
he praises berlin 's finance minister , theo sarrazin , for taking some harsh measures such as cutting subsides and 70,000 jobs and has managed to balance the budget for the first time - berlin has cut spending by about 11 percent since 1995 , the biggest savings made by any state .
the only way out is to focus on berlin 's advantages , its human capital and vibrant cultural life , experts say .
" i can not image that most industries and sectors that have left berlin will return , " said dieter vesper , an economist with the german institute for economic research .
" so the only choice berlin has is to try to develop sectors which are important in the future such as the health industry and the research and education sector , both areas which berlin already has an advantage .
but the only way to do this is to develop better links between these sectors and the business community . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin and wowereit say berlin needs the help another area to watch is if the federal government moves more of its people to berlin as many expect it to do - currently almost half of all government employees work outside the capital .
schmidt said he thinks that berlin will cease to be an independent state in 15 years and instead will merge with brandenburg , the state that surrounds it .
" that would help stop the rivalry and help lure investors , " he said .
" it would also trim administrative budgets , help universities to work more collaboratively .
there is no quick fix for berlin but there is no reason why the city ca n't survive with all it offers .

germany 's highest court ruled thursday that berlin is not getting a helping hand from the federal government to put its financial house in order .
what does that mean for the capital ? it seems as if every week , there is a new expensive museum or monument or refurbished relic opening in germany 's capital .
amid such lavish spending , it might appear odd to hear berlin officials complaining over a mountain of debt , even taking the federal government to court for more money .
berlin officials have long argued they are entitled to federal help with at least 60 percent of their 62-billion-euro -lrb- $ 77 billion -rrb- debt under a law that requires transfer payments between german states and the federal government in times of financial need .
after all , they have cut costs and sold off assets , they say .
and there is precedent - a 1992 court ruling forced the federal government to help bremen and saarland with their debt .
" we can not climb down from this debt mountain alone , " berlin mayor klaus wowereit told the german constitutional court in karlsruhe .
" we have done everything we can and now need federal solidarity .
berlin is a sexy but poor city . "
thursday , however , the court disagreed saying that berlin failed to qualify for emergency aid under the constitution rules .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal goverment is struggling to put the entire house in order " berlin adorns itself with the slogan ' poor but sexy ' but it is n't so poor , " said presiding judge winfried hassemer .
" berlin does n't have a budget emergency .
significant indicators point only to a budget that is under stress which berlin can in all probability overcome on its own . "
so what now ? christian schmidt of the berlin-based industrial investment council , an agency that promotes investment in the east , says he was surprised by the court decision and thinks people did n't expect it would be so harsh .
" ' poor but sexy ' obviously failed to impress the judges , " he said .
" berlin has even tougher times ahead . "

" while exports are continuing to expand strongly , the recovery is being increasingly carried by domestic demand . " the government 's plan to raise value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- by three percentage points to 19 percent from jan .
1 could , however , weigh on activity next year and lead to a marked slowdown in german growth . " never was vat increased so much in one go .
thus it is difficult to gauge to what extent fiscal policy will put the brakes on the economy , " the report said .
" the annual average rate of gdp growth depends largely on what purchases were brought forward this year as a result of the tax hike . " anticipatory effects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are spending as much as they can before the vat hike the institutes calculated that the anticipatory effects of the vat hike on consumer purchases this year would alone cut a quarter of a percentage point off next year 's growth . " only in the second half of 2007 will private consumption pick up modestly as employment rises .
for the year as a whole consumer spending is likely to stagnate . " another risk factor for the german economy next year could be a possible downturn in the real estate market in the us and in other major economies which " could lead to a stronger slowdown in the global economy , " the report said . in the meantime , the current stronger performance of the german economy is likely to have a positive effect on public finances in the euro zone 's economic powerhouse . shrinking deficit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is the largest economy in the euro zone germany 's public deficit was projected to amount to 2.4 percent of gdp this year and shrink further to just 1.4 percent next year . under eu budget rules , euro-zone countries are not allowed to run deficits in excess of 3.0 percent of gdp .
but germany , the main architect of the stability and growth pact , has been in breach of the three-percent rule every year since 2002 . the economic upturn was similarly expected to have a positive effect on the labor markets , with the institutes projecting a fall in the unemployment rate from 11.2 percent in 2005 to 10.4 percent in 2006 and 9.9 percent in 2007 . monetary policy turning to monetary policy , the institutes estimated that a further rise in euro-zone interest rates would be appropriate between now and the end of the year , but that the european central bank should then hold rates steady next year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government sees the planned vat increase as a necessary step " since december 2005 , the ecb has raised its benchmark interest rate to 3.25 percent , " the report said . " we share the ecb 's opinion that there are risks to price stability .
we therefore regard a further increase to 3.50 percent by the end of the year as appropriate , especially since the euro-zone economy will remain pointed upwards . " monetary conditions in the 12 countries that share the euro were likely to remain steady next year . the german vat hike would not have a lasting effect on headline inflation in the euro area , the institutes predicted . " the effects of the vat hike will be a one-off and will not in themselves be a reason to tighten monetary policy , " they said . in addition , economic growth was expected to slow next year .

a norwegian student on a field trip to berlin though he had made the deal of his life - until he got arrested buying deodorant . what some people call growing up is really no more than an endless series of gaffes , blunders and embarrassing missteps .
possessed by the ultimate fear of being left out of the fun , overconfident and dysfunctionally competitive teenagers simply ca n't help getting into trouble . earlier this week , a 16-year-old norwegian student struck a conversation with a stranger on alexanderplatz , a large square in the heart of former east berlin dominated by communist-era architecture and vague attempts to hide it behind renovated facades . aside from the fact that the norwegian student should have known better than to talk to strangers in general , a little bit of curiosity for the cultural milieu of his surroundings would have opened his eyes to the fact that many people were leaving the square in tears . why do people usually cry on alexanderplatz ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's always something fun to do at alexanderplatz the matchbox mafia is one of the most lucrative sections of the international brotherhood of charlatans .

she realized the money had been forged and informed the police . the young man - who has no previous criminal record in either germany or his home country - ended up in jail .
he said he did n't know the money had been forged , but thought , instead , that it had been laundered . of course .

a norwegian student on a field trip to berlin though he had made the deal of his life - until he got arrested buying deodorant . what some people call growing up is really no more than an endless series of gaffes , blunders and embarrassing missteps .
possessed by the ultimate fear of being left out of the fun , overconfident and dysfunctionally competitive teenagers simply ca n't help getting into trouble . earlier this week , a 16-year-old norwegian student struck a conversation with a stranger on alexanderplatz , a large square in the heart of former east berlin dominated by communist-era architecture and vague attempts to hide it behind renovated facades . aside from the fact that the norwegian student should have known better than to talk to strangers in general , a little bit of curiosity for the cultural milieu of his surroundings would have opened his eyes to the fact that many people were leaving the square in tears . why do people usually cry on alexanderplatz ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's always something fun to do at alexanderplatz the matchbox mafia is one of the most lucrative sections of the international brotherhood of charlatans .
their brilliant idea of cheating people out of their money by making them play a guessing game with matchboxes and a 50-euro banknote never seems to fail to attract an army of gullible lost souls . berlin 's alexanderplatz practically serves as the matchbox swindlers ' headquarters . the young norwegian , however , was oblivious to this fact .
he was also - as he later admitted - a little tipsy .
but that 's what teenagers do on their field trips , after all .
getting to know a foreign country and culture is always more difficult when you 're completely sober . here 's the deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lesson number one should be : do not engage in money laundering the man who approached the inebriated norwegian student asked him if he wanted to change some money for him .
usually , when people ask for change , they need a few euros to buy cigarettes , a subway ticket or a drink .
this time , however , the sum in question was a little larger .
in fact , it was larger than life . the man agreed to pay 400 euros -lrb- $ 500 -rrb- to the mysterious stranger .
in return , he got a big , fat wad of 200 euro bills , totaling 20,400 euros -lrb- $ 25,577 -rrb- . what a great deal , he must have thought to himself , almost too good to be true ! the sad thing in life that most teenagers learn about as they grow older and more bitter is that those things which sound too good to be true generally are . it was n't me , really bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it may look like 200 euros , but it 's probably not worth the paper it 's printed on on the following day , the young man took one of his crisp 200 euro notes and went to buy some deodorant .
the sales person realized something was up with the young person whose source of money did n't seem as admirable as his desire to smell nice during his class trip .
she realized the money had been forged and informed the police . the young man - who has no previous criminal record in either germany or his home country - ended up in jail .
he said he did n't know the money had been forged , but thought , instead , that it had been laundered . of course .
that 's what 16 year olds these days are hoping for : to strike a sweet deal with the money-laundering mafia while on a field trip .

it could even be the case that business clients get price cuts at the expense of individual users . but eu commissioner mccreevy tried to assuage these fears , saying the postal system will continue to deliver the mail universally after liberalization .

" i firmly believe that completing the internal market for postal services is vital for securing further improvements and for sustaining the progress and results achieved to date , " he said . " in preparing the proposal , we have put consumer and user needs first , " he added . " universal delivery " in danger ? german national postal system deutsche post , which is already slated to give up its monopoly in 2008 , and the german government welcomed the commissioner 's plan . on the contrary , consumer protection advocates said they were concerned about the fate of universal mail delivery in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the digital age has not made postal services obsolete - quite the contrary patrick von braunmühl of the federation of german consumer organizations said it was still unclear how the postal service could make good on a promise of universal mail delivery without the support of the state . in contrast to the effect of liberalized telecoms markets , he said , consumers can not expect significantly lower postage prices .
at most , bulk clients could expect rebates , but normal customers will see little , if any , benefit .
it could even be the case that business clients get price cuts at the expense of individual users . but eu commissioner mccreevy tried to assuage these fears , saying the postal system will continue to deliver the mail universally after liberalization .
deutsche post and other ex-monopolies in the eu are required to " deliver and pick up letters and packages at least five times a week , at good quality and competitive prices , " he reiterated . not just packages " when the market opens completely in 2009 , we can expect more innovation , better service , and higher cost efficiency , " mccreevy said .
he said this was the case for postal services in great britain , sweden and finland , which already made the switch . the current plan follows earlier waves of postal liberalization : in 1997 and 2002 .
at that time , the markets for the delivery of packages and letters weighing more than 50 grams were opened to competition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissoner charlie mccreevy wants an level playing field in europe now , mccreevy aims to break state monopolies for the delivery of letters weighing less than 50 grams by 2009 while guaranteeing mail services throughout each country . " without -lrb- liberalization -rrb- , eu postal markets will be increasingly unable to meet the challenges of the communications revolution , " the irish commissioner said . the proposal to fully liberalize the postal market will need the backing of member state governments and the european parliament to go into effect .
past efforts to liberalize the postal market have met fierce opposition in some countries , and this time is likely to be no different . states complain last week 10 national postal services voiced concern about how , under the reform , they would be allowed to cover the considerable cost of meeting universal delivery obligations without the backing of the state . the belgian , cypriot , french , greek , hungarian , italian , luxembourg , maltese , polish and spanish postal services said in a joint statement there was " no proof of the efficiency of the measures planned by the commission " to finance the obligation . in response to such concerns , the commission proposed a range of funding options as well as the possibility of dividing the responsibility to provide full geographic coverage among different postal services . " growing industry " " i 'm well aware that there will be considerable lobbying on all sides but it 's hardly fair to have some very large markets opened up to competition and other markets that are not , " mccreevy said . he added : " this industry is not a dying industry , it 's a growing one , it 's a very dynamic one and it 's a very profitable for those who operate it efficiently .
and that 's why operators want to get into it .

barcelona lost 1-0 to chelsea on wednesday . " we are in the mix now and have a chance to get through to the next phase , " said german international miroslav klose .
" we have sofia away and then chelsea at home .
chelsea are a great team but if we play like we did against barcelona we are capable of beating them . " without midfield duo tim borowski and frank baumann through injury , bremen lacked drive from midfield , but german international defender christian schulz had their first chance with his 24th minute effort whistling wide of the right hand post . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's diego , center , is attacked by sofia 's hristo yovov during the group a champions league match sofia , who had lost their first two matches against barcelona and chelsea , looked set to make it to the half-time break at 0-0 but paid the price for a terrible defensive wall .
naldo drilled a 25 yard free-kick straight through the collapsing wall and the unsighted sofia goalkeeper had no chance with the ball going in off the inside of the post . brazilian playmaker diego , a summer signing from fc porto , made a second goal on 74 minutes , and bremen took the spoils . bremen 's next european match is away to sofia on oct .

all the players fought hard and showed good team spirit and we managed to keep possession of the ball and have scoring chances of our own . " schweinsteiger first made his mark with the goal , following organized buildup play by bayern .
his 30-meter shot rifled past well-beaten sporting keeper ricardo for his second goal of the tournament and bayern 's seventh , with none conceded . six minutes later schweinsteiger earned a yellow card , following a challenge on nani , which paved the way for his exit for a second booking two minutes after the break for a trip on second-half substitute yannick djalo . schweinsteiger will now miss bayern 's fourth match at home to sporting in a fortnight where a point for the germans would suffice to progress . dw staff / dpa / afp -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de does the bundesliga have a world cup hangover ?

germany 's highest court ruled thursday that berlin is not getting a helping hand from the federal government to put its financial house in order .
what does that mean for the capital ? it seems as if every week , there is a new expensive museum or monument or refurbished relic opening in germany 's capital .
amid such lavish spending , it might appear odd to hear berlin officials complaining over a mountain of debt , even taking the federal government to court for more money .
berlin officials have long argued they are entitled to federal help with at least 60 percent of their 62-billion-euro -lrb- $ 77 billion -rrb- debt under a law that requires transfer payments between german states and the federal government in times of financial need .
after all , they have cut costs and sold off assets , they say .
and there is precedent - a 1992 court ruling forced the federal government to help bremen and saarland with their debt .
" we can not climb down from this debt mountain alone , " berlin mayor klaus wowereit told the german constitutional court in karlsruhe .
" we have done everything we can and now need federal solidarity .
berlin is a sexy but poor city . "
thursday , however , the court disagreed saying that berlin failed to qualify for emergency aid under the constitution rules .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal goverment is struggling to put the entire house in order " berlin adorns itself with the slogan ' poor but sexy ' but it is n't so poor , " said presiding judge winfried hassemer .
" berlin does n't have a budget emergency .
significant indicators point only to a budget that is under stress which berlin can in all probability overcome on its own . "
so what now ? christian schmidt of the berlin-based industrial investment council , an agency that promotes investment in the east , says he was surprised by the court decision and thinks people did n't expect it would be so harsh .
" ' poor but sexy ' obviously failed to impress the judges , " he said .
" berlin has even tougher times ahead . "
experts say things looks pretty bleak for the city of 3.4 million known for its vibrant arts , academic and cultural life , one in which the tourism and building sectors are growing .
that is because the city is burdened by massive debt and interest payments of 2.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.1 billion -rrb- annually .
the city has a very small industrial base and little hope of expanding it .
the unemployment rate is the third highest of any of germany 's 16 states , at 17 percent .
most of the problems date back to the end of world war ii when most large companies moved their headquarters to west germany - for example , siemens moved to munich and the banking industry fled to frankfurt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bode museum was just the latest new offering after german reunification in 1990 , east german industry collapsed when state subsidies were cut .
also , berlin failed to stop spending at a rate it was used to , especially when federal payments were slashed in 1995 from almost 8 million euros to 2 million euros .
as a result , since 1991 , berlin 's debt has risen nearly six-fold , from 10 billion to 61 billion euros , giving it the highest per capita debt level of any state in germany .
the city has lost about 100,000 industrial jobs since 1990 .
" in 15 years , we are going to be showing people from china around and hoping for a euro in tip , " said one economic expert .
" wealth is going south and i am not optimistic about berlin 's situation . "
tougher measures needed the judges said that poor political decision-making led to berlin 's financial situation , something that " federal aid is n't there to remedy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin : all that glitters is not gold they wrote that berlin needs to increase the local commercial tax rate and sell more of its assets , such as the state 's 270,000 housing units estimated to be worth about 4 billion euros and the landesbank berlin holding ag , worth 5 billion euros .
reducing wages for its civil servants is another area in need of attention - berlin employees are paid 50 percent more than those in hamburg , for example .
another issue is cutting subsidies that fund redundancies such as the city 's three operas , two zoos and six housing authorities , something that arose because berlin was divided . " to reconcile the two cities , well that was a tough thing , " said schmidt .
" but it took too long and no one had the guts cut into the meat . "
only way out schmidt says , however , that even so , berlin is in a tough predicament because even if it sold off a lot of its assets , it would n't cover the debt .
he praises berlin 's finance minister , theo sarrazin , for taking some harsh measures such as cutting subsides and 70,000 jobs and has managed to balance the budget for the first time - berlin has cut spending by about 11 percent since 1995 , the biggest savings made by any state .
the only way out is to focus on berlin 's advantages , its human capital and vibrant cultural life , experts say .
" i can not image that most industries and sectors that have left berlin will return , " said dieter vesper , an economist with the german institute for economic research .
" so the only choice berlin has is to try to develop sectors which are important in the future such as the health industry and the research and education sector , both areas which berlin already has an advantage .
but the only way to do this is to develop better links between these sectors and the business community . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin and wowereit say berlin needs the help another area to watch is if the federal government moves more of its people to berlin as many expect it to do - currently almost half of all government employees work outside the capital .
schmidt said he thinks that berlin will cease to be an independent state in 15 years and instead will merge with brandenburg , the state that surrounds it .
" that would help stop the rivalry and help lure investors , " he said .
" it would also trim administrative budgets , help universities to work more collaboratively .
there is no quick fix for berlin but there is no reason why the city ca n't survive with all it offers .

" it is highly probable that berlin can sort out its budget difficulties itself , " said winfried hassemer , vice-president of the court . government duty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin is the seat of germany 's federal government and parliament legally , the government is obliged to bail out a cash-strapped state so long as it has made the requisite budget savings and undertaken sufficient austerity measures .
states that have been on the receiving end of government aid include bremen and the saarland in 1992 . but in the 1990s , it was that the capital which bore the brunt of reunification 's cost . public spending was scaled back as unemployment soared , with some 100,000 industrial jobs lost over the last 16 years .

germany 's highest court ruled thursday that berlin is not getting a helping hand from the federal government to put its financial house in order .
what does that mean for the capital ? it seems as if every week , there is a new expensive museum or monument or refurbished relic opening in germany 's capital .
amid such lavish spending , it might appear odd to hear berlin officials complaining over a mountain of debt , even taking the federal government to court for more money .
berlin officials have long argued they are entitled to federal help with at least 60 percent of their 62-billion-euro -lrb- $ 77 billion -rrb- debt under a law that requires transfer payments between german states and the federal government in times of financial need .
after all , they have cut costs and sold off assets , they say .
and there is precedent - a 1992 court ruling forced the federal government to help bremen and saarland with their debt .
" we can not climb down from this debt mountain alone , " berlin mayor klaus wowereit told the german constitutional court in karlsruhe .
" we have done everything we can and now need federal solidarity .
berlin is a sexy but poor city . "
thursday , however , the court disagreed saying that berlin failed to qualify for emergency aid under the constitution rules .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal goverment is struggling to put the entire house in order " berlin adorns itself with the slogan ' poor but sexy ' but it is n't so poor , " said presiding judge winfried hassemer .
" berlin does n't have a budget emergency .
significant indicators point only to a budget that is under stress which berlin can in all probability overcome on its own . "
so what now ? christian schmidt of the berlin-based industrial investment council , an agency that promotes investment in the east , says he was surprised by the court decision and thinks people did n't expect it would be so harsh .
" ' poor but sexy ' obviously failed to impress the judges , " he said .
" berlin has even tougher times ahead . "
experts say things looks pretty bleak for the city of 3.4 million known for its vibrant arts , academic and cultural life , one in which the tourism and building sectors are growing .
that is because the city is burdened by massive debt and interest payments of 2.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.1 billion -rrb- annually .
the city has a very small industrial base and little hope of expanding it .
the unemployment rate is the third highest of any of germany 's 16 states , at 17 percent .
most of the problems date back to the end of world war ii when most large companies moved their headquarters to west germany - for example , siemens moved to munich and the banking industry fled to frankfurt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bode museum was just the latest new offering after german reunification in 1990 , east german industry collapsed when state subsidies were cut .
also , berlin failed to stop spending at a rate it was used to , especially when federal payments were slashed in 1995 from almost 8 million euros to 2 million euros .
as a result , since 1991 , berlin 's debt has risen nearly six-fold , from 10 billion to 61 billion euros , giving it the highest per capita debt level of any state in germany .
the city has lost about 100,000 industrial jobs since 1990 .
" in 15 years , we are going to be showing people from china around and hoping for a euro in tip , " said one economic expert .
" wealth is going south and i am not optimistic about berlin 's situation . "
tougher measures needed the judges said that poor political decision-making led to berlin 's financial situation , something that " federal aid is n't there to remedy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin : all that glitters is not gold they wrote that berlin needs to increase the local commercial tax rate and sell more of its assets , such as the state 's 270,000 housing units estimated to be worth about 4 billion euros and the landesbank berlin holding ag , worth 5 billion euros .
reducing wages for its civil servants is another area in need of attention - berlin employees are paid 50 percent more than those in hamburg , for example .
another issue is cutting subsidies that fund redundancies such as the city 's three operas , two zoos and six housing authorities , something that arose because berlin was divided . " to reconcile the two cities , well that was a tough thing , " said schmidt .
" but it took too long and no one had the guts cut into the meat . "
only way out schmidt says , however , that even so , berlin is in a tough predicament because even if it sold off a lot of its assets , it would n't cover the debt .
he praises berlin 's finance minister , theo sarrazin , for taking some harsh measures such as cutting subsides and 70,000 jobs and has managed to balance the budget for the first time - berlin has cut spending by about 11 percent since 1995 , the biggest savings made by any state .
the only way out is to focus on berlin 's advantages , its human capital and vibrant cultural life , experts say .
" i can not image that most industries and sectors that have left berlin will return , " said dieter vesper , an economist with the german institute for economic research .
" so the only choice berlin has is to try to develop sectors which are important in the future such as the health industry and the research and education sector , both areas which berlin already has an advantage .
but the only way to do this is to develop better links between these sectors and the business community . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin and wowereit say berlin needs the help another area to watch is if the federal government moves more of its people to berlin as many expect it to do - currently almost half of all government employees work outside the capital .
schmidt said he thinks that berlin will cease to be an independent state in 15 years and instead will merge with brandenburg , the state that surrounds it .
" that would help stop the rivalry and help lure investors , " he said .
" it would also trim administrative budgets , help universities to work more collaboratively .
there is no quick fix for berlin but there is no reason why the city ca n't survive with all it offers .

germany 's highest court ruled thursday that berlin is not getting a helping hand from the federal government to put its financial house in order .
what does that mean for the capital ? it seems as if every week , there is a new expensive museum or monument or refurbished relic opening in germany 's capital .
amid such lavish spending , it might appear odd to hear berlin officials complaining over a mountain of debt , even taking the federal government to court for more money .
berlin officials have long argued they are entitled to federal help with at least 60 percent of their 62-billion-euro -lrb- $ 77 billion -rrb- debt under a law that requires transfer payments between german states and the federal government in times of financial need .
after all , they have cut costs and sold off assets , they say .
and there is precedent - a 1992 court ruling forced the federal government to help bremen and saarland with their debt .
" we can not climb down from this debt mountain alone , " berlin mayor klaus wowereit told the german constitutional court in karlsruhe .
" we have done everything we can and now need federal solidarity .
berlin is a sexy but poor city . "
thursday , however , the court disagreed saying that berlin failed to qualify for emergency aid under the constitution rules .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal goverment is struggling to put the entire house in order " berlin adorns itself with the slogan ' poor but sexy ' but it is n't so poor , " said presiding judge winfried hassemer .
" berlin does n't have a budget emergency .
significant indicators point only to a budget that is under stress which berlin can in all probability overcome on its own . "
so what now ? christian schmidt of the berlin-based industrial investment council , an agency that promotes investment in the east , says he was surprised by the court decision and thinks people did n't expect it would be so harsh .
" ' poor but sexy ' obviously failed to impress the judges , " he said .
" berlin has even tougher times ahead . "
experts say things looks pretty bleak for the city of 3.4 million known for its vibrant arts , academic and cultural life , one in which the tourism and building sectors are growing .
that is because the city is burdened by massive debt and interest payments of 2.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.1 billion -rrb- annually .
the city has a very small industrial base and little hope of expanding it .
the unemployment rate is the third highest of any of germany 's 16 states , at 17 percent .
most of the problems date back to the end of world war ii when most large companies moved their headquarters to west germany - for example , siemens moved to munich and the banking industry fled to frankfurt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bode museum was just the latest new offering after german reunification in 1990 , east german industry collapsed when state subsidies were cut .
also , berlin failed to stop spending at a rate it was used to , especially when federal payments were slashed in 1995 from almost 8 million euros to 2 million euros .
as a result , since 1991 , berlin 's debt has risen nearly six-fold , from 10 billion to 61 billion euros , giving it the highest per capita debt level of any state in germany .
the city has lost about 100,000 industrial jobs since 1990 .
" in 15 years , we are going to be showing people from china around and hoping for a euro in tip , " said one economic expert .
" wealth is going south and i am not optimistic about berlin 's situation . "
tougher measures needed the judges said that poor political decision-making led to berlin 's financial situation , something that " federal aid is n't there to remedy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin : all that glitters is not gold they wrote that berlin needs to increase the local commercial tax rate and sell more of its assets , such as the state 's 270,000 housing units estimated to be worth about 4 billion euros and the landesbank berlin holding ag , worth 5 billion euros .
reducing wages for its civil servants is another area in need of attention - berlin employees are paid 50 percent more than those in hamburg , for example .
another issue is cutting subsidies that fund redundancies such as the city 's three operas , two zoos and six housing authorities , something that arose because berlin was divided . " to reconcile the two cities , well that was a tough thing , " said schmidt .
" but it took too long and no one had the guts cut into the meat . "
only way out schmidt says , however , that even so , berlin is in a tough predicament because even if it sold off a lot of its assets , it would n't cover the debt .
he praises berlin 's finance minister , theo sarrazin , for taking some harsh measures such as cutting subsides and 70,000 jobs and has managed to balance the budget for the first time - berlin has cut spending by about 11 percent since 1995 , the biggest savings made by any state .
the only way out is to focus on berlin 's advantages , its human capital and vibrant cultural life , experts say .
" i can not image that most industries and sectors that have left berlin will return , " said dieter vesper , an economist with the german institute for economic research .
" so the only choice berlin has is to try to develop sectors which are important in the future such as the health industry and the research and education sector , both areas which berlin already has an advantage .
but the only way to do this is to develop better links between these sectors and the business community . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin and wowereit say berlin needs the help another area to watch is if the federal government moves more of its people to berlin as many expect it to do - currently almost half of all government employees work outside the capital .
schmidt said he thinks that berlin will cease to be an independent state in 15 years and instead will merge with brandenburg , the state that surrounds it .
" that would help stop the rivalry and help lure investors , " he said .
" it would also trim administrative budgets , help universities to work more collaboratively .
there is no quick fix for berlin but there is no reason why the city ca n't survive with all it offers .

tougher measures needed the judges said that poor political decision-making led to berlin 's financial situation , something that " federal aid is n't there to remedy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin : all that glitters is not gold they wrote that berlin needs to increase the local commercial tax rate and sell more of its assets , such as the state 's 270,000 housing units estimated to be worth about 4 billion euros and the landesbank berlin holding ag , worth 5 billion euros .
reducing wages for its civil servants is another area in need of attention - berlin employees are paid 50 percent more than those in hamburg , for example .
another issue is cutting subsidies that fund redundancies such as the city 's three operas , two zoos and six housing authorities , something that arose because berlin was divided . " to reconcile the two cities , well that was a tough thing , " said schmidt .
" but it took too long and no one had the guts cut into the meat . "
only way out schmidt says , however , that even so , berlin is in a tough predicament because even if it sold off a lot of its assets , it would n't cover the debt .
he praises berlin 's finance minister , theo sarrazin , for taking some harsh measures such as cutting subsides and 70,000 jobs and has managed to balance the budget for the first time - berlin has cut spending by about 11 percent since 1995 , the biggest savings made by any state .
the only way out is to focus on berlin 's advantages , its human capital and vibrant cultural life , experts say .
" i can not image that most industries and sectors that have left berlin will return , " said dieter vesper , an economist with the german institute for economic research .
" so the only choice berlin has is to try to develop sectors which are important in the future such as the health industry and the research and education sector , both areas which berlin already has an advantage .
but the only way to do this is to develop better links between these sectors and the business community . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin and wowereit say berlin needs the help another area to watch is if the federal government moves more of its people to berlin as many expect it to do - currently almost half of all government employees work outside the capital .
schmidt said he thinks that berlin will cease to be an independent state in 15 years and instead will merge with brandenburg , the state that surrounds it .
" that would help stop the rivalry and help lure investors , " he said .
" it would also trim administrative budgets , help universities to work more collaboratively .

most of the people who were killed died during a second strike , which occurred a few minutes after the first one , while trying to aid the victims of the previous attack . although no german planes took part in the raid , the plaintiffs are seeking 536,000 euros -lrb- $ 675,000 -rrb- in damages from the german government . they claim german troops serving with nato helped select the target and germany therefore shared responsibility for the nato action . two lower courts had previously rejected claims for compensation . a legitimate target ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's federal court of justice in karlsruhe three of the 35 plaintiffs appeared before germany 's federal court of justice to present their case on thursday . lawyers for the german government called the attack a " tragedy , " but said they could not see why damages should be paid because the bridge was a military target . nato has defended the bombing and said the bridge was a " legitimate " target that served as infrastructure for the serbian army fighting in kosovo . varvarin mayor zoran milenkovic , who lost his daughter sanja in the air strike , said before the hearing that " the town was not defended and could not defend itself against a nato strike .

germany 's highest court ruled thursday that berlin is not getting a helping hand from the federal government to put its financial house in order .
what does that mean for the capital ? it seems as if every week , there is a new expensive museum or monument or refurbished relic opening in germany 's capital .
amid such lavish spending , it might appear odd to hear berlin officials complaining over a mountain of debt , even taking the federal government to court for more money .
berlin officials have long argued they are entitled to federal help with at least 60 percent of their 62-billion-euro -lrb- $ 77 billion -rrb- debt under a law that requires transfer payments between german states and the federal government in times of financial need .
after all , they have cut costs and sold off assets , they say .
and there is precedent - a 1992 court ruling forced the federal government to help bremen and saarland with their debt .
" we can not climb down from this debt mountain alone , " berlin mayor klaus wowereit told the german constitutional court in karlsruhe .
" we have done everything we can and now need federal solidarity .
berlin is a sexy but poor city . "
thursday , however , the court disagreed saying that berlin failed to qualify for emergency aid under the constitution rules .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal goverment is struggling to put the entire house in order " berlin adorns itself with the slogan ' poor but sexy ' but it is n't so poor , " said presiding judge winfried hassemer .
" berlin does n't have a budget emergency .
significant indicators point only to a budget that is under stress which berlin can in all probability overcome on its own . "
so what now ? christian schmidt of the berlin-based industrial investment council , an agency that promotes investment in the east , says he was surprised by the court decision and thinks people did n't expect it would be so harsh .
" ' poor but sexy ' obviously failed to impress the judges , " he said .
" berlin has even tougher times ahead . "
experts say things looks pretty bleak for the city of 3.4 million known for its vibrant arts , academic and cultural life , one in which the tourism and building sectors are growing .
that is because the city is burdened by massive debt and interest payments of 2.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.1 billion -rrb- annually .
the city has a very small industrial base and little hope of expanding it .
the unemployment rate is the third highest of any of germany 's 16 states , at 17 percent .
most of the problems date back to the end of world war ii when most large companies moved their headquarters to west germany - for example , siemens moved to munich and the banking industry fled to frankfurt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bode museum was just the latest new offering after german reunification in 1990 , east german industry collapsed when state subsidies were cut .
also , berlin failed to stop spending at a rate it was used to , especially when federal payments were slashed in 1995 from almost 8 million euros to 2 million euros .
as a result , since 1991 , berlin 's debt has risen nearly six-fold , from 10 billion to 61 billion euros , giving it the highest per capita debt level of any state in germany .
the city has lost about 100,000 industrial jobs since 1990 .
" in 15 years , we are going to be showing people from china around and hoping for a euro in tip , " said one economic expert .
" wealth is going south and i am not optimistic about berlin 's situation . "
tougher measures needed the judges said that poor political decision-making led to berlin 's financial situation , something that " federal aid is n't there to remedy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin : all that glitters is not gold they wrote that berlin needs to increase the local commercial tax rate and sell more of its assets , such as the state 's 270,000 housing units estimated to be worth about 4 billion euros and the landesbank berlin holding ag , worth 5 billion euros .
reducing wages for its civil servants is another area in need of attention - berlin employees are paid 50 percent more than those in hamburg , for example .
another issue is cutting subsidies that fund redundancies such as the city 's three operas , two zoos and six housing authorities , something that arose because berlin was divided . " to reconcile the two cities , well that was a tough thing , " said schmidt .
" but it took too long and no one had the guts cut into the meat . "
only way out schmidt says , however , that even so , berlin is in a tough predicament because even if it sold off a lot of its assets , it would n't cover the debt .
he praises berlin 's finance minister , theo sarrazin , for taking some harsh measures such as cutting subsides and 70,000 jobs and has managed to balance the budget for the first time - berlin has cut spending by about 11 percent since 1995 , the biggest savings made by any state .
the only way out is to focus on berlin 's advantages , its human capital and vibrant cultural life , experts say .
" i can not image that most industries and sectors that have left berlin will return , " said dieter vesper , an economist with the german institute for economic research .
" so the only choice berlin has is to try to develop sectors which are important in the future such as the health industry and the research and education sector , both areas which berlin already has an advantage .
but the only way to do this is to develop better links between these sectors and the business community . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin and wowereit say berlin needs the help another area to watch is if the federal government moves more of its people to berlin as many expect it to do - currently almost half of all government employees work outside the capital .
schmidt said he thinks that berlin will cease to be an independent state in 15 years and instead will merge with brandenburg , the state that surrounds it .
" that would help stop the rivalry and help lure investors , " he said .
" it would also trim administrative budgets , help universities to work more collaboratively .

" it is highly probable that berlin can sort out its budget difficulties itself , " said winfried hassemer , vice-president of the court . government duty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin is the seat of germany 's federal government and parliament legally , the government is obliged to bail out a cash-strapped state so long as it has made the requisite budget savings and undertaken sufficient austerity measures .
states that have been on the receiving end of government aid include bremen and the saarland in 1992 . but in the 1990s , it was that the capital which bore the brunt of reunification 's cost . public spending was scaled back as unemployment soared , with some 100,000 industrial jobs lost over the last 16 years .
cultural spending has seen massive cuts and civil servant salaries have been reduced .
but major business investments have have been few . according to the city authorities , berlin is not to blame for its spiraling debt .
they argue that the government slashed its post-reunification aid too soon - before the city had time to stabilize . resentment in the south bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber but the government as well as a number of other states argued that berlin did not meet the criteria for aid , and that with seven of germany 's 16 states are currently in debt , it is not the only one in financial dire straits . other states , including bavaria and baden-württemberg , point out that berlin has consistently overspent and failed to privatize state holdings . " berlin could have done far more to tighten its belt , " said baden-württemberg 's finance minister gerhard stratthaus -lrb- cdu -rrb- in an interview with weekly magazine der spiegel . bavarian state premier edmund stoiber , meanwhile , has insisted that " solidarity has its limits . " major cuts ahead the ruling will raise pressure on the capital to sell assets and cut spending in a city which has three opera companies , two zoos and what other regional states claim is a cultural scene way beyond its financial means .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 19.10.2006 german schools search for solutions to absentee teachers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without a teacher , he probably wo n't get far berlin 's christian democrats have drawn attention to a problem that disrupts learning in the city 's schools and could contribute to germany 's comparatively low educational standards . the problem , which is by no means endemic to berlin , is the number of classes which have to be cut every year due to a simple lack of staff .
principals up and down the country are practiced in the chaotic art of last-minute reorganization of timetables and redistribution of their teachers in order to provide as much education as they possibly can .
but for all their efforts , it remains the case that each week children across germany are granted extra playtime , because there simply are n't enough teachers around to teach them .
for the most part , the teachers are absent as a result of little more than minor ailments , and though the consequences might seem significant to an average nine-year old , parents , unions and political opponents would beg to differ .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : packing up time - the joys of sick teachers according to official figures , which vary from one state to another , an average of between 2 and 3 percent of all school classes fall by the wayside annually .
but that is by no means the whole picture .
last year , teachers in berlin were absent for a total of 10.1 percent of scheduled classes , and although three-quarters were spared cancellation by having other staff fill in , the replacements were not always teachers .
too many timetable irregularities katrin schulze-bernt , the berlin christian democrats ' education spokeswoman , said she was concerned that , as things stand , children are not getting their full quota of prescribed learning .
" every 10th hour is not taught by the regular teacher , and i 'm concerned that the replacements used are not always professionals , but are sometimes just after-school carers who can not actually teach . "
indeed primary schools in berlin do regularly have to fall back on the help of after-school carers to keep the children entertained throughout the course of the school day .
high schools students , meanwhile , must be prepared to accept whichever teacher and subject their moveable timetables serve up .
neither scenario is ideal , and both lead to unwanted disruptions for which there appears to be no quick-fix cure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education , school , learning !
across the board , the problem is a combination of job-for-life contracts , teacher burnout syndrome , strapped-for-cash local authorities , and no established culture of working with substitute teachers .
and it 's likely to get worse before it gets better , according to jens stiller , a spokesman for berlin 's department of education .
" three percent of our teachers are on long-term sick leave , " he said .
" and since the average age of our workforce is 49 , we are dealing with a lot of staff sickness .
what we need here is a greater balance between old and young teachers . "
testing new waters given that no such balance can be injected into the existing system , the educational powers that be have launched a trial scheme whereby a number of schools budget for their own needs .
" each school is allocated a certain budget from which they can employ substitute teachers as required , " stiller said .
" they use retired teachers , those on maternity leave or those in the final stages of their teacher training . "
it 's a novel scheme , which stiller said was working well , but it remains to be seen how well it would fare were it expanded to schools across the city .
" there are only so many trained teachers out there available to work as substitute staff , and they might be too few to go around , " he pointed out .
" guaranteed teaching " earlier this year , the state of hesse launched an initiative to tackle that very problem .
under its " guaranteed-teaching " scheme , it has created pools of substitute staff - only in this instance , teaching qualifications and experience are not a prerequisite .
nonetheless , christian boergen of hesse 's department of education said it was an improvement over the days when cut classes were a run-of-the-mill occurrence .
" it 's good for teachers to know someone will cover for them when they are sick , and for parents to know their children wo n't be walking the streets because a class has been cancelled , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hesse advertises for substitutes the project has been widely criticized for its randomness - not least by the regional teaching union , gew hesse .
hartwig schröder , the head of the union 's legal department , is horrified by the department of education 's willingness to use retired teachers , students and housewives to take over at the blackboard .
" the majority of those employed as part of the guaranteed-teaching project do not have the qualifications which used to be required to be able to teach , " he said .
" it is a slap in the face for the profession . "
unlike the test project in berlin , guaranteed teaching has not been restricted to a handful of schools , but has already been put into practice across the state .
schröder said it would ultimately do more harm than good .
" what we need is simple : more teachers , smaller class sizes , less stress and , consequently , a greater sense of satisfaction among the teachers .
and what we do n't need is this kind of patchwork solution . tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin school wants to profit from education phorms , a new private school in berlin , opened its doors in august .

barcelona lost 1-0 to chelsea on wednesday . " we are in the mix now and have a chance to get through to the next phase , " said german international miroslav klose .
" we have sofia away and then chelsea at home .
chelsea are a great team but if we play like we did against barcelona we are capable of beating them . " without midfield duo tim borowski and frank baumann through injury , bremen lacked drive from midfield , but german international defender christian schulz had their first chance with his 24th minute effort whistling wide of the right hand post . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's diego , center , is attacked by sofia 's hristo yovov during the group a champions league match sofia , who had lost their first two matches against barcelona and chelsea , looked set to make it to the half-time break at 0-0 but paid the price for a terrible defensive wall .
naldo drilled a 25 yard free-kick straight through the collapsing wall and the unsighted sofia goalkeeper had no chance with the ball going in off the inside of the post . brazilian playmaker diego , a summer signing from fc porto , made a second goal on 74 minutes , and bremen took the spoils . bremen 's next european match is away to sofia on oct .
31 .
however , they have a big domestic game saturday when they face reigning bundesliga champions bayern munich . schweinsteiger turns hero meanwhile , bayern munich 's dismissed midfielder bastian schweinsteiger turned from hero to villain on wednesday , when he scored the solo goal in their own champions league match against sporting lisbon . schweinsteiger 's 19th minute screamer means the germans are almost certain to qualify from group b , following this third consecutive victory , barring a dramatic loss of form by felix magath 's men . bavarian defender daniel van buyten said afterwards : " we really kept battling in the second half although we were down to 10 men .
all the players fought hard and showed good team spirit and we managed to keep possession of the ball and have scoring chances of our own . " schweinsteiger first made his mark with the goal , following organized buildup play by bayern .
his 30-meter shot rifled past well-beaten sporting keeper ricardo for his second goal of the tournament and bayern 's seventh , with none conceded . six minutes later schweinsteiger earned a yellow card , following a challenge on nani , which paved the way for his exit for a second booking two minutes after the break for a trip on second-half substitute yannick djalo . schweinsteiger will now miss bayern 's fourth match at home to sporting in a fortnight where a point for the germans would suffice to progress . dw staff / dpa / afp -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de does the bundesliga have a world cup hangover ?

" we have sofia away and then chelsea at home .
chelsea are a great team but if we play like we did against barcelona we are capable of beating them .

all the players fought hard and showed good team spirit and we managed to keep possession of the ball and have scoring chances of our own . " schweinsteiger first made his mark with the goal , following organized buildup play by bayern .
his 30-meter shot rifled past well-beaten sporting keeper ricardo for his second goal of the tournament and bayern 's seventh , with none conceded . six minutes later schweinsteiger earned a yellow card , following a challenge on nani , which paved the way for his exit for a second booking two minutes after the break for a trip on second-half substitute yannick djalo . schweinsteiger will now miss bayern 's fourth match at home to sporting in a fortnight where a point for the germans would suffice to progress . dw staff / dpa / afp -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de does the bundesliga have a world cup hangover ?

a norwegian student on a field trip to berlin though he had made the deal of his life - until he got arrested buying deodorant . what some people call growing up is really no more than an endless series of gaffes , blunders and embarrassing missteps .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 19.10.2006 eu seeks open postal markets by 2009 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german letter carriers often cover their routes by bike - luckily this time without rain , snow , sleet or hail the european commission laid out plans to complete the opening of the european union 's postal-services market to competition by 2009 despite fierce opposition from some countries . on wednesday , eu internal market commissioner charlie mccreevy , who is behind the plan , wants to build on the perceived success of britain , finland , germany , the netherlands and sweden , which have already opened their postal markets to competition . " i firmly believe that completing the internal market for postal services is vital for securing further improvements and for sustaining the progress and results achieved to date , " he said . " in preparing the proposal , we have put consumer and user needs first , " he added . " universal delivery " in danger ? german national postal system deutsche post , which is already slated to give up its monopoly in 2008 , and the german government welcomed the commissioner 's plan . on the contrary , consumer protection advocates said they were concerned about the fate of universal mail delivery in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the digital age has not made postal services obsolete - quite the contrary patrick von braunmühl of the federation of german consumer organizations said it was still unclear how the postal service could make good on a promise of universal mail delivery without the support of the state . in contrast to the effect of liberalized telecoms markets , he said , consumers can not expect significantly lower postage prices .
at most , bulk clients could expect rebates , but normal customers will see little , if any , benefit .
it could even be the case that business clients get price cuts at the expense of individual users . but eu commissioner mccreevy tried to assuage these fears , saying the postal system will continue to deliver the mail universally after liberalization .
deutsche post and other ex-monopolies in the eu are required to " deliver and pick up letters and packages at least five times a week , at good quality and competitive prices , " he reiterated . not just packages " when the market opens completely in 2009 , we can expect more innovation , better service , and higher cost efficiency , " mccreevy said .
he said this was the case for postal services in great britain , sweden and finland , which already made the switch . the current plan follows earlier waves of postal liberalization : in 1997 and 2002 .
at that time , the markets for the delivery of packages and letters weighing more than 50 grams were opened to competition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissoner charlie mccreevy wants an level playing field in europe now , mccreevy aims to break state monopolies for the delivery of letters weighing less than 50 grams by 2009 while guaranteeing mail services throughout each country . " without -lrb- liberalization -rrb- , eu postal markets will be increasingly unable to meet the challenges of the communications revolution , " the irish commissioner said . the proposal to fully liberalize the postal market will need the backing of member state governments and the european parliament to go into effect .
past efforts to liberalize the postal market have met fierce opposition in some countries , and this time is likely to be no different . states complain last week 10 national postal services voiced concern about how , under the reform , they would be allowed to cover the considerable cost of meeting universal delivery obligations without the backing of the state . the belgian , cypriot , french , greek , hungarian , italian , luxembourg , maltese , polish and spanish postal services said in a joint statement there was " no proof of the efficiency of the measures planned by the commission " to finance the obligation . in response to such concerns , the commission proposed a range of funding options as well as the possibility of dividing the responsibility to provide full geographic coverage among different postal services . " growing industry " " i 'm well aware that there will be considerable lobbying on all sides but it 's hardly fair to have some very large markets opened up to competition and other markets that are not , " mccreevy said . he added : " this industry is not a dying industry , it 's a growing one , it 's a very dynamic one and it 's a very profitable for those who operate it efficiently .

" universal delivery " in danger ? german national postal system deutsche post , which is already slated to give up its monopoly in 2008 , and the german government welcomed the commissioner 's plan . on the contrary , consumer protection advocates said they were concerned about the fate of universal mail delivery in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the digital age has not made postal services obsolete - quite the contrary patrick von braunmühl of the federation of german consumer organizations said it was still unclear how the postal service could make good on a promise of universal mail delivery without the support of the state . in contrast to the effect of liberalized telecoms markets , he said , consumers can not expect significantly lower postage prices .
at most , bulk clients could expect rebates , but normal customers will see little , if any , benefit .
it could even be the case that business clients get price cuts at the expense of individual users . but eu commissioner mccreevy tried to assuage these fears , saying the postal system will continue to deliver the mail universally after liberalization .
deutsche post and other ex-monopolies in the eu are required to " deliver and pick up letters and packages at least five times a week , at good quality and competitive prices , " he reiterated . not just packages " when the market opens completely in 2009 , we can expect more innovation , better service , and higher cost efficiency , " mccreevy said .
he said this was the case for postal services in great britain , sweden and finland , which already made the switch . the current plan follows earlier waves of postal liberalization : in 1997 and 2002 .

" without -lrb- liberalization -rrb- , eu postal markets will be increasingly unable to meet the challenges of the communications revolution , " the irish commissioner said . the proposal to fully liberalize the postal market will need the backing of member state governments and the european parliament to go into effect .
past efforts to liberalize the postal market have met fierce opposition in some countries , and this time is likely to be no different . states complain last week 10 national postal services voiced concern about how , under the reform , they would be allowed to cover the considerable cost of meeting universal delivery obligations without the backing of the state . the belgian , cypriot , french , greek , hungarian , italian , luxembourg , maltese , polish and spanish postal services said in a joint statement there was " no proof of the efficiency of the measures planned by the commission " to finance the obligation . in response to such concerns , the commission proposed a range of funding options as well as the possibility of dividing the responsibility to provide full geographic coverage among different postal services . " growing industry " " i 'm well aware that there will be considerable lobbying on all sides but it 's hardly fair to have some very large markets opened up to competition and other markets that are not , " mccreevy said . he added : " this industry is not a dying industry , it 's a growing one , it 's a very dynamic one and it 's a very profitable for those who operate it efficiently .

" universal delivery " in danger ? german national postal system deutsche post , which is already slated to give up its monopoly in 2008 , and the german government welcomed the commissioner 's plan . on the contrary , consumer protection advocates said they were concerned about the fate of universal mail delivery in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the digital age has not made postal services obsolete - quite the contrary patrick von braunmühl of the federation of german consumer organizations said it was still unclear how the postal service could make good on a promise of universal mail delivery without the support of the state . in contrast to the effect of liberalized telecoms markets , he said , consumers can not expect significantly lower postage prices .
at most , bulk clients could expect rebates , but normal customers will see little , if any , benefit .
it could even be the case that business clients get price cuts at the expense of individual users . but eu commissioner mccreevy tried to assuage these fears , saying the postal system will continue to deliver the mail universally after liberalization .
deutsche post and other ex-monopolies in the eu are required to " deliver and pick up letters and packages at least five times a week , at good quality and competitive prices , " he reiterated . not just packages " when the market opens completely in 2009 , we can expect more innovation , better service , and higher cost efficiency , " mccreevy said .
he said this was the case for postal services in great britain , sweden and finland , which already made the switch . the current plan follows earlier waves of postal liberalization : in 1997 and 2002 .
at that time , the markets for the delivery of packages and letters weighing more than 50 grams were opened to competition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissoner charlie mccreevy wants an level playing field in europe now , mccreevy aims to break state monopolies for the delivery of letters weighing less than 50 grams by 2009 while guaranteeing mail services throughout each country . " without -lrb- liberalization -rrb- , eu postal markets will be increasingly unable to meet the challenges of the communications revolution , " the irish commissioner said . the proposal to fully liberalize the postal market will need the backing of member state governments and the european parliament to go into effect .
past efforts to liberalize the postal market have met fierce opposition in some countries , and this time is likely to be no different . states complain last week 10 national postal services voiced concern about how , under the reform , they would be allowed to cover the considerable cost of meeting universal delivery obligations without the backing of the state . the belgian , cypriot , french , greek , hungarian , italian , luxembourg , maltese , polish and spanish postal services said in a joint statement there was " no proof of the efficiency of the measures planned by the commission " to finance the obligation . in response to such concerns , the commission proposed a range of funding options as well as the possibility of dividing the responsibility to provide full geographic coverage among different postal services . " growing industry " " i 'm well aware that there will be considerable lobbying on all sides but it 's hardly fair to have some very large markets opened up to competition and other markets that are not , " mccreevy said . he added : " this industry is not a dying industry , it 's a growing one , it 's a very dynamic one and it 's a very profitable for those who operate it efficiently .
and that 's why operators want to get into it .

germany 's highest court ruled thursday that berlin is not getting a helping hand from the federal government to put its financial house in order .
what does that mean for the capital ? it seems as if every week , there is a new expensive museum or monument or refurbished relic opening in germany 's capital .
amid such lavish spending , it might appear odd to hear berlin officials complaining over a mountain of debt , even taking the federal government to court for more money .
berlin officials have long argued they are entitled to federal help with at least 60 percent of their 62-billion-euro -lrb- $ 77 billion -rrb- debt under a law that requires transfer payments between german states and the federal government in times of financial need .
after all , they have cut costs and sold off assets , they say .
and there is precedent - a 1992 court ruling forced the federal government to help bremen and saarland with their debt .
" we can not climb down from this debt mountain alone , " berlin mayor klaus wowereit told the german constitutional court in karlsruhe .
" we have done everything we can and now need federal solidarity .
berlin is a sexy but poor city . "
thursday , however , the court disagreed saying that berlin failed to qualify for emergency aid under the constitution rules .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal goverment is struggling to put the entire house in order " berlin adorns itself with the slogan ' poor but sexy ' but it is n't so poor , " said presiding judge winfried hassemer .
" berlin does n't have a budget emergency .
significant indicators point only to a budget that is under stress which berlin can in all probability overcome on its own . "
so what now ? christian schmidt of the berlin-based industrial investment council , an agency that promotes investment in the east , says he was surprised by the court decision and thinks people did n't expect it would be so harsh .
" ' poor but sexy ' obviously failed to impress the judges , " he said .
" berlin has even tougher times ahead . "
experts say things looks pretty bleak for the city of 3.4 million known for its vibrant arts , academic and cultural life , one in which the tourism and building sectors are growing .
that is because the city is burdened by massive debt and interest payments of 2.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.1 billion -rrb- annually .
the city has a very small industrial base and little hope of expanding it .
the unemployment rate is the third highest of any of germany 's 16 states , at 17 percent .
most of the problems date back to the end of world war ii when most large companies moved their headquarters to west germany - for example , siemens moved to munich and the banking industry fled to frankfurt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bode museum was just the latest new offering after german reunification in 1990 , east german industry collapsed when state subsidies were cut .
also , berlin failed to stop spending at a rate it was used to , especially when federal payments were slashed in 1995 from almost 8 million euros to 2 million euros .
as a result , since 1991 , berlin 's debt has risen nearly six-fold , from 10 billion to 61 billion euros , giving it the highest per capita debt level of any state in germany .
the city has lost about 100,000 industrial jobs since 1990 .
" in 15 years , we are going to be showing people from china around and hoping for a euro in tip , " said one economic expert .
" wealth is going south and i am not optimistic about berlin 's situation . "
tougher measures needed the judges said that poor political decision-making led to berlin 's financial situation , something that " federal aid is n't there to remedy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin : all that glitters is not gold they wrote that berlin needs to increase the local commercial tax rate and sell more of its assets , such as the state 's 270,000 housing units estimated to be worth about 4 billion euros and the landesbank berlin holding ag , worth 5 billion euros .
reducing wages for its civil servants is another area in need of attention - berlin employees are paid 50 percent more than those in hamburg , for example .
another issue is cutting subsidies that fund redundancies such as the city 's three operas , two zoos and six housing authorities , something that arose because berlin was divided . " to reconcile the two cities , well that was a tough thing , " said schmidt .
" but it took too long and no one had the guts cut into the meat . "
only way out schmidt says , however , that even so , berlin is in a tough predicament because even if it sold off a lot of its assets , it would n't cover the debt .
he praises berlin 's finance minister , theo sarrazin , for taking some harsh measures such as cutting subsides and 70,000 jobs and has managed to balance the budget for the first time - berlin has cut spending by about 11 percent since 1995 , the biggest savings made by any state .
the only way out is to focus on berlin 's advantages , its human capital and vibrant cultural life , experts say .
" i can not image that most industries and sectors that have left berlin will return , " said dieter vesper , an economist with the german institute for economic research .
" so the only choice berlin has is to try to develop sectors which are important in the future such as the health industry and the research and education sector , both areas which berlin already has an advantage .
but the only way to do this is to develop better links between these sectors and the business community . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin and wowereit say berlin needs the help another area to watch is if the federal government moves more of its people to berlin as many expect it to do - currently almost half of all government employees work outside the capital .
schmidt said he thinks that berlin will cease to be an independent state in 15 years and instead will merge with brandenburg , the state that surrounds it .
" that would help stop the rivalry and help lure investors , " he said .
" it would also trim administrative budgets , help universities to work more collaboratively .
there is no quick fix for berlin but there is no reason why the city ca n't survive with all it offers .

germany 's highest court ruled thursday that berlin is not getting a helping hand from the federal government to put its financial house in order .
what does that mean for the capital ? it seems as if every week , there is a new expensive museum or monument or refurbished relic opening in germany 's capital .
amid such lavish spending , it might appear odd to hear berlin officials complaining over a mountain of debt , even taking the federal government to court for more money .
berlin officials have long argued they are entitled to federal help with at least 60 percent of their 62-billion-euro -lrb- $ 77 billion -rrb- debt under a law that requires transfer payments between german states and the federal government in times of financial need .
after all , they have cut costs and sold off assets , they say .
and there is precedent - a 1992 court ruling forced the federal government to help bremen and saarland with their debt .
" we can not climb down from this debt mountain alone , " berlin mayor klaus wowereit told the german constitutional court in karlsruhe .
" we have done everything we can and now need federal solidarity .
berlin is a sexy but poor city . "
thursday , however , the court disagreed saying that berlin failed to qualify for emergency aid under the constitution rules .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal goverment is struggling to put the entire house in order " berlin adorns itself with the slogan ' poor but sexy ' but it is n't so poor , " said presiding judge winfried hassemer .
" berlin does n't have a budget emergency .
significant indicators point only to a budget that is under stress which berlin can in all probability overcome on its own . "
so what now ? christian schmidt of the berlin-based industrial investment council , an agency that promotes investment in the east , says he was surprised by the court decision and thinks people did n't expect it would be so harsh .
" ' poor but sexy ' obviously failed to impress the judges , " he said .
" berlin has even tougher times ahead . "
experts say things looks pretty bleak for the city of 3.4 million known for its vibrant arts , academic and cultural life , one in which the tourism and building sectors are growing .
that is because the city is burdened by massive debt and interest payments of 2.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.1 billion -rrb- annually .
the city has a very small industrial base and little hope of expanding it .
the unemployment rate is the third highest of any of germany 's 16 states , at 17 percent .
most of the problems date back to the end of world war ii when most large companies moved their headquarters to west germany - for example , siemens moved to munich and the banking industry fled to frankfurt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bode museum was just the latest new offering after german reunification in 1990 , east german industry collapsed when state subsidies were cut .
also , berlin failed to stop spending at a rate it was used to , especially when federal payments were slashed in 1995 from almost 8 million euros to 2 million euros .
as a result , since 1991 , berlin 's debt has risen nearly six-fold , from 10 billion to 61 billion euros , giving it the highest per capita debt level of any state in germany .
the city has lost about 100,000 industrial jobs since 1990 .
" in 15 years , we are going to be showing people from china around and hoping for a euro in tip , " said one economic expert .
" wealth is going south and i am not optimistic about berlin 's situation . "
tougher measures needed the judges said that poor political decision-making led to berlin 's financial situation , something that " federal aid is n't there to remedy . "

germany 's highest court ruled thursday that berlin is not getting a helping hand from the federal government to put its financial house in order .
what does that mean for the capital ? it seems as if every week , there is a new expensive museum or monument or refurbished relic opening in germany 's capital .
amid such lavish spending , it might appear odd to hear berlin officials complaining over a mountain of debt , even taking the federal government to court for more money .
berlin officials have long argued they are entitled to federal help with at least 60 percent of their 62-billion-euro -lrb- $ 77 billion -rrb- debt under a law that requires transfer payments between german states and the federal government in times of financial need .
after all , they have cut costs and sold off assets , they say .
and there is precedent - a 1992 court ruling forced the federal government to help bremen and saarland with their debt .
" we can not climb down from this debt mountain alone , " berlin mayor klaus wowereit told the german constitutional court in karlsruhe .
" we have done everything we can and now need federal solidarity .
berlin is a sexy but poor city . "
thursday , however , the court disagreed saying that berlin failed to qualify for emergency aid under the constitution rules .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal goverment is struggling to put the entire house in order " berlin adorns itself with the slogan ' poor but sexy ' but it is n't so poor , " said presiding judge winfried hassemer .
" berlin does n't have a budget emergency .
significant indicators point only to a budget that is under stress which berlin can in all probability overcome on its own . "
so what now ? christian schmidt of the berlin-based industrial investment council , an agency that promotes investment in the east , says he was surprised by the court decision and thinks people did n't expect it would be so harsh .
" ' poor but sexy ' obviously failed to impress the judges , " he said .
" berlin has even tougher times ahead . "
experts say things looks pretty bleak for the city of 3.4 million known for its vibrant arts , academic and cultural life , one in which the tourism and building sectors are growing .
that is because the city is burdened by massive debt and interest payments of 2.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.1 billion -rrb- annually .
the city has a very small industrial base and little hope of expanding it .
the unemployment rate is the third highest of any of germany 's 16 states , at 17 percent .
most of the problems date back to the end of world war ii when most large companies moved their headquarters to west germany - for example , siemens moved to munich and the banking industry fled to frankfurt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bode museum was just the latest new offering after german reunification in 1990 , east german industry collapsed when state subsidies were cut .
also , berlin failed to stop spending at a rate it was used to , especially when federal payments were slashed in 1995 from almost 8 million euros to 2 million euros .
as a result , since 1991 , berlin 's debt has risen nearly six-fold , from 10 billion to 61 billion euros , giving it the highest per capita debt level of any state in germany .
the city has lost about 100,000 industrial jobs since 1990 .
" in 15 years , we are going to be showing people from china around and hoping for a euro in tip , " said one economic expert .
" wealth is going south and i am not optimistic about berlin 's situation . "
tougher measures needed the judges said that poor political decision-making led to berlin 's financial situation , something that " federal aid is n't there to remedy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin : all that glitters is not gold they wrote that berlin needs to increase the local commercial tax rate and sell more of its assets , such as the state 's 270,000 housing units estimated to be worth about 4 billion euros and the landesbank berlin holding ag , worth 5 billion euros .
reducing wages for its civil servants is another area in need of attention - berlin employees are paid 50 percent more than those in hamburg , for example .
another issue is cutting subsidies that fund redundancies such as the city 's three operas , two zoos and six housing authorities , something that arose because berlin was divided . " to reconcile the two cities , well that was a tough thing , " said schmidt .
" but it took too long and no one had the guts cut into the meat . "
only way out schmidt says , however , that even so , berlin is in a tough predicament because even if it sold off a lot of its assets , it would n't cover the debt .
he praises berlin 's finance minister , theo sarrazin , for taking some harsh measures such as cutting subsides and 70,000 jobs and has managed to balance the budget for the first time - berlin has cut spending by about 11 percent since 1995 , the biggest savings made by any state .
the only way out is to focus on berlin 's advantages , its human capital and vibrant cultural life , experts say .
" i can not image that most industries and sectors that have left berlin will return , " said dieter vesper , an economist with the german institute for economic research .
" so the only choice berlin has is to try to develop sectors which are important in the future such as the health industry and the research and education sector , both areas which berlin already has an advantage .
but the only way to do this is to develop better links between these sectors and the business community . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin and wowereit say berlin needs the help another area to watch is if the federal government moves more of its people to berlin as many expect it to do - currently almost half of all government employees work outside the capital .
schmidt said he thinks that berlin will cease to be an independent state in 15 years and instead will merge with brandenburg , the state that surrounds it .
" that would help stop the rivalry and help lure investors , " he said .
" it would also trim administrative budgets , help universities to work more collaboratively .
there is no quick fix for berlin but there is no reason why the city ca n't survive with all it offers .

" the upturn in the german economy has strengthened substantially this year , " the report said .
" while exports are continuing to expand strongly , the recovery is being increasingly carried by domestic demand . " the government 's plan to raise value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- by three percentage points to 19 percent from jan .
1 could , however , weigh on activity next year and lead to a marked slowdown in german growth . " never was vat increased so much in one go .
thus it is difficult to gauge to what extent fiscal policy will put the brakes on the economy , " the report said .
" the annual average rate of gdp growth depends largely on what purchases were brought forward this year as a result of the tax hike . " anticipatory effects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are spending as much as they can before the vat hike the institutes calculated that the anticipatory effects of the vat hike on consumer purchases this year would alone cut a quarter of a percentage point off next year 's growth . " only in the second half of 2007 will private consumption pick up modestly as employment rises .
for the year as a whole consumer spending is likely to stagnate . " another risk factor for the german economy next year could be a possible downturn in the real estate market in the us and in other major economies which " could lead to a stronger slowdown in the global economy , " the report said . in the meantime , the current stronger performance of the german economy is likely to have a positive effect on public finances in the euro zone 's economic powerhouse . shrinking deficit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is the largest economy in the euro zone germany 's public deficit was projected to amount to 2.4 percent of gdp this year and shrink further to just 1.4 percent next year . under eu budget rules , euro-zone countries are not allowed to run deficits in excess of 3.0 percent of gdp .
but germany , the main architect of the stability and growth pact , has been in breach of the three-percent rule every year since 2002 . the economic upturn was similarly expected to have a positive effect on the labor markets , with the institutes projecting a fall in the unemployment rate from 11.2 percent in 2005 to 10.4 percent in 2006 and 9.9 percent in 2007 . monetary policy turning to monetary policy , the institutes estimated that a further rise in euro-zone interest rates would be appropriate between now and the end of the year , but that the european central bank should then hold rates steady next year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government sees the planned vat increase as a necessary step " since december 2005 , the ecb has raised its benchmark interest rate to 3.25 percent , " the report said . " we share the ecb 's opinion that there are risks to price stability .
we therefore regard a further increase to 3.50 percent by the end of the year as appropriate , especially since the euro-zone economy will remain pointed upwards . " monetary conditions in the 12 countries that share the euro were likely to remain steady next year . the german vat hike would not have a lasting effect on headline inflation in the euro area , the institutes predicted . " the effects of the vat hike will be a one-off and will not in themselves be a reason to tighten monetary policy , " they said . in addition , economic growth was expected to slow next year .

barcelona lost 1-0 to chelsea on wednesday . " we are in the mix now and have a chance to get through to the next phase , " said german international miroslav klose .
" we have sofia away and then chelsea at home .
chelsea are a great team but if we play like we did against barcelona we are capable of beating them . " without midfield duo tim borowski and frank baumann through injury , bremen lacked drive from midfield , but german international defender christian schulz had their first chance with his 24th minute effort whistling wide of the right hand post . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's diego , center , is attacked by sofia 's hristo yovov during the group a champions league match sofia , who had lost their first two matches against barcelona and chelsea , looked set to make it to the half-time break at 0-0 but paid the price for a terrible defensive wall .
naldo drilled a 25 yard free-kick straight through the collapsing wall and the unsighted sofia goalkeeper had no chance with the ball going in off the inside of the post . brazilian playmaker diego , a summer signing from fc porto , made a second goal on 74 minutes , and bremen took the spoils . bremen 's next european match is away to sofia on oct .

principals up and down the country are practiced in the chaotic art of last-minute reorganization of timetables and redistribution of their teachers in order to provide as much education as they possibly can .
but for all their efforts , it remains the case that each week children across germany are granted extra playtime , because there simply are n't enough teachers around to teach them .
for the most part , the teachers are absent as a result of little more than minor ailments , and though the consequences might seem significant to an average nine-year old , parents , unions and political opponents would beg to differ .

last year , teachers in berlin were absent for a total of 10.1 percent of scheduled classes , and although three-quarters were spared cancellation by having other staff fill in , the replacements were not always teachers .

" every 10th hour is not taught by the regular teacher , and i 'm concerned that the replacements used are not always professionals , but are sometimes just after-school carers who can not actually teach . "

" three percent of our teachers are on long-term sick leave , " he said .

" each school is allocated a certain budget from which they can employ substitute teachers as required , " stiller said .
" they use retired teachers , those on maternity leave or those in the final stages of their teacher training . "
it 's a novel scheme , which stiller said was working well , but it remains to be seen how well it would fare were it expanded to schools across the city .
" there are only so many trained teachers out there available to work as substitute staff , and they might be too few to go around , " he pointed out .
" guaranteed teaching " earlier this year , the state of hesse launched an initiative to tackle that very problem .
under its " guaranteed-teaching " scheme , it has created pools of substitute staff - only in this instance , teaching qualifications and experience are not a prerequisite .
nonetheless , christian boergen of hesse 's department of education said it was an improvement over the days when cut classes were a run-of-the-mill occurrence .
" it 's good for teachers to know someone will cover for them when they are sick , and for parents to know their children wo n't be walking the streets because a class has been cancelled , " he said .

germany 's highest court ruled thursday that berlin is not getting a helping hand from the federal government to put its financial house in order .
what does that mean for the capital ? it seems as if every week , there is a new expensive museum or monument or refurbished relic opening in germany 's capital .
amid such lavish spending , it might appear odd to hear berlin officials complaining over a mountain of debt , even taking the federal government to court for more money .
berlin officials have long argued they are entitled to federal help with at least 60 percent of their 62-billion-euro -lrb- $ 77 billion -rrb- debt under a law that requires transfer payments between german states and the federal government in times of financial need .
after all , they have cut costs and sold off assets , they say .
and there is precedent - a 1992 court ruling forced the federal government to help bremen and saarland with their debt .
" we can not climb down from this debt mountain alone , " berlin mayor klaus wowereit told the german constitutional court in karlsruhe .
" we have done everything we can and now need federal solidarity .
berlin is a sexy but poor city . "
thursday , however , the court disagreed saying that berlin failed to qualify for emergency aid under the constitution rules .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal goverment is struggling to put the entire house in order " berlin adorns itself with the slogan ' poor but sexy ' but it is n't so poor , " said presiding judge winfried hassemer .
" berlin does n't have a budget emergency .
significant indicators point only to a budget that is under stress which berlin can in all probability overcome on its own . "
so what now ? christian schmidt of the berlin-based industrial investment council , an agency that promotes investment in the east , says he was surprised by the court decision and thinks people did n't expect it would be so harsh .
" ' poor but sexy ' obviously failed to impress the judges , " he said .
" berlin has even tougher times ahead . "
experts say things looks pretty bleak for the city of 3.4 million known for its vibrant arts , academic and cultural life , one in which the tourism and building sectors are growing .
that is because the city is burdened by massive debt and interest payments of 2.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.1 billion -rrb- annually .
the city has a very small industrial base and little hope of expanding it .
the unemployment rate is the third highest of any of germany 's 16 states , at 17 percent .
most of the problems date back to the end of world war ii when most large companies moved their headquarters to west germany - for example , siemens moved to munich and the banking industry fled to frankfurt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bode museum was just the latest new offering after german reunification in 1990 , east german industry collapsed when state subsidies were cut .
also , berlin failed to stop spending at a rate it was used to , especially when federal payments were slashed in 1995 from almost 8 million euros to 2 million euros .
as a result , since 1991 , berlin 's debt has risen nearly six-fold , from 10 billion to 61 billion euros , giving it the highest per capita debt level of any state in germany .
the city has lost about 100,000 industrial jobs since 1990 .
" in 15 years , we are going to be showing people from china around and hoping for a euro in tip , " said one economic expert .
" wealth is going south and i am not optimistic about berlin 's situation . "
tougher measures needed the judges said that poor political decision-making led to berlin 's financial situation , something that " federal aid is n't there to remedy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin : all that glitters is not gold they wrote that berlin needs to increase the local commercial tax rate and sell more of its assets , such as the state 's 270,000 housing units estimated to be worth about 4 billion euros and the landesbank berlin holding ag , worth 5 billion euros .
reducing wages for its civil servants is another area in need of attention - berlin employees are paid 50 percent more than those in hamburg , for example .
another issue is cutting subsidies that fund redundancies such as the city 's three operas , two zoos and six housing authorities , something that arose because berlin was divided . " to reconcile the two cities , well that was a tough thing , " said schmidt .
" but it took too long and no one had the guts cut into the meat . "
only way out schmidt says , however , that even so , berlin is in a tough predicament because even if it sold off a lot of its assets , it would n't cover the debt .
he praises berlin 's finance minister , theo sarrazin , for taking some harsh measures such as cutting subsides and 70,000 jobs and has managed to balance the budget for the first time - berlin has cut spending by about 11 percent since 1995 , the biggest savings made by any state .
the only way out is to focus on berlin 's advantages , its human capital and vibrant cultural life , experts say .
" i can not image that most industries and sectors that have left berlin will return , " said dieter vesper , an economist with the german institute for economic research .
" so the only choice berlin has is to try to develop sectors which are important in the future such as the health industry and the research and education sector , both areas which berlin already has an advantage .
but the only way to do this is to develop better links between these sectors and the business community . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin and wowereit say berlin needs the help another area to watch is if the federal government moves more of its people to berlin as many expect it to do - currently almost half of all government employees work outside the capital .
schmidt said he thinks that berlin will cease to be an independent state in 15 years and instead will merge with brandenburg , the state that surrounds it .
" that would help stop the rivalry and help lure investors , " he said .
" it would also trim administrative budgets , help universities to work more collaboratively .
there is no quick fix for berlin but there is no reason why the city ca n't survive with all it offers .

a norwegian student on a field trip to berlin though he had made the deal of his life - until he got arrested buying deodorant . what some people call growing up is really no more than an endless series of gaffes , blunders and embarrassing missteps .
possessed by the ultimate fear of being left out of the fun , overconfident and dysfunctionally competitive teenagers simply ca n't help getting into trouble . earlier this week , a 16-year-old norwegian student struck a conversation with a stranger on alexanderplatz , a large square in the heart of former east berlin dominated by communist-era architecture and vague attempts to hide it behind renovated facades . aside from the fact that the norwegian student should have known better than to talk to strangers in general , a little bit of curiosity for the cultural milieu of his surroundings would have opened his eyes to the fact that many people were leaving the square in tears . why do people usually cry on alexanderplatz ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's always something fun to do at alexanderplatz the matchbox mafia is one of the most lucrative sections of the international brotherhood of charlatans .
their brilliant idea of cheating people out of their money by making them play a guessing game with matchboxes and a 50-euro banknote never seems to fail to attract an army of gullible lost souls . berlin 's alexanderplatz practically serves as the matchbox swindlers ' headquarters . the young norwegian , however , was oblivious to this fact .
he was also - as he later admitted - a little tipsy .
but that 's what teenagers do on their field trips , after all .
getting to know a foreign country and culture is always more difficult when you 're completely sober . here 's the deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lesson number one should be : do not engage in money laundering the man who approached the inebriated norwegian student asked him if he wanted to change some money for him .
usually , when people ask for change , they need a few euros to buy cigarettes , a subway ticket or a drink .
this time , however , the sum in question was a little larger .
in fact , it was larger than life . the man agreed to pay 400 euros -lrb- $ 500 -rrb- to the mysterious stranger .
in return , he got a big , fat wad of 200 euro bills , totaling 20,400 euros -lrb- $ 25,577 -rrb- . what a great deal , he must have thought to himself , almost too good to be true ! the sad thing in life that most teenagers learn about as they grow older and more bitter is that those things which sound too good to be true generally are . it was n't me , really bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it may look like 200 euros , but it 's probably not worth the paper it 's printed on on the following day , the young man took one of his crisp 200 euro notes and went to buy some deodorant .
the sales person realized something was up with the young person whose source of money did n't seem as admirable as his desire to smell nice during his class trip .
she realized the money had been forged and informed the police . the young man - who has no previous criminal record in either germany or his home country - ended up in jail .
he said he did n't know the money had been forged , but thought , instead , that it had been laundered . of course .
that 's what 16 year olds these days are hoping for : to strike a sweet deal with the money-laundering mafia while on a field trip .

germany 's highest court ruled thursday that berlin is not getting a helping hand from the federal government to put its financial house in order .
what does that mean for the capital ? it seems as if every week , there is a new expensive museum or monument or refurbished relic opening in germany 's capital .
amid such lavish spending , it might appear odd to hear berlin officials complaining over a mountain of debt , even taking the federal government to court for more money .
berlin officials have long argued they are entitled to federal help with at least 60 percent of their 62-billion-euro -lrb- $ 77 billion -rrb- debt under a law that requires transfer payments between german states and the federal government in times of financial need .
after all , they have cut costs and sold off assets , they say .
and there is precedent - a 1992 court ruling forced the federal government to help bremen and saarland with their debt .
" we can not climb down from this debt mountain alone , " berlin mayor klaus wowereit told the german constitutional court in karlsruhe .
" we have done everything we can and now need federal solidarity .
berlin is a sexy but poor city . "
thursday , however , the court disagreed saying that berlin failed to qualify for emergency aid under the constitution rules .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal goverment is struggling to put the entire house in order " berlin adorns itself with the slogan ' poor but sexy ' but it is n't so poor , " said presiding judge winfried hassemer .
" berlin does n't have a budget emergency .
significant indicators point only to a budget that is under stress which berlin can in all probability overcome on its own . "
so what now ? christian schmidt of the berlin-based industrial investment council , an agency that promotes investment in the east , says he was surprised by the court decision and thinks people did n't expect it would be so harsh .
" ' poor but sexy ' obviously failed to impress the judges , " he said .
" berlin has even tougher times ahead . "
experts say things looks pretty bleak for the city of 3.4 million known for its vibrant arts , academic and cultural life , one in which the tourism and building sectors are growing .
that is because the city is burdened by massive debt and interest payments of 2.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.1 billion -rrb- annually .
the city has a very small industrial base and little hope of expanding it .
the unemployment rate is the third highest of any of germany 's 16 states , at 17 percent .
most of the problems date back to the end of world war ii when most large companies moved their headquarters to west germany - for example , siemens moved to munich and the banking industry fled to frankfurt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bode museum was just the latest new offering after german reunification in 1990 , east german industry collapsed when state subsidies were cut .
also , berlin failed to stop spending at a rate it was used to , especially when federal payments were slashed in 1995 from almost 8 million euros to 2 million euros .
as a result , since 1991 , berlin 's debt has risen nearly six-fold , from 10 billion to 61 billion euros , giving it the highest per capita debt level of any state in germany .
the city has lost about 100,000 industrial jobs since 1990 .
" in 15 years , we are going to be showing people from china around and hoping for a euro in tip , " said one economic expert .
" wealth is going south and i am not optimistic about berlin 's situation . "
tougher measures needed the judges said that poor political decision-making led to berlin 's financial situation , something that " federal aid is n't there to remedy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin : all that glitters is not gold they wrote that berlin needs to increase the local commercial tax rate and sell more of its assets , such as the state 's 270,000 housing units estimated to be worth about 4 billion euros and the landesbank berlin holding ag , worth 5 billion euros .
reducing wages for its civil servants is another area in need of attention - berlin employees are paid 50 percent more than those in hamburg , for example .
another issue is cutting subsidies that fund redundancies such as the city 's three operas , two zoos and six housing authorities , something that arose because berlin was divided . " to reconcile the two cities , well that was a tough thing , " said schmidt .
" but it took too long and no one had the guts cut into the meat . "
only way out schmidt says , however , that even so , berlin is in a tough predicament because even if it sold off a lot of its assets , it would n't cover the debt .
he praises berlin 's finance minister , theo sarrazin , for taking some harsh measures such as cutting subsides and 70,000 jobs and has managed to balance the budget for the first time - berlin has cut spending by about 11 percent since 1995 , the biggest savings made by any state .
the only way out is to focus on berlin 's advantages , its human capital and vibrant cultural life , experts say .
" i can not image that most industries and sectors that have left berlin will return , " said dieter vesper , an economist with the german institute for economic research .
" so the only choice berlin has is to try to develop sectors which are important in the future such as the health industry and the research and education sector , both areas which berlin already has an advantage .
but the only way to do this is to develop better links between these sectors and the business community . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin and wowereit say berlin needs the help another area to watch is if the federal government moves more of its people to berlin as many expect it to do - currently almost half of all government employees work outside the capital .
schmidt said he thinks that berlin will cease to be an independent state in 15 years and instead will merge with brandenburg , the state that surrounds it .
" that would help stop the rivalry and help lure investors , " he said .
" it would also trim administrative budgets , help universities to work more collaboratively .
there is no quick fix for berlin but there is no reason why the city ca n't survive with all it offers .

barcelona lost 1-0 to chelsea on wednesday . " we are in the mix now and have a chance to get through to the next phase , " said german international miroslav klose .
" we have sofia away and then chelsea at home .
chelsea are a great team but if we play like we did against barcelona we are capable of beating them . " without midfield duo tim borowski and frank baumann through injury , bremen lacked drive from midfield , but german international defender christian schulz had their first chance with his 24th minute effort whistling wide of the right hand post . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's diego , center , is attacked by sofia 's hristo yovov during the group a champions league match sofia , who had lost their first two matches against barcelona and chelsea , looked set to make it to the half-time break at 0-0 but paid the price for a terrible defensive wall .
naldo drilled a 25 yard free-kick straight through the collapsing wall and the unsighted sofia goalkeeper had no chance with the ball going in off the inside of the post . brazilian playmaker diego , a summer signing from fc porto , made a second goal on 74 minutes , and bremen took the spoils . bremen 's next european match is away to sofia on oct .

all the players fought hard and showed good team spirit and we managed to keep possession of the ball and have scoring chances of our own . " schweinsteiger first made his mark with the goal , following organized buildup play by bayern .
his 30-meter shot rifled past well-beaten sporting keeper ricardo for his second goal of the tournament and bayern 's seventh , with none conceded . six minutes later schweinsteiger earned a yellow card , following a challenge on nani , which paved the way for his exit for a second booking two minutes after the break for a trip on second-half substitute yannick djalo . schweinsteiger will now miss bayern 's fourth match at home to sporting in a fortnight where a point for the germans would suffice to progress . dw staff / dpa / afp -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de does the bundesliga have a world cup hangover ?

as a result , since 1991 , berlin 's debt has risen nearly six-fold , from 10 billion to 61 billion euros , giving it the highest per capita debt level of any state in germany .
the city has lost about 100,000 industrial jobs since 1990 .

reducing wages for its civil servants is another area in need of attention - berlin employees are paid 50 percent more than those in hamburg , for example .

he praises berlin 's finance minister , theo sarrazin , for taking some harsh measures such as cutting subsides and 70,000 jobs and has managed to balance the budget for the first time - berlin has cut spending by about 11 percent since 1995 , the biggest savings made by any state .
the only way out is to focus on berlin 's advantages , its human capital and vibrant cultural life , experts say .
" i can not image that most industries and sectors that have left berlin will return , " said dieter vesper , an economist with the german institute for economic research .

germany 's highest court ruled thursday that berlin is not getting a helping hand from the federal government to put its financial house in order .
what does that mean for the capital ? it seems as if every week , there is a new expensive museum or monument or refurbished relic opening in germany 's capital .
amid such lavish spending , it might appear odd to hear berlin officials complaining over a mountain of debt , even taking the federal government to court for more money .
berlin officials have long argued they are entitled to federal help with at least 60 percent of their 62-billion-euro -lrb- $ 77 billion -rrb- debt under a law that requires transfer payments between german states and the federal government in times of financial need .
after all , they have cut costs and sold off assets , they say .
and there is precedent - a 1992 court ruling forced the federal government to help bremen and saarland with their debt .
" we can not climb down from this debt mountain alone , " berlin mayor klaus wowereit told the german constitutional court in karlsruhe .
" we have done everything we can and now need federal solidarity .
berlin is a sexy but poor city . "
thursday , however , the court disagreed saying that berlin failed to qualify for emergency aid under the constitution rules .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal goverment is struggling to put the entire house in order " berlin adorns itself with the slogan ' poor but sexy ' but it is n't so poor , " said presiding judge winfried hassemer .
" berlin does n't have a budget emergency .
significant indicators point only to a budget that is under stress which berlin can in all probability overcome on its own . "
so what now ? christian schmidt of the berlin-based industrial investment council , an agency that promotes investment in the east , says he was surprised by the court decision and thinks people did n't expect it would be so harsh .
" ' poor but sexy ' obviously failed to impress the judges , " he said .
" berlin has even tougher times ahead . "
experts say things looks pretty bleak for the city of 3.4 million known for its vibrant arts , academic and cultural life , one in which the tourism and building sectors are growing .
that is because the city is burdened by massive debt and interest payments of 2.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.1 billion -rrb- annually .
the city has a very small industrial base and little hope of expanding it .
the unemployment rate is the third highest of any of germany 's 16 states , at 17 percent .
most of the problems date back to the end of world war ii when most large companies moved their headquarters to west germany - for example , siemens moved to munich and the banking industry fled to frankfurt .

getting to know a foreign country and culture is always more difficult when you 're completely sober . here 's the deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lesson number one should be : do not engage in money laundering the man who approached the inebriated norwegian student asked him if he wanted to change some money for him .
usually , when people ask for change , they need a few euros to buy cigarettes , a subway ticket or a drink .
this time , however , the sum in question was a little larger .
in fact , it was larger than life . the man agreed to pay 400 euros -lrb- $ 500 -rrb- to the mysterious stranger .
in return , he got a big , fat wad of 200 euro bills , totaling 20,400 euros -lrb- $ 25,577 -rrb- . what a great deal , he must have thought to himself , almost too good to be true ! the sad thing in life that most teenagers learn about as they grow older and more bitter is that those things which sound too good to be true generally are . it was n't me , really bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it may look like 200 euros , but it 's probably not worth the paper it 's printed on on the following day , the young man took one of his crisp 200 euro notes and went to buy some deodorant .
the sales person realized something was up with the young person whose source of money did n't seem as admirable as his desire to smell nice during his class trip .
she realized the money had been forged and informed the police . the young man - who has no previous criminal record in either germany or his home country - ended up in jail .
he said he did n't know the money had been forged , but thought , instead , that it had been laundered . of course .
that 's what 16 year olds these days are hoping for : to strike a sweet deal with the money-laundering mafia while on a field trip .

at most , bulk clients could expect rebates , but normal customers will see little , if any , benefit .
it could even be the case that business clients get price cuts at the expense of individual users . but eu commissioner mccreevy tried to assuage these fears , saying the postal system will continue to deliver the mail universally after liberalization .
deutsche post and other ex-monopolies in the eu are required to " deliver and pick up letters and packages at least five times a week , at good quality and competitive prices , " he reiterated . not just packages " when the market opens completely in 2009 , we can expect more innovation , better service , and higher cost efficiency , " mccreevy said .
he said this was the case for postal services in great britain , sweden and finland , which already made the switch . the current plan follows earlier waves of postal liberalization : in 1997 and 2002 .

" without -lrb- liberalization -rrb- , eu postal markets will be increasingly unable to meet the challenges of the communications revolution , " the irish commissioner said . the proposal to fully liberalize the postal market will need the backing of member state governments and the european parliament to go into effect .
past efforts to liberalize the postal market have met fierce opposition in some countries , and this time is likely to be no different . states complain last week 10 national postal services voiced concern about how , under the reform , they would be allowed to cover the considerable cost of meeting universal delivery obligations without the backing of the state . the belgian , cypriot , french , greek , hungarian , italian , luxembourg , maltese , polish and spanish postal services said in a joint statement there was " no proof of the efficiency of the measures planned by the commission " to finance the obligation . in response to such concerns , the commission proposed a range of funding options as well as the possibility of dividing the responsibility to provide full geographic coverage among different postal services . " growing industry " " i 'm well aware that there will be considerable lobbying on all sides but it 's hardly fair to have some very large markets opened up to competition and other markets that are not , " mccreevy said . he added : " this industry is not a dying industry , it 's a growing one , it 's a very dynamic one and it 's a very profitable for those who operate it efficiently .

" i firmly believe that completing the internal market for postal services is vital for securing further improvements and for sustaining the progress and results achieved to date , " he said . " in preparing the proposal , we have put consumer and user needs first , " he added . " universal delivery " in danger ? german national postal system deutsche post , which is already slated to give up its monopoly in 2008 , and the german government welcomed the commissioner 's plan . on the contrary , consumer protection advocates said they were concerned about the fate of universal mail delivery in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the digital age has not made postal services obsolete - quite the contrary patrick von braunmühl of the federation of german consumer organizations said it was still unclear how the postal service could make good on a promise of universal mail delivery without the support of the state . in contrast to the effect of liberalized telecoms markets , he said , consumers can not expect significantly lower postage prices .
at most , bulk clients could expect rebates , but normal customers will see little , if any , benefit .
it could even be the case that business clients get price cuts at the expense of individual users . but eu commissioner mccreevy tried to assuage these fears , saying the postal system will continue to deliver the mail universally after liberalization .
deutsche post and other ex-monopolies in the eu are required to " deliver and pick up letters and packages at least five times a week , at good quality and competitive prices , " he reiterated . not just packages " when the market opens completely in 2009 , we can expect more innovation , better service , and higher cost efficiency , " mccreevy said .
he said this was the case for postal services in great britain , sweden and finland , which already made the switch . the current plan follows earlier waves of postal liberalization : in 1997 and 2002 .
at that time , the markets for the delivery of packages and letters weighing more than 50 grams were opened to competition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissoner charlie mccreevy wants an level playing field in europe now , mccreevy aims to break state monopolies for the delivery of letters weighing less than 50 grams by 2009 while guaranteeing mail services throughout each country . " without -lrb- liberalization -rrb- , eu postal markets will be increasingly unable to meet the challenges of the communications revolution , " the irish commissioner said . the proposal to fully liberalize the postal market will need the backing of member state governments and the european parliament to go into effect .
past efforts to liberalize the postal market have met fierce opposition in some countries , and this time is likely to be no different . states complain last week 10 national postal services voiced concern about how , under the reform , they would be allowed to cover the considerable cost of meeting universal delivery obligations without the backing of the state . the belgian , cypriot , french , greek , hungarian , italian , luxembourg , maltese , polish and spanish postal services said in a joint statement there was " no proof of the efficiency of the measures planned by the commission " to finance the obligation . in response to such concerns , the commission proposed a range of funding options as well as the possibility of dividing the responsibility to provide full geographic coverage among different postal services . " growing industry " " i 'm well aware that there will be considerable lobbying on all sides but it 's hardly fair to have some very large markets opened up to competition and other markets that are not , " mccreevy said . he added : " this industry is not a dying industry , it 's a growing one , it 's a very dynamic one and it 's a very profitable for those who operate it efficiently .
and that 's why operators want to get into it .

" i firmly believe that completing the internal market for postal services is vital for securing further improvements and for sustaining the progress and results achieved to date , " he said . " in preparing the proposal , we have put consumer and user needs first , " he added . " universal delivery " in danger ? german national postal system deutsche post , which is already slated to give up its monopoly in 2008 , and the german government welcomed the commissioner 's plan . on the contrary , consumer protection advocates said they were concerned about the fate of universal mail delivery in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the digital age has not made postal services obsolete - quite the contrary patrick von braunmühl of the federation of german consumer organizations said it was still unclear how the postal service could make good on a promise of universal mail delivery without the support of the state . in contrast to the effect of liberalized telecoms markets , he said , consumers can not expect significantly lower postage prices .
at most , bulk clients could expect rebates , but normal customers will see little , if any , benefit .
it could even be the case that business clients get price cuts at the expense of individual users . but eu commissioner mccreevy tried to assuage these fears , saying the postal system will continue to deliver the mail universally after liberalization .
deutsche post and other ex-monopolies in the eu are required to " deliver and pick up letters and packages at least five times a week , at good quality and competitive prices , " he reiterated . not just packages " when the market opens completely in 2009 , we can expect more innovation , better service , and higher cost efficiency , " mccreevy said .
he said this was the case for postal services in great britain , sweden and finland , which already made the switch . the current plan follows earlier waves of postal liberalization : in 1997 and 2002 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 19.10.2006 economic think tanks upgrade germany 's growth forecasts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german economic forecast is mostly sunny and warm germany 's six leading economic research institutes on thursday upgraded their forecasts for growth in the euro zone 's biggest economy but cautioned that the recovery was likely to lose momentum next year . six leading german think tanks have said in their autumn report that they were pencilling in german gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- growth of 2.3 percent in 2006 and 1.4 percent in 2007 . in their previous report published in the spring , the institutes - - ifo in munich , diw in berlin , hwwa in hamburg , ifw in kiel , iwh in halle and rwi in essen - had been forecasting gdp growth of 1.8 percent and 1.2 percent respectively for this year and next year . " the upturn in the german economy has strengthened substantially this year , " the report said .
" while exports are continuing to expand strongly , the recovery is being increasingly carried by domestic demand . " the government 's plan to raise value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- by three percentage points to 19 percent from jan .
1 could , however , weigh on activity next year and lead to a marked slowdown in german growth . " never was vat increased so much in one go .
thus it is difficult to gauge to what extent fiscal policy will put the brakes on the economy , " the report said .
" the annual average rate of gdp growth depends largely on what purchases were brought forward this year as a result of the tax hike . " anticipatory effects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are spending as much as they can before the vat hike the institutes calculated that the anticipatory effects of the vat hike on consumer purchases this year would alone cut a quarter of a percentage point off next year 's growth . " only in the second half of 2007 will private consumption pick up modestly as employment rises .
for the year as a whole consumer spending is likely to stagnate . " another risk factor for the german economy next year could be a possible downturn in the real estate market in the us and in other major economies which " could lead to a stronger slowdown in the global economy , " the report said . in the meantime , the current stronger performance of the german economy is likely to have a positive effect on public finances in the euro zone 's economic powerhouse . shrinking deficit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is the largest economy in the euro zone germany 's public deficit was projected to amount to 2.4 percent of gdp this year and shrink further to just 1.4 percent next year . under eu budget rules , euro-zone countries are not allowed to run deficits in excess of 3.0 percent of gdp .
but germany , the main architect of the stability and growth pact , has been in breach of the three-percent rule every year since 2002 . the economic upturn was similarly expected to have a positive effect on the labor markets , with the institutes projecting a fall in the unemployment rate from 11.2 percent in 2005 to 10.4 percent in 2006 and 9.9 percent in 2007 . monetary policy turning to monetary policy , the institutes estimated that a further rise in euro-zone interest rates would be appropriate between now and the end of the year , but that the european central bank should then hold rates steady next year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government sees the planned vat increase as a necessary step " since december 2005 , the ecb has raised its benchmark interest rate to 3.25 percent , " the report said . " we share the ecb 's opinion that there are risks to price stability .
we therefore regard a further increase to 3.50 percent by the end of the year as appropriate , especially since the euro-zone economy will remain pointed upwards . " monetary conditions in the 12 countries that share the euro were likely to remain steady next year . the german vat hike would not have a lasting effect on headline inflation in the euro area , the institutes predicted . " the effects of the vat hike will be a one-off and will not in themselves be a reason to tighten monetary policy , " they said . in addition , economic growth was expected to slow next year . " all indications seem to point to steady interest rates , " the report said . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu commission upgrades german and eu growth forecasts the european commission is raising its forecasts for economic growth this year in germany , in the 12-country euro zone and in the 25-nation eu , a new report says .

" the upturn in the german economy has strengthened substantially this year , " the report said .
" while exports are continuing to expand strongly , the recovery is being increasingly carried by domestic demand . " the government 's plan to raise value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- by three percentage points to 19 percent from jan .
1 could , however , weigh on activity next year and lead to a marked slowdown in german growth . " never was vat increased so much in one go .
thus it is difficult to gauge to what extent fiscal policy will put the brakes on the economy , " the report said .
" the annual average rate of gdp growth depends largely on what purchases were brought forward this year as a result of the tax hike . " anticipatory effects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are spending as much as they can before the vat hike the institutes calculated that the anticipatory effects of the vat hike on consumer purchases this year would alone cut a quarter of a percentage point off next year 's growth . " only in the second half of 2007 will private consumption pick up modestly as employment rises .
for the year as a whole consumer spending is likely to stagnate . " another risk factor for the german economy next year could be a possible downturn in the real estate market in the us and in other major economies which " could lead to a stronger slowdown in the global economy , " the report said . in the meantime , the current stronger performance of the german economy is likely to have a positive effect on public finances in the euro zone 's economic powerhouse . shrinking deficit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is the largest economy in the euro zone germany 's public deficit was projected to amount to 2.4 percent of gdp this year and shrink further to just 1.4 percent next year . under eu budget rules , euro-zone countries are not allowed to run deficits in excess of 3.0 percent of gdp .
but germany , the main architect of the stability and growth pact , has been in breach of the three-percent rule every year since 2002 . the economic upturn was similarly expected to have a positive effect on the labor markets , with the institutes projecting a fall in the unemployment rate from 11.2 percent in 2005 to 10.4 percent in 2006 and 9.9 percent in 2007 . monetary policy turning to monetary policy , the institutes estimated that a further rise in euro-zone interest rates would be appropriate between now and the end of the year , but that the european central bank should then hold rates steady next year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government sees the planned vat increase as a necessary step " since december 2005 , the ecb has raised its benchmark interest rate to 3.25 percent , " the report said . " we share the ecb 's opinion that there are risks to price stability .
we therefore regard a further increase to 3.50 percent by the end of the year as appropriate , especially since the euro-zone economy will remain pointed upwards . " monetary conditions in the 12 countries that share the euro were likely to remain steady next year . the german vat hike would not have a lasting effect on headline inflation in the euro area , the institutes predicted . " the effects of the vat hike will be a one-off and will not in themselves be a reason to tighten monetary policy , " they said . in addition , economic growth was expected to slow next year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 19.10.2006 german schools search for solutions to absentee teachers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without a teacher , he probably wo n't get far berlin 's christian democrats have drawn attention to a problem that disrupts learning in the city 's schools and could contribute to germany 's comparatively low educational standards . the problem , which is by no means endemic to berlin , is the number of classes which have to be cut every year due to a simple lack of staff .
principals up and down the country are practiced in the chaotic art of last-minute reorganization of timetables and redistribution of their teachers in order to provide as much education as they possibly can .
but for all their efforts , it remains the case that each week children across germany are granted extra playtime , because there simply are n't enough teachers around to teach them .
for the most part , the teachers are absent as a result of little more than minor ailments , and though the consequences might seem significant to an average nine-year old , parents , unions and political opponents would beg to differ .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : packing up time - the joys of sick teachers according to official figures , which vary from one state to another , an average of between 2 and 3 percent of all school classes fall by the wayside annually .
but that is by no means the whole picture .
last year , teachers in berlin were absent for a total of 10.1 percent of scheduled classes , and although three-quarters were spared cancellation by having other staff fill in , the replacements were not always teachers .
too many timetable irregularities katrin schulze-bernt , the berlin christian democrats ' education spokeswoman , said she was concerned that , as things stand , children are not getting their full quota of prescribed learning .
" every 10th hour is not taught by the regular teacher , and i 'm concerned that the replacements used are not always professionals , but are sometimes just after-school carers who can not actually teach . "
indeed primary schools in berlin do regularly have to fall back on the help of after-school carers to keep the children entertained throughout the course of the school day .
high schools students , meanwhile , must be prepared to accept whichever teacher and subject their moveable timetables serve up .
neither scenario is ideal , and both lead to unwanted disruptions for which there appears to be no quick-fix cure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education , school , learning !
across the board , the problem is a combination of job-for-life contracts , teacher burnout syndrome , strapped-for-cash local authorities , and no established culture of working with substitute teachers .
and it 's likely to get worse before it gets better , according to jens stiller , a spokesman for berlin 's department of education .
" three percent of our teachers are on long-term sick leave , " he said .
" and since the average age of our workforce is 49 , we are dealing with a lot of staff sickness .
what we need here is a greater balance between old and young teachers . "
testing new waters given that no such balance can be injected into the existing system , the educational powers that be have launched a trial scheme whereby a number of schools budget for their own needs .
" each school is allocated a certain budget from which they can employ substitute teachers as required , " stiller said .
" they use retired teachers , those on maternity leave or those in the final stages of their teacher training . "
it 's a novel scheme , which stiller said was working well , but it remains to be seen how well it would fare were it expanded to schools across the city .
" there are only so many trained teachers out there available to work as substitute staff , and they might be too few to go around , " he pointed out .
" guaranteed teaching " earlier this year , the state of hesse launched an initiative to tackle that very problem .
under its " guaranteed-teaching " scheme , it has created pools of substitute staff - only in this instance , teaching qualifications and experience are not a prerequisite .
nonetheless , christian boergen of hesse 's department of education said it was an improvement over the days when cut classes were a run-of-the-mill occurrence .
" it 's good for teachers to know someone will cover for them when they are sick , and for parents to know their children wo n't be walking the streets because a class has been cancelled , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hesse advertises for substitutes the project has been widely criticized for its randomness - not least by the regional teaching union , gew hesse .
hartwig schröder , the head of the union 's legal department , is horrified by the department of education 's willingness to use retired teachers , students and housewives to take over at the blackboard .
" the majority of those employed as part of the guaranteed-teaching project do not have the qualifications which used to be required to be able to teach , " he said .
" it is a slap in the face for the profession . "
unlike the test project in berlin , guaranteed teaching has not been restricted to a handful of schools , but has already been put into practice across the state .
schröder said it would ultimately do more harm than good .
" what we need is simple : more teachers , smaller class sizes , less stress and , consequently , a greater sense of satisfaction among the teachers .
and what we do n't need is this kind of patchwork solution . tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin school wants to profit from education phorms , a new private school in berlin , opened its doors in august .

barcelona lost 1-0 to chelsea on wednesday . " we are in the mix now and have a chance to get through to the next phase , " said german international miroslav klose .
" we have sofia away and then chelsea at home .
chelsea are a great team but if we play like we did against barcelona we are capable of beating them . " without midfield duo tim borowski and frank baumann through injury , bremen lacked drive from midfield , but german international defender christian schulz had their first chance with his 24th minute effort whistling wide of the right hand post . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's diego , center , is attacked by sofia 's hristo yovov during the group a champions league match sofia , who had lost their first two matches against barcelona and chelsea , looked set to make it to the half-time break at 0-0 but paid the price for a terrible defensive wall .
naldo drilled a 25 yard free-kick straight through the collapsing wall and the unsighted sofia goalkeeper had no chance with the ball going in off the inside of the post . brazilian playmaker diego , a summer signing from fc porto , made a second goal on 74 minutes , and bremen took the spoils . bremen 's next european match is away to sofia on oct .

all the players fought hard and showed good team spirit and we managed to keep possession of the ball and have scoring chances of our own . " schweinsteiger first made his mark with the goal , following organized buildup play by bayern .
his 30-meter shot rifled past well-beaten sporting keeper ricardo for his second goal of the tournament and bayern 's seventh , with none conceded . six minutes later schweinsteiger earned a yellow card , following a challenge on nani , which paved the way for his exit for a second booking two minutes after the break for a trip on second-half substitute yannick djalo . schweinsteiger will now miss bayern 's fourth match at home to sporting in a fortnight where a point for the germans would suffice to progress . dw staff / dpa / afp -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de does the bundesliga have a world cup hangover ?

" i firmly believe that completing the internal market for postal services is vital for securing further improvements and for sustaining the progress and results achieved to date , " he said . " in preparing the proposal , we have put consumer and user needs first , " he added . " universal delivery " in danger ? german national postal system deutsche post , which is already slated to give up its monopoly in 2008 , and the german government welcomed the commissioner 's plan . on the contrary , consumer protection advocates said they were concerned about the fate of universal mail delivery in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the digital age has not made postal services obsolete - quite the contrary patrick von braunmühl of the federation of german consumer organizations said it was still unclear how the postal service could make good on a promise of universal mail delivery without the support of the state . in contrast to the effect of liberalized telecoms markets , he said , consumers can not expect significantly lower postage prices .
at most , bulk clients could expect rebates , but normal customers will see little , if any , benefit .
it could even be the case that business clients get price cuts at the expense of individual users . but eu commissioner mccreevy tried to assuage these fears , saying the postal system will continue to deliver the mail universally after liberalization .
deutsche post and other ex-monopolies in the eu are required to " deliver and pick up letters and packages at least five times a week , at good quality and competitive prices , " he reiterated . not just packages " when the market opens completely in 2009 , we can expect more innovation , better service , and higher cost efficiency , " mccreevy said .
he said this was the case for postal services in great britain , sweden and finland , which already made the switch . the current plan follows earlier waves of postal liberalization : in 1997 and 2002 .
at that time , the markets for the delivery of packages and letters weighing more than 50 grams were opened to competition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissoner charlie mccreevy wants an level playing field in europe now , mccreevy aims to break state monopolies for the delivery of letters weighing less than 50 grams by 2009 while guaranteeing mail services throughout each country . " without -lrb- liberalization -rrb- , eu postal markets will be increasingly unable to meet the challenges of the communications revolution , " the irish commissioner said . the proposal to fully liberalize the postal market will need the backing of member state governments and the european parliament to go into effect .
past efforts to liberalize the postal market have met fierce opposition in some countries , and this time is likely to be no different . states complain last week 10 national postal services voiced concern about how , under the reform , they would be allowed to cover the considerable cost of meeting universal delivery obligations without the backing of the state . the belgian , cypriot , french , greek , hungarian , italian , luxembourg , maltese , polish and spanish postal services said in a joint statement there was " no proof of the efficiency of the measures planned by the commission " to finance the obligation . in response to such concerns , the commission proposed a range of funding options as well as the possibility of dividing the responsibility to provide full geographic coverage among different postal services . " growing industry " " i 'm well aware that there will be considerable lobbying on all sides but it 's hardly fair to have some very large markets opened up to competition and other markets that are not , " mccreevy said . he added : " this industry is not a dying industry , it 's a growing one , it 's a very dynamic one and it 's a very profitable for those who operate it efficiently .
and that 's why operators want to get into it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 19.10.2006 german schools search for solutions to absentee teachers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without a teacher , he probably wo n't get far berlin 's christian democrats have drawn attention to a problem that disrupts learning in the city 's schools and could contribute to germany 's comparatively low educational standards . the problem , which is by no means endemic to berlin , is the number of classes which have to be cut every year due to a simple lack of staff .
principals up and down the country are practiced in the chaotic art of last-minute reorganization of timetables and redistribution of their teachers in order to provide as much education as they possibly can .
but for all their efforts , it remains the case that each week children across germany are granted extra playtime , because there simply are n't enough teachers around to teach them .
for the most part , the teachers are absent as a result of little more than minor ailments , and though the consequences might seem significant to an average nine-year old , parents , unions and political opponents would beg to differ .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : packing up time - the joys of sick teachers according to official figures , which vary from one state to another , an average of between 2 and 3 percent of all school classes fall by the wayside annually .
but that is by no means the whole picture .
last year , teachers in berlin were absent for a total of 10.1 percent of scheduled classes , and although three-quarters were spared cancellation by having other staff fill in , the replacements were not always teachers .
too many timetable irregularities katrin schulze-bernt , the berlin christian democrats ' education spokeswoman , said she was concerned that , as things stand , children are not getting their full quota of prescribed learning .
" every 10th hour is not taught by the regular teacher , and i 'm concerned that the replacements used are not always professionals , but are sometimes just after-school carers who can not actually teach . "
indeed primary schools in berlin do regularly have to fall back on the help of after-school carers to keep the children entertained throughout the course of the school day .
high schools students , meanwhile , must be prepared to accept whichever teacher and subject their moveable timetables serve up .
neither scenario is ideal , and both lead to unwanted disruptions for which there appears to be no quick-fix cure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education , school , learning !
across the board , the problem is a combination of job-for-life contracts , teacher burnout syndrome , strapped-for-cash local authorities , and no established culture of working with substitute teachers .
and it 's likely to get worse before it gets better , according to jens stiller , a spokesman for berlin 's department of education .
" three percent of our teachers are on long-term sick leave , " he said .
" and since the average age of our workforce is 49 , we are dealing with a lot of staff sickness .
what we need here is a greater balance between old and young teachers . "
testing new waters given that no such balance can be injected into the existing system , the educational powers that be have launched a trial scheme whereby a number of schools budget for their own needs .
" each school is allocated a certain budget from which they can employ substitute teachers as required , " stiller said .
" they use retired teachers , those on maternity leave or those in the final stages of their teacher training . "
it 's a novel scheme , which stiller said was working well , but it remains to be seen how well it would fare were it expanded to schools across the city .
" there are only so many trained teachers out there available to work as substitute staff , and they might be too few to go around , " he pointed out .
" guaranteed teaching " earlier this year , the state of hesse launched an initiative to tackle that very problem .

nonetheless , christian boergen of hesse 's department of education said it was an improvement over the days when cut classes were a run-of-the-mill occurrence .
" it 's good for teachers to know someone will cover for them when they are sick , and for parents to know their children wo n't be walking the streets because a class has been cancelled , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hesse advertises for substitutes the project has been widely criticized for its randomness - not least by the regional teaching union , gew hesse .
hartwig schröder , the head of the union 's legal department , is horrified by the department of education 's willingness to use retired teachers , students and housewives to take over at the blackboard .
" the majority of those employed as part of the guaranteed-teaching project do not have the qualifications which used to be required to be able to teach , " he said .
" it is a slap in the face for the profession . "
unlike the test project in berlin , guaranteed teaching has not been restricted to a handful of schools , but has already been put into practice across the state .
schröder said it would ultimately do more harm than good .
" what we need is simple : more teachers , smaller class sizes , less stress and , consequently , a greater sense of satisfaction among the teachers .
and what we do n't need is this kind of patchwork solution . tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin school wants to profit from education phorms , a new private school in berlin , opened its doors in august .

germany 's highest court ruled thursday that berlin is not getting a helping hand from the federal government to put its financial house in order .
what does that mean for the capital ? it seems as if every week , there is a new expensive museum or monument or refurbished relic opening in germany 's capital .
amid such lavish spending , it might appear odd to hear berlin officials complaining over a mountain of debt , even taking the federal government to court for more money .
berlin officials have long argued they are entitled to federal help with at least 60 percent of their 62-billion-euro -lrb- $ 77 billion -rrb- debt under a law that requires transfer payments between german states and the federal government in times of financial need .
after all , they have cut costs and sold off assets , they say .
and there is precedent - a 1992 court ruling forced the federal government to help bremen and saarland with their debt .
" we can not climb down from this debt mountain alone , " berlin mayor klaus wowereit told the german constitutional court in karlsruhe .
" we have done everything we can and now need federal solidarity .
berlin is a sexy but poor city . "
thursday , however , the court disagreed saying that berlin failed to qualify for emergency aid under the constitution rules .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal goverment is struggling to put the entire house in order " berlin adorns itself with the slogan ' poor but sexy ' but it is n't so poor , " said presiding judge winfried hassemer .
" berlin does n't have a budget emergency .
significant indicators point only to a budget that is under stress which berlin can in all probability overcome on its own . "
so what now ? christian schmidt of the berlin-based industrial investment council , an agency that promotes investment in the east , says he was surprised by the court decision and thinks people did n't expect it would be so harsh .
" ' poor but sexy ' obviously failed to impress the judges , " he said .
" berlin has even tougher times ahead . "
experts say things looks pretty bleak for the city of 3.4 million known for its vibrant arts , academic and cultural life , one in which the tourism and building sectors are growing .
that is because the city is burdened by massive debt and interest payments of 2.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.1 billion -rrb- annually .
the city has a very small industrial base and little hope of expanding it .
the unemployment rate is the third highest of any of germany 's 16 states , at 17 percent .
most of the problems date back to the end of world war ii when most large companies moved their headquarters to west germany - for example , siemens moved to munich and the banking industry fled to frankfurt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bode museum was just the latest new offering after german reunification in 1990 , east german industry collapsed when state subsidies were cut .
also , berlin failed to stop spending at a rate it was used to , especially when federal payments were slashed in 1995 from almost 8 million euros to 2 million euros .
as a result , since 1991 , berlin 's debt has risen nearly six-fold , from 10 billion to 61 billion euros , giving it the highest per capita debt level of any state in germany .
the city has lost about 100,000 industrial jobs since 1990 .
" in 15 years , we are going to be showing people from china around and hoping for a euro in tip , " said one economic expert .
" wealth is going south and i am not optimistic about berlin 's situation . "
tougher measures needed the judges said that poor political decision-making led to berlin 's financial situation , something that " federal aid is n't there to remedy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin : all that glitters is not gold they wrote that berlin needs to increase the local commercial tax rate and sell more of its assets , such as the state 's 270,000 housing units estimated to be worth about 4 billion euros and the landesbank berlin holding ag , worth 5 billion euros .
reducing wages for its civil servants is another area in need of attention - berlin employees are paid 50 percent more than those in hamburg , for example .
another issue is cutting subsidies that fund redundancies such as the city 's three operas , two zoos and six housing authorities , something that arose because berlin was divided . " to reconcile the two cities , well that was a tough thing , " said schmidt .
" but it took too long and no one had the guts cut into the meat . "
only way out schmidt says , however , that even so , berlin is in a tough predicament because even if it sold off a lot of its assets , it would n't cover the debt .
he praises berlin 's finance minister , theo sarrazin , for taking some harsh measures such as cutting subsides and 70,000 jobs and has managed to balance the budget for the first time - berlin has cut spending by about 11 percent since 1995 , the biggest savings made by any state .
the only way out is to focus on berlin 's advantages , its human capital and vibrant cultural life , experts say .
" i can not image that most industries and sectors that have left berlin will return , " said dieter vesper , an economist with the german institute for economic research .
" so the only choice berlin has is to try to develop sectors which are important in the future such as the health industry and the research and education sector , both areas which berlin already has an advantage .
but the only way to do this is to develop better links between these sectors and the business community . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin and wowereit say berlin needs the help another area to watch is if the federal government moves more of its people to berlin as many expect it to do - currently almost half of all government employees work outside the capital .
schmidt said he thinks that berlin will cease to be an independent state in 15 years and instead will merge with brandenburg , the state that surrounds it .
" that would help stop the rivalry and help lure investors , " he said .
" it would also trim administrative budgets , help universities to work more collaboratively .
there is no quick fix for berlin but there is no reason why the city ca n't survive with all it offers .

as a result , since 1991 , berlin 's debt has risen nearly six-fold , from 10 billion to 61 billion euros , giving it the highest per capita debt level of any state in germany .
the city has lost about 100,000 industrial jobs since 1990 .
" in 15 years , we are going to be showing people from china around and hoping for a euro in tip , " said one economic expert .
" wealth is going south and i am not optimistic about berlin 's situation . "

reducing wages for its civil servants is another area in need of attention - berlin employees are paid 50 percent more than those in hamburg , for example .
another issue is cutting subsidies that fund redundancies such as the city 's three operas , two zoos and six housing authorities , something that arose because berlin was divided . " to reconcile the two cities , well that was a tough thing , " said schmidt .
" but it took too long and no one had the guts cut into the meat . "
only way out schmidt says , however , that even so , berlin is in a tough predicament because even if it sold off a lot of its assets , it would n't cover the debt .
he praises berlin 's finance minister , theo sarrazin , for taking some harsh measures such as cutting subsides and 70,000 jobs and has managed to balance the budget for the first time - berlin has cut spending by about 11 percent since 1995 , the biggest savings made by any state .
the only way out is to focus on berlin 's advantages , its human capital and vibrant cultural life , experts say .
" i can not image that most industries and sectors that have left berlin will return , " said dieter vesper , an economist with the german institute for economic research .
" so the only choice berlin has is to try to develop sectors which are important in the future such as the health industry and the research and education sector , both areas which berlin already has an advantage .
but the only way to do this is to develop better links between these sectors and the business community . "

schmidt said he thinks that berlin will cease to be an independent state in 15 years and instead will merge with brandenburg , the state that surrounds it .
" that would help stop the rivalry and help lure investors , " he said .

germany 's highest court ruled thursday that berlin is not getting a helping hand from the federal government to put its financial house in order .
what does that mean for the capital ? it seems as if every week , there is a new expensive museum or monument or refurbished relic opening in germany 's capital .
amid such lavish spending , it might appear odd to hear berlin officials complaining over a mountain of debt , even taking the federal government to court for more money .
berlin officials have long argued they are entitled to federal help with at least 60 percent of their 62-billion-euro -lrb- $ 77 billion -rrb- debt under a law that requires transfer payments between german states and the federal government in times of financial need .
after all , they have cut costs and sold off assets , they say .
and there is precedent - a 1992 court ruling forced the federal government to help bremen and saarland with their debt .
" we can not climb down from this debt mountain alone , " berlin mayor klaus wowereit told the german constitutional court in karlsruhe .
" we have done everything we can and now need federal solidarity .
berlin is a sexy but poor city . "
thursday , however , the court disagreed saying that berlin failed to qualify for emergency aid under the constitution rules .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal goverment is struggling to put the entire house in order " berlin adorns itself with the slogan ' poor but sexy ' but it is n't so poor , " said presiding judge winfried hassemer .
" berlin does n't have a budget emergency .
significant indicators point only to a budget that is under stress which berlin can in all probability overcome on its own . "
so what now ? christian schmidt of the berlin-based industrial investment council , an agency that promotes investment in the east , says he was surprised by the court decision and thinks people did n't expect it would be so harsh .
" ' poor but sexy ' obviously failed to impress the judges , " he said .
" berlin has even tougher times ahead . "
experts say things looks pretty bleak for the city of 3.4 million known for its vibrant arts , academic and cultural life , one in which the tourism and building sectors are growing .
that is because the city is burdened by massive debt and interest payments of 2.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.1 billion -rrb- annually .
the city has a very small industrial base and little hope of expanding it .
the unemployment rate is the third highest of any of germany 's 16 states , at 17 percent .
most of the problems date back to the end of world war ii when most large companies moved their headquarters to west germany - for example , siemens moved to munich and the banking industry fled to frankfurt .

germany 's highest court ruled thursday that berlin is not getting a helping hand from the federal government to put its financial house in order .
what does that mean for the capital ? it seems as if every week , there is a new expensive museum or monument or refurbished relic opening in germany 's capital .
amid such lavish spending , it might appear odd to hear berlin officials complaining over a mountain of debt , even taking the federal government to court for more money .
berlin officials have long argued they are entitled to federal help with at least 60 percent of their 62-billion-euro -lrb- $ 77 billion -rrb- debt under a law that requires transfer payments between german states and the federal government in times of financial need .
after all , they have cut costs and sold off assets , they say .
and there is precedent - a 1992 court ruling forced the federal government to help bremen and saarland with their debt .
" we can not climb down from this debt mountain alone , " berlin mayor klaus wowereit told the german constitutional court in karlsruhe .
" we have done everything we can and now need federal solidarity .
berlin is a sexy but poor city . "
thursday , however , the court disagreed saying that berlin failed to qualify for emergency aid under the constitution rules .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal goverment is struggling to put the entire house in order " berlin adorns itself with the slogan ' poor but sexy ' but it is n't so poor , " said presiding judge winfried hassemer .
" berlin does n't have a budget emergency .
significant indicators point only to a budget that is under stress which berlin can in all probability overcome on its own . "
so what now ? christian schmidt of the berlin-based industrial investment council , an agency that promotes investment in the east , says he was surprised by the court decision and thinks people did n't expect it would be so harsh .
" ' poor but sexy ' obviously failed to impress the judges , " he said .
" berlin has even tougher times ahead . "
experts say things looks pretty bleak for the city of 3.4 million known for its vibrant arts , academic and cultural life , one in which the tourism and building sectors are growing .
that is because the city is burdened by massive debt and interest payments of 2.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.1 billion -rrb- annually .
the city has a very small industrial base and little hope of expanding it .
the unemployment rate is the third highest of any of germany 's 16 states , at 17 percent .
most of the problems date back to the end of world war ii when most large companies moved their headquarters to west germany - for example , siemens moved to munich and the banking industry fled to frankfurt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bode museum was just the latest new offering after german reunification in 1990 , east german industry collapsed when state subsidies were cut .
also , berlin failed to stop spending at a rate it was used to , especially when federal payments were slashed in 1995 from almost 8 million euros to 2 million euros .
as a result , since 1991 , berlin 's debt has risen nearly six-fold , from 10 billion to 61 billion euros , giving it the highest per capita debt level of any state in germany .
the city has lost about 100,000 industrial jobs since 1990 .
" in 15 years , we are going to be showing people from china around and hoping for a euro in tip , " said one economic expert .
" wealth is going south and i am not optimistic about berlin 's situation . "
tougher measures needed the judges said that poor political decision-making led to berlin 's financial situation , something that " federal aid is n't there to remedy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin : all that glitters is not gold they wrote that berlin needs to increase the local commercial tax rate and sell more of its assets , such as the state 's 270,000 housing units estimated to be worth about 4 billion euros and the landesbank berlin holding ag , worth 5 billion euros .
reducing wages for its civil servants is another area in need of attention - berlin employees are paid 50 percent more than those in hamburg , for example .
another issue is cutting subsidies that fund redundancies such as the city 's three operas , two zoos and six housing authorities , something that arose because berlin was divided . " to reconcile the two cities , well that was a tough thing , " said schmidt .
" but it took too long and no one had the guts cut into the meat . "
only way out schmidt says , however , that even so , berlin is in a tough predicament because even if it sold off a lot of its assets , it would n't cover the debt .
he praises berlin 's finance minister , theo sarrazin , for taking some harsh measures such as cutting subsides and 70,000 jobs and has managed to balance the budget for the first time - berlin has cut spending by about 11 percent since 1995 , the biggest savings made by any state .
the only way out is to focus on berlin 's advantages , its human capital and vibrant cultural life , experts say .
" i can not image that most industries and sectors that have left berlin will return , " said dieter vesper , an economist with the german institute for economic research .
" so the only choice berlin has is to try to develop sectors which are important in the future such as the health industry and the research and education sector , both areas which berlin already has an advantage .
but the only way to do this is to develop better links between these sectors and the business community . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin and wowereit say berlin needs the help another area to watch is if the federal government moves more of its people to berlin as many expect it to do - currently almost half of all government employees work outside the capital .
schmidt said he thinks that berlin will cease to be an independent state in 15 years and instead will merge with brandenburg , the state that surrounds it .
" that would help stop the rivalry and help lure investors , " he said .
" it would also trim administrative budgets , help universities to work more collaboratively .

" it is highly probable that berlin can sort out its budget difficulties itself , " said winfried hassemer , vice-president of the court . government duty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin is the seat of germany 's federal government and parliament legally , the government is obliged to bail out a cash-strapped state so long as it has made the requisite budget savings and undertaken sufficient austerity measures .
states that have been on the receiving end of government aid include bremen and the saarland in 1992 . but in the 1990s , it was that the capital which bore the brunt of reunification 's cost . public spending was scaled back as unemployment soared , with some 100,000 industrial jobs lost over the last 16 years .
cultural spending has seen massive cuts and civil servant salaries have been reduced .
but major business investments have have been few . according to the city authorities , berlin is not to blame for its spiraling debt .
they argue that the government slashed its post-reunification aid too soon - before the city had time to stabilize . resentment in the south bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber but the government as well as a number of other states argued that berlin did not meet the criteria for aid , and that with seven of germany 's 16 states are currently in debt , it is not the only one in financial dire straits . other states , including bavaria and baden-württemberg , point out that berlin has consistently overspent and failed to privatize state holdings . " berlin could have done far more to tighten its belt , " said baden-württemberg 's finance minister gerhard stratthaus -lrb- cdu -rrb- in an interview with weekly magazine der spiegel . bavarian state premier edmund stoiber , meanwhile , has insisted that " solidarity has its limits . " major cuts ahead the ruling will raise pressure on the capital to sell assets and cut spending in a city which has three opera companies , two zoos and what other regional states claim is a cultural scene way beyond its financial means .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 19.10.2006 german schools search for solutions to absentee teachers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without a teacher , he probably wo n't get far berlin 's christian democrats have drawn attention to a problem that disrupts learning in the city 's schools and could contribute to germany 's comparatively low educational standards . the problem , which is by no means endemic to berlin , is the number of classes which have to be cut every year due to a simple lack of staff .
principals up and down the country are practiced in the chaotic art of last-minute reorganization of timetables and redistribution of their teachers in order to provide as much education as they possibly can .
but for all their efforts , it remains the case that each week children across germany are granted extra playtime , because there simply are n't enough teachers around to teach them .
for the most part , the teachers are absent as a result of little more than minor ailments , and though the consequences might seem significant to an average nine-year old , parents , unions and political opponents would beg to differ .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : packing up time - the joys of sick teachers according to official figures , which vary from one state to another , an average of between 2 and 3 percent of all school classes fall by the wayside annually .
but that is by no means the whole picture .
last year , teachers in berlin were absent for a total of 10.1 percent of scheduled classes , and although three-quarters were spared cancellation by having other staff fill in , the replacements were not always teachers .
too many timetable irregularities katrin schulze-bernt , the berlin christian democrats ' education spokeswoman , said she was concerned that , as things stand , children are not getting their full quota of prescribed learning .
" every 10th hour is not taught by the regular teacher , and i 'm concerned that the replacements used are not always professionals , but are sometimes just after-school carers who can not actually teach . "
indeed primary schools in berlin do regularly have to fall back on the help of after-school carers to keep the children entertained throughout the course of the school day .
high schools students , meanwhile , must be prepared to accept whichever teacher and subject their moveable timetables serve up .
neither scenario is ideal , and both lead to unwanted disruptions for which there appears to be no quick-fix cure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education , school , learning !
across the board , the problem is a combination of job-for-life contracts , teacher burnout syndrome , strapped-for-cash local authorities , and no established culture of working with substitute teachers .
and it 's likely to get worse before it gets better , according to jens stiller , a spokesman for berlin 's department of education .
" three percent of our teachers are on long-term sick leave , " he said .
" and since the average age of our workforce is 49 , we are dealing with a lot of staff sickness .
what we need here is a greater balance between old and young teachers . "
testing new waters given that no such balance can be injected into the existing system , the educational powers that be have launched a trial scheme whereby a number of schools budget for their own needs .
" each school is allocated a certain budget from which they can employ substitute teachers as required , " stiller said .
" they use retired teachers , those on maternity leave or those in the final stages of their teacher training . "
it 's a novel scheme , which stiller said was working well , but it remains to be seen how well it would fare were it expanded to schools across the city .
" there are only so many trained teachers out there available to work as substitute staff , and they might be too few to go around , " he pointed out .
" guaranteed teaching " earlier this year , the state of hesse launched an initiative to tackle that very problem .
under its " guaranteed-teaching " scheme , it has created pools of substitute staff - only in this instance , teaching qualifications and experience are not a prerequisite .
nonetheless , christian boergen of hesse 's department of education said it was an improvement over the days when cut classes were a run-of-the-mill occurrence .
" it 's good for teachers to know someone will cover for them when they are sick , and for parents to know their children wo n't be walking the streets because a class has been cancelled , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hesse advertises for substitutes the project has been widely criticized for its randomness - not least by the regional teaching union , gew hesse .
hartwig schröder , the head of the union 's legal department , is horrified by the department of education 's willingness to use retired teachers , students and housewives to take over at the blackboard .
" the majority of those employed as part of the guaranteed-teaching project do not have the qualifications which used to be required to be able to teach , " he said .
" it is a slap in the face for the profession . "
unlike the test project in berlin , guaranteed teaching has not been restricted to a handful of schools , but has already been put into practice across the state .
schröder said it would ultimately do more harm than good .
" what we need is simple : more teachers , smaller class sizes , less stress and , consequently , a greater sense of satisfaction among the teachers .
and what we do n't need is this kind of patchwork solution . tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin school wants to profit from education phorms , a new private school in berlin , opened its doors in august .

" i firmly believe that completing the internal market for postal services is vital for securing further improvements and for sustaining the progress and results achieved to date , " he said . " in preparing the proposal , we have put consumer and user needs first , " he added . " universal delivery " in danger ? german national postal system deutsche post , which is already slated to give up its monopoly in 2008 , and the german government welcomed the commissioner 's plan . on the contrary , consumer protection advocates said they were concerned about the fate of universal mail delivery in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the digital age has not made postal services obsolete - quite the contrary patrick von braunmühl of the federation of german consumer organizations said it was still unclear how the postal service could make good on a promise of universal mail delivery without the support of the state . in contrast to the effect of liberalized telecoms markets , he said , consumers can not expect significantly lower postage prices .
at most , bulk clients could expect rebates , but normal customers will see little , if any , benefit .
it could even be the case that business clients get price cuts at the expense of individual users . but eu commissioner mccreevy tried to assuage these fears , saying the postal system will continue to deliver the mail universally after liberalization .
deutsche post and other ex-monopolies in the eu are required to " deliver and pick up letters and packages at least five times a week , at good quality and competitive prices , " he reiterated . not just packages " when the market opens completely in 2009 , we can expect more innovation , better service , and higher cost efficiency , " mccreevy said .
he said this was the case for postal services in great britain , sweden and finland , which already made the switch . the current plan follows earlier waves of postal liberalization : in 1997 and 2002 .
at that time , the markets for the delivery of packages and letters weighing more than 50 grams were opened to competition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissoner charlie mccreevy wants an level playing field in europe now , mccreevy aims to break state monopolies for the delivery of letters weighing less than 50 grams by 2009 while guaranteeing mail services throughout each country . " without -lrb- liberalization -rrb- , eu postal markets will be increasingly unable to meet the challenges of the communications revolution , " the irish commissioner said . the proposal to fully liberalize the postal market will need the backing of member state governments and the european parliament to go into effect .
past efforts to liberalize the postal market have met fierce opposition in some countries , and this time is likely to be no different . states complain last week 10 national postal services voiced concern about how , under the reform , they would be allowed to cover the considerable cost of meeting universal delivery obligations without the backing of the state . the belgian , cypriot , french , greek , hungarian , italian , luxembourg , maltese , polish and spanish postal services said in a joint statement there was " no proof of the efficiency of the measures planned by the commission " to finance the obligation . in response to such concerns , the commission proposed a range of funding options as well as the possibility of dividing the responsibility to provide full geographic coverage among different postal services . " growing industry " " i 'm well aware that there will be considerable lobbying on all sides but it 's hardly fair to have some very large markets opened up to competition and other markets that are not , " mccreevy said . he added : " this industry is not a dying industry , it 's a growing one , it 's a very dynamic one and it 's a very profitable for those who operate it efficiently .

at that time , the markets for the delivery of packages and letters weighing more than 50 grams were opened to competition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissoner charlie mccreevy wants an level playing field in europe now , mccreevy aims to break state monopolies for the delivery of letters weighing less than 50 grams by 2009 while guaranteeing mail services throughout each country . " without -lrb- liberalization -rrb- , eu postal markets will be increasingly unable to meet the challenges of the communications revolution , " the irish commissioner said . the proposal to fully liberalize the postal market will need the backing of member state governments and the european parliament to go into effect .
past efforts to liberalize the postal market have met fierce opposition in some countries , and this time is likely to be no different . states complain last week 10 national postal services voiced concern about how , under the reform , they would be allowed to cover the considerable cost of meeting universal delivery obligations without the backing of the state . the belgian , cypriot , french , greek , hungarian , italian , luxembourg , maltese , polish and spanish postal services said in a joint statement there was " no proof of the efficiency of the measures planned by the commission " to finance the obligation . in response to such concerns , the commission proposed a range of funding options as well as the possibility of dividing the responsibility to provide full geographic coverage among different postal services . " growing industry " " i 'm well aware that there will be considerable lobbying on all sides but it 's hardly fair to have some very large markets opened up to competition and other markets that are not , " mccreevy said . he added : " this industry is not a dying industry , it 's a growing one , it 's a very dynamic one and it 's a very profitable for those who operate it efficiently .

" the upturn in the german economy has strengthened substantially this year , " the report said .
" while exports are continuing to expand strongly , the recovery is being increasingly carried by domestic demand . " the government 's plan to raise value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- by three percentage points to 19 percent from jan .
1 could , however , weigh on activity next year and lead to a marked slowdown in german growth . " never was vat increased so much in one go .
thus it is difficult to gauge to what extent fiscal policy will put the brakes on the economy , " the report said .
" the annual average rate of gdp growth depends largely on what purchases were brought forward this year as a result of the tax hike . " anticipatory effects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are spending as much as they can before the vat hike the institutes calculated that the anticipatory effects of the vat hike on consumer purchases this year would alone cut a quarter of a percentage point off next year 's growth . " only in the second half of 2007 will private consumption pick up modestly as employment rises .
for the year as a whole consumer spending is likely to stagnate . " another risk factor for the german economy next year could be a possible downturn in the real estate market in the us and in other major economies which " could lead to a stronger slowdown in the global economy , " the report said . in the meantime , the current stronger performance of the german economy is likely to have a positive effect on public finances in the euro zone 's economic powerhouse . shrinking deficit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is the largest economy in the euro zone germany 's public deficit was projected to amount to 2.4 percent of gdp this year and shrink further to just 1.4 percent next year . under eu budget rules , euro-zone countries are not allowed to run deficits in excess of 3.0 percent of gdp .
but germany , the main architect of the stability and growth pact , has been in breach of the three-percent rule every year since 2002 . the economic upturn was similarly expected to have a positive effect on the labor markets , with the institutes projecting a fall in the unemployment rate from 11.2 percent in 2005 to 10.4 percent in 2006 and 9.9 percent in 2007 . monetary policy turning to monetary policy , the institutes estimated that a further rise in euro-zone interest rates would be appropriate between now and the end of the year , but that the european central bank should then hold rates steady next year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government sees the planned vat increase as a necessary step " since december 2005 , the ecb has raised its benchmark interest rate to 3.25 percent , " the report said . " we share the ecb 's opinion that there are risks to price stability .
we therefore regard a further increase to 3.50 percent by the end of the year as appropriate , especially since the euro-zone economy will remain pointed upwards . " monetary conditions in the 12 countries that share the euro were likely to remain steady next year . the german vat hike would not have a lasting effect on headline inflation in the euro area , the institutes predicted . " the effects of the vat hike will be a one-off and will not in themselves be a reason to tighten monetary policy , " they said . in addition , economic growth was expected to slow next year .

principals up and down the country are practiced in the chaotic art of last-minute reorganization of timetables and redistribution of their teachers in order to provide as much education as they possibly can .
but for all their efforts , it remains the case that each week children across germany are granted extra playtime , because there simply are n't enough teachers around to teach them .

last year , teachers in berlin were absent for a total of 10.1 percent of scheduled classes , and although three-quarters were spared cancellation by having other staff fill in , the replacements were not always teachers .
too many timetable irregularities katrin schulze-bernt , the berlin christian democrats ' education spokeswoman , said she was concerned that , as things stand , children are not getting their full quota of prescribed learning .
" every 10th hour is not taught by the regular teacher , and i 'm concerned that the replacements used are not always professionals , but are sometimes just after-school carers who can not actually teach . "
indeed primary schools in berlin do regularly have to fall back on the help of after-school carers to keep the children entertained throughout the course of the school day .
high schools students , meanwhile , must be prepared to accept whichever teacher and subject their moveable timetables serve up .
neither scenario is ideal , and both lead to unwanted disruptions for which there appears to be no quick-fix cure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education , school , learning !
across the board , the problem is a combination of job-for-life contracts , teacher burnout syndrome , strapped-for-cash local authorities , and no established culture of working with substitute teachers .
and it 's likely to get worse before it gets better , according to jens stiller , a spokesman for berlin 's department of education .
" three percent of our teachers are on long-term sick leave , " he said .
" and since the average age of our workforce is 49 , we are dealing with a lot of staff sickness .
what we need here is a greater balance between old and young teachers . "
testing new waters given that no such balance can be injected into the existing system , the educational powers that be have launched a trial scheme whereby a number of schools budget for their own needs .
" each school is allocated a certain budget from which they can employ substitute teachers as required , " stiller said .
" they use retired teachers , those on maternity leave or those in the final stages of their teacher training . "
it 's a novel scheme , which stiller said was working well , but it remains to be seen how well it would fare were it expanded to schools across the city .
" there are only so many trained teachers out there available to work as substitute staff , and they might be too few to go around , " he pointed out .
" guaranteed teaching " earlier this year , the state of hesse launched an initiative to tackle that very problem .
under its " guaranteed-teaching " scheme , it has created pools of substitute staff - only in this instance , teaching qualifications and experience are not a prerequisite .
nonetheless , christian boergen of hesse 's department of education said it was an improvement over the days when cut classes were a run-of-the-mill occurrence .
" it 's good for teachers to know someone will cover for them when they are sick , and for parents to know their children wo n't be walking the streets because a class has been cancelled , " he said .

hartwig schröder , the head of the union 's legal department , is horrified by the department of education 's willingness to use retired teachers , students and housewives to take over at the blackboard .
" the majority of those employed as part of the guaranteed-teaching project do not have the qualifications which used to be required to be able to teach , " he said .
" it is a slap in the face for the profession . "
unlike the test project in berlin , guaranteed teaching has not been restricted to a handful of schools , but has already been put into practice across the state .

barcelona lost 1-0 to chelsea on wednesday . " we are in the mix now and have a chance to get through to the next phase , " said german international miroslav klose .
" we have sofia away and then chelsea at home .
chelsea are a great team but if we play like we did against barcelona we are capable of beating them . " without midfield duo tim borowski and frank baumann through injury , bremen lacked drive from midfield , but german international defender christian schulz had their first chance with his 24th minute effort whistling wide of the right hand post . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's diego , center , is attacked by sofia 's hristo yovov during the group a champions league match sofia , who had lost their first two matches against barcelona and chelsea , looked set to make it to the half-time break at 0-0 but paid the price for a terrible defensive wall .
naldo drilled a 25 yard free-kick straight through the collapsing wall and the unsighted sofia goalkeeper had no chance with the ball going in off the inside of the post . brazilian playmaker diego , a summer signing from fc porto , made a second goal on 74 minutes , and bremen took the spoils . bremen 's next european match is away to sofia on oct .

however , they have a big domestic game saturday when they face reigning bundesliga champions bayern munich . schweinsteiger turns hero meanwhile , bayern munich 's dismissed midfielder bastian schweinsteiger turned from hero to villain on wednesday , when he scored the solo goal in their own champions league match against sporting lisbon . schweinsteiger 's 19th minute screamer means the germans are almost certain to qualify from group b , following this third consecutive victory , barring a dramatic loss of form by felix magath 's men . bavarian defender daniel van buyten said afterwards : " we really kept battling in the second half although we were down to 10 men .
all the players fought hard and showed good team spirit and we managed to keep possession of the ball and have scoring chances of our own . " schweinsteiger first made his mark with the goal , following organized buildup play by bayern .
his 30-meter shot rifled past well-beaten sporting keeper ricardo for his second goal of the tournament and bayern 's seventh , with none conceded . six minutes later schweinsteiger earned a yellow card , following a challenge on nani , which paved the way for his exit for a second booking two minutes after the break for a trip on second-half substitute yannick djalo . schweinsteiger will now miss bayern 's fourth match at home to sporting in a fortnight where a point for the germans would suffice to progress . dw staff / dpa / afp -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de does the bundesliga have a world cup hangover ?

" it is highly probable that berlin can sort out its budget difficulties itself , " said winfried hassemer , vice-president of the court . government duty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin is the seat of germany 's federal government and parliament legally , the government is obliged to bail out a cash-strapped state so long as it has made the requisite budget savings and undertaken sufficient austerity measures .

cultural spending has seen massive cuts and civil servant salaries have been reduced .

they argue that the government slashed its post-reunification aid too soon - before the city had time to stabilize . resentment in the south bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber but the government as well as a number of other states argued that berlin did not meet the criteria for aid , and that with seven of germany 's 16 states are currently in debt , it is not the only one in financial dire straits . other states , including bavaria and baden-württemberg , point out that berlin has consistently overspent and failed to privatize state holdings . " berlin could have done far more to tighten its belt , " said baden-württemberg 's finance minister gerhard stratthaus -lrb- cdu -rrb- in an interview with weekly magazine der spiegel . bavarian state premier edmund stoiber , meanwhile , has insisted that " solidarity has its limits . " major cuts ahead the ruling will raise pressure on the capital to sell assets and cut spending in a city which has three opera companies , two zoos and what other regional states claim is a cultural scene way beyond its financial means .

" i firmly believe that completing the internal market for postal services is vital for securing further improvements and for sustaining the progress and results achieved to date , " he said . " in preparing the proposal , we have put consumer and user needs first , " he added . " universal delivery " in danger ? german national postal system deutsche post , which is already slated to give up its monopoly in 2008 , and the german government welcomed the commissioner 's plan . on the contrary , consumer protection advocates said they were concerned about the fate of universal mail delivery in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the digital age has not made postal services obsolete - quite the contrary patrick von braunmühl of the federation of german consumer organizations said it was still unclear how the postal service could make good on a promise of universal mail delivery without the support of the state . in contrast to the effect of liberalized telecoms markets , he said , consumers can not expect significantly lower postage prices .
at most , bulk clients could expect rebates , but normal customers will see little , if any , benefit .
it could even be the case that business clients get price cuts at the expense of individual users . but eu commissioner mccreevy tried to assuage these fears , saying the postal system will continue to deliver the mail universally after liberalization .
deutsche post and other ex-monopolies in the eu are required to " deliver and pick up letters and packages at least five times a week , at good quality and competitive prices , " he reiterated . not just packages " when the market opens completely in 2009 , we can expect more innovation , better service , and higher cost efficiency , " mccreevy said .
he said this was the case for postal services in great britain , sweden and finland , which already made the switch . the current plan follows earlier waves of postal liberalization : in 1997 and 2002 .
at that time , the markets for the delivery of packages and letters weighing more than 50 grams were opened to competition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissoner charlie mccreevy wants an level playing field in europe now , mccreevy aims to break state monopolies for the delivery of letters weighing less than 50 grams by 2009 while guaranteeing mail services throughout each country . " without -lrb- liberalization -rrb- , eu postal markets will be increasingly unable to meet the challenges of the communications revolution , " the irish commissioner said . the proposal to fully liberalize the postal market will need the backing of member state governments and the european parliament to go into effect .
past efforts to liberalize the postal market have met fierce opposition in some countries , and this time is likely to be no different . states complain last week 10 national postal services voiced concern about how , under the reform , they would be allowed to cover the considerable cost of meeting universal delivery obligations without the backing of the state . the belgian , cypriot , french , greek , hungarian , italian , luxembourg , maltese , polish and spanish postal services said in a joint statement there was " no proof of the efficiency of the measures planned by the commission " to finance the obligation . in response to such concerns , the commission proposed a range of funding options as well as the possibility of dividing the responsibility to provide full geographic coverage among different postal services . " growing industry " " i 'm well aware that there will be considerable lobbying on all sides but it 's hardly fair to have some very large markets opened up to competition and other markets that are not , " mccreevy said . he added : " this industry is not a dying industry , it 's a growing one , it 's a very dynamic one and it 's a very profitable for those who operate it efficiently .
and that 's why operators want to get into it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 19.10.2006 eu seeks open postal markets by 2009 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german letter carriers often cover their routes by bike - luckily this time without rain , snow , sleet or hail the european commission laid out plans to complete the opening of the european union 's postal-services market to competition by 2009 despite fierce opposition from some countries . on wednesday , eu internal market commissioner charlie mccreevy , who is behind the plan , wants to build on the perceived success of britain , finland , germany , the netherlands and sweden , which have already opened their postal markets to competition . " i firmly believe that completing the internal market for postal services is vital for securing further improvements and for sustaining the progress and results achieved to date , " he said . " in preparing the proposal , we have put consumer and user needs first , " he added . " universal delivery " in danger ? german national postal system deutsche post , which is already slated to give up its monopoly in 2008 , and the german government welcomed the commissioner 's plan . on the contrary , consumer protection advocates said they were concerned about the fate of universal mail delivery in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the digital age has not made postal services obsolete - quite the contrary patrick von braunmühl of the federation of german consumer organizations said it was still unclear how the postal service could make good on a promise of universal mail delivery without the support of the state . in contrast to the effect of liberalized telecoms markets , he said , consumers can not expect significantly lower postage prices .
at most , bulk clients could expect rebates , but normal customers will see little , if any , benefit .
it could even be the case that business clients get price cuts at the expense of individual users . but eu commissioner mccreevy tried to assuage these fears , saying the postal system will continue to deliver the mail universally after liberalization .
deutsche post and other ex-monopolies in the eu are required to " deliver and pick up letters and packages at least five times a week , at good quality and competitive prices , " he reiterated . not just packages " when the market opens completely in 2009 , we can expect more innovation , better service , and higher cost efficiency , " mccreevy said .
he said this was the case for postal services in great britain , sweden and finland , which already made the switch . the current plan follows earlier waves of postal liberalization : in 1997 and 2002 .
at that time , the markets for the delivery of packages and letters weighing more than 50 grams were opened to competition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissoner charlie mccreevy wants an level playing field in europe now , mccreevy aims to break state monopolies for the delivery of letters weighing less than 50 grams by 2009 while guaranteeing mail services throughout each country . " without -lrb- liberalization -rrb- , eu postal markets will be increasingly unable to meet the challenges of the communications revolution , " the irish commissioner said . the proposal to fully liberalize the postal market will need the backing of member state governments and the european parliament to go into effect .
past efforts to liberalize the postal market have met fierce opposition in some countries , and this time is likely to be no different . states complain last week 10 national postal services voiced concern about how , under the reform , they would be allowed to cover the considerable cost of meeting universal delivery obligations without the backing of the state . the belgian , cypriot , french , greek , hungarian , italian , luxembourg , maltese , polish and spanish postal services said in a joint statement there was " no proof of the efficiency of the measures planned by the commission " to finance the obligation . in response to such concerns , the commission proposed a range of funding options as well as the possibility of dividing the responsibility to provide full geographic coverage among different postal services . " growing industry " " i 'm well aware that there will be considerable lobbying on all sides but it 's hardly fair to have some very large markets opened up to competition and other markets that are not , " mccreevy said . he added : " this industry is not a dying industry , it 's a growing one , it 's a very dynamic one and it 's a very profitable for those who operate it efficiently .
and that 's why operators want to get into it .

" the accusations must be immediately investigated , " said spd defense expert rainer arnold on thursday . both partners in germany 's coalition government have agreed to investigate claims made by the german-born turk that he had been physically mistreated by troops from the special operations ksk unit of the german army , the bundeswehr . while the government has confirmed that that ksk soldiers had been in touch with murnaz , a defense ministry official said wednesday that they had " verbal contact " with him in a us detention center in afghanistan , but there was no proof to back up his claims he was physically abused . murat kurnaz , 24 , was released in august after spending four years from the us military jail in guantanamo bay . us investigators had claimed he was an islamist " enemy combatant " with links to terrorist organization al qaeda . verbal contact only defense ministry officials revealed that 69 soldiers had been questioned about the incident . from the replies of a handful of soldiers it had been established that after kurnaz 's arrest in pakistan in 2001 , german forces were alerted by their us counterparts that one of the detainees spoke german . one of the german soldiers allegedly told kurnaz : " you were on the wrong side .

germany 's highest court ruled thursday that berlin is not getting a helping hand from the federal government to put its financial house in order .
what does that mean for the capital ? it seems as if every week , there is a new expensive museum or monument or refurbished relic opening in germany 's capital .
amid such lavish spending , it might appear odd to hear berlin officials complaining over a mountain of debt , even taking the federal government to court for more money .
berlin officials have long argued they are entitled to federal help with at least 60 percent of their 62-billion-euro -lrb- $ 77 billion -rrb- debt under a law that requires transfer payments between german states and the federal government in times of financial need .
after all , they have cut costs and sold off assets , they say .
and there is precedent - a 1992 court ruling forced the federal government to help bremen and saarland with their debt .
" we can not climb down from this debt mountain alone , " berlin mayor klaus wowereit told the german constitutional court in karlsruhe .
" we have done everything we can and now need federal solidarity .
berlin is a sexy but poor city . "
thursday , however , the court disagreed saying that berlin failed to qualify for emergency aid under the constitution rules .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal goverment is struggling to put the entire house in order " berlin adorns itself with the slogan ' poor but sexy ' but it is n't so poor , " said presiding judge winfried hassemer .
" berlin does n't have a budget emergency .
significant indicators point only to a budget that is under stress which berlin can in all probability overcome on its own . "
so what now ? christian schmidt of the berlin-based industrial investment council , an agency that promotes investment in the east , says he was surprised by the court decision and thinks people did n't expect it would be so harsh .
" ' poor but sexy ' obviously failed to impress the judges , " he said .
" berlin has even tougher times ahead . "
experts say things looks pretty bleak for the city of 3.4 million known for its vibrant arts , academic and cultural life , one in which the tourism and building sectors are growing .
that is because the city is burdened by massive debt and interest payments of 2.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.1 billion -rrb- annually .
the city has a very small industrial base and little hope of expanding it .
the unemployment rate is the third highest of any of germany 's 16 states , at 17 percent .
most of the problems date back to the end of world war ii when most large companies moved their headquarters to west germany - for example , siemens moved to munich and the banking industry fled to frankfurt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bode museum was just the latest new offering after german reunification in 1990 , east german industry collapsed when state subsidies were cut .
also , berlin failed to stop spending at a rate it was used to , especially when federal payments were slashed in 1995 from almost 8 million euros to 2 million euros .
as a result , since 1991 , berlin 's debt has risen nearly six-fold , from 10 billion to 61 billion euros , giving it the highest per capita debt level of any state in germany .
the city has lost about 100,000 industrial jobs since 1990 .
" in 15 years , we are going to be showing people from china around and hoping for a euro in tip , " said one economic expert .
" wealth is going south and i am not optimistic about berlin 's situation . "
tougher measures needed the judges said that poor political decision-making led to berlin 's financial situation , something that " federal aid is n't there to remedy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin : all that glitters is not gold they wrote that berlin needs to increase the local commercial tax rate and sell more of its assets , such as the state 's 270,000 housing units estimated to be worth about 4 billion euros and the landesbank berlin holding ag , worth 5 billion euros .
reducing wages for its civil servants is another area in need of attention - berlin employees are paid 50 percent more than those in hamburg , for example .
another issue is cutting subsidies that fund redundancies such as the city 's three operas , two zoos and six housing authorities , something that arose because berlin was divided . " to reconcile the two cities , well that was a tough thing , " said schmidt .
" but it took too long and no one had the guts cut into the meat . "
only way out schmidt says , however , that even so , berlin is in a tough predicament because even if it sold off a lot of its assets , it would n't cover the debt .
he praises berlin 's finance minister , theo sarrazin , for taking some harsh measures such as cutting subsides and 70,000 jobs and has managed to balance the budget for the first time - berlin has cut spending by about 11 percent since 1995 , the biggest savings made by any state .
the only way out is to focus on berlin 's advantages , its human capital and vibrant cultural life , experts say .
" i can not image that most industries and sectors that have left berlin will return , " said dieter vesper , an economist with the german institute for economic research .
" so the only choice berlin has is to try to develop sectors which are important in the future such as the health industry and the research and education sector , both areas which berlin already has an advantage .
but the only way to do this is to develop better links between these sectors and the business community . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin and wowereit say berlin needs the help another area to watch is if the federal government moves more of its people to berlin as many expect it to do - currently almost half of all government employees work outside the capital .
schmidt said he thinks that berlin will cease to be an independent state in 15 years and instead will merge with brandenburg , the state that surrounds it .
" that would help stop the rivalry and help lure investors , " he said .
" it would also trim administrative budgets , help universities to work more collaboratively .
there is no quick fix for berlin but there is no reason why the city ca n't survive with all it offers .

berlin officials have long argued they are entitled to federal help with at least 60 percent of their 62-billion-euro -lrb- $ 77 billion -rrb- debt under a law that requires transfer payments between german states and the federal government in times of financial need .
after all , they have cut costs and sold off assets , they say .
and there is precedent - a 1992 court ruling forced the federal government to help bremen and saarland with their debt .
" we can not climb down from this debt mountain alone , " berlin mayor klaus wowereit told the german constitutional court in karlsruhe .
" we have done everything we can and now need federal solidarity .
berlin is a sexy but poor city . "
thursday , however , the court disagreed saying that berlin failed to qualify for emergency aid under the constitution rules .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal goverment is struggling to put the entire house in order " berlin adorns itself with the slogan ' poor but sexy ' but it is n't so poor , " said presiding judge winfried hassemer .
" berlin does n't have a budget emergency .
significant indicators point only to a budget that is under stress which berlin can in all probability overcome on its own . "
so what now ? christian schmidt of the berlin-based industrial investment council , an agency that promotes investment in the east , says he was surprised by the court decision and thinks people did n't expect it would be so harsh .
" ' poor but sexy ' obviously failed to impress the judges , " he said .
" berlin has even tougher times ahead . "
experts say things looks pretty bleak for the city of 3.4 million known for its vibrant arts , academic and cultural life , one in which the tourism and building sectors are growing .
that is because the city is burdened by massive debt and interest payments of 2.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.1 billion -rrb- annually .
the city has a very small industrial base and little hope of expanding it .
the unemployment rate is the third highest of any of germany 's 16 states , at 17 percent .
most of the problems date back to the end of world war ii when most large companies moved their headquarters to west germany - for example , siemens moved to munich and the banking industry fled to frankfurt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bode museum was just the latest new offering after german reunification in 1990 , east german industry collapsed when state subsidies were cut .
also , berlin failed to stop spending at a rate it was used to , especially when federal payments were slashed in 1995 from almost 8 million euros to 2 million euros .
as a result , since 1991 , berlin 's debt has risen nearly six-fold , from 10 billion to 61 billion euros , giving it the highest per capita debt level of any state in germany .
the city has lost about 100,000 industrial jobs since 1990 .
" in 15 years , we are going to be showing people from china around and hoping for a euro in tip , " said one economic expert .
" wealth is going south and i am not optimistic about berlin 's situation . "
tougher measures needed the judges said that poor political decision-making led to berlin 's financial situation , something that " federal aid is n't there to remedy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin : all that glitters is not gold they wrote that berlin needs to increase the local commercial tax rate and sell more of its assets , such as the state 's 270,000 housing units estimated to be worth about 4 billion euros and the landesbank berlin holding ag , worth 5 billion euros .
reducing wages for its civil servants is another area in need of attention - berlin employees are paid 50 percent more than those in hamburg , for example .
another issue is cutting subsidies that fund redundancies such as the city 's three operas , two zoos and six housing authorities , something that arose because berlin was divided . " to reconcile the two cities , well that was a tough thing , " said schmidt .
" but it took too long and no one had the guts cut into the meat . "
only way out schmidt says , however , that even so , berlin is in a tough predicament because even if it sold off a lot of its assets , it would n't cover the debt .
he praises berlin 's finance minister , theo sarrazin , for taking some harsh measures such as cutting subsides and 70,000 jobs and has managed to balance the budget for the first time - berlin has cut spending by about 11 percent since 1995 , the biggest savings made by any state .
the only way out is to focus on berlin 's advantages , its human capital and vibrant cultural life , experts say .
" i can not image that most industries and sectors that have left berlin will return , " said dieter vesper , an economist with the german institute for economic research .
" so the only choice berlin has is to try to develop sectors which are important in the future such as the health industry and the research and education sector , both areas which berlin already has an advantage .
but the only way to do this is to develop better links between these sectors and the business community . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin and wowereit say berlin needs the help another area to watch is if the federal government moves more of its people to berlin as many expect it to do - currently almost half of all government employees work outside the capital .
schmidt said he thinks that berlin will cease to be an independent state in 15 years and instead will merge with brandenburg , the state that surrounds it .
" that would help stop the rivalry and help lure investors , " he said .
" it would also trim administrative budgets , help universities to work more collaboratively .
there is no quick fix for berlin but there is no reason why the city ca n't survive with all it offers .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin : all that glitters is not gold they wrote that berlin needs to increase the local commercial tax rate and sell more of its assets , such as the state 's 270,000 housing units estimated to be worth about 4 billion euros and the landesbank berlin holding ag , worth 5 billion euros .
reducing wages for its civil servants is another area in need of attention - berlin employees are paid 50 percent more than those in hamburg , for example .
another issue is cutting subsidies that fund redundancies such as the city 's three operas , two zoos and six housing authorities , something that arose because berlin was divided . " to reconcile the two cities , well that was a tough thing , " said schmidt .
" but it took too long and no one had the guts cut into the meat . "
only way out schmidt says , however , that even so , berlin is in a tough predicament because even if it sold off a lot of its assets , it would n't cover the debt .
he praises berlin 's finance minister , theo sarrazin , for taking some harsh measures such as cutting subsides and 70,000 jobs and has managed to balance the budget for the first time - berlin has cut spending by about 11 percent since 1995 , the biggest savings made by any state .
the only way out is to focus on berlin 's advantages , its human capital and vibrant cultural life , experts say .
" i can not image that most industries and sectors that have left berlin will return , " said dieter vesper , an economist with the german institute for economic research .
" so the only choice berlin has is to try to develop sectors which are important in the future such as the health industry and the research and education sector , both areas which berlin already has an advantage .
but the only way to do this is to develop better links between these sectors and the business community . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin and wowereit say berlin needs the help another area to watch is if the federal government moves more of its people to berlin as many expect it to do - currently almost half of all government employees work outside the capital .
schmidt said he thinks that berlin will cease to be an independent state in 15 years and instead will merge with brandenburg , the state that surrounds it .
" that would help stop the rivalry and help lure investors , " he said .
" it would also trim administrative budgets , help universities to work more collaboratively .
there is no quick fix for berlin but there is no reason why the city ca n't survive with all it offers .

a norwegian student on a field trip to berlin though he had made the deal of his life - until he got arrested buying deodorant . what some people call growing up is really no more than an endless series of gaffes , blunders and embarrassing missteps .
possessed by the ultimate fear of being left out of the fun , overconfident and dysfunctionally competitive teenagers simply ca n't help getting into trouble . earlier this week , a 16-year-old norwegian student struck a conversation with a stranger on alexanderplatz , a large square in the heart of former east berlin dominated by communist-era architecture and vague attempts to hide it behind renovated facades . aside from the fact that the norwegian student should have known better than to talk to strangers in general , a little bit of curiosity for the cultural milieu of his surroundings would have opened his eyes to the fact that many people were leaving the square in tears . why do people usually cry on alexanderplatz ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's always something fun to do at alexanderplatz the matchbox mafia is one of the most lucrative sections of the international brotherhood of charlatans .
their brilliant idea of cheating people out of their money by making them play a guessing game with matchboxes and a 50-euro banknote never seems to fail to attract an army of gullible lost souls . berlin 's alexanderplatz practically serves as the matchbox swindlers ' headquarters . the young norwegian , however , was oblivious to this fact .
he was also - as he later admitted - a little tipsy .
but that 's what teenagers do on their field trips , after all .
getting to know a foreign country and culture is always more difficult when you 're completely sober . here 's the deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lesson number one should be : do not engage in money laundering the man who approached the inebriated norwegian student asked him if he wanted to change some money for him .
usually , when people ask for change , they need a few euros to buy cigarettes , a subway ticket or a drink .

" berlin could have done far more to tighten its belt , " said baden-württemberg 's finance minister gerhard stratthaus -lrb- cdu -rrb- in an interview with weekly magazine der spiegel . bavarian state premier edmund stoiber , meanwhile , has insisted that " solidarity has its limits .

" we have sofia away and then chelsea at home .
chelsea are a great team but if we play like we did against barcelona we are capable of beating them .

" growing industry " " i 'm well aware that there will be considerable lobbying on all sides but it 's hardly fair to have some very large markets opened up to competition and other markets that are not , " mccreevy said . he added : " this industry is not a dying industry , it 's a growing one , it 's a very dynamic one and it 's a very profitable for those who operate it efficiently .

" i firmly believe that completing the internal market for postal services is vital for securing further improvements and for sustaining the progress and results achieved to date , " he said . " in preparing the proposal , we have put consumer and user needs first , " he added . " universal delivery " in danger ? german national postal system deutsche post , which is already slated to give up its monopoly in 2008 , and the german government welcomed the commissioner 's plan . on the contrary , consumer protection advocates said they were concerned about the fate of universal mail delivery in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the digital age has not made postal services obsolete - quite the contrary patrick von braunmühl of the federation of german consumer organizations said it was still unclear how the postal service could make good on a promise of universal mail delivery without the support of the state . in contrast to the effect of liberalized telecoms markets , he said , consumers can not expect significantly lower postage prices .
at most , bulk clients could expect rebates , but normal customers will see little , if any , benefit .
it could even be the case that business clients get price cuts at the expense of individual users . but eu commissioner mccreevy tried to assuage these fears , saying the postal system will continue to deliver the mail universally after liberalization .
deutsche post and other ex-monopolies in the eu are required to " deliver and pick up letters and packages at least five times a week , at good quality and competitive prices , " he reiterated . not just packages " when the market opens completely in 2009 , we can expect more innovation , better service , and higher cost efficiency , " mccreevy said .
he said this was the case for postal services in great britain , sweden and finland , which already made the switch . the current plan follows earlier waves of postal liberalization : in 1997 and 2002 .
at that time , the markets for the delivery of packages and letters weighing more than 50 grams were opened to competition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissoner charlie mccreevy wants an level playing field in europe now , mccreevy aims to break state monopolies for the delivery of letters weighing less than 50 grams by 2009 while guaranteeing mail services throughout each country . " without -lrb- liberalization -rrb- , eu postal markets will be increasingly unable to meet the challenges of the communications revolution , " the irish commissioner said . the proposal to fully liberalize the postal market will need the backing of member state governments and the european parliament to go into effect .
past efforts to liberalize the postal market have met fierce opposition in some countries , and this time is likely to be no different . states complain last week 10 national postal services voiced concern about how , under the reform , they would be allowed to cover the considerable cost of meeting universal delivery obligations without the backing of the state . the belgian , cypriot , french , greek , hungarian , italian , luxembourg , maltese , polish and spanish postal services said in a joint statement there was " no proof of the efficiency of the measures planned by the commission " to finance the obligation . in response to such concerns , the commission proposed a range of funding options as well as the possibility of dividing the responsibility to provide full geographic coverage among different postal services . " growing industry " " i 'm well aware that there will be considerable lobbying on all sides but it 's hardly fair to have some very large markets opened up to competition and other markets that are not , " mccreevy said . he added : " this industry is not a dying industry , it 's a growing one , it 's a very dynamic one and it 's a very profitable for those who operate it efficiently .
and that 's why operators want to get into it .

principals up and down the country are practiced in the chaotic art of last-minute reorganization of timetables and redistribution of their teachers in order to provide as much education as they possibly can .
but for all their efforts , it remains the case that each week children across germany are granted extra playtime , because there simply are n't enough teachers around to teach them .
for the most part , the teachers are absent as a result of little more than minor ailments , and though the consequences might seem significant to an average nine-year old , parents , unions and political opponents would beg to differ .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : packing up time - the joys of sick teachers according to official figures , which vary from one state to another , an average of between 2 and 3 percent of all school classes fall by the wayside annually .
but that is by no means the whole picture .
last year , teachers in berlin were absent for a total of 10.1 percent of scheduled classes , and although three-quarters were spared cancellation by having other staff fill in , the replacements were not always teachers .
too many timetable irregularities katrin schulze-bernt , the berlin christian democrats ' education spokeswoman , said she was concerned that , as things stand , children are not getting their full quota of prescribed learning .
" every 10th hour is not taught by the regular teacher , and i 'm concerned that the replacements used are not always professionals , but are sometimes just after-school carers who can not actually teach . "
indeed primary schools in berlin do regularly have to fall back on the help of after-school carers to keep the children entertained throughout the course of the school day .
high schools students , meanwhile , must be prepared to accept whichever teacher and subject their moveable timetables serve up .
neither scenario is ideal , and both lead to unwanted disruptions for which there appears to be no quick-fix cure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education , school , learning !
across the board , the problem is a combination of job-for-life contracts , teacher burnout syndrome , strapped-for-cash local authorities , and no established culture of working with substitute teachers .
and it 's likely to get worse before it gets better , according to jens stiller , a spokesman for berlin 's department of education .
" three percent of our teachers are on long-term sick leave , " he said .
" and since the average age of our workforce is 49 , we are dealing with a lot of staff sickness .
what we need here is a greater balance between old and young teachers . "
testing new waters given that no such balance can be injected into the existing system , the educational powers that be have launched a trial scheme whereby a number of schools budget for their own needs .
" each school is allocated a certain budget from which they can employ substitute teachers as required , " stiller said .
" they use retired teachers , those on maternity leave or those in the final stages of their teacher training . "
it 's a novel scheme , which stiller said was working well , but it remains to be seen how well it would fare were it expanded to schools across the city .
" there are only so many trained teachers out there available to work as substitute staff , and they might be too few to go around , " he pointed out .
" guaranteed teaching " earlier this year , the state of hesse launched an initiative to tackle that very problem .
under its " guaranteed-teaching " scheme , it has created pools of substitute staff - only in this instance , teaching qualifications and experience are not a prerequisite .
nonetheless , christian boergen of hesse 's department of education said it was an improvement over the days when cut classes were a run-of-the-mill occurrence .
" it 's good for teachers to know someone will cover for them when they are sick , and for parents to know their children wo n't be walking the streets because a class has been cancelled , " he said .

" the majority of those employed as part of the guaranteed-teaching project do not have the qualifications which used to be required to be able to teach , " he said .
" it is a slap in the face for the profession . "
unlike the test project in berlin , guaranteed teaching has not been restricted to a handful of schools , but has already been put into practice across the state .

principals up and down the country are practiced in the chaotic art of last-minute reorganization of timetables and redistribution of their teachers in order to provide as much education as they possibly can .
but for all their efforts , it remains the case that each week children across germany are granted extra playtime , because there simply are n't enough teachers around to teach them .

" three percent of our teachers are on long-term sick leave , " he said .

testing new waters given that no such balance can be injected into the existing system , the educational powers that be have launched a trial scheme whereby a number of schools budget for their own needs .
" each school is allocated a certain budget from which they can employ substitute teachers as required , " stiller said .
" they use retired teachers , those on maternity leave or those in the final stages of their teacher training . "
it 's a novel scheme , which stiller said was working well , but it remains to be seen how well it would fare were it expanded to schools across the city .

germany 's highest court ruled thursday that berlin is not getting a helping hand from the federal government to put its financial house in order .
what does that mean for the capital ? it seems as if every week , there is a new expensive museum or monument or refurbished relic opening in germany 's capital .
amid such lavish spending , it might appear odd to hear berlin officials complaining over a mountain of debt , even taking the federal government to court for more money .
berlin officials have long argued they are entitled to federal help with at least 60 percent of their 62-billion-euro -lrb- $ 77 billion -rrb- debt under a law that requires transfer payments between german states and the federal government in times of financial need .
after all , they have cut costs and sold off assets , they say .
and there is precedent - a 1992 court ruling forced the federal government to help bremen and saarland with their debt .
" we can not climb down from this debt mountain alone , " berlin mayor klaus wowereit told the german constitutional court in karlsruhe .
" we have done everything we can and now need federal solidarity .
berlin is a sexy but poor city . "
thursday , however , the court disagreed saying that berlin failed to qualify for emergency aid under the constitution rules .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal goverment is struggling to put the entire house in order " berlin adorns itself with the slogan ' poor but sexy ' but it is n't so poor , " said presiding judge winfried hassemer .
" berlin does n't have a budget emergency .
significant indicators point only to a budget that is under stress which berlin can in all probability overcome on its own . "
so what now ? christian schmidt of the berlin-based industrial investment council , an agency that promotes investment in the east , says he was surprised by the court decision and thinks people did n't expect it would be so harsh .
" ' poor but sexy ' obviously failed to impress the judges , " he said .
" berlin has even tougher times ahead . "
experts say things looks pretty bleak for the city of 3.4 million known for its vibrant arts , academic and cultural life , one in which the tourism and building sectors are growing .
that is because the city is burdened by massive debt and interest payments of 2.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.1 billion -rrb- annually .
the city has a very small industrial base and little hope of expanding it .
the unemployment rate is the third highest of any of germany 's 16 states , at 17 percent .
most of the problems date back to the end of world war ii when most large companies moved their headquarters to west germany - for example , siemens moved to munich and the banking industry fled to frankfurt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bode museum was just the latest new offering after german reunification in 1990 , east german industry collapsed when state subsidies were cut .
also , berlin failed to stop spending at a rate it was used to , especially when federal payments were slashed in 1995 from almost 8 million euros to 2 million euros .
as a result , since 1991 , berlin 's debt has risen nearly six-fold , from 10 billion to 61 billion euros , giving it the highest per capita debt level of any state in germany .
the city has lost about 100,000 industrial jobs since 1990 .
" in 15 years , we are going to be showing people from china around and hoping for a euro in tip , " said one economic expert .
" wealth is going south and i am not optimistic about berlin 's situation . "
tougher measures needed the judges said that poor political decision-making led to berlin 's financial situation , something that " federal aid is n't there to remedy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin : all that glitters is not gold they wrote that berlin needs to increase the local commercial tax rate and sell more of its assets , such as the state 's 270,000 housing units estimated to be worth about 4 billion euros and the landesbank berlin holding ag , worth 5 billion euros .
reducing wages for its civil servants is another area in need of attention - berlin employees are paid 50 percent more than those in hamburg , for example .
another issue is cutting subsidies that fund redundancies such as the city 's three operas , two zoos and six housing authorities , something that arose because berlin was divided . " to reconcile the two cities , well that was a tough thing , " said schmidt .
" but it took too long and no one had the guts cut into the meat . "
only way out schmidt says , however , that even so , berlin is in a tough predicament because even if it sold off a lot of its assets , it would n't cover the debt .
he praises berlin 's finance minister , theo sarrazin , for taking some harsh measures such as cutting subsides and 70,000 jobs and has managed to balance the budget for the first time - berlin has cut spending by about 11 percent since 1995 , the biggest savings made by any state .
the only way out is to focus on berlin 's advantages , its human capital and vibrant cultural life , experts say .
" i can not image that most industries and sectors that have left berlin will return , " said dieter vesper , an economist with the german institute for economic research .
" so the only choice berlin has is to try to develop sectors which are important in the future such as the health industry and the research and education sector , both areas which berlin already has an advantage .
but the only way to do this is to develop better links between these sectors and the business community . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin and wowereit say berlin needs the help another area to watch is if the federal government moves more of its people to berlin as many expect it to do - currently almost half of all government employees work outside the capital .
schmidt said he thinks that berlin will cease to be an independent state in 15 years and instead will merge with brandenburg , the state that surrounds it .
" that would help stop the rivalry and help lure investors , " he said .
" it would also trim administrative budgets , help universities to work more collaboratively .
there is no quick fix for berlin but there is no reason why the city ca n't survive with all it offers .

south wales fire service is urging people celebrating diwali and eid ul fitr to be aware of fire safety in the home during the festivities .
diwali is associated with candle use , while special meals are prepared for eid - both of which the brigade says cause a rise in home fires .
diwali is celebrated by hindus , sikhs and jains , while muslims mark eid .
the brigade , which covers areas including cardiff and newport which both have large communities celebrating the two festivals , says it is concerned that " safety comes second " at times of any celebration , including christmas .
chief fire officer , brian fraser said : " it is ironic and tragic that during periods of celebration there is a dramatic increase in the number of fires amongst many communities .
" it 's not only diwali and eid , but we also see an increase at christmas .
" i would especially urge the celebrating communities to ensure they have a working smoke alarm installed on every floor of their home . "
he said fire statistics from across the uk showed there was an increase in fires during diwali - the festival of lights celebrated by hindus , sikhs and jains .
he said it was because the festival involves the use of candles , tea lights and fireworks .
candle fires increase by over a third during the diwali period and over 20 % of deaths uk-wide are caused by candles occur at this time .
during eid ul fitr , celebrated by muslims to mark the end of ramadan , a month of fasting , the preparation of special celebratory meals increases the risk of cooking fires .
the celebration involves an increased amount of cooking and entertaining in the home .
diwali is on 21 october , with eid on 24 october .

" i would especially urge the celebrating communities to ensure they have a working smoke alarm installed on every floor of their home . "
he said fire statistics from across the uk showed there was an increase in fires during diwali - the festival of lights celebrated by hindus , sikhs and jains .
he said it was because the festival involves the use of candles , tea lights and fireworks .
candle fires increase by over a third during the diwali period and over 20 % of deaths uk-wide are caused by candles occur at this time .
during eid ul fitr , celebrated by muslims to mark the end of ramadan , a month of fasting , the preparation of special celebratory meals increases the risk of cooking fires .
the celebration involves an increased amount of cooking and entertaining in the home .
diwali is on 21 october , with eid on 24 october .

a time to remember those who were lost and to give thanks for those who survived .
a time , too , to look to the future , for a community that lost almost a whole generation .
after a public service on thursday evening , a very private memorial for family and friends will take place on the mountainside cemetery above aberfan on saturday , exactly 40 years after so many lives were marked by tragedy .
there they will lay wreaths and say prayers to remember the 144 people who died as a coal waste tip slid down the mountain engulfing almost two dozen homes and the local junior school .
of the dead , 116 were children . "
i tried to run for the door but i never made it . "
gaynor madgewick , survivor it was misty that morning in the mining village near merthyr tydfil .
the children were looking forward to breaking up for half-term .
but at 0915 the village heard a dreadful sound that was to haunt the community - and indeed a nation - for a lifetime .
gaynor madgewick was eight years old and had just sat down to a maths lesson at pantglas junior school .
" we heard a terrible , terrible sound - a rumbling sound - it was so loud .
we just did n't know what it was , " she said .
" it seemed like the school went numb .
i was suddenly petrified .
" it got louder and louder .
i remember thinking : ' something terrible is going to happen . '
then it just went black .
i tried to run for the door but i never made it .
" next thing i remember is waking up to a terrifying nightmare .
there was chaos , debris everywhere , children everywhere .
a couple of my mates were lying underneath me and at the side of me .
one little boy - a friend - died at the side of me . "
hettie williams was teaching in a nearby classroom when she heard the " indescribable " noise .
she said : " i said to the children : ' quick , get under the desks , something 's coming down on top of us . '
" then the walls started to crack .
i opened the door and it was just black outside .
i could see some light .
there seemed to be a tunnel .
i said to the children : ' it 's fire drill , do n't look left or right ' and they just crawled out through this tunnel . "
all her pupils escaped , but the scene elsewhere was much bleaker .
" there were 34 children in my class - only four survived , " recalled former pupil jeff edwards .
" i walked to school as normal that morning with my best friend robert - minutes later he was dead . "
i was scandalised by the behaviour of lord robens and chiefs of the coal board " professor iain mclean " one minute i was a child walking to school kicking a ball without a care in the world .
the next , i had death on my shoulder . "
as the news broke , rescuers came from everywhere .
miners from the local pit marched through the village to find the school engulfed and firemen were summoned from all over wales .
hundreds just threw a spade in their car and drove to aberfan , desperate to help .
as they dug through the still-moving slurry , every now and again a rescuer would shout out .
a whistle was blown and silence descended as they listened for any hope , any tell-tale sign of life .
but within two hours all hope had gone .
nobody was rescued after 1100 that morning .
it was a week before all the bodies were recovered .
scathing sorrow soon turned to anger .
the national coal board , which owned the mines and tips , tried to claim it was an act of god .
lord robens , the board 's chairman , blamed a natural spring which had been pouring water into the heart of the tip , but said it was impossible to know it was there .
that was untrue however .
it had been common knowledge in the village .
people had previously voiced fears about the tip 's safety .
conclusions from a tribunal of inquiry set up to investigate the disaster were scathing .
the coal board was condemned for its weaknesses and failures , the government criticised , but no one was ever prosecuted , fined or dismissed the disaster caused an outpouring of grief , and £ 1.75m flooded into the village .
then came the second blow .
afraid the tips that remained could slip again , the villagers wanted them removed .
when their demands were n't met they dumped bags of slurry in the welsh office .
the government finally agreed they should be removed , but the village had to pay £ 150,000 from the disaster fund towards the work .
professor iain mclean has carried out extensive research into the disaster and studied at length the findings of the inquiry .
he says : " this was a disaster waiting to happen .
so many lessons should have been learnt and were not .
" i was scandalised by the behaviour of lord robens and chiefs of the coal board , the failure of anyone in authority to understand the traumas of the people of aberfan and the failures of the government - the most notorious forcing the fund to pay for the removal of the tips . "
the cash was eventually repaid 30 years later but without interest payments , and is money the village says is now needed to maintain the graves .
the pain is still as tangible today .
but the villagers do n't dwell on the past and they have launched many projects to bring new work and hope to the area .
many do n't want to speak about their loss and are more keen to talk about rebuilding a future in the village .
the disaster caused division amongst those who lost family and those whose loved ones survived , a split that time has helped to heal .
cliff minett fully understands this .
while his daughter gaynor madgewick was pulled out alive , another daughter and son died at the school that day .
" saturday is no different from any other day for us , " he says .
" it does n't matter if it 's one year or 40 years on - the pain is just the same , the memories as clear today as they were then .
" some will go the cemetery to remember - others will stay at home , but we will never be able to forget what happened in aberfan that day . "

rescuers came from all over wales , but many children perished a time to remember those who were lost and to give thanks for those who survived .
a time , too , to look to the future , for a community that lost almost a whole generation .
after a public service on thursday evening , a very private memorial for family and friends will take place on the mountainside cemetery above aberfan on saturday , exactly 40 years after so many lives were marked by tragedy .
there they will lay wreaths and say prayers to remember the 144 people who died as a coal waste tip slid down the mountain engulfing almost two dozen homes and the local junior school .
of the dead , 116 were children .
i tried to run for the door but i never made it .
gaynor madgewick , survivor survivors ' stories it was misty that morning in the mining village near merthyr tydfil .
the children were looking forward to breaking up for half-term .
but at 0915 the village heard a dreadful sound that was to haunt the community - and indeed a nation - for a lifetime .
gaynor madgewick was eight years old and had just sat down to a maths lesson at pantglas junior school .
" we heard a terrible , terrible sound - a rumbling sound - it was so loud .
we just did n't know what it was , " she said .
" it seemed like the school went numb .
i was suddenly petrified .
gaynor madgewick woke up in the darkness to a ' terrible nightmare ' " it got louder and louder .
i remember thinking : ' something terrible is going to happen . '
then it just went black .
i tried to run for the door but i never made it .
" next thing i remember is waking up to a terrifying nightmare .
there was chaos , debris everywhere , children everywhere .
a couple of my mates were lying underneath me and at the side of me .
one little boy - a friend - died at the side of me . "
hettie williams was teaching in a nearby classroom when she heard the " indescribable " noise .
she said : " i said to the children : ' quick , get under the desks , something 's coming down on top of us . '
" then the walls started to crack .
i opened the door and it was just black outside .
i could see some light .
there seemed to be a tunnel .
i said to the children : ' it 's fire drill , do n't look left or right ' and they just crawled out through this tunnel . "
all her pupils escaped , but the scene elsewhere was much bleaker .
" there were 34 children in my class - only four survived , " recalled former pupil jeff edwards .
" i walked to school as normal that morning with my best friend robert - minutes later he was dead .
i was scandalised by the behaviour of lord robens and chiefs of the coal board professor iain mclean " one minute i was a child walking to school kicking a ball without a care in the world .
the next , i had death on my shoulder . "
as the news broke , rescuers came from everywhere .
miners from the local pit marched through the village to find the school engulfed and firemen were summoned from all over wales .
hundreds just threw a spade in their car and drove to aberfan , desperate to help .
as they dug through the still-moving slurry , every now and again a rescuer would shout out .
a whistle was blown and silence descended as they listened for any hope , any tell-tale sign of life .
but within two hours all hope had gone .
nobody was rescued after 1100 that morning .
it was a week before all the bodies were recovered .
scathing sorrow soon turned to anger .
the national coal board , which owned the mines and tips , tried to claim it was an act of god .
lord robens , the board 's chairman , blamed a natural spring which had been pouring water into the heart of the tip , but said it was impossible to know it was there .
that was untrue however .
it had been common knowledge in the village .
people had previously voiced fears about the tip 's safety .
conclusions from a tribunal of inquiry set up to investigate the disaster were scathing .
the coal board was condemned for its weaknesses and failures , the government criticised , but no one was ever prosecuted , fined or dismissed the disaster caused an outpouring of grief , and £ 1.75m flooded into the village .
then came the second blow .
afraid the tips that remained could slip again , the villagers wanted them removed .
when their demands were n't met they dumped bags of slurry in the welsh office .
the memorial park was built on the school site the government finally agreed they should be removed , but the village had to pay £ 150,000 from the disaster fund towards the work .
professor iain mclean has carried out extensive research into the disaster and studied at length the findings of the inquiry .
he says : " this was a disaster waiting to happen .
so many lessons should have been learnt and were not .
" i was scandalised by the behaviour of lord robens and chiefs of the coal board , the failure of anyone in authority to understand the traumas of the people of aberfan and the failures of the government - the most notorious forcing the fund to pay for the removal of the tips . "
the cash was eventually repaid 30 years later but without interest payments , and is money the village says is now needed to maintain the graves .
the pain is still as tangible today .
but the villagers do n't dwell on the past and they have launched many projects to bring new work and hope to the area .
many do n't want to speak about their loss and are more keen to talk about rebuilding a future in the village .
the disaster caused division amongst those who lost family and those whose loved ones survived , a split that time has helped to heal .
cliff minett fully understands this .
while his daughter gaynor madgewick was pulled out alive , another daughter and son died at the school that day .
" saturday is no different from any other day for us , " he says .
" it does n't matter if it 's one year or 40 years on - the pain is just the same , the memories as clear today as they were then .
" some will go the cemetery to remember - others will stay at home , but we will never be able to forget what happened in aberfan that day . "

the year-on-year growth rate fell back from the record 11.3 % growth seen from april to june , official data showed .
the government has raised interest rates twice this year and cut approvals for new business investment as it tries to prevent the economy overheating .
the latest data put inflation at 1.3 % and showed industrial output slowing .
' effective measures ' china has taken steps to dampen its economy because it worries that double-digit growth in investment and lending could soar out of control , fuelling inflation and leaving banks exposed to bad debts .
" these effective measures have successfully avoided the fast growth of the economy turning into an overheating , " said a spokesman for the national bureau of statistics .
four consecutive years of growth at over 10 % have seen china pass britain to become the world 's fourth largest economy .

bbc news -pipe- technology -pipe- telecoms open up for deaf people bbc news / technology graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- thursday , 19 october 2006 , 06:37 gmt 07:37 uk telecoms open up for deaf people by geoff adams-spink age & disability correspondent , bbc news website services developed by uk organisations will help some hearing-impaired people to participate more fully in phone calls and meetings .
a bedfordshire company will soon start two new services using internet devices and voice recognition technology .
and the royal national institute for deaf people -lrb- rnid -rrb- is launching the screenphone .
both products turn voice calls or meetings into text and are aimed at deaf people who prefer to speak .
the screenphone costs just over £ 200 and uses the rnid 's typetalk service .
the organisation estimates that it could be of benefit to almost half a million people .
the call is connected by a typetalk operator so that the hard of hearing person is able to use their own voice but the other person 's responses are typed and presented as text on the screenphone 's display .
the rnid says that people who lose their hearing during adulthood often prefer to use their own voice for making phone calls .
until now , text phones have required the user to type what they want to say - something which some older people have found difficult .
the screenphone is made by geemarc and has a large screen with adjustable font sizes .
" this is a very exciting breakthrough for people who are losing their hearing and can no longer use the telephone , " said mark downs , rnid 's executive director of technology and enterprise .
the rnid says that - in people who are losing their hearing - the ear 's ability to separate sounds gradually reaches a point at which they can no longer distinguish between different parts of speech .
simply providing sound amplification does not overcome this problem .
bedfordshire-based teletec has announced two services that use an internet device - a computer , pda or smartphone - as well as a phone connection .
webcaptel connects two callers via an operator who then repeats the conversation into voice recognition software which then displays the whole thing as text on the deaf person 's hardware .
teletec says that there will be a 3 or 4 second delay between a person speaking and the text appearing .
the company 's personal communicating service uses the same technology to give a hearing-impaired person access to a face-to-face meeting .
in this case the teletec operator - or captioning assistant - listens to the meeting using a conference phone or even a mobile handset .
the captioning assistants have to be specially trained to be able to listen and speak at the same time - a skill similar to that of a simultaneous translator .
" if somebody mumbles or the captioning assistant does n't quite catch what 's being said they press the ' unclear ' button , " explained david hart of teletec .
" this will then give the person reading the text the opportunity to tell the person they 're speaking to that they did n't catch what was said so it can be repeated . "
both webcaptel and personal communicating are expected to be launched early next year .
while both the teletec and the rnid systems do similar things , one of the main differences will be the cost to the end user .
screenphone will cost the same as an ordinary phone call once the handset has been purchased .
webcaptel and personal communicating will cost £ 1 per minute .
according to david hart of teletec , this cost can often be met in a business environment by the government 's access to work fund .
and he points out that in the case of shorter meetings - for example a 20-minute medical consultation - the cost would be a lot less than using a british sign language interpreter .
telecoms regulator , ofcom , is being lobbied to create a fund to subsidise the cost of calls to services like webcaptel .

a bedfordshire company will soon start two new services using internet devices and voice recognition technology .
and the royal national institute for deaf people -lrb- rnid -rrb- is launching the screenphone .
both products turn voice calls or meetings into text and are aimed at deaf people who prefer to speak .
the screenphone costs just over £ 200 and uses the rnid 's typetalk service .
the organisation estimates that it could be of benefit to almost half a million people .
the call is connected by a typetalk operator so that the hard of hearing person is able to use their own voice but the other person 's responses are typed and presented as text on the screenphone 's display .
the rnid says that people who lose their hearing during adulthood often prefer to use their own voice for making phone calls .
until now , text phones have required the user to type what they want to say - something which some older people have found difficult .
the screenphone is made by geemarc and has a large screen with adjustable font sizes .
" this is a very exciting breakthrough for people who are losing their hearing and can no longer use the telephone , " said mark downs , rnid 's executive director of technology and enterprise .
the rnid says that - in people who are losing their hearing - the ear 's ability to separate sounds gradually reaches a point at which they can no longer distinguish between different parts of speech .
simply providing sound amplification does not overcome this problem .

" if somebody mumbles or the captioning assistant does n't quite catch what 's being said they press the ' unclear ' button , " explained david hart of teletec .

both webcaptel and personal communicating are expected to be launched early next year .
while both the teletec and the rnid systems do similar things , one of the main differences will be the cost to the end user .
screenphone will cost the same as an ordinary phone call once the handset has been purchased .
webcaptel and personal communicating will cost £ 1 per minute .
according to david hart of teletec , this cost can often be met in a business environment by the government 's access to work fund .
and he points out that in the case of shorter meetings - for example a 20-minute medical consultation - the cost would be a lot less than using a british sign language interpreter .
telecoms regulator , ofcom , is being lobbied to create a fund to subsidise the cost of calls to services like webcaptel .

a bedfordshire company will soon start two new services using internet devices and voice recognition technology .
and the royal national institute for deaf people -lrb- rnid -rrb- is launching the screenphone .
both products turn voice calls or meetings into text and are aimed at deaf people who prefer to speak .
the screenphone costs just over £ 200 and uses the rnid 's typetalk service .
the organisation estimates that it could be of benefit to almost half a million people .
the call is connected by a typetalk operator so that the hard of hearing person is able to use their own voice but the other person 's responses are typed and presented as text on the screenphone 's display .
the rnid says that people who lose their hearing during adulthood often prefer to use their own voice for making phone calls .
until now , text phones have required the user to type what they want to say - something which some older people have found difficult .
the screenphone is made by geemarc and has a large screen with adjustable font sizes .
" this is a very exciting breakthrough for people who are losing their hearing and can no longer use the telephone , " said mark downs , rnid 's executive director of technology and enterprise .
the rnid says that - in people who are losing their hearing - the ear 's ability to separate sounds gradually reaches a point at which they can no longer distinguish between different parts of speech .
simply providing sound amplification does not overcome this problem .
bedfordshire-based teletec has announced two services that use an internet device - a computer , pda or smartphone - as well as a phone connection .
webcaptel connects two callers via an operator who then repeats the conversation into voice recognition software which then displays the whole thing as text on the deaf person 's hardware .
teletec says that there will be a 3 or 4 second delay between a person speaking and the text appearing .
the company 's personal communicating service uses the same technology to give a hearing-impaired person access to a face-to-face meeting .

the total sum surpasses the amount the region receives in direct foreign investment and official development aid from international donors .
a third of the remittances go to mexico , making it the country 's second largest source of income after oil .
the report was compiled by washington based inter-american development bank .
another $ 15bn is sent home by latin americans living in countries other than the united states , the report says .
more lucrative life the report 's findings illustrate the uphill challenge that those who favour building fences and walls to keep latin american immigrants out of the united states face .
the $ 45bn that latin american immigrants will have sent home by the end of 2006 - more than 50 % higher than the figure was just two years ago - will keep food on the tables of millions of their relatives , help pay the rent and in some cases , will keep entire families afloat .
the study , based on a telephone survey of immigrants , also demonstrates that the majority of those polled find life in the us a great deal more lucrative than the life they left behind .
most of those surveyed said that while they did not have full-time jobs back home , they found one within a month of moving to the us , with 38 % finding a job in less than two weeks .
the average salary for their first job , according to the study , was $ 900 a month , about six times more than what the majority said they could expect to earn in their home countries .
perhaps more telling is the fact that the money they send back home surpasses the amount of money the countries receive in direct foreign investment and official development aid .

the total sum surpasses the amount the region receives in direct foreign investment and official development aid from international donors .
a third of the remittances go to mexico , making it the country 's second largest source of income after oil .
the report was compiled by washington based inter-american development bank .
another $ 15bn is sent home by latin americans living in countries other than the united states , the report says .
more lucrative life the report 's findings illustrate the uphill challenge that those who favour building fences and walls to keep latin american immigrants out of the united states face .
the $ 45bn that latin american immigrants will have sent home by the end of 2006 - more than 50 % higher than the figure was just two years ago - will keep food on the tables of millions of their relatives , help pay the rent and in some cases , will keep entire families afloat .
the study , based on a telephone survey of immigrants , also demonstrates that the majority of those polled find life in the us a great deal more lucrative than the life they left behind .
most of those surveyed said that while they did not have full-time jobs back home , they found one within a month of moving to the us , with 38 % finding a job in less than two weeks .
the average salary for their first job , according to the study , was $ 900 a month , about six times more than what the majority said they could expect to earn in their home countries .
perhaps more telling is the fact that the money they send back home surpasses the amount of money the countries receive in direct foreign investment and official development aid .

over a prolonged period this leads to weight gain .
experts want the government to take sleep-deprivation as seriously as diet and exercise in the obesity battle .
the researchers at bristol university say the evidence is stark .
energy ' imbalance ' dr taheri told the bbc : " there is a really clear relationship between short sleep duration and obesity in children . "
he said obesity occurs because of the " imbalance between the energy that we take in - the foods that we eat -and the energy we burn , which is our physical activity " .
dr taheri added " there is a very good relationship between physical activity and good sleep " .
the expert said this link was due to the fact that physical activity would make children tired , whereas youngsters were less likely to sleep well if they had been watching television or playing computer games .
drastic measures now need to be put in place to try and reverse this situation tam fry child growth foundation he went on to say that children were " smart enough to learn about healthy foods and the importance of exercise " , before adding that " we really should educate them about the importance of sleep " .
one proposal is to start the school day later , so youngsters get a lie-in .
another is to persuade parents to remove computers and mobile phones from their children 's bedrooms , so they go to sleep on time .
based on current trends , one million children in the uk will be obese by 2010 , experts estimate .
worldwide , more than 22 million children under five years old are obese or overweight , according to the world health organization .
tam fry , chairman of the child growth foundation and a member of the national obesity forum , said the problem with obesity in the uk was " huge " and continuing to rise .

dr shahrad taheri and his team at bristol university say sleep deprivation leads to hormonal changes .
they say these changes tell the body to eat sugary or starchy food to provide an energy boost .
over a prolonged period this leads to weight gain .
experts want the government to take sleep-deprivation as seriously as diet and exercise in the obesity battle .
the researchers at bristol university say the evidence is stark .
energy ' imbalance ' dr taheri told the bbc : " there is a really clear relationship between short sleep duration and obesity in children . "
he said obesity occurs because of the " imbalance between the energy that we take in - the foods that we eat -and the energy we burn , which is our physical activity " .
dr taheri added " there is a very good relationship between physical activity and good sleep " .
the expert said this link was due to the fact that physical activity would make children tired , whereas youngsters were less likely to sleep well if they had been watching television or playing computer games . "
drastic measures now need to be put in place to try and reverse this situation " tam fry child growth foundation he went on to say that children were " smart enough to learn about healthy foods and the importance of exercise " , before adding that " we really should educate them about the importance of sleep " .
one proposal is to start the school day later , so youngsters get a lie-in .
another is to persuade parents to remove computers and mobile phones from their children 's bedrooms , so they go to sleep on time .
based on current trends , one million children in the uk will be obese by 2010 , experts estimate .
worldwide , more than 22 million children under five years old are obese or overweight , according to the world health organization .

mirza tahir hussain , 36 , is due to be executed on 1 november for murdering a taxi driver in 1988 .
prince charles , who is due to be in pakistan on the day of the execution , has contacted pakistan 's prime minister urging a reprieve .
mr hussain told bbc asian network he renewed his " heartfelt plea to pardon me and reflect on my circumstances . "
he added : " i am grateful to his royal highness for showing interest in my plight .
i also thank prime minister tony blair and all the others who are helping me .
" it is the 11th hour and i once again renew my heartfelt plea to president musharraf to pardon me and reflect on my circumstances and sufferings when he leads the country in celebrating eid .
" i am hoping that president musharraf will not send me to the gallows when he himself has expressed doubts about the safety of my conviction . "
" in my suffering and sorrow i wish everyone peace and happiness . "
' unjust ' execution prime minister tony blair said he had spoken personally to pakistan 's president to ask him to intervene .
he told the commons the execution would be " a serious " matter .
prince charles and the duchess of cornwall are due to meet president musharraf during their planned visit to the country from 29 october to 3 november .
a spokesman for the prince said : " the prince of wales has been concerned about this case for some time and had raised it with the prime minister for pakistan . "
the prince and duchess will meet pakistan president musharraf leeds mp greg mulholland said it would be " monstrous " for mr hussain to be hanged during the prince 's visit .
he has written an urgent letter to the prince asking him not to go ahead with the visit unless the execution is cancelled .
he said : " for this unjust execution to go ahead anyway would be bad enough , but to do this when prince charles , heir to the british throne , is visiting the country would be monstrous .
" cancelling the visit will send a clear and powerful message to the pakistani authorities . "
mr hussain 's case has won the backing of uk and euro mps and amnesty international , who have all urged president musharraf to quash the penalty .
respect party mp george galloway had planned to fly to pakistan on monday to appeal directly to the president to quash the penalty but cancelled the trip at the request of mr hussain 's family .

many farmers are being forced to sell up , leaving land which often their families have worked on for generations .

australian farmers have long been known for their toughness and resilience , the very qualities which make them more reluctant to acknowledge any psychological problems .

a generation of boys could be left behind unless the matter is addressed , he said .
some 61 % of girls gain high gcse passes in england , northern ireland and wales , compared with 51 % of boys .
mr brown and education secretary alan johnson are to conduct the assessment of the way the curriculum is tailored .
parents will also be urged to be more involved in children 's schooling .
' britishness ' the chancellor called on mothers and fathers , schools and the wider community to work together , pointing to the success of " extended schools " .
these provide access to a variety of services , such as daytime childcare , after-school homework , music and sports clubs , and support in specialised areas such as speech therapy .
in a wide-ranging speech - the inaugural donald dewar memorial lecture at the university of glasgow - mr brown also outlined his views on " britishness " and social justice .
and he talked about the how to ensure that the rights and responsibilities of individuals , society and the state are balanced effectively .
this year 's gcse results , announced in august , were an improvement on 2005 , with almost one in five entries in england , northern ireland and wales being awarded the top a * or a grades .
boys ' results improved faster than those of girls - but it was still girls who did best overall .
shadow education secretary david willetts said : " the problem is not getting better , and if anything it has got worse over the last nine years .
" we need fresh ideas on how we tackle it , but sadly it seems gordon brown offers just more of the same . "
in scotland , where pupils sit standard grade exams rather than gcses , first minister jack mcconnell has already promised additional tests to determine whether teenagers are competent in the " three rs " .
survey statistics show half of all 14-year-olds in scotland fall below expected standards .
