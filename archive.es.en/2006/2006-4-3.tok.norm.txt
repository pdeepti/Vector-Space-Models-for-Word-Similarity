program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.04.2006 german president promotes african successes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler has made africa his political focus on his second trip to africa , horst köhler will focus on the continent 's success stories .
during visits to mozambique , madagascar and botswana , the german leader will promote better understanding of african issues . success stories are rare in africa , a continent plagued by conflict and catastrophe .
even rarer are news reports focusing on the region 's positive aspects .
germany 's president hopes to change that .
his visit to the continent , starting on monday , takes placae under an optimistic motto .
rather than dwelling on africa 's problems , horst köhler wants to draw attention to what works . with stops in mozambique , madagascar and botswana , the president has selected three countries which have managed to free themselves from the yoke of poverty , disease and lack of education .
for köhler , africa is more than a continent in crisis .
he is convinced that europe 's neighbor has more to offer than the negative headlines so often associated with it .
and in his eyes , it is time the international community took more notice . africa must find its own way köhler has observed first hand the difficult political and economic reforms africa has undertaken in the past decades .
during his years as head of the international monetary fund , he traveled the continent six times .
but he has refrained from promoting an ultimate solution for the region 's problems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler visited benin in december 2004 as with his trip last year , which took him to sierra leone , benin and ethiopia , köhler has rejected a cure-all prescription for africa .
" no matter what we do , when we come as outsiders with our aid and our money , we must resist the temptation to press upon the africans our notions of life , " he said after returning from his previous trip . " of course africa has its own tragic history with slavery , colonialism and the east-west conflict ; but it has above all else its own culture , " köhler said .
" we should refrain from exporting our ideals one-to-one to africa , " he said . african role models in december 2004 , köhler launched his first major trip abroad with a visit to sierra leone .
once mired down in a brutal civil war , the country managed to pull itself out of conflict with the aid of a large un mission .
it was this turn in fortune the president focused on , and not the country 's continuing problems . the countries köhler is visiting this time have all found their own way , their own solution for dealing with poverty and the problems of political and economic instability .
botswana , the last country on the president 's itinerary , is clearly a role model in this regard .
the so-called " switzerland of africa " is no longer dependent on development aid .
instead , the country has become exemplary of sustainable and reform-oriented politics in africa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fully automized diamond sorting machine in the jwaneng mine in botswana botswana has the highest gross domestic product in africa .
it owes this relative prosperity to its large diamond deposits : one-third of the world 's diamonds originate here .
the country the size of france and with a population of 1.7 million invests its profits responsibly in infrastructure projects , social welfare , schools , and above all in the battle against aids . perhaps more so than in any other african country , the leaders of botswana have realized that if they do not focus their efforts on stopping the spread of aids , all their successes in social , economic and political development will be endangered .
with four out of 10 adults testing hiv positive , botswana has countered the catastrophic situation with a resolute policy : 12 percent of its national budget flows into the health system , one-third into education . madagascar 's liberal course while botswana has proven itself over the decade as a successful reform state , mozambique and madagascar have only recently begun to turn themselves around .
for both , germany remains an important donor nation . in the current and previous year , germany made available some 16.5 million euros -lrb- $ 20 million -rrb- for development programs in madagascar , with the prime benefactors being environmental projects and the protection and sustainable use of natural resources .
after the country 's civil war in 2001 , the economy began to improve . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : madagascar 's capital , antananarivo the fight against poverty is a major goal of the current leadership .
last year , economic growth hovered around 5 percent .
more than two-thirds of all people in madagascar live on less than $ 1 a day , and the public health system is not accessible to a majority of the poor . president marc ravalomanana has set out a liberal economic course for the island nation , with attention focused on infrastructure , education and privatization .
köhler , whose contact with the madagascar leader dates back to his days at the imf , supports ravalomanana . mozambique but it is mozambique that will initially set the accent for köhler 's trip .
it will also be the first time a german president has visited the country .
although mozambique is still dependent on two dozen donor countries , it is also one of the fastest growing economies in africa .
its adjusted growth rate for 2006 is expected to be over 7 percent .
some 70 million euros from external aid flow into education , rural development and economic reform . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mozambique 's capital , maputo it is here that mozambique faces its biggest challenges .
it must push forward with the diversification of its economy .
with the exception of a few large projects financed primarily by south african investors , the economy is dominated by farming , handcrafts and fishing .
for this reason , the country will be watching the large delegation of corporate representatives traveling with köhler in the hopes of winning more german investment projects . africa 's fate peaceful and democratic - all three countries can lay claim to these attributes , and they are all good examples of köhler 's vision for africa .
during his trip through the continent , the german leader will be pressing his message that the world needs to take africa seriously . he is convinced that the security , peace and welfare of europe can only be guaranteed as long as africa receives its own fair chance .
as he said during his inauguration speech : " for me our degree of humanity hangs on the fate of africa .
is it not a question of europe 's self respect to involve itself - in view of its own basic fundamentals , values and history - honestly and wholeheartedly with africa ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.04.2006 german president promotes african successes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler has made africa his political focus on his second trip to africa , horst köhler will focus on the continent 's success stories .
during visits to mozambique , madagascar and botswana , the german leader will promote better understanding of african issues . success stories are rare in africa , a continent plagued by conflict and catastrophe .
even rarer are news reports focusing on the region 's positive aspects .
germany 's president hopes to change that .
his visit to the continent , starting on monday , takes placae under an optimistic motto .
rather than dwelling on africa 's problems , horst köhler wants to draw attention to what works . with stops in mozambique , madagascar and botswana , the president has selected three countries which have managed to free themselves from the yoke of poverty , disease and lack of education .
for köhler , africa is more than a continent in crisis .
he is convinced that europe 's neighbor has more to offer than the negative headlines so often associated with it .
and in his eyes , it is time the international community took more notice . africa must find its own way köhler has observed first hand the difficult political and economic reforms africa has undertaken in the past decades .
during his years as head of the international monetary fund , he traveled the continent six times .
but he has refrained from promoting an ultimate solution for the region 's problems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler visited benin in december 2004 as with his trip last year , which took him to sierra leone , benin and ethiopia , köhler has rejected a cure-all prescription for africa .
" no matter what we do , when we come as outsiders with our aid and our money , we must resist the temptation to press upon the africans our notions of life , " he said after returning from his previous trip . " of course africa has its own tragic history with slavery , colonialism and the east-west conflict ; but it has above all else its own culture , " köhler said .
" we should refrain from exporting our ideals one-to-one to africa , " he said . african role models in december 2004 , köhler launched his first major trip abroad with a visit to sierra leone .
once mired down in a brutal civil war , the country managed to pull itself out of conflict with the aid of a large un mission .
it was this turn in fortune the president focused on , and not the country 's continuing problems . the countries köhler is visiting this time have all found their own way , their own solution for dealing with poverty and the problems of political and economic instability .
botswana , the last country on the president 's itinerary , is clearly a role model in this regard .
the so-called " switzerland of africa " is no longer dependent on development aid .
instead , the country has become exemplary of sustainable and reform-oriented politics in africa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fully automized diamond sorting machine in the jwaneng mine in botswana botswana has the highest gross domestic product in africa .
it owes this relative prosperity to its large diamond deposits : one-third of the world 's diamonds originate here .
the country the size of france and with a population of 1.7 million invests its profits responsibly in infrastructure projects , social welfare , schools , and above all in the battle against aids . perhaps more so than in any other african country , the leaders of botswana have realized that if they do not focus their efforts on stopping the spread of aids , all their successes in social , economic and political development will be endangered .
with four out of 10 adults testing hiv positive , botswana has countered the catastrophic situation with a resolute policy : 12 percent of its national budget flows into the health system , one-third into education . madagascar 's liberal course while botswana has proven itself over the decade as a successful reform state , mozambique and madagascar have only recently begun to turn themselves around .
for both , germany remains an important donor nation . in the current and previous year , germany made available some 16.5 million euros -lrb- $ 20 million -rrb- for development programs in madagascar , with the prime benefactors being environmental projects and the protection and sustainable use of natural resources .
after the country 's civil war in 2001 , the economy began to improve . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : madagascar 's capital , antananarivo the fight against poverty is a major goal of the current leadership .
last year , economic growth hovered around 5 percent .
more than two-thirds of all people in madagascar live on less than $ 1 a day , and the public health system is not accessible to a majority of the poor . president marc ravalomanana has set out a liberal economic course for the island nation , with attention focused on infrastructure , education and privatization .
köhler , whose contact with the madagascar leader dates back to his days at the imf , supports ravalomanana . mozambique but it is mozambique that will initially set the accent for köhler 's trip .
it will also be the first time a german president has visited the country .
although mozambique is still dependent on two dozen donor countries , it is also one of the fastest growing economies in africa .
its adjusted growth rate for 2006 is expected to be over 7 percent .
some 70 million euros from external aid flow into education , rural development and economic reform . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mozambique 's capital , maputo it is here that mozambique faces its biggest challenges .
it must push forward with the diversification of its economy .
with the exception of a few large projects financed primarily by south african investors , the economy is dominated by farming , handcrafts and fishing .
for this reason , the country will be watching the large delegation of corporate representatives traveling with köhler in the hopes of winning more german investment projects . africa 's fate peaceful and democratic - all three countries can lay claim to these attributes , and they are all good examples of köhler 's vision for africa .
during his trip through the continent , the german leader will be pressing his message that the world needs to take africa seriously . he is convinced that the security , peace and welfare of europe can only be guaranteed as long as africa receives its own fair chance .
as he said during his inauguration speech : " for me our degree of humanity hangs on the fate of africa .
is it not a question of europe 's self respect to involve itself - in view of its own basic fundamentals , values and history - honestly and wholeheartedly with africa ?

even rarer are news reports focusing on the region 's positive aspects .
germany 's president hopes to change that .
his visit to the continent , starting on monday , takes placae under an optimistic motto .
rather than dwelling on africa 's problems , horst köhler wants to draw attention to what works . with stops in mozambique , madagascar and botswana , the president has selected three countries which have managed to free themselves from the yoke of poverty , disease and lack of education .
for köhler , africa is more than a continent in crisis .
he is convinced that europe 's neighbor has more to offer than the negative headlines so often associated with it .
and in his eyes , it is time the international community took more notice . africa must find its own way köhler has observed first hand the difficult political and economic reforms africa has undertaken in the past decades .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 03.04.2006 german public sector looks for private help großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the route to new schools could be private finance to counteract the financial crises many german cities find themselves in , they 've been looking to the private sector for help .
public-private partnerships are one route municipalities have been taking . once more , 2005 was a negative year for city and town treasuries in germany .
municipalities around the country were 2.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.76 billion -rrb- in the red .
it was an improvement of 1.6 billion euros over 2004 , but the situation of german cities is not positive .
the city of dresden has taken the radical approach of eliminating its debts by selling its complete real estate holding - 48,000 apartments - for 1.7 billion euros to the us investment company fortress .
the transaction met with some skepticism from politicians and economists who feared that dresden was surrendering an important core asset .
but as local german governments search for alternative financing possibilities to offset their shrinking revenues , privatization deals look more and more appealing to many .
the new trend : ppp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden gave apartments a fresh coat of paint before selling them what has been a phenomenon primarily in the anglo-american world is beginning to take root in germany , namely the public-private partnership , or ppp .
the main goal of public-private projects is to allow cash-strapped local and state governments to undertake projects that are for many no longer feasible , such as hospitals , schools , and administrative buildings and even highways .
the ppp concept is relatively simple .
a private contractor , or frequently a consortium of companies , provides the financing and construction of a building .
the consortium acts as a landlord and also takes care of building maintenance .
the municipality , like a tenant , pays for use of the hospital or school .
after a period of time , usually 20 to 30 years for a school or hospital , the local government assumes ownership of the facility .
its proponents stress that there are numerous advantages to such partnerships .
according to the ppp task force of north-rhine westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- , which provides assistance to cities and districts in such matters , the biggest plus is savings of 6 to 15 percent compared to when a municipality plans , builds , finances and runs the building itself .
efficiency , spreading payments over time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schools financed by consortiums may be built faster one of the first ppp projects in nrw was a school and adjoining sports gymnasium in the city of frechen in the rhine-erft district between cologne and bonn .
not only was 12 percent saved compared to if the district had itself overseen the construction process , the consortium was able to hand over the keys just 15 months after the contract had been signed .
" we were very pleased with how quickly the project was completed , " said rhine-erft district project director anton-josef cremer .
" we are also happy about the efficiency when something must be fixed or attended to in the building .
it takes much less time than before . "
earlier , a crew from the responsible city or district would have been called in to fix a faulty boiler or replace a broken window , but the work was not always done quickly .
besides the practical aspects , the district is relieved from immediately coming up with a large sum of money to pay for the project , according to cremer .
the rhine-erft district will spread out the payments in the form of rent for 25 years , which substantially eases its tight financial situation .
but there is a downside .
the district no longer dictates who can use the building and how .
when they draw up usage contracts with the facility managers , the district officials must be specific about which clubs can use a school or gym .
if one group is forgotten , as the rhine-erft district did in the school pilot project , the contract must be renegotiated or the group must pay .
" naturally we can subsidize some groups , but we are going to have to make some hard choices about who receives how much money , " said cremer .
convincing politicians proving difficult local leaders are treading new waters when dealing with public-private partnerships .
the ppp task force in nrw , the first of its kind in the country when it was established in 2002 , has sometimes found it difficult to convince politicians that ppps are worthwhile .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german state of north rhine-westphalia is using a ppp to build a new prison " local leaders can be somewhat skeptical when it comes to public-private projects .
some politicians do n't like letting go of the reins of control in such matters , " said task force director frank littwin .
nevertheless , littwin said , city halls and the state government in düsseldorf have been turning more and more to his group for assistance with large projects .
one of its most recent plans is to help nrw to build a new prison , a the first projecct of its kind in germany .
reflecting the money-saving measures almost all states and municipalities in germany are taking , the ppp task force has ever more work on its hands . john kluempers send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dresden agrees to sell real estate holdings to us investor in a deal that will wipe out the eastern german city of dresden 's debt in one go , us property investment company fortress deutschland has been given the go-ahead to buy the city 's entire residential real estate holdings .

public-private partnerships are one route municipalities have been taking . once more , 2005 was a negative year for city and town treasuries in germany .
municipalities around the country were 2.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.76 billion -rrb- in the red .
it was an improvement of 1.6 billion euros over 2004 , but the situation of german cities is not positive .
the city of dresden has taken the radical approach of eliminating its debts by selling its complete real estate holding - 48,000 apartments - for 1.7 billion euros to the us investment company fortress .
the transaction met with some skepticism from politicians and economists who feared that dresden was surrendering an important core asset .
but as local german governments search for alternative financing possibilities to offset their shrinking revenues , privatization deals look more and more appealing to many .
the new trend : ppp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden gave apartments a fresh coat of paint before selling them what has been a phenomenon primarily in the anglo-american world is beginning to take root in germany , namely the public-private partnership , or ppp .
the main goal of public-private projects is to allow cash-strapped local and state governments to undertake projects that are for many no longer feasible , such as hospitals , schools , and administrative buildings and even highways .
the ppp concept is relatively simple .
a private contractor , or frequently a consortium of companies , provides the financing and construction of a building .
the consortium acts as a landlord and also takes care of building maintenance .
the municipality , like a tenant , pays for use of the hospital or school .
after a period of time , usually 20 to 30 years for a school or hospital , the local government assumes ownership of the facility .
its proponents stress that there are numerous advantages to such partnerships .
according to the ppp task force of north-rhine westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- , which provides assistance to cities and districts in such matters , the biggest plus is savings of 6 to 15 percent compared to when a municipality plans , builds , finances and runs the building itself .

not only was 12 percent saved compared to if the district had itself overseen the construction process , the consortium was able to hand over the keys just 15 months after the contract had been signed .
" we were very pleased with how quickly the project was completed , " said rhine-erft district project director anton-josef cremer .
" we are also happy about the efficiency when something must be fixed or attended to in the building .
it takes much less time than before . "
earlier , a crew from the responsible city or district would have been called in to fix a faulty boiler or replace a broken window , but the work was not always done quickly .
besides the practical aspects , the district is relieved from immediately coming up with a large sum of money to pay for the project , according to cremer .
the rhine-erft district will spread out the payments in the form of rent for 25 years , which substantially eases its tight financial situation .
but there is a downside .
the district no longer dictates who can use the building and how .
when they draw up usage contracts with the facility managers , the district officials must be specific about which clubs can use a school or gym .
if one group is forgotten , as the rhine-erft district did in the school pilot project , the contract must be renegotiated or the group must pay .
" naturally we can subsidize some groups , but we are going to have to make some hard choices about who receives how much money , " said cremer .

nuclear power will likely heat up the debate . amid concern about europe 's dependence on russian and middle eastern oil and gas , sharp disagreements over the role of nuclear power still rage in germany .
chancellor merkel , economy minister michael glos and environment minister sigmar gabriel are scheduled to meet with top managers from german utilities and other major firms in the chancellor 's office in berlin on monday evening .
it will be the first of a series of summits and working group meetings aimed at developing strategies for the next 15 years . " we must understand that we have a task that reaches far beyond this parliamentary term , so all subjects will be on the table and different opinions will certainly be exchanged on some points , " merkel told reporters on monday before the meeting .
representatives of labor unions and consumer groups , as well as klaus töpfer , the head of the united nations environment program , have also been invited to the talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel nuclear power will be a hot topic " nuclear power will also be on the agenda , " said jürgen rüttgers of the christian democratic party -lrb- to which merkel belongs -rrb- and premier of north rhine-westfalia .
" the social democratic party and green party ca n't ignore the question of where 30 percent of our energy in germany is to come from in the future , " said rüttgers , referring to the amount nuclear plants have supplied until now . the country 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have been divided over nuclear power .
recent threats by russian gas giant gazprom to cut off gas supplies to ukraine if it did not pay higher prices prompted conservatives near merkel to demand that germany slash a planned phase-out of nuclear energy in germany . the gradual shutdown of all germany 's nuclear power plants was agreed upon in 2000 by the government of former spd chancellor gerhard schröder and his then-coalition partners , the greens . despite germany 's increasing dependence on russian gas - gazprom and two german firms are building a gas pipeline from siberia to germany - the spd are firm on the phase-out and forced the conservatives to back their line in a coalition agreement after last year 's elections . but pro-nuclear conservatives have not given up .
a paper for the summit authored by christian union parliamentarians said that nuclear energy " remains a competitive and co2-free form of energy that is absolutely essential for the foreseeable future . " alternative energies are a long-term goal germany has 17 nuclear power plants , with nuclear reactors providing 30 percent of the electricity the country 's 82 million people require .
some states , however , use a much higher percentage of atomic energy and strongly oppose the phase-out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of germany 's 110-meter-high offshore windmills in the north sea christian wulff , conservative state premier of lower saxony , said germany 's precarious economic recovery could not handle an increase in already-high power costs .
we need an appropriate energy mix that is not based on ideology but on technology , environmental friendliness and price , " he said in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper . environment minister gabriel of the spd disagreed and told the welt am sonntag paper that there was no need for nuclear energy and that even coal , used to produce half of germany 's electricity , was undergoing a " renaissance . "
he also said that " by 2020 it will be possible to cover 20 to 25 percent of our energy demand with renewable sources . " the center-left spd and conservative cdu / csu - as " grand coalition " partners in government - do agree that germany must boost investment in environmentally friendly alternative sources of energy . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g8 split on nuclear power in energy talks g8 countries were divided thursday on ways to ensure long-term world energy security , as the eu admitted its members had diverging views on ambitious plans for developing nuclear power being pushed by russia and the us .

nuclear power will likely heat up the debate . amid concern about europe 's dependence on russian and middle eastern oil and gas , sharp disagreements over the role of nuclear power still rage in germany .
chancellor merkel , economy minister michael glos and environment minister sigmar gabriel are scheduled to meet with top managers from german utilities and other major firms in the chancellor 's office in berlin on monday evening .
it will be the first of a series of summits and working group meetings aimed at developing strategies for the next 15 years . " we must understand that we have a task that reaches far beyond this parliamentary term , so all subjects will be on the table and different opinions will certainly be exchanged on some points , " merkel told reporters on monday before the meeting .
representatives of labor unions and consumer groups , as well as klaus töpfer , the head of the united nations environment program , have also been invited to the talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel nuclear power will be a hot topic " nuclear power will also be on the agenda , " said jürgen rüttgers of the christian democratic party -lrb- to which merkel belongs -rrb- and premier of north rhine-westfalia .
" the social democratic party and green party ca n't ignore the question of where 30 percent of our energy in germany is to come from in the future , " said rüttgers , referring to the amount nuclear plants have supplied until now . the country 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have been divided over nuclear power .
recent threats by russian gas giant gazprom to cut off gas supplies to ukraine if it did not pay higher prices prompted conservatives near merkel to demand that germany slash a planned phase-out of nuclear energy in germany . the gradual shutdown of all germany 's nuclear power plants was agreed upon in 2000 by the government of former spd chancellor gerhard schröder and his then-coalition partners , the greens . despite germany 's increasing dependence on russian gas - gazprom and two german firms are building a gas pipeline from siberia to germany - the spd are firm on the phase-out and forced the conservatives to back their line in a coalition agreement after last year 's elections . but pro-nuclear conservatives have not given up .
a paper for the summit authored by christian union parliamentarians said that nuclear energy " remains a competitive and co2-free form of energy that is absolutely essential for the foreseeable future . " alternative energies are a long-term goal germany has 17 nuclear power plants , with nuclear reactors providing 30 percent of the electricity the country 's 82 million people require .
some states , however , use a much higher percentage of atomic energy and strongly oppose the phase-out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of germany 's 110-meter-high offshore windmills in the north sea christian wulff , conservative state premier of lower saxony , said germany 's precarious economic recovery could not handle an increase in already-high power costs .
we need an appropriate energy mix that is not based on ideology but on technology , environmental friendliness and price , " he said in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper . environment minister gabriel of the spd disagreed and told the welt am sonntag paper that there was no need for nuclear energy and that even coal , used to produce half of germany 's electricity , was undergoing a " renaissance . "
he also said that " by 2020 it will be possible to cover 20 to 25 percent of our energy demand with renewable sources . " the center-left spd and conservative cdu / csu - as " grand coalition " partners in government - do agree that germany must boost investment in environmentally friendly alternative sources of energy . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g8 split on nuclear power in energy talks g8 countries were divided thursday on ways to ensure long-term world energy security , as the eu admitted its members had diverging views on ambitious plans for developing nuclear power being pushed by russia and the us .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.04.2006 german president promotes african successes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler has made africa his political focus on his second trip to africa , horst köhler will focus on the continent 's success stories .
during visits to mozambique , madagascar and botswana , the german leader will promote better understanding of african issues . success stories are rare in africa , a continent plagued by conflict and catastrophe .
even rarer are news reports focusing on the region 's positive aspects .
germany 's president hopes to change that .
his visit to the continent , starting on monday , takes placae under an optimistic motto .
rather than dwelling on africa 's problems , horst köhler wants to draw attention to what works . with stops in mozambique , madagascar and botswana , the president has selected three countries which have managed to free themselves from the yoke of poverty , disease and lack of education .
for köhler , africa is more than a continent in crisis .
he is convinced that europe 's neighbor has more to offer than the negative headlines so often associated with it .
and in his eyes , it is time the international community took more notice . africa must find its own way köhler has observed first hand the difficult political and economic reforms africa has undertaken in the past decades .
during his years as head of the international monetary fund , he traveled the continent six times .
but he has refrained from promoting an ultimate solution for the region 's problems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler visited benin in december 2004 as with his trip last year , which took him to sierra leone , benin and ethiopia , köhler has rejected a cure-all prescription for africa .
" no matter what we do , when we come as outsiders with our aid and our money , we must resist the temptation to press upon the africans our notions of life , " he said after returning from his previous trip . " of course africa has its own tragic history with slavery , colonialism and the east-west conflict ; but it has above all else its own culture , " köhler said .
" we should refrain from exporting our ideals one-to-one to africa , " he said . african role models in december 2004 , köhler launched his first major trip abroad with a visit to sierra leone .
once mired down in a brutal civil war , the country managed to pull itself out of conflict with the aid of a large un mission .
it was this turn in fortune the president focused on , and not the country 's continuing problems . the countries köhler is visiting this time have all found their own way , their own solution for dealing with poverty and the problems of political and economic instability .
botswana , the last country on the president 's itinerary , is clearly a role model in this regard .
the so-called " switzerland of africa " is no longer dependent on development aid .
instead , the country has become exemplary of sustainable and reform-oriented politics in africa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fully automized diamond sorting machine in the jwaneng mine in botswana botswana has the highest gross domestic product in africa .
it owes this relative prosperity to its large diamond deposits : one-third of the world 's diamonds originate here .
the country the size of france and with a population of 1.7 million invests its profits responsibly in infrastructure projects , social welfare , schools , and above all in the battle against aids . perhaps more so than in any other african country , the leaders of botswana have realized that if they do not focus their efforts on stopping the spread of aids , all their successes in social , economic and political development will be endangered .
with four out of 10 adults testing hiv positive , botswana has countered the catastrophic situation with a resolute policy : 12 percent of its national budget flows into the health system , one-third into education . madagascar 's liberal course while botswana has proven itself over the decade as a successful reform state , mozambique and madagascar have only recently begun to turn themselves around .
for both , germany remains an important donor nation . in the current and previous year , germany made available some 16.5 million euros -lrb- $ 20 million -rrb- for development programs in madagascar , with the prime benefactors being environmental projects and the protection and sustainable use of natural resources .
after the country 's civil war in 2001 , the economy began to improve . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : madagascar 's capital , antananarivo the fight against poverty is a major goal of the current leadership .
last year , economic growth hovered around 5 percent .
more than two-thirds of all people in madagascar live on less than $ 1 a day , and the public health system is not accessible to a majority of the poor . president marc ravalomanana has set out a liberal economic course for the island nation , with attention focused on infrastructure , education and privatization .
köhler , whose contact with the madagascar leader dates back to his days at the imf , supports ravalomanana . mozambique but it is mozambique that will initially set the accent for köhler 's trip .
it will also be the first time a german president has visited the country .
although mozambique is still dependent on two dozen donor countries , it is also one of the fastest growing economies in africa .
its adjusted growth rate for 2006 is expected to be over 7 percent .
some 70 million euros from external aid flow into education , rural development and economic reform . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mozambique 's capital , maputo it is here that mozambique faces its biggest challenges .
it must push forward with the diversification of its economy .
with the exception of a few large projects financed primarily by south african investors , the economy is dominated by farming , handcrafts and fishing .
for this reason , the country will be watching the large delegation of corporate representatives traveling with köhler in the hopes of winning more german investment projects . africa 's fate peaceful and democratic - all three countries can lay claim to these attributes , and they are all good examples of köhler 's vision for africa .
during his trip through the continent , the german leader will be pressing his message that the world needs to take africa seriously . he is convinced that the security , peace and welfare of europe can only be guaranteed as long as africa receives its own fair chance .
as he said during his inauguration speech : " for me our degree of humanity hangs on the fate of africa .
is it not a question of europe 's self respect to involve itself - in view of its own basic fundamentals , values and history - honestly and wholeheartedly with africa ?

but he has refrained from promoting an ultimate solution for the region 's problems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler visited benin in december 2004 as with his trip last year , which took him to sierra leone , benin and ethiopia , köhler has rejected a cure-all prescription for africa .
" no matter what we do , when we come as outsiders with our aid and our money , we must resist the temptation to press upon the africans our notions of life , " he said after returning from his previous trip . " of course africa has its own tragic history with slavery , colonialism and the east-west conflict ; but it has above all else its own culture , " köhler said .
" we should refrain from exporting our ideals one-to-one to africa , " he said . african role models in december 2004 , köhler launched his first major trip abroad with a visit to sierra leone .
once mired down in a brutal civil war , the country managed to pull itself out of conflict with the aid of a large un mission .
it was this turn in fortune the president focused on , and not the country 's continuing problems . the countries köhler is visiting this time have all found their own way , their own solution for dealing with poverty and the problems of political and economic instability .
botswana , the last country on the president 's itinerary , is clearly a role model in this regard .
the so-called " switzerland of africa " is no longer dependent on development aid .
instead , the country has become exemplary of sustainable and reform-oriented politics in africa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fully automized diamond sorting machine in the jwaneng mine in botswana botswana has the highest gross domestic product in africa .
it owes this relative prosperity to its large diamond deposits : one-third of the world 's diamonds originate here .
the country the size of france and with a population of 1.7 million invests its profits responsibly in infrastructure projects , social welfare , schools , and above all in the battle against aids . perhaps more so than in any other african country , the leaders of botswana have realized that if they do not focus their efforts on stopping the spread of aids , all their successes in social , economic and political development will be endangered .
with four out of 10 adults testing hiv positive , botswana has countered the catastrophic situation with a resolute policy : 12 percent of its national budget flows into the health system , one-third into education . madagascar 's liberal course while botswana has proven itself over the decade as a successful reform state , mozambique and madagascar have only recently begun to turn themselves around .
for both , germany remains an important donor nation . in the current and previous year , germany made available some 16.5 million euros -lrb- $ 20 million -rrb- for development programs in madagascar , with the prime benefactors being environmental projects and the protection and sustainable use of natural resources .
after the country 's civil war in 2001 , the economy began to improve . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : madagascar 's capital , antananarivo the fight against poverty is a major goal of the current leadership .
last year , economic growth hovered around 5 percent .
more than two-thirds of all people in madagascar live on less than $ 1 a day , and the public health system is not accessible to a majority of the poor . president marc ravalomanana has set out a liberal economic course for the island nation , with attention focused on infrastructure , education and privatization .
köhler , whose contact with the madagascar leader dates back to his days at the imf , supports ravalomanana . mozambique but it is mozambique that will initially set the accent for köhler 's trip .
it will also be the first time a german president has visited the country .
although mozambique is still dependent on two dozen donor countries , it is also one of the fastest growing economies in africa .
its adjusted growth rate for 2006 is expected to be over 7 percent .
some 70 million euros from external aid flow into education , rural development and economic reform . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mozambique 's capital , maputo it is here that mozambique faces its biggest challenges .
it must push forward with the diversification of its economy .
with the exception of a few large projects financed primarily by south african investors , the economy is dominated by farming , handcrafts and fishing .
for this reason , the country will be watching the large delegation of corporate representatives traveling with köhler in the hopes of winning more german investment projects . africa 's fate peaceful and democratic - all three countries can lay claim to these attributes , and they are all good examples of köhler 's vision for africa .
during his trip through the continent , the german leader will be pressing his message that the world needs to take africa seriously . he is convinced that the security , peace and welfare of europe can only be guaranteed as long as africa receives its own fair chance .
as he said during his inauguration speech : " for me our degree of humanity hangs on the fate of africa .
is it not a question of europe 's self respect to involve itself - in view of its own basic fundamentals , values and history - honestly and wholeheartedly with africa ?

nuclear power will likely heat up the debate . amid concern about europe 's dependence on russian and middle eastern oil and gas , sharp disagreements over the role of nuclear power still rage in germany .
chancellor merkel , economy minister michael glos and environment minister sigmar gabriel are scheduled to meet with top managers from german utilities and other major firms in the chancellor 's office in berlin on monday evening .
it will be the first of a series of summits and working group meetings aimed at developing strategies for the next 15 years . " we must understand that we have a task that reaches far beyond this parliamentary term , so all subjects will be on the table and different opinions will certainly be exchanged on some points , " merkel told reporters on monday before the meeting .
representatives of labor unions and consumer groups , as well as klaus töpfer , the head of the united nations environment program , have also been invited to the talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel nuclear power will be a hot topic " nuclear power will also be on the agenda , " said jürgen rüttgers of the christian democratic party -lrb- to which merkel belongs -rrb- and premier of north rhine-westfalia .
" the social democratic party and green party ca n't ignore the question of where 30 percent of our energy in germany is to come from in the future , " said rüttgers , referring to the amount nuclear plants have supplied until now . the country 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have been divided over nuclear power .
recent threats by russian gas giant gazprom to cut off gas supplies to ukraine if it did not pay higher prices prompted conservatives near merkel to demand that germany slash a planned phase-out of nuclear energy in germany . the gradual shutdown of all germany 's nuclear power plants was agreed upon in 2000 by the government of former spd chancellor gerhard schröder and his then-coalition partners , the greens . despite germany 's increasing dependence on russian gas - gazprom and two german firms are building a gas pipeline from siberia to germany - the spd are firm on the phase-out and forced the conservatives to back their line in a coalition agreement after last year 's elections . but pro-nuclear conservatives have not given up .
a paper for the summit authored by christian union parliamentarians said that nuclear energy " remains a competitive and co2-free form of energy that is absolutely essential for the foreseeable future . " alternative energies are a long-term goal germany has 17 nuclear power plants , with nuclear reactors providing 30 percent of the electricity the country 's 82 million people require .
some states , however , use a much higher percentage of atomic energy and strongly oppose the phase-out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of germany 's 110-meter-high offshore windmills in the north sea christian wulff , conservative state premier of lower saxony , said germany 's precarious economic recovery could not handle an increase in already-high power costs .
we need an appropriate energy mix that is not based on ideology but on technology , environmental friendliness and price , " he said in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper . environment minister gabriel of the spd disagreed and told the welt am sonntag paper that there was no need for nuclear energy and that even coal , used to produce half of germany 's electricity , was undergoing a " renaissance . "
he also said that " by 2020 it will be possible to cover 20 to 25 percent of our energy demand with renewable sources . " the center-left spd and conservative cdu / csu - as " grand coalition " partners in government - do agree that germany must boost investment in environmentally friendly alternative sources of energy . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g8 split on nuclear power in energy talks g8 countries were divided thursday on ways to ensure long-term world energy security , as the eu admitted its members had diverging views on ambitious plans for developing nuclear power being pushed by russia and the us .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 03.04.2006 german public sector looks for private help großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the route to new schools could be private finance to counteract the financial crises many german cities find themselves in , they 've been looking to the private sector for help .
public-private partnerships are one route municipalities have been taking . once more , 2005 was a negative year for city and town treasuries in germany .
municipalities around the country were 2.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.76 billion -rrb- in the red .
it was an improvement of 1.6 billion euros over 2004 , but the situation of german cities is not positive .
the city of dresden has taken the radical approach of eliminating its debts by selling its complete real estate holding - 48,000 apartments - for 1.7 billion euros to the us investment company fortress .
the transaction met with some skepticism from politicians and economists who feared that dresden was surrendering an important core asset .
but as local german governments search for alternative financing possibilities to offset their shrinking revenues , privatization deals look more and more appealing to many .
the new trend : ppp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden gave apartments a fresh coat of paint before selling them what has been a phenomenon primarily in the anglo-american world is beginning to take root in germany , namely the public-private partnership , or ppp .
the main goal of public-private projects is to allow cash-strapped local and state governments to undertake projects that are for many no longer feasible , such as hospitals , schools , and administrative buildings and even highways .
the ppp concept is relatively simple .
a private contractor , or frequently a consortium of companies , provides the financing and construction of a building .
the consortium acts as a landlord and also takes care of building maintenance .
the municipality , like a tenant , pays for use of the hospital or school .
after a period of time , usually 20 to 30 years for a school or hospital , the local government assumes ownership of the facility .
its proponents stress that there are numerous advantages to such partnerships .
according to the ppp task force of north-rhine westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- , which provides assistance to cities and districts in such matters , the biggest plus is savings of 6 to 15 percent compared to when a municipality plans , builds , finances and runs the building itself .
efficiency , spreading payments over time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schools financed by consortiums may be built faster one of the first ppp projects in nrw was a school and adjoining sports gymnasium in the city of frechen in the rhine-erft district between cologne and bonn .
not only was 12 percent saved compared to if the district had itself overseen the construction process , the consortium was able to hand over the keys just 15 months after the contract had been signed .
" we were very pleased with how quickly the project was completed , " said rhine-erft district project director anton-josef cremer .
" we are also happy about the efficiency when something must be fixed or attended to in the building .
it takes much less time than before . "
earlier , a crew from the responsible city or district would have been called in to fix a faulty boiler or replace a broken window , but the work was not always done quickly .
besides the practical aspects , the district is relieved from immediately coming up with a large sum of money to pay for the project , according to cremer .
the rhine-erft district will spread out the payments in the form of rent for 25 years , which substantially eases its tight financial situation .
but there is a downside .
the district no longer dictates who can use the building and how .
when they draw up usage contracts with the facility managers , the district officials must be specific about which clubs can use a school or gym .
if one group is forgotten , as the rhine-erft district did in the school pilot project , the contract must be renegotiated or the group must pay .
" naturally we can subsidize some groups , but we are going to have to make some hard choices about who receives how much money , " said cremer .
convincing politicians proving difficult local leaders are treading new waters when dealing with public-private partnerships .
the ppp task force in nrw , the first of its kind in the country when it was established in 2002 , has sometimes found it difficult to convince politicians that ppps are worthwhile .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german state of north rhine-westphalia is using a ppp to build a new prison " local leaders can be somewhat skeptical when it comes to public-private projects .
some politicians do n't like letting go of the reins of control in such matters , " said task force director frank littwin .
nevertheless , littwin said , city halls and the state government in düsseldorf have been turning more and more to his group for assistance with large projects .
one of its most recent plans is to help nrw to build a new prison , a the first projecct of its kind in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.04.2006 german president promotes african successes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler has made africa his political focus on his second trip to africa , horst köhler will focus on the continent 's success stories .
during visits to mozambique , madagascar and botswana , the german leader will promote better understanding of african issues . success stories are rare in africa , a continent plagued by conflict and catastrophe .
even rarer are news reports focusing on the region 's positive aspects .
germany 's president hopes to change that .
his visit to the continent , starting on monday , takes placae under an optimistic motto .
rather than dwelling on africa 's problems , horst köhler wants to draw attention to what works . with stops in mozambique , madagascar and botswana , the president has selected three countries which have managed to free themselves from the yoke of poverty , disease and lack of education .
for köhler , africa is more than a continent in crisis .
he is convinced that europe 's neighbor has more to offer than the negative headlines so often associated with it .
and in his eyes , it is time the international community took more notice . africa must find its own way köhler has observed first hand the difficult political and economic reforms africa has undertaken in the past decades .
during his years as head of the international monetary fund , he traveled the continent six times .
but he has refrained from promoting an ultimate solution for the region 's problems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler visited benin in december 2004 as with his trip last year , which took him to sierra leone , benin and ethiopia , köhler has rejected a cure-all prescription for africa .
" no matter what we do , when we come as outsiders with our aid and our money , we must resist the temptation to press upon the africans our notions of life , " he said after returning from his previous trip . " of course africa has its own tragic history with slavery , colonialism and the east-west conflict ; but it has above all else its own culture , " köhler said .
" we should refrain from exporting our ideals one-to-one to africa , " he said . african role models in december 2004 , köhler launched his first major trip abroad with a visit to sierra leone .
once mired down in a brutal civil war , the country managed to pull itself out of conflict with the aid of a large un mission .
it was this turn in fortune the president focused on , and not the country 's continuing problems . the countries köhler is visiting this time have all found their own way , their own solution for dealing with poverty and the problems of political and economic instability .
botswana , the last country on the president 's itinerary , is clearly a role model in this regard .
the so-called " switzerland of africa " is no longer dependent on development aid .
instead , the country has become exemplary of sustainable and reform-oriented politics in africa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fully automized diamond sorting machine in the jwaneng mine in botswana botswana has the highest gross domestic product in africa .
it owes this relative prosperity to its large diamond deposits : one-third of the world 's diamonds originate here .
the country the size of france and with a population of 1.7 million invests its profits responsibly in infrastructure projects , social welfare , schools , and above all in the battle against aids . perhaps more so than in any other african country , the leaders of botswana have realized that if they do not focus their efforts on stopping the spread of aids , all their successes in social , economic and political development will be endangered .
with four out of 10 adults testing hiv positive , botswana has countered the catastrophic situation with a resolute policy : 12 percent of its national budget flows into the health system , one-third into education . madagascar 's liberal course while botswana has proven itself over the decade as a successful reform state , mozambique and madagascar have only recently begun to turn themselves around .
for both , germany remains an important donor nation . in the current and previous year , germany made available some 16.5 million euros -lrb- $ 20 million -rrb- for development programs in madagascar , with the prime benefactors being environmental projects and the protection and sustainable use of natural resources .
after the country 's civil war in 2001 , the economy began to improve . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : madagascar 's capital , antananarivo the fight against poverty is a major goal of the current leadership .
last year , economic growth hovered around 5 percent .
more than two-thirds of all people in madagascar live on less than $ 1 a day , and the public health system is not accessible to a majority of the poor . president marc ravalomanana has set out a liberal economic course for the island nation , with attention focused on infrastructure , education and privatization .
köhler , whose contact with the madagascar leader dates back to his days at the imf , supports ravalomanana . mozambique but it is mozambique that will initially set the accent for köhler 's trip .
it will also be the first time a german president has visited the country .
although mozambique is still dependent on two dozen donor countries , it is also one of the fastest growing economies in africa .
its adjusted growth rate for 2006 is expected to be over 7 percent .
some 70 million euros from external aid flow into education , rural development and economic reform . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mozambique 's capital , maputo it is here that mozambique faces its biggest challenges .
it must push forward with the diversification of its economy .
with the exception of a few large projects financed primarily by south african investors , the economy is dominated by farming , handcrafts and fishing .
for this reason , the country will be watching the large delegation of corporate representatives traveling with köhler in the hopes of winning more german investment projects . africa 's fate peaceful and democratic - all three countries can lay claim to these attributes , and they are all good examples of köhler 's vision for africa .
during his trip through the continent , the german leader will be pressing his message that the world needs to take africa seriously . he is convinced that the security , peace and welfare of europe can only be guaranteed as long as africa receives its own fair chance .
as he said during his inauguration speech : " for me our degree of humanity hangs on the fate of africa .
is it not a question of europe 's self respect to involve itself - in view of its own basic fundamentals , values and history - honestly and wholeheartedly with africa ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.04.2006 nuclear power tiff to dominate merkel 's energy summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear power plants provide about a third of germany 's electricity german chancellor angela merkel will meet with ministers and industry chiefs on monday to plot strategies for long-term energy security .
nuclear power will likely heat up the debate . amid concern about europe 's dependence on russian and middle eastern oil and gas , sharp disagreements over the role of nuclear power still rage in germany .
chancellor merkel , economy minister michael glos and environment minister sigmar gabriel are scheduled to meet with top managers from german utilities and other major firms in the chancellor 's office in berlin on monday evening .
it will be the first of a series of summits and working group meetings aimed at developing strategies for the next 15 years . " we must understand that we have a task that reaches far beyond this parliamentary term , so all subjects will be on the table and different opinions will certainly be exchanged on some points , " merkel told reporters on monday before the meeting .
representatives of labor unions and consumer groups , as well as klaus töpfer , the head of the united nations environment program , have also been invited to the talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel nuclear power will be a hot topic " nuclear power will also be on the agenda , " said jürgen rüttgers of the christian democratic party -lrb- to which merkel belongs -rrb- and premier of north rhine-westfalia .
" the social democratic party and green party ca n't ignore the question of where 30 percent of our energy in germany is to come from in the future , " said rüttgers , referring to the amount nuclear plants have supplied until now . the country 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have been divided over nuclear power .
recent threats by russian gas giant gazprom to cut off gas supplies to ukraine if it did not pay higher prices prompted conservatives near merkel to demand that germany slash a planned phase-out of nuclear energy in germany . the gradual shutdown of all germany 's nuclear power plants was agreed upon in 2000 by the government of former spd chancellor gerhard schröder and his then-coalition partners , the greens . despite germany 's increasing dependence on russian gas - gazprom and two german firms are building a gas pipeline from siberia to germany - the spd are firm on the phase-out and forced the conservatives to back their line in a coalition agreement after last year 's elections . but pro-nuclear conservatives have not given up .
a paper for the summit authored by christian union parliamentarians said that nuclear energy " remains a competitive and co2-free form of energy that is absolutely essential for the foreseeable future . " alternative energies are a long-term goal germany has 17 nuclear power plants , with nuclear reactors providing 30 percent of the electricity the country 's 82 million people require .
some states , however , use a much higher percentage of atomic energy and strongly oppose the phase-out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of germany 's 110-meter-high offshore windmills in the north sea christian wulff , conservative state premier of lower saxony , said germany 's precarious economic recovery could not handle an increase in already-high power costs .
we need an appropriate energy mix that is not based on ideology but on technology , environmental friendliness and price , " he said in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper . environment minister gabriel of the spd disagreed and told the welt am sonntag paper that there was no need for nuclear energy and that even coal , used to produce half of germany 's electricity , was undergoing a " renaissance . "
he also said that " by 2020 it will be possible to cover 20 to 25 percent of our energy demand with renewable sources . " the center-left spd and conservative cdu / csu - as " grand coalition " partners in government - do agree that germany must boost investment in environmentally friendly alternative sources of energy . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g8 split on nuclear power in energy talks g8 countries were divided thursday on ways to ensure long-term world energy security , as the eu admitted its members had diverging views on ambitious plans for developing nuclear power being pushed by russia and the us .
-lrb- march 16 , 2006 -rrb- eu leaders move ahead on common energy policy european union leaders opened a second day of summit talks friday , downplaying discord over resurgent protectionism in the 25-nation bloc whilst trumpeting agreement on a new common energy policy . -lrb- march 24 , 2006 -rrb- germany 's solar explosion q-cells ag , a maker of solar cells , became the latest alternative energy company to make its debut on the german stock exchange on wednesday , with its shares showing warm gains on their first day of trading .

nuclear power will likely heat up the debate . amid concern about europe 's dependence on russian and middle eastern oil and gas , sharp disagreements over the role of nuclear power still rage in germany .
chancellor merkel , economy minister michael glos and environment minister sigmar gabriel are scheduled to meet with top managers from german utilities and other major firms in the chancellor 's office in berlin on monday evening .
it will be the first of a series of summits and working group meetings aimed at developing strategies for the next 15 years . " we must understand that we have a task that reaches far beyond this parliamentary term , so all subjects will be on the table and different opinions will certainly be exchanged on some points , " merkel told reporters on monday before the meeting .
representatives of labor unions and consumer groups , as well as klaus töpfer , the head of the united nations environment program , have also been invited to the talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel nuclear power will be a hot topic " nuclear power will also be on the agenda , " said jürgen rüttgers of the christian democratic party -lrb- to which merkel belongs -rrb- and premier of north rhine-westfalia .
" the social democratic party and green party ca n't ignore the question of where 30 percent of our energy in germany is to come from in the future , " said rüttgers , referring to the amount nuclear plants have supplied until now . the country 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have been divided over nuclear power .
recent threats by russian gas giant gazprom to cut off gas supplies to ukraine if it did not pay higher prices prompted conservatives near merkel to demand that germany slash a planned phase-out of nuclear energy in germany . the gradual shutdown of all germany 's nuclear power plants was agreed upon in 2000 by the government of former spd chancellor gerhard schröder and his then-coalition partners , the greens . despite germany 's increasing dependence on russian gas - gazprom and two german firms are building a gas pipeline from siberia to germany - the spd are firm on the phase-out and forced the conservatives to back their line in a coalition agreement after last year 's elections . but pro-nuclear conservatives have not given up .
a paper for the summit authored by christian union parliamentarians said that nuclear energy " remains a competitive and co2-free form of energy that is absolutely essential for the foreseeable future . " alternative energies are a long-term goal germany has 17 nuclear power plants , with nuclear reactors providing 30 percent of the electricity the country 's 82 million people require .
some states , however , use a much higher percentage of atomic energy and strongly oppose the phase-out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of germany 's 110-meter-high offshore windmills in the north sea christian wulff , conservative state premier of lower saxony , said germany 's precarious economic recovery could not handle an increase in already-high power costs .
we need an appropriate energy mix that is not based on ideology but on technology , environmental friendliness and price , " he said in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper . environment minister gabriel of the spd disagreed and told the welt am sonntag paper that there was no need for nuclear energy and that even coal , used to produce half of germany 's electricity , was undergoing a " renaissance . "
he also said that " by 2020 it will be possible to cover 20 to 25 percent of our energy demand with renewable sources . " the center-left spd and conservative cdu / csu - as " grand coalition " partners in government - do agree that germany must boost investment in environmentally friendly alternative sources of energy . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g8 split on nuclear power in energy talks g8 countries were divided thursday on ways to ensure long-term world energy security , as the eu admitted its members had diverging views on ambitious plans for developing nuclear power being pushed by russia and the us .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.04.2006 german president promotes african successes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler has made africa his political focus on his second trip to africa , horst köhler will focus on the continent 's success stories .
during visits to mozambique , madagascar and botswana , the german leader will promote better understanding of african issues . success stories are rare in africa , a continent plagued by conflict and catastrophe .
even rarer are news reports focusing on the region 's positive aspects .
germany 's president hopes to change that .
his visit to the continent , starting on monday , takes placae under an optimistic motto .
rather than dwelling on africa 's problems , horst köhler wants to draw attention to what works . with stops in mozambique , madagascar and botswana , the president has selected three countries which have managed to free themselves from the yoke of poverty , disease and lack of education .
for köhler , africa is more than a continent in crisis .
he is convinced that europe 's neighbor has more to offer than the negative headlines so often associated with it .
and in his eyes , it is time the international community took more notice . africa must find its own way köhler has observed first hand the difficult political and economic reforms africa has undertaken in the past decades .
during his years as head of the international monetary fund , he traveled the continent six times .
but he has refrained from promoting an ultimate solution for the region 's problems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler visited benin in december 2004 as with his trip last year , which took him to sierra leone , benin and ethiopia , köhler has rejected a cure-all prescription for africa .
" no matter what we do , when we come as outsiders with our aid and our money , we must resist the temptation to press upon the africans our notions of life , " he said after returning from his previous trip . " of course africa has its own tragic history with slavery , colonialism and the east-west conflict ; but it has above all else its own culture , " köhler said .
" we should refrain from exporting our ideals one-to-one to africa , " he said . african role models in december 2004 , köhler launched his first major trip abroad with a visit to sierra leone .
once mired down in a brutal civil war , the country managed to pull itself out of conflict with the aid of a large un mission .
it was this turn in fortune the president focused on , and not the country 's continuing problems . the countries köhler is visiting this time have all found their own way , their own solution for dealing with poverty and the problems of political and economic instability .
botswana , the last country on the president 's itinerary , is clearly a role model in this regard .
the so-called " switzerland of africa " is no longer dependent on development aid .
instead , the country has become exemplary of sustainable and reform-oriented politics in africa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fully automized diamond sorting machine in the jwaneng mine in botswana botswana has the highest gross domestic product in africa .
it owes this relative prosperity to its large diamond deposits : one-third of the world 's diamonds originate here .
the country the size of france and with a population of 1.7 million invests its profits responsibly in infrastructure projects , social welfare , schools , and above all in the battle against aids . perhaps more so than in any other african country , the leaders of botswana have realized that if they do not focus their efforts on stopping the spread of aids , all their successes in social , economic and political development will be endangered .
with four out of 10 adults testing hiv positive , botswana has countered the catastrophic situation with a resolute policy : 12 percent of its national budget flows into the health system , one-third into education . madagascar 's liberal course while botswana has proven itself over the decade as a successful reform state , mozambique and madagascar have only recently begun to turn themselves around .
for both , germany remains an important donor nation . in the current and previous year , germany made available some 16.5 million euros -lrb- $ 20 million -rrb- for development programs in madagascar , with the prime benefactors being environmental projects and the protection and sustainable use of natural resources .
after the country 's civil war in 2001 , the economy began to improve . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : madagascar 's capital , antananarivo the fight against poverty is a major goal of the current leadership .
last year , economic growth hovered around 5 percent .
more than two-thirds of all people in madagascar live on less than $ 1 a day , and the public health system is not accessible to a majority of the poor . president marc ravalomanana has set out a liberal economic course for the island nation , with attention focused on infrastructure , education and privatization .
köhler , whose contact with the madagascar leader dates back to his days at the imf , supports ravalomanana . mozambique but it is mozambique that will initially set the accent for köhler 's trip .
it will also be the first time a german president has visited the country .
although mozambique is still dependent on two dozen donor countries , it is also one of the fastest growing economies in africa .
its adjusted growth rate for 2006 is expected to be over 7 percent .
some 70 million euros from external aid flow into education , rural development and economic reform . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mozambique 's capital , maputo it is here that mozambique faces its biggest challenges .
it must push forward with the diversification of its economy .
with the exception of a few large projects financed primarily by south african investors , the economy is dominated by farming , handcrafts and fishing .
for this reason , the country will be watching the large delegation of corporate representatives traveling with köhler in the hopes of winning more german investment projects . africa 's fate peaceful and democratic - all three countries can lay claim to these attributes , and they are all good examples of köhler 's vision for africa .
during his trip through the continent , the german leader will be pressing his message that the world needs to take africa seriously . he is convinced that the security , peace and welfare of europe can only be guaranteed as long as africa receives its own fair chance .
as he said during his inauguration speech : " for me our degree of humanity hangs on the fate of africa .
is it not a question of europe 's self respect to involve itself - in view of its own basic fundamentals , values and history - honestly and wholeheartedly with africa ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 03.04.2006 german public sector looks for private help großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the route to new schools could be private finance to counteract the financial crises many german cities find themselves in , they 've been looking to the private sector for help .
public-private partnerships are one route municipalities have been taking . once more , 2005 was a negative year for city and town treasuries in germany .
municipalities around the country were 2.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.76 billion -rrb- in the red .
it was an improvement of 1.6 billion euros over 2004 , but the situation of german cities is not positive .
the city of dresden has taken the radical approach of eliminating its debts by selling its complete real estate holding - 48,000 apartments - for 1.7 billion euros to the us investment company fortress .
the transaction met with some skepticism from politicians and economists who feared that dresden was surrendering an important core asset .
but as local german governments search for alternative financing possibilities to offset their shrinking revenues , privatization deals look more and more appealing to many .
the new trend : ppp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden gave apartments a fresh coat of paint before selling them what has been a phenomenon primarily in the anglo-american world is beginning to take root in germany , namely the public-private partnership , or ppp .
the main goal of public-private projects is to allow cash-strapped local and state governments to undertake projects that are for many no longer feasible , such as hospitals , schools , and administrative buildings and even highways .
the ppp concept is relatively simple .
a private contractor , or frequently a consortium of companies , provides the financing and construction of a building .
the consortium acts as a landlord and also takes care of building maintenance .
the municipality , like a tenant , pays for use of the hospital or school .
after a period of time , usually 20 to 30 years for a school or hospital , the local government assumes ownership of the facility .
its proponents stress that there are numerous advantages to such partnerships .
according to the ppp task force of north-rhine westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- , which provides assistance to cities and districts in such matters , the biggest plus is savings of 6 to 15 percent compared to when a municipality plans , builds , finances and runs the building itself .
efficiency , spreading payments over time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schools financed by consortiums may be built faster one of the first ppp projects in nrw was a school and adjoining sports gymnasium in the city of frechen in the rhine-erft district between cologne and bonn .
not only was 12 percent saved compared to if the district had itself overseen the construction process , the consortium was able to hand over the keys just 15 months after the contract had been signed .
" we were very pleased with how quickly the project was completed , " said rhine-erft district project director anton-josef cremer .
" we are also happy about the efficiency when something must be fixed or attended to in the building .
it takes much less time than before . "
earlier , a crew from the responsible city or district would have been called in to fix a faulty boiler or replace a broken window , but the work was not always done quickly .
besides the practical aspects , the district is relieved from immediately coming up with a large sum of money to pay for the project , according to cremer .
the rhine-erft district will spread out the payments in the form of rent for 25 years , which substantially eases its tight financial situation .
but there is a downside .
the district no longer dictates who can use the building and how .
when they draw up usage contracts with the facility managers , the district officials must be specific about which clubs can use a school or gym .
if one group is forgotten , as the rhine-erft district did in the school pilot project , the contract must be renegotiated or the group must pay .
" naturally we can subsidize some groups , but we are going to have to make some hard choices about who receives how much money , " said cremer .
convincing politicians proving difficult local leaders are treading new waters when dealing with public-private partnerships .
the ppp task force in nrw , the first of its kind in the country when it was established in 2002 , has sometimes found it difficult to convince politicians that ppps are worthwhile .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german state of north rhine-westphalia is using a ppp to build a new prison " local leaders can be somewhat skeptical when it comes to public-private projects .
some politicians do n't like letting go of the reins of control in such matters , " said task force director frank littwin .
nevertheless , littwin said , city halls and the state government in düsseldorf have been turning more and more to his group for assistance with large projects .
one of its most recent plans is to help nrw to build a new prison , a the first projecct of its kind in germany .

" there 's something fishy about the whole matter , " she told the bild daily .
schröder 's government approved the gazprom credit just weeks before schröder stepped down from government after elections in september . the green party , with whom schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- formed a coalition in government , has also not ruled out a parliamentary inquiry .
" you just ca n't do something like that , " said green party economics expert matthias berninger .
berninger said he was interested in discovering who else knew about the billion-euro loan guarantee . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loans must be approved before gas can flow bodo ramelow , deputy head of the left party parliamentary group , said his party is reviewing legal action that could be taken against members of schröder 's spd-green government should more damaging details emerge .
" we could be talking about the misappropriation of tax money here , " ramelow said . even schröder 's own party has criticized the former chancellor 's actions .
" you just ca n't ignore it when someone has messed things up , " garrelt duin of the spd told die welt newspaper . russian newspaper nezavisimaya gazeta wrote on monday that " gerhard schröder 's business relationship with gazprom is looking more and more unsavory ...
the image of the most important joint energy project for europe is suffering as a result . " on friday , schröder officially took up the post as head of the supervisory board of a consortium that plans to build the natural pipeline under the baltic sea from russia to germany .
gazprom holds 51 percent of the consortium 's shares . schröder has since defended his decision to head the board following criticism of alleged imprudent behavior . schröder said he was only offered the supervisory board post , for which he will earn an annual salary of 250,000 euros , after he left office in november .
" i can not see anything wrong with that , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a still-optimistic schröder he also told the handelsblatt business daily he had been unaware his -lrb- former -rrb- administration had guaranteed the credit gazprom 's pipeline .
he added that gazprom had no plans to take the loan .
" i did not know about these proceedings , " he said . " but the key point is that gazprom has already said that it has not and will not accept the financing option put forward by the banks .
thus , there will not be a federal loan guarantee for the two german banks , " he added . the economy ministry confirmed saturday that an inter-ministerial commission rushed through a " decision in principle " on oct .
24 last year while waiting for a new coalition to be formed by now chancellor angela merkel . schröder also told handelsblatt that : " federal loan guarantees are a tried and tested instrument to defend the economic interests of our country , " he said .
" that especially includes a reliable supply of natural resources for german industry . " schröder seems to have gained the upper hand in another battle as well .
he has repeatedly sued guido westerwelle , head of the free democrat -lrb- fdp -rrb- party , for verbal attacks about the gazprom affair .
on monday , following an appeal by schröder last week , the hamburg district court barred westerwelle from making further comments about schröder 's supervisory board position . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : schröder government approved gazprom credit the former german government of gerhard schröder guaranteed a credit of one billion euros -lrb- $ 1.2 billion -rrb- for the russian gas group gazprom 's baltic pipeline project , a german daily reported in its saturday edition .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.04.2006 german president promotes african successes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler has made africa his political focus on his second trip to africa , horst köhler will focus on the continent 's success stories .
during visits to mozambique , madagascar and botswana , the german leader will promote better understanding of african issues . success stories are rare in africa , a continent plagued by conflict and catastrophe .
even rarer are news reports focusing on the region 's positive aspects .
germany 's president hopes to change that .
his visit to the continent , starting on monday , takes placae under an optimistic motto .
rather than dwelling on africa 's problems , horst köhler wants to draw attention to what works . with stops in mozambique , madagascar and botswana , the president has selected three countries which have managed to free themselves from the yoke of poverty , disease and lack of education .
for köhler , africa is more than a continent in crisis .
he is convinced that europe 's neighbor has more to offer than the negative headlines so often associated with it .
and in his eyes , it is time the international community took more notice . africa must find its own way köhler has observed first hand the difficult political and economic reforms africa has undertaken in the past decades .
during his years as head of the international monetary fund , he traveled the continent six times .
but he has refrained from promoting an ultimate solution for the region 's problems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler visited benin in december 2004 as with his trip last year , which took him to sierra leone , benin and ethiopia , köhler has rejected a cure-all prescription for africa .
" no matter what we do , when we come as outsiders with our aid and our money , we must resist the temptation to press upon the africans our notions of life , " he said after returning from his previous trip . " of course africa has its own tragic history with slavery , colonialism and the east-west conflict ; but it has above all else its own culture , " köhler said .
" we should refrain from exporting our ideals one-to-one to africa , " he said . african role models in december 2004 , köhler launched his first major trip abroad with a visit to sierra leone .
once mired down in a brutal civil war , the country managed to pull itself out of conflict with the aid of a large un mission .
it was this turn in fortune the president focused on , and not the country 's continuing problems . the countries köhler is visiting this time have all found their own way , their own solution for dealing with poverty and the problems of political and economic instability .
botswana , the last country on the president 's itinerary , is clearly a role model in this regard .
the so-called " switzerland of africa " is no longer dependent on development aid .
instead , the country has become exemplary of sustainable and reform-oriented politics in africa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fully automized diamond sorting machine in the jwaneng mine in botswana botswana has the highest gross domestic product in africa .
it owes this relative prosperity to its large diamond deposits : one-third of the world 's diamonds originate here .
the country the size of france and with a population of 1.7 million invests its profits responsibly in infrastructure projects , social welfare , schools , and above all in the battle against aids . perhaps more so than in any other african country , the leaders of botswana have realized that if they do not focus their efforts on stopping the spread of aids , all their successes in social , economic and political development will be endangered .
with four out of 10 adults testing hiv positive , botswana has countered the catastrophic situation with a resolute policy : 12 percent of its national budget flows into the health system , one-third into education . madagascar 's liberal course while botswana has proven itself over the decade as a successful reform state , mozambique and madagascar have only recently begun to turn themselves around .
for both , germany remains an important donor nation . in the current and previous year , germany made available some 16.5 million euros -lrb- $ 20 million -rrb- for development programs in madagascar , with the prime benefactors being environmental projects and the protection and sustainable use of natural resources .
after the country 's civil war in 2001 , the economy began to improve . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : madagascar 's capital , antananarivo the fight against poverty is a major goal of the current leadership .
last year , economic growth hovered around 5 percent .
more than two-thirds of all people in madagascar live on less than $ 1 a day , and the public health system is not accessible to a majority of the poor . president marc ravalomanana has set out a liberal economic course for the island nation , with attention focused on infrastructure , education and privatization .
köhler , whose contact with the madagascar leader dates back to his days at the imf , supports ravalomanana . mozambique but it is mozambique that will initially set the accent for köhler 's trip .
it will also be the first time a german president has visited the country .
although mozambique is still dependent on two dozen donor countries , it is also one of the fastest growing economies in africa .
its adjusted growth rate for 2006 is expected to be over 7 percent .
some 70 million euros from external aid flow into education , rural development and economic reform . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mozambique 's capital , maputo it is here that mozambique faces its biggest challenges .
it must push forward with the diversification of its economy .
with the exception of a few large projects financed primarily by south african investors , the economy is dominated by farming , handcrafts and fishing .
for this reason , the country will be watching the large delegation of corporate representatives traveling with köhler in the hopes of winning more german investment projects . africa 's fate peaceful and democratic - all three countries can lay claim to these attributes , and they are all good examples of köhler 's vision for africa .
during his trip through the continent , the german leader will be pressing his message that the world needs to take africa seriously . he is convinced that the security , peace and welfare of europe can only be guaranteed as long as africa receives its own fair chance .
as he said during his inauguration speech : " for me our degree of humanity hangs on the fate of africa .
is it not a question of europe 's self respect to involve itself - in view of its own basic fundamentals , values and history - honestly and wholeheartedly with africa ?

nuclear power will likely heat up the debate . amid concern about europe 's dependence on russian and middle eastern oil and gas , sharp disagreements over the role of nuclear power still rage in germany .
chancellor merkel , economy minister michael glos and environment minister sigmar gabriel are scheduled to meet with top managers from german utilities and other major firms in the chancellor 's office in berlin on monday evening .
it will be the first of a series of summits and working group meetings aimed at developing strategies for the next 15 years . " we must understand that we have a task that reaches far beyond this parliamentary term , so all subjects will be on the table and different opinions will certainly be exchanged on some points , " merkel told reporters on monday before the meeting .
representatives of labor unions and consumer groups , as well as klaus töpfer , the head of the united nations environment program , have also been invited to the talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel nuclear power will be a hot topic " nuclear power will also be on the agenda , " said jürgen rüttgers of the christian democratic party -lrb- to which merkel belongs -rrb- and premier of north rhine-westfalia .
" the social democratic party and green party ca n't ignore the question of where 30 percent of our energy in germany is to come from in the future , " said rüttgers , referring to the amount nuclear plants have supplied until now . the country 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have been divided over nuclear power .
recent threats by russian gas giant gazprom to cut off gas supplies to ukraine if it did not pay higher prices prompted conservatives near merkel to demand that germany slash a planned phase-out of nuclear energy in germany . the gradual shutdown of all germany 's nuclear power plants was agreed upon in 2000 by the government of former spd chancellor gerhard schröder and his then-coalition partners , the greens . despite germany 's increasing dependence on russian gas - gazprom and two german firms are building a gas pipeline from siberia to germany - the spd are firm on the phase-out and forced the conservatives to back their line in a coalition agreement after last year 's elections . but pro-nuclear conservatives have not given up .
a paper for the summit authored by christian union parliamentarians said that nuclear energy " remains a competitive and co2-free form of energy that is absolutely essential for the foreseeable future . " alternative energies are a long-term goal germany has 17 nuclear power plants , with nuclear reactors providing 30 percent of the electricity the country 's 82 million people require .
some states , however , use a much higher percentage of atomic energy and strongly oppose the phase-out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of germany 's 110-meter-high offshore windmills in the north sea christian wulff , conservative state premier of lower saxony , said germany 's precarious economic recovery could not handle an increase in already-high power costs .
we need an appropriate energy mix that is not based on ideology but on technology , environmental friendliness and price , " he said in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper . environment minister gabriel of the spd disagreed and told the welt am sonntag paper that there was no need for nuclear energy and that even coal , used to produce half of germany 's electricity , was undergoing a " renaissance . "
he also said that " by 2020 it will be possible to cover 20 to 25 percent of our energy demand with renewable sources . " the center-left spd and conservative cdu / csu - as " grand coalition " partners in government - do agree that germany must boost investment in environmentally friendly alternative sources of energy . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g8 split on nuclear power in energy talks g8 countries were divided thursday on ways to ensure long-term world energy security , as the eu admitted its members had diverging views on ambitious plans for developing nuclear power being pushed by russia and the us .

public-private partnerships are one route municipalities have been taking . once more , 2005 was a negative year for city and town treasuries in germany .
municipalities around the country were 2.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.76 billion -rrb- in the red .
it was an improvement of 1.6 billion euros over 2004 , but the situation of german cities is not positive .
the city of dresden has taken the radical approach of eliminating its debts by selling its complete real estate holding - 48,000 apartments - for 1.7 billion euros to the us investment company fortress .
the transaction met with some skepticism from politicians and economists who feared that dresden was surrendering an important core asset .
but as local german governments search for alternative financing possibilities to offset their shrinking revenues , privatization deals look more and more appealing to many .
the new trend : ppp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden gave apartments a fresh coat of paint before selling them what has been a phenomenon primarily in the anglo-american world is beginning to take root in germany , namely the public-private partnership , or ppp .
the main goal of public-private projects is to allow cash-strapped local and state governments to undertake projects that are for many no longer feasible , such as hospitals , schools , and administrative buildings and even highways .
the ppp concept is relatively simple .
a private contractor , or frequently a consortium of companies , provides the financing and construction of a building .
the consortium acts as a landlord and also takes care of building maintenance .
the municipality , like a tenant , pays for use of the hospital or school .
after a period of time , usually 20 to 30 years for a school or hospital , the local government assumes ownership of the facility .
its proponents stress that there are numerous advantages to such partnerships .
according to the ppp task force of north-rhine westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- , which provides assistance to cities and districts in such matters , the biggest plus is savings of 6 to 15 percent compared to when a municipality plans , builds , finances and runs the building itself .
efficiency , spreading payments over time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schools financed by consortiums may be built faster one of the first ppp projects in nrw was a school and adjoining sports gymnasium in the city of frechen in the rhine-erft district between cologne and bonn .
not only was 12 percent saved compared to if the district had itself overseen the construction process , the consortium was able to hand over the keys just 15 months after the contract had been signed .
" we were very pleased with how quickly the project was completed , " said rhine-erft district project director anton-josef cremer .
" we are also happy about the efficiency when something must be fixed or attended to in the building .
it takes much less time than before . "
earlier , a crew from the responsible city or district would have been called in to fix a faulty boiler or replace a broken window , but the work was not always done quickly .
besides the practical aspects , the district is relieved from immediately coming up with a large sum of money to pay for the project , according to cremer .
the rhine-erft district will spread out the payments in the form of rent for 25 years , which substantially eases its tight financial situation .
but there is a downside .
the district no longer dictates who can use the building and how .
when they draw up usage contracts with the facility managers , the district officials must be specific about which clubs can use a school or gym .
if one group is forgotten , as the rhine-erft district did in the school pilot project , the contract must be renegotiated or the group must pay .
" naturally we can subsidize some groups , but we are going to have to make some hard choices about who receives how much money , " said cremer .

public-private partnerships are one route municipalities have been taking . once more , 2005 was a negative year for city and town treasuries in germany .
municipalities around the country were 2.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.76 billion -rrb- in the red .
it was an improvement of 1.6 billion euros over 2004 , but the situation of german cities is not positive .
the city of dresden has taken the radical approach of eliminating its debts by selling its complete real estate holding - 48,000 apartments - for 1.7 billion euros to the us investment company fortress .
the transaction met with some skepticism from politicians and economists who feared that dresden was surrendering an important core asset .
but as local german governments search for alternative financing possibilities to offset their shrinking revenues , privatization deals look more and more appealing to many .
the new trend : ppp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden gave apartments a fresh coat of paint before selling them what has been a phenomenon primarily in the anglo-american world is beginning to take root in germany , namely the public-private partnership , or ppp .
the main goal of public-private projects is to allow cash-strapped local and state governments to undertake projects that are for many no longer feasible , such as hospitals , schools , and administrative buildings and even highways .
the ppp concept is relatively simple .
a private contractor , or frequently a consortium of companies , provides the financing and construction of a building .
the consortium acts as a landlord and also takes care of building maintenance .
the municipality , like a tenant , pays for use of the hospital or school .
after a period of time , usually 20 to 30 years for a school or hospital , the local government assumes ownership of the facility .
its proponents stress that there are numerous advantages to such partnerships .
according to the ppp task force of north-rhine westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- , which provides assistance to cities and districts in such matters , the biggest plus is savings of 6 to 15 percent compared to when a municipality plans , builds , finances and runs the building itself .
efficiency , spreading payments over time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schools financed by consortiums may be built faster one of the first ppp projects in nrw was a school and adjoining sports gymnasium in the city of frechen in the rhine-erft district between cologne and bonn .
not only was 12 percent saved compared to if the district had itself overseen the construction process , the consortium was able to hand over the keys just 15 months after the contract had been signed .
" we were very pleased with how quickly the project was completed , " said rhine-erft district project director anton-josef cremer .
" we are also happy about the efficiency when something must be fixed or attended to in the building .
it takes much less time than before . "
earlier , a crew from the responsible city or district would have been called in to fix a faulty boiler or replace a broken window , but the work was not always done quickly .
besides the practical aspects , the district is relieved from immediately coming up with a large sum of money to pay for the project , according to cremer .
the rhine-erft district will spread out the payments in the form of rent for 25 years , which substantially eases its tight financial situation .
but there is a downside .
the district no longer dictates who can use the building and how .
when they draw up usage contracts with the facility managers , the district officials must be specific about which clubs can use a school or gym .
if one group is forgotten , as the rhine-erft district did in the school pilot project , the contract must be renegotiated or the group must pay .
" naturally we can subsidize some groups , but we are going to have to make some hard choices about who receives how much money , " said cremer .
convincing politicians proving difficult local leaders are treading new waters when dealing with public-private partnerships .
the ppp task force in nrw , the first of its kind in the country when it was established in 2002 , has sometimes found it difficult to convince politicians that ppps are worthwhile .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german state of north rhine-westphalia is using a ppp to build a new prison " local leaders can be somewhat skeptical when it comes to public-private projects .
some politicians do n't like letting go of the reins of control in such matters , " said task force director frank littwin .
nevertheless , littwin said , city halls and the state government in düsseldorf have been turning more and more to his group for assistance with large projects .
one of its most recent plans is to help nrw to build a new prison , a the first projecct of its kind in germany .

" there 's something fishy about the whole matter , " she told the bild daily .
schröder 's government approved the gazprom credit just weeks before schröder stepped down from government after elections in september . the green party , with whom schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- formed a coalition in government , has also not ruled out a parliamentary inquiry .
" you just ca n't do something like that , " said green party economics expert matthias berninger .
berninger said he was interested in discovering who else knew about the billion-euro loan guarantee . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loans must be approved before gas can flow bodo ramelow , deputy head of the left party parliamentary group , said his party is reviewing legal action that could be taken against members of schröder 's spd-green government should more damaging details emerge .
" we could be talking about the misappropriation of tax money here , " ramelow said . even schröder 's own party has criticized the former chancellor 's actions .
" you just ca n't ignore it when someone has messed things up , " garrelt duin of the spd told die welt newspaper . russian newspaper nezavisimaya gazeta wrote on monday that " gerhard schröder 's business relationship with gazprom is looking more and more unsavory ...
the image of the most important joint energy project for europe is suffering as a result . " on friday , schröder officially took up the post as head of the supervisory board of a consortium that plans to build the natural pipeline under the baltic sea from russia to germany .
gazprom holds 51 percent of the consortium 's shares . schröder has since defended his decision to head the board following criticism of alleged imprudent behavior . schröder said he was only offered the supervisory board post , for which he will earn an annual salary of 250,000 euros , after he left office in november .
" i can not see anything wrong with that , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a still-optimistic schröder he also told the handelsblatt business daily he had been unaware his -lrb- former -rrb- administration had guaranteed the credit gazprom 's pipeline .
he added that gazprom had no plans to take the loan .
" i did not know about these proceedings , " he said . " but the key point is that gazprom has already said that it has not and will not accept the financing option put forward by the banks .
thus , there will not be a federal loan guarantee for the two german banks , " he added . the economy ministry confirmed saturday that an inter-ministerial commission rushed through a " decision in principle " on oct .
24 last year while waiting for a new coalition to be formed by now chancellor angela merkel . schröder also told handelsblatt that : " federal loan guarantees are a tried and tested instrument to defend the economic interests of our country , " he said .
" that especially includes a reliable supply of natural resources for german industry . " schröder seems to have gained the upper hand in another battle as well .
he has repeatedly sued guido westerwelle , head of the free democrat -lrb- fdp -rrb- party , for verbal attacks about the gazprom affair .
on monday , following an appeal by schröder last week , the hamburg district court barred westerwelle from making further comments about schröder 's supervisory board position . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : schröder government approved gazprom credit the former german government of gerhard schröder guaranteed a credit of one billion euros -lrb- $ 1.2 billion -rrb- for the russian gas group gazprom 's baltic pipeline project , a german daily reported in its saturday edition .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.04.2006 nuclear power tiff to dominate merkel 's energy summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear power plants provide about a third of germany 's electricity german chancellor angela merkel will meet with ministers and industry chiefs on monday to plot strategies for long-term energy security .
nuclear power will likely heat up the debate . amid concern about europe 's dependence on russian and middle eastern oil and gas , sharp disagreements over the role of nuclear power still rage in germany .
chancellor merkel , economy minister michael glos and environment minister sigmar gabriel are scheduled to meet with top managers from german utilities and other major firms in the chancellor 's office in berlin on monday evening .
it will be the first of a series of summits and working group meetings aimed at developing strategies for the next 15 years . " we must understand that we have a task that reaches far beyond this parliamentary term , so all subjects will be on the table and different opinions will certainly be exchanged on some points , " merkel told reporters on monday before the meeting .
representatives of labor unions and consumer groups , as well as klaus töpfer , the head of the united nations environment program , have also been invited to the talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel nuclear power will be a hot topic " nuclear power will also be on the agenda , " said jürgen rüttgers of the christian democratic party -lrb- to which merkel belongs -rrb- and premier of north rhine-westfalia .
" the social democratic party and green party ca n't ignore the question of where 30 percent of our energy in germany is to come from in the future , " said rüttgers , referring to the amount nuclear plants have supplied until now . the country 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have been divided over nuclear power .
recent threats by russian gas giant gazprom to cut off gas supplies to ukraine if it did not pay higher prices prompted conservatives near merkel to demand that germany slash a planned phase-out of nuclear energy in germany . the gradual shutdown of all germany 's nuclear power plants was agreed upon in 2000 by the government of former spd chancellor gerhard schröder and his then-coalition partners , the greens . despite germany 's increasing dependence on russian gas - gazprom and two german firms are building a gas pipeline from siberia to germany - the spd are firm on the phase-out and forced the conservatives to back their line in a coalition agreement after last year 's elections . but pro-nuclear conservatives have not given up .
a paper for the summit authored by christian union parliamentarians said that nuclear energy " remains a competitive and co2-free form of energy that is absolutely essential for the foreseeable future . " alternative energies are a long-term goal germany has 17 nuclear power plants , with nuclear reactors providing 30 percent of the electricity the country 's 82 million people require .
some states , however , use a much higher percentage of atomic energy and strongly oppose the phase-out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of germany 's 110-meter-high offshore windmills in the north sea christian wulff , conservative state premier of lower saxony , said germany 's precarious economic recovery could not handle an increase in already-high power costs .
we need an appropriate energy mix that is not based on ideology but on technology , environmental friendliness and price , " he said in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper . environment minister gabriel of the spd disagreed and told the welt am sonntag paper that there was no need for nuclear energy and that even coal , used to produce half of germany 's electricity , was undergoing a " renaissance . "
he also said that " by 2020 it will be possible to cover 20 to 25 percent of our energy demand with renewable sources . " the center-left spd and conservative cdu / csu - as " grand coalition " partners in government - do agree that germany must boost investment in environmentally friendly alternative sources of energy . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g8 split on nuclear power in energy talks g8 countries were divided thursday on ways to ensure long-term world energy security , as the eu admitted its members had diverging views on ambitious plans for developing nuclear power being pushed by russia and the us .

" we should distance ourselves and say that we will not accept such a situation and for that reason we do not want to participate , " the ombudsman , claes borgström , told swedish radio .
" it 's a good opportunity to do something effective ... targeting modern-day slavery . " a number of non-governmental organizations have warned that up to 40,000 women from eastern europe could be smuggled into germany by criminal gangs to work as prostitutes during the tournament that takes place in 12 cities in june and july . prostitution is legal in germany , where some 175,000 women are already involved in the sex trade . " maybe in 10 years , we will be remembered for having been the first to put a foot down and say ' no , we do n't want to be a part of trafficking ' , " the ombudsman 's spokesman magnus jacobson told afp .
" it could be 10,000 , 40,000 women ...
these are often women who have been grossly abused and who have lived in terrible conditions . " the deputy head of the swedish sports confederation , birgitta ljung , said the ombudsman 's boycott proposal was " extremely naive " , swedish news agency tt reported . " that would mean that an entire country would be disappointed during the world cup and in addition , we would probably be suspended from the next one , " the head of the soccer federation , lars-aake lagrell , told tt . dw-world.de soccer world cup anti-prostitution campaign kicks off the initiators of " red card for forced prostitution , " seeking to fight against an influx of prostitutes during the world cup in germany this summer , launched their campaign in berlin on wednesday .

" i can not see any reason not to choose oliver kahn but i get the impression that jens lehmann will be the one playing at the world cup , " schumacher said in an interview with internet portal sport 1 .
" jens was so calm and relaxed when interviewed after arsenal 's recent champions league game with juventus .
i sensed then that he already knows he will be the number one . " if kahn thought he was certain of being the number one he surely would not have played against cologne carrying an injury , " schumacher added . klinsmann has confirmed that he will make his decision by the beginning of may before naming his final 23-man world cup squad on may 15 . schumacher was runner-up at two world cups with west germany in 1982 and 1986 but is perhaps best remembered for a cynical challenge on french defender patrick battiston in the 1982 semi-final .
battiston was through on goal , but the no-nonsense schumacher crashed into his french opponent to stop him scoring and stayed on the pitch to become the hero as west germany defeated france on penalties to reach the final . dw-world.de coach leaves door open for world cup aspirants germany coach jürgen klinsmann on tuesday made it clear late newcomers would be welcome in his 23-man world cup squad which will be announced in berlin on may 14 .

" i can not see any reason not to choose oliver kahn but i get the impression that jens lehmann will be the one playing at the world cup , " schumacher said in an interview with internet portal sport 1 .
" jens was so calm and relaxed when interviewed after arsenal 's recent champions league game with juventus .
i sensed then that he already knows he will be the number one . " if kahn thought he was certain of being the number one he surely would not have played against cologne carrying an injury , " schumacher added . klinsmann has confirmed that he will make his decision by the beginning of may before naming his final 23-man world cup squad on may 15 . schumacher was runner-up at two world cups with west germany in 1982 and 1986 but is perhaps best remembered for a cynical challenge on french defender patrick battiston in the 1982 semi-final .
battiston was through on goal , but the no-nonsense schumacher crashed into his french opponent to stop him scoring and stayed on the pitch to become the hero as west germany defeated france on penalties to reach the final . dw-world.de coach leaves door open for world cup aspirants germany coach jürgen klinsmann on tuesday made it clear late newcomers would be welcome in his 23-man world cup squad which will be announced in berlin on may 14 .

breuer was chief executive officer of germany 's largest bank at the time . in january , germany 's highest court ruled breuer 's comments breached the bank 's contractual duty of not having a negative effect on a customer 's ability to receive credit from other sources .
one of kirch 's media units had loans of over 700 million euros -lrb- $ 848 million -rrb- . " it 's a shame that kirch is the reason for his departure , " wolfgang gerke , a professor of banking at the university of nuremberg-erlangen , told bloomburg .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.04.2006 gerhard schröder takes a blow over gazprom großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and putin signed the pipeline deal in september germany 's opposition fdp party has threatened to demand a parliamentary inquiry into the so-called " pipeline affair " involving the former government of gerhard schröder and russian gas group gazprom . following a report in the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper over the weekend about the approval of a billion euro -lrb- $ 1.2 billion -rrb- credit for gazprom 's baltic pipeline by former chancellor schröder 's government , fdp opposition party energy expert gudrun kopp said she would fight for a parliamentary investigation .
" there 's something fishy about the whole matter , " she told the bild daily .
schröder 's government approved the gazprom credit just weeks before schröder stepped down from government after elections in september . the green party , with whom schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- formed a coalition in government , has also not ruled out a parliamentary inquiry .
" you just ca n't do something like that , " said green party economics expert matthias berninger .
berninger said he was interested in discovering who else knew about the billion-euro loan guarantee . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loans must be approved before gas can flow bodo ramelow , deputy head of the left party parliamentary group , said his party is reviewing legal action that could be taken against members of schröder 's spd-green government should more damaging details emerge .
" we could be talking about the misappropriation of tax money here , " ramelow said . even schröder 's own party has criticized the former chancellor 's actions .
" you just ca n't ignore it when someone has messed things up , " garrelt duin of the spd told die welt newspaper . russian newspaper nezavisimaya gazeta wrote on monday that " gerhard schröder 's business relationship with gazprom is looking more and more unsavory ...
the image of the most important joint energy project for europe is suffering as a result . " on friday , schröder officially took up the post as head of the supervisory board of a consortium that plans to build the natural pipeline under the baltic sea from russia to germany .
gazprom holds 51 percent of the consortium 's shares . schröder has since defended his decision to head the board following criticism of alleged imprudent behavior . schröder said he was only offered the supervisory board post , for which he will earn an annual salary of 250,000 euros , after he left office in november .
" i can not see anything wrong with that , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a still-optimistic schröder he also told the handelsblatt business daily he had been unaware his -lrb- former -rrb- administration had guaranteed the credit gazprom 's pipeline .
he added that gazprom had no plans to take the loan .
" i did not know about these proceedings , " he said . " but the key point is that gazprom has already said that it has not and will not accept the financing option put forward by the banks .
thus , there will not be a federal loan guarantee for the two german banks , " he added . the economy ministry confirmed saturday that an inter-ministerial commission rushed through a " decision in principle " on oct .
24 last year while waiting for a new coalition to be formed by now chancellor angela merkel . schröder also told handelsblatt that : " federal loan guarantees are a tried and tested instrument to defend the economic interests of our country , " he said .
" that especially includes a reliable supply of natural resources for german industry . " schröder seems to have gained the upper hand in another battle as well .
he has repeatedly sued guido westerwelle , head of the free democrat -lrb- fdp -rrb- party , for verbal attacks about the gazprom affair .

" there 's something fishy about the whole matter , " she told the bild daily .
schröder 's government approved the gazprom credit just weeks before schröder stepped down from government after elections in september . the green party , with whom schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- formed a coalition in government , has also not ruled out a parliamentary inquiry .

during visits to mozambique , madagascar and botswana , the german leader will promote better understanding of african issues . success stories are rare in africa , a continent plagued by conflict and catastrophe .
even rarer are news reports focusing on the region 's positive aspects .
germany 's president hopes to change that .
his visit to the continent , starting on monday , takes placae under an optimistic motto .
rather than dwelling on africa 's problems , horst köhler wants to draw attention to what works . with stops in mozambique , madagascar and botswana , the president has selected three countries which have managed to free themselves from the yoke of poverty , disease and lack of education .
for köhler , africa is more than a continent in crisis .
he is convinced that europe 's neighbor has more to offer than the negative headlines so often associated with it .
and in his eyes , it is time the international community took more notice . africa must find its own way köhler has observed first hand the difficult political and economic reforms africa has undertaken in the past decades .
during his years as head of the international monetary fund , he traveled the continent six times .
but he has refrained from promoting an ultimate solution for the region 's problems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler visited benin in december 2004 as with his trip last year , which took him to sierra leone , benin and ethiopia , köhler has rejected a cure-all prescription for africa .
" no matter what we do , when we come as outsiders with our aid and our money , we must resist the temptation to press upon the africans our notions of life , " he said after returning from his previous trip . " of course africa has its own tragic history with slavery , colonialism and the east-west conflict ; but it has above all else its own culture , " köhler said .
" we should refrain from exporting our ideals one-to-one to africa , " he said . african role models in december 2004 , köhler launched his first major trip abroad with a visit to sierra leone .
once mired down in a brutal civil war , the country managed to pull itself out of conflict with the aid of a large un mission .
it was this turn in fortune the president focused on , and not the country 's continuing problems . the countries köhler is visiting this time have all found their own way , their own solution for dealing with poverty and the problems of political and economic instability .
botswana , the last country on the president 's itinerary , is clearly a role model in this regard .
the so-called " switzerland of africa " is no longer dependent on development aid .
instead , the country has become exemplary of sustainable and reform-oriented politics in africa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fully automized diamond sorting machine in the jwaneng mine in botswana botswana has the highest gross domestic product in africa .
it owes this relative prosperity to its large diamond deposits : one-third of the world 's diamonds originate here .
the country the size of france and with a population of 1.7 million invests its profits responsibly in infrastructure projects , social welfare , schools , and above all in the battle against aids . perhaps more so than in any other african country , the leaders of botswana have realized that if they do not focus their efforts on stopping the spread of aids , all their successes in social , economic and political development will be endangered .
with four out of 10 adults testing hiv positive , botswana has countered the catastrophic situation with a resolute policy : 12 percent of its national budget flows into the health system , one-third into education . madagascar 's liberal course while botswana has proven itself over the decade as a successful reform state , mozambique and madagascar have only recently begun to turn themselves around .
for both , germany remains an important donor nation . in the current and previous year , germany made available some 16.5 million euros -lrb- $ 20 million -rrb- for development programs in madagascar , with the prime benefactors being environmental projects and the protection and sustainable use of natural resources .
after the country 's civil war in 2001 , the economy began to improve . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : madagascar 's capital , antananarivo the fight against poverty is a major goal of the current leadership .
last year , economic growth hovered around 5 percent .
more than two-thirds of all people in madagascar live on less than $ 1 a day , and the public health system is not accessible to a majority of the poor . president marc ravalomanana has set out a liberal economic course for the island nation , with attention focused on infrastructure , education and privatization .
köhler , whose contact with the madagascar leader dates back to his days at the imf , supports ravalomanana . mozambique but it is mozambique that will initially set the accent for köhler 's trip .
it will also be the first time a german president has visited the country .
although mozambique is still dependent on two dozen donor countries , it is also one of the fastest growing economies in africa .
its adjusted growth rate for 2006 is expected to be over 7 percent .
some 70 million euros from external aid flow into education , rural development and economic reform . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mozambique 's capital , maputo it is here that mozambique faces its biggest challenges .
it must push forward with the diversification of its economy .
with the exception of a few large projects financed primarily by south african investors , the economy is dominated by farming , handcrafts and fishing .
for this reason , the country will be watching the large delegation of corporate representatives traveling with köhler in the hopes of winning more german investment projects . africa 's fate peaceful and democratic - all three countries can lay claim to these attributes , and they are all good examples of köhler 's vision for africa .
during his trip through the continent , the german leader will be pressing his message that the world needs to take africa seriously . he is convinced that the security , peace and welfare of europe can only be guaranteed as long as africa receives its own fair chance .
as he said during his inauguration speech : " for me our degree of humanity hangs on the fate of africa .

rather than dwelling on africa 's problems , horst köhler wants to draw attention to what works . with stops in mozambique , madagascar and botswana , the president has selected three countries which have managed to free themselves from the yoke of poverty , disease and lack of education .
for köhler , africa is more than a continent in crisis .
he is convinced that europe 's neighbor has more to offer than the negative headlines so often associated with it .
and in his eyes , it is time the international community took more notice . africa must find its own way köhler has observed first hand the difficult political and economic reforms africa has undertaken in the past decades .
during his years as head of the international monetary fund , he traveled the continent six times .
but he has refrained from promoting an ultimate solution for the region 's problems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler visited benin in december 2004 as with his trip last year , which took him to sierra leone , benin and ethiopia , köhler has rejected a cure-all prescription for africa .
" no matter what we do , when we come as outsiders with our aid and our money , we must resist the temptation to press upon the africans our notions of life , " he said after returning from his previous trip . " of course africa has its own tragic history with slavery , colonialism and the east-west conflict ; but it has above all else its own culture , " köhler said .
" we should refrain from exporting our ideals one-to-one to africa , " he said . african role models in december 2004 , köhler launched his first major trip abroad with a visit to sierra leone .
once mired down in a brutal civil war , the country managed to pull itself out of conflict with the aid of a large un mission .
it was this turn in fortune the president focused on , and not the country 's continuing problems . the countries köhler is visiting this time have all found their own way , their own solution for dealing with poverty and the problems of political and economic instability .
botswana , the last country on the president 's itinerary , is clearly a role model in this regard .
the so-called " switzerland of africa " is no longer dependent on development aid .
instead , the country has become exemplary of sustainable and reform-oriented politics in africa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fully automized diamond sorting machine in the jwaneng mine in botswana botswana has the highest gross domestic product in africa .
it owes this relative prosperity to its large diamond deposits : one-third of the world 's diamonds originate here .
the country the size of france and with a population of 1.7 million invests its profits responsibly in infrastructure projects , social welfare , schools , and above all in the battle against aids . perhaps more so than in any other african country , the leaders of botswana have realized that if they do not focus their efforts on stopping the spread of aids , all their successes in social , economic and political development will be endangered .
with four out of 10 adults testing hiv positive , botswana has countered the catastrophic situation with a resolute policy : 12 percent of its national budget flows into the health system , one-third into education . madagascar 's liberal course while botswana has proven itself over the decade as a successful reform state , mozambique and madagascar have only recently begun to turn themselves around .
for both , germany remains an important donor nation . in the current and previous year , germany made available some 16.5 million euros -lrb- $ 20 million -rrb- for development programs in madagascar , with the prime benefactors being environmental projects and the protection and sustainable use of natural resources .
after the country 's civil war in 2001 , the economy began to improve . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : madagascar 's capital , antananarivo the fight against poverty is a major goal of the current leadership .
last year , economic growth hovered around 5 percent .
more than two-thirds of all people in madagascar live on less than $ 1 a day , and the public health system is not accessible to a majority of the poor . president marc ravalomanana has set out a liberal economic course for the island nation , with attention focused on infrastructure , education and privatization .
köhler , whose contact with the madagascar leader dates back to his days at the imf , supports ravalomanana . mozambique but it is mozambique that will initially set the accent for köhler 's trip .
it will also be the first time a german president has visited the country .
although mozambique is still dependent on two dozen donor countries , it is also one of the fastest growing economies in africa .
its adjusted growth rate for 2006 is expected to be over 7 percent .
some 70 million euros from external aid flow into education , rural development and economic reform . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mozambique 's capital , maputo it is here that mozambique faces its biggest challenges .
it must push forward with the diversification of its economy .
with the exception of a few large projects financed primarily by south african investors , the economy is dominated by farming , handcrafts and fishing .
for this reason , the country will be watching the large delegation of corporate representatives traveling with köhler in the hopes of winning more german investment projects . africa 's fate peaceful and democratic - all three countries can lay claim to these attributes , and they are all good examples of köhler 's vision for africa .
during his trip through the continent , the german leader will be pressing his message that the world needs to take africa seriously . he is convinced that the security , peace and welfare of europe can only be guaranteed as long as africa receives its own fair chance .
as he said during his inauguration speech : " for me our degree of humanity hangs on the fate of africa .

" this is a strong sign to iran that negotiation , not confrontation , should be their course , " rice said . " it is now up to iran to make a choice ... between isolation brought about by its own actions or a return to the negotiating table , " added steinmeier , the meeting 's host . not full unity over iran cracks appeared between the major powers in berlin over how to act if iran does not comply . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president remains defiant the un statement leaves open what consequences might follow if tehran does not halt uranium enrichment , and russia and china insisted that economic sanctions or military action did not belong on the table . the non-binding un security council declaration was seen as a bid to placate russia and china , which have opposed any hint of punitive measures against iran , an ally and key trading partner .

nuclear power will likely heat up the debate . amid concern about europe 's dependence on russian and middle eastern oil and gas , sharp disagreements over the role of nuclear power still rage in germany .
chancellor merkel , economy minister michael glos and environment minister sigmar gabriel are scheduled to meet with top managers from german utilities and other major firms in the chancellor 's office in berlin on monday evening .
it will be the first of a series of summits and working group meetings aimed at developing strategies for the next 15 years . " we must understand that we have a task that reaches far beyond this parliamentary term , so all subjects will be on the table and different opinions will certainly be exchanged on some points , " merkel told reporters on monday before the meeting .
representatives of labor unions and consumer groups , as well as klaus töpfer , the head of the united nations environment program , have also been invited to the talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel nuclear power will be a hot topic " nuclear power will also be on the agenda , " said jürgen rüttgers of the christian democratic party -lrb- to which merkel belongs -rrb- and premier of north rhine-westfalia .
" the social democratic party and green party ca n't ignore the question of where 30 percent of our energy in germany is to come from in the future , " said rüttgers , referring to the amount nuclear plants have supplied until now . the country 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have been divided over nuclear power .
recent threats by russian gas giant gazprom to cut off gas supplies to ukraine if it did not pay higher prices prompted conservatives near merkel to demand that germany slash a planned phase-out of nuclear energy in germany . the gradual shutdown of all germany 's nuclear power plants was agreed upon in 2000 by the government of former spd chancellor gerhard schröder and his then-coalition partners , the greens . despite germany 's increasing dependence on russian gas - gazprom and two german firms are building a gas pipeline from siberia to germany - the spd are firm on the phase-out and forced the conservatives to back their line in a coalition agreement after last year 's elections . but pro-nuclear conservatives have not given up .
a paper for the summit authored by christian union parliamentarians said that nuclear energy " remains a competitive and co2-free form of energy that is absolutely essential for the foreseeable future . " alternative energies are a long-term goal germany has 17 nuclear power plants , with nuclear reactors providing 30 percent of the electricity the country 's 82 million people require .
some states , however , use a much higher percentage of atomic energy and strongly oppose the phase-out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of germany 's 110-meter-high offshore windmills in the north sea christian wulff , conservative state premier of lower saxony , said germany 's precarious economic recovery could not handle an increase in already-high power costs .
we need an appropriate energy mix that is not based on ideology but on technology , environmental friendliness and price , " he said in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper . environment minister gabriel of the spd disagreed and told the welt am sonntag paper that there was no need for nuclear energy and that even coal , used to produce half of germany 's electricity , was undergoing a " renaissance . "
he also said that " by 2020 it will be possible to cover 20 to 25 percent of our energy demand with renewable sources . " the center-left spd and conservative cdu / csu - as " grand coalition " partners in government - do agree that germany must boost investment in environmentally friendly alternative sources of energy . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g8 split on nuclear power in energy talks g8 countries were divided thursday on ways to ensure long-term world energy security , as the eu admitted its members had diverging views on ambitious plans for developing nuclear power being pushed by russia and the us .

nuclear power will likely heat up the debate . amid concern about europe 's dependence on russian and middle eastern oil and gas , sharp disagreements over the role of nuclear power still rage in germany .
chancellor merkel , economy minister michael glos and environment minister sigmar gabriel are scheduled to meet with top managers from german utilities and other major firms in the chancellor 's office in berlin on monday evening .
it will be the first of a series of summits and working group meetings aimed at developing strategies for the next 15 years . " we must understand that we have a task that reaches far beyond this parliamentary term , so all subjects will be on the table and different opinions will certainly be exchanged on some points , " merkel told reporters on monday before the meeting .
representatives of labor unions and consumer groups , as well as klaus töpfer , the head of the united nations environment program , have also been invited to the talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel nuclear power will be a hot topic " nuclear power will also be on the agenda , " said jürgen rüttgers of the christian democratic party -lrb- to which merkel belongs -rrb- and premier of north rhine-westfalia .
" the social democratic party and green party ca n't ignore the question of where 30 percent of our energy in germany is to come from in the future , " said rüttgers , referring to the amount nuclear plants have supplied until now . the country 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have been divided over nuclear power .
recent threats by russian gas giant gazprom to cut off gas supplies to ukraine if it did not pay higher prices prompted conservatives near merkel to demand that germany slash a planned phase-out of nuclear energy in germany . the gradual shutdown of all germany 's nuclear power plants was agreed upon in 2000 by the government of former spd chancellor gerhard schröder and his then-coalition partners , the greens . despite germany 's increasing dependence on russian gas - gazprom and two german firms are building a gas pipeline from siberia to germany - the spd are firm on the phase-out and forced the conservatives to back their line in a coalition agreement after last year 's elections . but pro-nuclear conservatives have not given up .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.04.2006 german president promotes african successes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler has made africa his political focus on his second trip to africa , horst köhler will focus on the continent 's success stories .
during visits to mozambique , madagascar and botswana , the german leader will promote better understanding of african issues . success stories are rare in africa , a continent plagued by conflict and catastrophe .
even rarer are news reports focusing on the region 's positive aspects .
germany 's president hopes to change that .
his visit to the continent , starting on monday , takes placae under an optimistic motto .
rather than dwelling on africa 's problems , horst köhler wants to draw attention to what works . with stops in mozambique , madagascar and botswana , the president has selected three countries which have managed to free themselves from the yoke of poverty , disease and lack of education .
for köhler , africa is more than a continent in crisis .
he is convinced that europe 's neighbor has more to offer than the negative headlines so often associated with it .
and in his eyes , it is time the international community took more notice . africa must find its own way köhler has observed first hand the difficult political and economic reforms africa has undertaken in the past decades .
during his years as head of the international monetary fund , he traveled the continent six times .
but he has refrained from promoting an ultimate solution for the region 's problems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler visited benin in december 2004 as with his trip last year , which took him to sierra leone , benin and ethiopia , köhler has rejected a cure-all prescription for africa .
" no matter what we do , when we come as outsiders with our aid and our money , we must resist the temptation to press upon the africans our notions of life , " he said after returning from his previous trip . " of course africa has its own tragic history with slavery , colonialism and the east-west conflict ; but it has above all else its own culture , " köhler said .
" we should refrain from exporting our ideals one-to-one to africa , " he said . african role models in december 2004 , köhler launched his first major trip abroad with a visit to sierra leone .
once mired down in a brutal civil war , the country managed to pull itself out of conflict with the aid of a large un mission .
it was this turn in fortune the president focused on , and not the country 's continuing problems . the countries köhler is visiting this time have all found their own way , their own solution for dealing with poverty and the problems of political and economic instability .
botswana , the last country on the president 's itinerary , is clearly a role model in this regard .
the so-called " switzerland of africa " is no longer dependent on development aid .
instead , the country has become exemplary of sustainable and reform-oriented politics in africa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fully automized diamond sorting machine in the jwaneng mine in botswana botswana has the highest gross domestic product in africa .
it owes this relative prosperity to its large diamond deposits : one-third of the world 's diamonds originate here .
the country the size of france and with a population of 1.7 million invests its profits responsibly in infrastructure projects , social welfare , schools , and above all in the battle against aids . perhaps more so than in any other african country , the leaders of botswana have realized that if they do not focus their efforts on stopping the spread of aids , all their successes in social , economic and political development will be endangered .
with four out of 10 adults testing hiv positive , botswana has countered the catastrophic situation with a resolute policy : 12 percent of its national budget flows into the health system , one-third into education . madagascar 's liberal course while botswana has proven itself over the decade as a successful reform state , mozambique and madagascar have only recently begun to turn themselves around .
for both , germany remains an important donor nation . in the current and previous year , germany made available some 16.5 million euros -lrb- $ 20 million -rrb- for development programs in madagascar , with the prime benefactors being environmental projects and the protection and sustainable use of natural resources .
after the country 's civil war in 2001 , the economy began to improve . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : madagascar 's capital , antananarivo the fight against poverty is a major goal of the current leadership .
last year , economic growth hovered around 5 percent .
more than two-thirds of all people in madagascar live on less than $ 1 a day , and the public health system is not accessible to a majority of the poor . president marc ravalomanana has set out a liberal economic course for the island nation , with attention focused on infrastructure , education and privatization .
köhler , whose contact with the madagascar leader dates back to his days at the imf , supports ravalomanana . mozambique but it is mozambique that will initially set the accent for köhler 's trip .
it will also be the first time a german president has visited the country .
although mozambique is still dependent on two dozen donor countries , it is also one of the fastest growing economies in africa .
its adjusted growth rate for 2006 is expected to be over 7 percent .
some 70 million euros from external aid flow into education , rural development and economic reform . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mozambique 's capital , maputo it is here that mozambique faces its biggest challenges .
it must push forward with the diversification of its economy .
with the exception of a few large projects financed primarily by south african investors , the economy is dominated by farming , handcrafts and fishing .
for this reason , the country will be watching the large delegation of corporate representatives traveling with köhler in the hopes of winning more german investment projects . africa 's fate peaceful and democratic - all three countries can lay claim to these attributes , and they are all good examples of köhler 's vision for africa .
during his trip through the continent , the german leader will be pressing his message that the world needs to take africa seriously . he is convinced that the security , peace and welfare of europe can only be guaranteed as long as africa receives its own fair chance .
as he said during his inauguration speech : " for me our degree of humanity hangs on the fate of africa .
is it not a question of europe 's self respect to involve itself - in view of its own basic fundamentals , values and history - honestly and wholeheartedly with africa ?

nuclear power will likely heat up the debate . amid concern about europe 's dependence on russian and middle eastern oil and gas , sharp disagreements over the role of nuclear power still rage in germany .
chancellor merkel , economy minister michael glos and environment minister sigmar gabriel are scheduled to meet with top managers from german utilities and other major firms in the chancellor 's office in berlin on monday evening .
it will be the first of a series of summits and working group meetings aimed at developing strategies for the next 15 years . " we must understand that we have a task that reaches far beyond this parliamentary term , so all subjects will be on the table and different opinions will certainly be exchanged on some points , " merkel told reporters on monday before the meeting .
representatives of labor unions and consumer groups , as well as klaus töpfer , the head of the united nations environment program , have also been invited to the talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel nuclear power will be a hot topic " nuclear power will also be on the agenda , " said jürgen rüttgers of the christian democratic party -lrb- to which merkel belongs -rrb- and premier of north rhine-westfalia .
" the social democratic party and green party ca n't ignore the question of where 30 percent of our energy in germany is to come from in the future , " said rüttgers , referring to the amount nuclear plants have supplied until now . the country 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have been divided over nuclear power .
recent threats by russian gas giant gazprom to cut off gas supplies to ukraine if it did not pay higher prices prompted conservatives near merkel to demand that germany slash a planned phase-out of nuclear energy in germany . the gradual shutdown of all germany 's nuclear power plants was agreed upon in 2000 by the government of former spd chancellor gerhard schröder and his then-coalition partners , the greens . despite germany 's increasing dependence on russian gas - gazprom and two german firms are building a gas pipeline from siberia to germany - the spd are firm on the phase-out and forced the conservatives to back their line in a coalition agreement after last year 's elections . but pro-nuclear conservatives have not given up .
a paper for the summit authored by christian union parliamentarians said that nuclear energy " remains a competitive and co2-free form of energy that is absolutely essential for the foreseeable future . " alternative energies are a long-term goal germany has 17 nuclear power plants , with nuclear reactors providing 30 percent of the electricity the country 's 82 million people require .
some states , however , use a much higher percentage of atomic energy and strongly oppose the phase-out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of germany 's 110-meter-high offshore windmills in the north sea christian wulff , conservative state premier of lower saxony , said germany 's precarious economic recovery could not handle an increase in already-high power costs .
we need an appropriate energy mix that is not based on ideology but on technology , environmental friendliness and price , " he said in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper . environment minister gabriel of the spd disagreed and told the welt am sonntag paper that there was no need for nuclear energy and that even coal , used to produce half of germany 's electricity , was undergoing a " renaissance . "
he also said that " by 2020 it will be possible to cover 20 to 25 percent of our energy demand with renewable sources . " the center-left spd and conservative cdu / csu - as " grand coalition " partners in government - do agree that germany must boost investment in environmentally friendly alternative sources of energy . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g8 split on nuclear power in energy talks g8 countries were divided thursday on ways to ensure long-term world energy security , as the eu admitted its members had diverging views on ambitious plans for developing nuclear power being pushed by russia and the us .

public-private partnerships are one route municipalities have been taking . once more , 2005 was a negative year for city and town treasuries in germany .
municipalities around the country were 2.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.76 billion -rrb- in the red .
it was an improvement of 1.6 billion euros over 2004 , but the situation of german cities is not positive .
the city of dresden has taken the radical approach of eliminating its debts by selling its complete real estate holding - 48,000 apartments - for 1.7 billion euros to the us investment company fortress .
the transaction met with some skepticism from politicians and economists who feared that dresden was surrendering an important core asset .
but as local german governments search for alternative financing possibilities to offset their shrinking revenues , privatization deals look more and more appealing to many .
the new trend : ppp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden gave apartments a fresh coat of paint before selling them what has been a phenomenon primarily in the anglo-american world is beginning to take root in germany , namely the public-private partnership , or ppp .
the main goal of public-private projects is to allow cash-strapped local and state governments to undertake projects that are for many no longer feasible , such as hospitals , schools , and administrative buildings and even highways .
the ppp concept is relatively simple .
a private contractor , or frequently a consortium of companies , provides the financing and construction of a building .
the consortium acts as a landlord and also takes care of building maintenance .
the municipality , like a tenant , pays for use of the hospital or school .
after a period of time , usually 20 to 30 years for a school or hospital , the local government assumes ownership of the facility .
its proponents stress that there are numerous advantages to such partnerships .
according to the ppp task force of north-rhine westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- , which provides assistance to cities and districts in such matters , the biggest plus is savings of 6 to 15 percent compared to when a municipality plans , builds , finances and runs the building itself .
efficiency , spreading payments over time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schools financed by consortiums may be built faster one of the first ppp projects in nrw was a school and adjoining sports gymnasium in the city of frechen in the rhine-erft district between cologne and bonn .
not only was 12 percent saved compared to if the district had itself overseen the construction process , the consortium was able to hand over the keys just 15 months after the contract had been signed .
" we were very pleased with how quickly the project was completed , " said rhine-erft district project director anton-josef cremer .
" we are also happy about the efficiency when something must be fixed or attended to in the building .
it takes much less time than before . "
earlier , a crew from the responsible city or district would have been called in to fix a faulty boiler or replace a broken window , but the work was not always done quickly .
besides the practical aspects , the district is relieved from immediately coming up with a large sum of money to pay for the project , according to cremer .
the rhine-erft district will spread out the payments in the form of rent for 25 years , which substantially eases its tight financial situation .
but there is a downside .
the district no longer dictates who can use the building and how .
when they draw up usage contracts with the facility managers , the district officials must be specific about which clubs can use a school or gym .
if one group is forgotten , as the rhine-erft district did in the school pilot project , the contract must be renegotiated or the group must pay .
" naturally we can subsidize some groups , but we are going to have to make some hard choices about who receives how much money , " said cremer .
convincing politicians proving difficult local leaders are treading new waters when dealing with public-private partnerships .
the ppp task force in nrw , the first of its kind in the country when it was established in 2002 , has sometimes found it difficult to convince politicians that ppps are worthwhile .

nuclear power will likely heat up the debate . amid concern about europe 's dependence on russian and middle eastern oil and gas , sharp disagreements over the role of nuclear power still rage in germany .
chancellor merkel , economy minister michael glos and environment minister sigmar gabriel are scheduled to meet with top managers from german utilities and other major firms in the chancellor 's office in berlin on monday evening .
it will be the first of a series of summits and working group meetings aimed at developing strategies for the next 15 years . " we must understand that we have a task that reaches far beyond this parliamentary term , so all subjects will be on the table and different opinions will certainly be exchanged on some points , " merkel told reporters on monday before the meeting .
representatives of labor unions and consumer groups , as well as klaus töpfer , the head of the united nations environment program , have also been invited to the talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel nuclear power will be a hot topic " nuclear power will also be on the agenda , " said jürgen rüttgers of the christian democratic party -lrb- to which merkel belongs -rrb- and premier of north rhine-westfalia .
" the social democratic party and green party ca n't ignore the question of where 30 percent of our energy in germany is to come from in the future , " said rüttgers , referring to the amount nuclear plants have supplied until now . the country 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have been divided over nuclear power .
recent threats by russian gas giant gazprom to cut off gas supplies to ukraine if it did not pay higher prices prompted conservatives near merkel to demand that germany slash a planned phase-out of nuclear energy in germany . the gradual shutdown of all germany 's nuclear power plants was agreed upon in 2000 by the government of former spd chancellor gerhard schröder and his then-coalition partners , the greens . despite germany 's increasing dependence on russian gas - gazprom and two german firms are building a gas pipeline from siberia to germany - the spd are firm on the phase-out and forced the conservatives to back their line in a coalition agreement after last year 's elections . but pro-nuclear conservatives have not given up .
a paper for the summit authored by christian union parliamentarians said that nuclear energy " remains a competitive and co2-free form of energy that is absolutely essential for the foreseeable future . " alternative energies are a long-term goal germany has 17 nuclear power plants , with nuclear reactors providing 30 percent of the electricity the country 's 82 million people require .
some states , however , use a much higher percentage of atomic energy and strongly oppose the phase-out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of germany 's 110-meter-high offshore windmills in the north sea christian wulff , conservative state premier of lower saxony , said germany 's precarious economic recovery could not handle an increase in already-high power costs .
we need an appropriate energy mix that is not based on ideology but on technology , environmental friendliness and price , " he said in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper . environment minister gabriel of the spd disagreed and told the welt am sonntag paper that there was no need for nuclear energy and that even coal , used to produce half of germany 's electricity , was undergoing a " renaissance . "
he also said that " by 2020 it will be possible to cover 20 to 25 percent of our energy demand with renewable sources .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.04.2006 german president promotes african successes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler has made africa his political focus on his second trip to africa , horst köhler will focus on the continent 's success stories .
during visits to mozambique , madagascar and botswana , the german leader will promote better understanding of african issues . success stories are rare in africa , a continent plagued by conflict and catastrophe .
even rarer are news reports focusing on the region 's positive aspects .
germany 's president hopes to change that .
his visit to the continent , starting on monday , takes placae under an optimistic motto .
rather than dwelling on africa 's problems , horst köhler wants to draw attention to what works . with stops in mozambique , madagascar and botswana , the president has selected three countries which have managed to free themselves from the yoke of poverty , disease and lack of education .
for köhler , africa is more than a continent in crisis .
he is convinced that europe 's neighbor has more to offer than the negative headlines so often associated with it .
and in his eyes , it is time the international community took more notice . africa must find its own way köhler has observed first hand the difficult political and economic reforms africa has undertaken in the past decades .
during his years as head of the international monetary fund , he traveled the continent six times .
but he has refrained from promoting an ultimate solution for the region 's problems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler visited benin in december 2004 as with his trip last year , which took him to sierra leone , benin and ethiopia , köhler has rejected a cure-all prescription for africa .
" no matter what we do , when we come as outsiders with our aid and our money , we must resist the temptation to press upon the africans our notions of life , " he said after returning from his previous trip . " of course africa has its own tragic history with slavery , colonialism and the east-west conflict ; but it has above all else its own culture , " köhler said .
" we should refrain from exporting our ideals one-to-one to africa , " he said . african role models in december 2004 , köhler launched his first major trip abroad with a visit to sierra leone .
once mired down in a brutal civil war , the country managed to pull itself out of conflict with the aid of a large un mission .
it was this turn in fortune the president focused on , and not the country 's continuing problems . the countries köhler is visiting this time have all found their own way , their own solution for dealing with poverty and the problems of political and economic instability .
botswana , the last country on the president 's itinerary , is clearly a role model in this regard .
the so-called " switzerland of africa " is no longer dependent on development aid .
instead , the country has become exemplary of sustainable and reform-oriented politics in africa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fully automized diamond sorting machine in the jwaneng mine in botswana botswana has the highest gross domestic product in africa .
it owes this relative prosperity to its large diamond deposits : one-third of the world 's diamonds originate here .
the country the size of france and with a population of 1.7 million invests its profits responsibly in infrastructure projects , social welfare , schools , and above all in the battle against aids . perhaps more so than in any other african country , the leaders of botswana have realized that if they do not focus their efforts on stopping the spread of aids , all their successes in social , economic and political development will be endangered .
with four out of 10 adults testing hiv positive , botswana has countered the catastrophic situation with a resolute policy : 12 percent of its national budget flows into the health system , one-third into education . madagascar 's liberal course while botswana has proven itself over the decade as a successful reform state , mozambique and madagascar have only recently begun to turn themselves around .
for both , germany remains an important donor nation . in the current and previous year , germany made available some 16.5 million euros -lrb- $ 20 million -rrb- for development programs in madagascar , with the prime benefactors being environmental projects and the protection and sustainable use of natural resources .
after the country 's civil war in 2001 , the economy began to improve . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : madagascar 's capital , antananarivo the fight against poverty is a major goal of the current leadership .
last year , economic growth hovered around 5 percent .
more than two-thirds of all people in madagascar live on less than $ 1 a day , and the public health system is not accessible to a majority of the poor . president marc ravalomanana has set out a liberal economic course for the island nation , with attention focused on infrastructure , education and privatization .
köhler , whose contact with the madagascar leader dates back to his days at the imf , supports ravalomanana . mozambique but it is mozambique that will initially set the accent for köhler 's trip .
it will also be the first time a german president has visited the country .
although mozambique is still dependent on two dozen donor countries , it is also one of the fastest growing economies in africa .
its adjusted growth rate for 2006 is expected to be over 7 percent .
some 70 million euros from external aid flow into education , rural development and economic reform . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mozambique 's capital , maputo it is here that mozambique faces its biggest challenges .
it must push forward with the diversification of its economy .
with the exception of a few large projects financed primarily by south african investors , the economy is dominated by farming , handcrafts and fishing .
for this reason , the country will be watching the large delegation of corporate representatives traveling with köhler in the hopes of winning more german investment projects . africa 's fate peaceful and democratic - all three countries can lay claim to these attributes , and they are all good examples of köhler 's vision for africa .
during his trip through the continent , the german leader will be pressing his message that the world needs to take africa seriously . he is convinced that the security , peace and welfare of europe can only be guaranteed as long as africa receives its own fair chance .
as he said during his inauguration speech : " for me our degree of humanity hangs on the fate of africa .

during visits to mozambique , madagascar and botswana , the german leader will promote better understanding of african issues . success stories are rare in africa , a continent plagued by conflict and catastrophe .
even rarer are news reports focusing on the region 's positive aspects .
germany 's president hopes to change that .
his visit to the continent , starting on monday , takes placae under an optimistic motto .
rather than dwelling on africa 's problems , horst köhler wants to draw attention to what works . with stops in mozambique , madagascar and botswana , the president has selected three countries which have managed to free themselves from the yoke of poverty , disease and lack of education .
for köhler , africa is more than a continent in crisis .
he is convinced that europe 's neighbor has more to offer than the negative headlines so often associated with it .
and in his eyes , it is time the international community took more notice . africa must find its own way köhler has observed first hand the difficult political and economic reforms africa has undertaken in the past decades .
during his years as head of the international monetary fund , he traveled the continent six times .
but he has refrained from promoting an ultimate solution for the region 's problems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler visited benin in december 2004 as with his trip last year , which took him to sierra leone , benin and ethiopia , köhler has rejected a cure-all prescription for africa .
" no matter what we do , when we come as outsiders with our aid and our money , we must resist the temptation to press upon the africans our notions of life , " he said after returning from his previous trip . " of course africa has its own tragic history with slavery , colonialism and the east-west conflict ; but it has above all else its own culture , " köhler said .
" we should refrain from exporting our ideals one-to-one to africa , " he said . african role models in december 2004 , köhler launched his first major trip abroad with a visit to sierra leone .
once mired down in a brutal civil war , the country managed to pull itself out of conflict with the aid of a large un mission .
it was this turn in fortune the president focused on , and not the country 's continuing problems . the countries köhler is visiting this time have all found their own way , their own solution for dealing with poverty and the problems of political and economic instability .
botswana , the last country on the president 's itinerary , is clearly a role model in this regard .
the so-called " switzerland of africa " is no longer dependent on development aid .
instead , the country has become exemplary of sustainable and reform-oriented politics in africa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fully automized diamond sorting machine in the jwaneng mine in botswana botswana has the highest gross domestic product in africa .
it owes this relative prosperity to its large diamond deposits : one-third of the world 's diamonds originate here .
the country the size of france and with a population of 1.7 million invests its profits responsibly in infrastructure projects , social welfare , schools , and above all in the battle against aids . perhaps more so than in any other african country , the leaders of botswana have realized that if they do not focus their efforts on stopping the spread of aids , all their successes in social , economic and political development will be endangered .
with four out of 10 adults testing hiv positive , botswana has countered the catastrophic situation with a resolute policy : 12 percent of its national budget flows into the health system , one-third into education . madagascar 's liberal course while botswana has proven itself over the decade as a successful reform state , mozambique and madagascar have only recently begun to turn themselves around .
for both , germany remains an important donor nation . in the current and previous year , germany made available some 16.5 million euros -lrb- $ 20 million -rrb- for development programs in madagascar , with the prime benefactors being environmental projects and the protection and sustainable use of natural resources .
after the country 's civil war in 2001 , the economy began to improve . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : madagascar 's capital , antananarivo the fight against poverty is a major goal of the current leadership .
last year , economic growth hovered around 5 percent .
more than two-thirds of all people in madagascar live on less than $ 1 a day , and the public health system is not accessible to a majority of the poor . president marc ravalomanana has set out a liberal economic course for the island nation , with attention focused on infrastructure , education and privatization .
köhler , whose contact with the madagascar leader dates back to his days at the imf , supports ravalomanana . mozambique but it is mozambique that will initially set the accent for köhler 's trip .
it will also be the first time a german president has visited the country .
although mozambique is still dependent on two dozen donor countries , it is also one of the fastest growing economies in africa .
its adjusted growth rate for 2006 is expected to be over 7 percent .
some 70 million euros from external aid flow into education , rural development and economic reform . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mozambique 's capital , maputo it is here that mozambique faces its biggest challenges .
it must push forward with the diversification of its economy .
with the exception of a few large projects financed primarily by south african investors , the economy is dominated by farming , handcrafts and fishing .
for this reason , the country will be watching the large delegation of corporate representatives traveling with köhler in the hopes of winning more german investment projects . africa 's fate peaceful and democratic - all three countries can lay claim to these attributes , and they are all good examples of köhler 's vision for africa .
during his trip through the continent , the german leader will be pressing his message that the world needs to take africa seriously . he is convinced that the security , peace and welfare of europe can only be guaranteed as long as africa receives its own fair chance .
as he said during his inauguration speech : " for me our degree of humanity hangs on the fate of africa .
is it not a question of europe 's self respect to involve itself - in view of its own basic fundamentals , values and history - honestly and wholeheartedly with africa ?

once ridiculed by society mavens for her dowdy dress sense , merkel has now managed to silence even those critics with her latest turn as a fashion muse for german designer , wolfgang joop . joop was apparently so taken with merkel 's image change that he has dedicated a clothing line from his new fall / winter collection to her .

according to joop , it 's a style that will appeal to the " worldly woman . " " it 's not a style that everyone will like , " he told bild .
" but if you try to please everyone , you end up pleasing no one . " there 's been no word yet on whether chancellor merkel herself is pleased with her new role as a fashion icon .
nor , for that matter , on whether she is even a fan of joop 's clothing . she did once pay a visit to his atelier , the designer said , but not to buy haute couture .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.04.2006 german president promotes african successes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler has made africa his political focus on his second trip to africa , horst köhler will focus on the continent 's success stories .
during visits to mozambique , madagascar and botswana , the german leader will promote better understanding of african issues . success stories are rare in africa , a continent plagued by conflict and catastrophe .
even rarer are news reports focusing on the region 's positive aspects .
germany 's president hopes to change that .
his visit to the continent , starting on monday , takes placae under an optimistic motto .
rather than dwelling on africa 's problems , horst köhler wants to draw attention to what works . with stops in mozambique , madagascar and botswana , the president has selected three countries which have managed to free themselves from the yoke of poverty , disease and lack of education .
for köhler , africa is more than a continent in crisis .
he is convinced that europe 's neighbor has more to offer than the negative headlines so often associated with it .
and in his eyes , it is time the international community took more notice . africa must find its own way köhler has observed first hand the difficult political and economic reforms africa has undertaken in the past decades .
during his years as head of the international monetary fund , he traveled the continent six times .
but he has refrained from promoting an ultimate solution for the region 's problems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler visited benin in december 2004 as with his trip last year , which took him to sierra leone , benin and ethiopia , köhler has rejected a cure-all prescription for africa .
" no matter what we do , when we come as outsiders with our aid and our money , we must resist the temptation to press upon the africans our notions of life , " he said after returning from his previous trip . " of course africa has its own tragic history with slavery , colonialism and the east-west conflict ; but it has above all else its own culture , " köhler said .
" we should refrain from exporting our ideals one-to-one to africa , " he said . african role models in december 2004 , köhler launched his first major trip abroad with a visit to sierra leone .
once mired down in a brutal civil war , the country managed to pull itself out of conflict with the aid of a large un mission .
it was this turn in fortune the president focused on , and not the country 's continuing problems . the countries köhler is visiting this time have all found their own way , their own solution for dealing with poverty and the problems of political and economic instability .
botswana , the last country on the president 's itinerary , is clearly a role model in this regard .
the so-called " switzerland of africa " is no longer dependent on development aid .
instead , the country has become exemplary of sustainable and reform-oriented politics in africa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fully automized diamond sorting machine in the jwaneng mine in botswana botswana has the highest gross domestic product in africa .
it owes this relative prosperity to its large diamond deposits : one-third of the world 's diamonds originate here .
the country the size of france and with a population of 1.7 million invests its profits responsibly in infrastructure projects , social welfare , schools , and above all in the battle against aids . perhaps more so than in any other african country , the leaders of botswana have realized that if they do not focus their efforts on stopping the spread of aids , all their successes in social , economic and political development will be endangered .
with four out of 10 adults testing hiv positive , botswana has countered the catastrophic situation with a resolute policy : 12 percent of its national budget flows into the health system , one-third into education . madagascar 's liberal course while botswana has proven itself over the decade as a successful reform state , mozambique and madagascar have only recently begun to turn themselves around .
for both , germany remains an important donor nation . in the current and previous year , germany made available some 16.5 million euros -lrb- $ 20 million -rrb- for development programs in madagascar , with the prime benefactors being environmental projects and the protection and sustainable use of natural resources .
after the country 's civil war in 2001 , the economy began to improve . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : madagascar 's capital , antananarivo the fight against poverty is a major goal of the current leadership .
last year , economic growth hovered around 5 percent .
more than two-thirds of all people in madagascar live on less than $ 1 a day , and the public health system is not accessible to a majority of the poor . president marc ravalomanana has set out a liberal economic course for the island nation , with attention focused on infrastructure , education and privatization .
köhler , whose contact with the madagascar leader dates back to his days at the imf , supports ravalomanana . mozambique but it is mozambique that will initially set the accent for köhler 's trip .
it will also be the first time a german president has visited the country .
although mozambique is still dependent on two dozen donor countries , it is also one of the fastest growing economies in africa .
its adjusted growth rate for 2006 is expected to be over 7 percent .
some 70 million euros from external aid flow into education , rural development and economic reform . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mozambique 's capital , maputo it is here that mozambique faces its biggest challenges .
it must push forward with the diversification of its economy .
with the exception of a few large projects financed primarily by south african investors , the economy is dominated by farming , handcrafts and fishing .
for this reason , the country will be watching the large delegation of corporate representatives traveling with köhler in the hopes of winning more german investment projects . africa 's fate peaceful and democratic - all three countries can lay claim to these attributes , and they are all good examples of köhler 's vision for africa .
during his trip through the continent , the german leader will be pressing his message that the world needs to take africa seriously . he is convinced that the security , peace and welfare of europe can only be guaranteed as long as africa receives its own fair chance .
as he said during his inauguration speech : " for me our degree of humanity hangs on the fate of africa .
is it not a question of europe 's self respect to involve itself - in view of its own basic fundamentals , values and history - honestly and wholeheartedly with africa ?

breuer was chief executive officer of germany 's largest bank at the time . in january , germany 's highest court ruled breuer 's comments breached the bank 's contractual duty of not having a negative effect on a customer 's ability to receive credit from other sources .
one of kirch 's media units had loans of over 700 million euros -lrb- $ 848 million -rrb- . " it 's a shame that kirch is the reason for his departure , " wolfgang gerke , a professor of banking at the university of nuremberg-erlangen , told bloomburg .

"
kirch 's lawyers said they anticipate receiving up to 1.5 billion euros in compensation should they win the case . dax reaches five-year high finance markets also greeted the change positively .
investment bank merrill lynch upgraded deutsche bank stocks to " buy " after sunday 's announcement that chief financial officer clemens börsig would take over breuer 's position .
anthony di iorio will then become cfo and hugo bänziger will join the board as chief risk officer , the bank announced . " investors are relying on deutsche bank being kept out of negative headlines after breuer 's resignation , " a trader told reuters . concerns from westlb analyst georg kanders that the resignation could add fuel to the kirch fire and scare away investors initially appeared unfounded .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 03.04.2006 german public sector looks for private help großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the route to new schools could be private finance to counteract the financial crises many german cities find themselves in , they 've been looking to the private sector for help .
public-private partnerships are one route municipalities have been taking . once more , 2005 was a negative year for city and town treasuries in germany .
municipalities around the country were 2.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.76 billion -rrb- in the red .
it was an improvement of 1.6 billion euros over 2004 , but the situation of german cities is not positive .
the city of dresden has taken the radical approach of eliminating its debts by selling its complete real estate holding - 48,000 apartments - for 1.7 billion euros to the us investment company fortress .
the transaction met with some skepticism from politicians and economists who feared that dresden was surrendering an important core asset .
but as local german governments search for alternative financing possibilities to offset their shrinking revenues , privatization deals look more and more appealing to many .
the new trend : ppp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden gave apartments a fresh coat of paint before selling them what has been a phenomenon primarily in the anglo-american world is beginning to take root in germany , namely the public-private partnership , or ppp .
the main goal of public-private projects is to allow cash-strapped local and state governments to undertake projects that are for many no longer feasible , such as hospitals , schools , and administrative buildings and even highways .
the ppp concept is relatively simple .
a private contractor , or frequently a consortium of companies , provides the financing and construction of a building .
the consortium acts as a landlord and also takes care of building maintenance .
the municipality , like a tenant , pays for use of the hospital or school .
after a period of time , usually 20 to 30 years for a school or hospital , the local government assumes ownership of the facility .
its proponents stress that there are numerous advantages to such partnerships .
according to the ppp task force of north-rhine westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- , which provides assistance to cities and districts in such matters , the biggest plus is savings of 6 to 15 percent compared to when a municipality plans , builds , finances and runs the building itself .
efficiency , spreading payments over time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schools financed by consortiums may be built faster one of the first ppp projects in nrw was a school and adjoining sports gymnasium in the city of frechen in the rhine-erft district between cologne and bonn .
not only was 12 percent saved compared to if the district had itself overseen the construction process , the consortium was able to hand over the keys just 15 months after the contract had been signed .
" we were very pleased with how quickly the project was completed , " said rhine-erft district project director anton-josef cremer .
" we are also happy about the efficiency when something must be fixed or attended to in the building .
it takes much less time than before . "
earlier , a crew from the responsible city or district would have been called in to fix a faulty boiler or replace a broken window , but the work was not always done quickly .
besides the practical aspects , the district is relieved from immediately coming up with a large sum of money to pay for the project , according to cremer .
the rhine-erft district will spread out the payments in the form of rent for 25 years , which substantially eases its tight financial situation .
but there is a downside .
the district no longer dictates who can use the building and how .
when they draw up usage contracts with the facility managers , the district officials must be specific about which clubs can use a school or gym .
if one group is forgotten , as the rhine-erft district did in the school pilot project , the contract must be renegotiated or the group must pay .
" naturally we can subsidize some groups , but we are going to have to make some hard choices about who receives how much money , " said cremer .

" there 's something fishy about the whole matter , " she told the bild daily .
schröder 's government approved the gazprom credit just weeks before schröder stepped down from government after elections in september . the green party , with whom schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- formed a coalition in government , has also not ruled out a parliamentary inquiry .
" you just ca n't do something like that , " said green party economics expert matthias berninger .
berninger said he was interested in discovering who else knew about the billion-euro loan guarantee . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loans must be approved before gas can flow bodo ramelow , deputy head of the left party parliamentary group , said his party is reviewing legal action that could be taken against members of schröder 's spd-green government should more damaging details emerge .
" we could be talking about the misappropriation of tax money here , " ramelow said . even schröder 's own party has criticized the former chancellor 's actions .
" you just ca n't ignore it when someone has messed things up , " garrelt duin of the spd told die welt newspaper . russian newspaper nezavisimaya gazeta wrote on monday that " gerhard schröder 's business relationship with gazprom is looking more and more unsavory ...
the image of the most important joint energy project for europe is suffering as a result . " on friday , schröder officially took up the post as head of the supervisory board of a consortium that plans to build the natural pipeline under the baltic sea from russia to germany .
gazprom holds 51 percent of the consortium 's shares . schröder has since defended his decision to head the board following criticism of alleged imprudent behavior . schröder said he was only offered the supervisory board post , for which he will earn an annual salary of 250,000 euros , after he left office in november .
" i can not see anything wrong with that , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a still-optimistic schröder he also told the handelsblatt business daily he had been unaware his -lrb- former -rrb- administration had guaranteed the credit gazprom 's pipeline .
he added that gazprom had no plans to take the loan .
" i did not know about these proceedings , " he said . " but the key point is that gazprom has already said that it has not and will not accept the financing option put forward by the banks .
thus , there will not be a federal loan guarantee for the two german banks , " he added . the economy ministry confirmed saturday that an inter-ministerial commission rushed through a " decision in principle " on oct .
24 last year while waiting for a new coalition to be formed by now chancellor angela merkel . schröder also told handelsblatt that : " federal loan guarantees are a tried and tested instrument to defend the economic interests of our country , " he said .
" that especially includes a reliable supply of natural resources for german industry . " schröder seems to have gained the upper hand in another battle as well .
he has repeatedly sued guido westerwelle , head of the free democrat -lrb- fdp -rrb- party , for verbal attacks about the gazprom affair .
on monday , following an appeal by schröder last week , the hamburg district court barred westerwelle from making further comments about schröder 's supervisory board position . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : schröder government approved gazprom credit the former german government of gerhard schröder guaranteed a credit of one billion euros -lrb- $ 1.2 billion -rrb- for the russian gas group gazprom 's baltic pipeline project , a german daily reported in its saturday edition .
-lrb- april 1 , 2006 -rrb- former chancellor schröder sworn in at russia 's gazprom former german chancellor gerhard schröder was voted in thursday as head of the supervisory board of a consortium that plans to build a natural gas pipeline under the baltic sea from russia to germany , officials said .

" when you play against ten men for so long you expect to win , " hamburg manager thomas doll said .
" that was a giant step towards the champions league . " schalke were left to rue the sending off of their young brazilian defender rafinha after he lashed out at rafael van der vaart on 28 minutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sergej barbarez and the rest of the hamburg team were a step above schalke " rafa should not do that , but you should not go down like a bag of potatoes either , " schalke team manager andreas müller said . dutch international van der vaart picked himself up to open the coring in the 57th minute with a brilliant free-kick . brazilian striker ailton , on loan at hamburg from turkish side besiktas , then came back to haunt schalke who sold him in the summer . substituted into the match , ailton struck in the 80th minute after using his pace to power away from the schalke defense . kahn the april fool in cologne hamburg , who last appeared in the champions league back in 2001 , are now seven points behind munich after the bavarian giants drew 2-2 with fc cologne . it was april fool 's day and the joke was on german international goalkeeper oliver kahn who produced a major howler to allow cologne a share of the spoils . the 36-year-old kahn shrugged off a hip injury to face cologne but may wish he had n't bothered after allowing albert streit 's speculative shot to squirm under his body to restore cologne 's lead at 2-1 , surprising the cologne scorer as much as everyone watching . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a goal from roy makaay , right , got bayern one point in cologne kahn , who was replaced at half-time by michael rensing , will hope germany manager jürgen klinsmann missed his gaffe as he bids to prove he is germany 's number one ahead of this summer 's world cup finals . " i was helpless for the first goal , but i was at fault for the second goal and have to hold my hands up , " kahn said , before making a rare admission of guilt .
" but as a goalkeeper you know there will be errors like that from time to time . " arsenal goalkeeper jens lehmann , kahn 's rival for the number one jersey at the world cup , will no doubt watch the replays with a pleased grin . crowd unhappy over ballack departure fortunately , kahn has field players capable of getting him out of trouble - dutch international roy makaay equalized shortly before half-time . bayern have seen their lead cut to seven points but , barring an almighty collapse in their final six games , felix magath 's team will be collecting their 20th domestic title in may . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 2-2 draw and the crowd 's whistles made it a hard day for ballack german international captain michael ballack has been a driving force behind the title bid but the player , who looks set to join english champions chelsea on a free transfer in the summer , was jeered by the home bayern fans after a poor display . " it is always a problem when you have a player who is likely to be playing somewhere else in the near future , " bayern coach magath said .
" but it is not michael ballack 's fault that the game finished 2-2 . " klose continues scoring while kahn and ballack had an afternoon to forget their international teammate miroslav klose continued to do no wrong . bremen striker klose scored a 70th minute penalty to help bremen to a vital 1-0 win over eintracht frankfurt on saturday . it was klose 's 20th goal of a prolific season and helped bremen consolidate third position , three points behind hamburg but four points clear of schalke . " his goal was worth its weight in gold , " said bremen sporting director klaus allofs . " we are in a champions league place now and that was the target before next weekend 's match against bayern .

" i can not see anything wrong with that , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a still-optimistic schröder he also told the handelsblatt business daily he had been unaware his -lrb- former -rrb- administration had guaranteed the credit gazprom 's pipeline .
he added that gazprom had no plans to take the loan .
" i did not know about these proceedings , " he said . " but the key point is that gazprom has already said that it has not and will not accept the financing option put forward by the banks .
thus , there will not be a federal loan guarantee for the two german banks , " he added . the economy ministry confirmed saturday that an inter-ministerial commission rushed through a " decision in principle " on oct .

" that especially includes a reliable supply of natural resources for german industry . " schröder seems to have gained the upper hand in another battle as well .
he has repeatedly sued guido westerwelle , head of the free democrat -lrb- fdp -rrb- party , for verbal attacks about the gazprom affair .
on monday , following an appeal by schröder last week , the hamburg district court barred westerwelle from making further comments about schröder 's supervisory board position . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : schröder government approved gazprom credit the former german government of gerhard schröder guaranteed a credit of one billion euros -lrb- $ 1.2 billion -rrb- for the russian gas group gazprom 's baltic pipeline project , a german daily reported in its saturday edition .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.04.2006 nuclear power tiff to dominate merkel 's energy summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear power plants provide about a third of germany 's electricity german chancellor angela merkel will meet with ministers and industry chiefs on monday to plot strategies for long-term energy security .
nuclear power will likely heat up the debate . amid concern about europe 's dependence on russian and middle eastern oil and gas , sharp disagreements over the role of nuclear power still rage in germany .
chancellor merkel , economy minister michael glos and environment minister sigmar gabriel are scheduled to meet with top managers from german utilities and other major firms in the chancellor 's office in berlin on monday evening .
it will be the first of a series of summits and working group meetings aimed at developing strategies for the next 15 years . " we must understand that we have a task that reaches far beyond this parliamentary term , so all subjects will be on the table and different opinions will certainly be exchanged on some points , " merkel told reporters on monday before the meeting .
representatives of labor unions and consumer groups , as well as klaus töpfer , the head of the united nations environment program , have also been invited to the talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel nuclear power will be a hot topic " nuclear power will also be on the agenda , " said jürgen rüttgers of the christian democratic party -lrb- to which merkel belongs -rrb- and premier of north rhine-westfalia .
" the social democratic party and green party ca n't ignore the question of where 30 percent of our energy in germany is to come from in the future , " said rüttgers , referring to the amount nuclear plants have supplied until now . the country 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have been divided over nuclear power .
recent threats by russian gas giant gazprom to cut off gas supplies to ukraine if it did not pay higher prices prompted conservatives near merkel to demand that germany slash a planned phase-out of nuclear energy in germany . the gradual shutdown of all germany 's nuclear power plants was agreed upon in 2000 by the government of former spd chancellor gerhard schröder and his then-coalition partners , the greens . despite germany 's increasing dependence on russian gas - gazprom and two german firms are building a gas pipeline from siberia to germany - the spd are firm on the phase-out and forced the conservatives to back their line in a coalition agreement after last year 's elections . but pro-nuclear conservatives have not given up .
a paper for the summit authored by christian union parliamentarians said that nuclear energy " remains a competitive and co2-free form of energy that is absolutely essential for the foreseeable future . " alternative energies are a long-term goal germany has 17 nuclear power plants , with nuclear reactors providing 30 percent of the electricity the country 's 82 million people require .
some states , however , use a much higher percentage of atomic energy and strongly oppose the phase-out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of germany 's 110-meter-high offshore windmills in the north sea christian wulff , conservative state premier of lower saxony , said germany 's precarious economic recovery could not handle an increase in already-high power costs .
we need an appropriate energy mix that is not based on ideology but on technology , environmental friendliness and price , " he said in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper . environment minister gabriel of the spd disagreed and told the welt am sonntag paper that there was no need for nuclear energy and that even coal , used to produce half of germany 's electricity , was undergoing a " renaissance . "

" when you play against ten men for so long you expect to win , " hamburg manager thomas doll said .
" that was a giant step towards the champions league . " schalke were left to rue the sending off of their young brazilian defender rafinha after he lashed out at rafael van der vaart on 28 minutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sergej barbarez and the rest of the hamburg team were a step above schalke " rafa should not do that , but you should not go down like a bag of potatoes either , " schalke team manager andreas müller said . dutch international van der vaart picked himself up to open the coring in the 57th minute with a brilliant free-kick . brazilian striker ailton , on loan at hamburg from turkish side besiktas , then came back to haunt schalke who sold him in the summer . substituted into the match , ailton struck in the 80th minute after using his pace to power away from the schalke defense . kahn the april fool in cologne hamburg , who last appeared in the champions league back in 2001 , are now seven points behind munich after the bavarian giants drew 2-2 with fc cologne . it was april fool 's day and the joke was on german international goalkeeper oliver kahn who produced a major howler to allow cologne a share of the spoils . the 36-year-old kahn shrugged off a hip injury to face cologne but may wish he had n't bothered after allowing albert streit 's speculative shot to squirm under his body to restore cologne 's lead at 2-1 , surprising the cologne scorer as much as everyone watching . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a goal from roy makaay , right , got bayern one point in cologne kahn , who was replaced at half-time by michael rensing , will hope germany manager jürgen klinsmann missed his gaffe as he bids to prove he is germany 's number one ahead of this summer 's world cup finals . " i was helpless for the first goal , but i was at fault for the second goal and have to hold my hands up , " kahn said , before making a rare admission of guilt .
" but as a goalkeeper you know there will be errors like that from time to time . " arsenal goalkeeper jens lehmann , kahn 's rival for the number one jersey at the world cup , will no doubt watch the replays with a pleased grin . crowd unhappy over ballack departure fortunately , kahn has field players capable of getting him out of trouble - dutch international roy makaay equalized shortly before half-time . bayern have seen their lead cut to seven points but , barring an almighty collapse in their final six games , felix magath 's team will be collecting their 20th domestic title in may . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 2-2 draw and the crowd 's whistles made it a hard day for ballack german international captain michael ballack has been a driving force behind the title bid but the player , who looks set to join english champions chelsea on a free transfer in the summer , was jeered by the home bayern fans after a poor display . " it is always a problem when you have a player who is likely to be playing somewhere else in the near future , " bayern coach magath said .
" but it is not michael ballack 's fault that the game finished 2-2 . " klose continues scoring while kahn and ballack had an afternoon to forget their international teammate miroslav klose continued to do no wrong . bremen striker klose scored a 70th minute penalty to help bremen to a vital 1-0 win over eintracht frankfurt on saturday . it was klose 's 20th goal of a prolific season and helped bremen consolidate third position , three points behind hamburg but four points clear of schalke .

public-private partnerships are one route municipalities have been taking . once more , 2005 was a negative year for city and town treasuries in germany .
municipalities around the country were 2.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.76 billion -rrb- in the red .
it was an improvement of 1.6 billion euros over 2004 , but the situation of german cities is not positive .
the city of dresden has taken the radical approach of eliminating its debts by selling its complete real estate holding - 48,000 apartments - for 1.7 billion euros to the us investment company fortress .
the transaction met with some skepticism from politicians and economists who feared that dresden was surrendering an important core asset .
but as local german governments search for alternative financing possibilities to offset their shrinking revenues , privatization deals look more and more appealing to many .
the new trend : ppp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden gave apartments a fresh coat of paint before selling them what has been a phenomenon primarily in the anglo-american world is beginning to take root in germany , namely the public-private partnership , or ppp .
the main goal of public-private projects is to allow cash-strapped local and state governments to undertake projects that are for many no longer feasible , such as hospitals , schools , and administrative buildings and even highways .
the ppp concept is relatively simple .
a private contractor , or frequently a consortium of companies , provides the financing and construction of a building .
the consortium acts as a landlord and also takes care of building maintenance .
the municipality , like a tenant , pays for use of the hospital or school .
after a period of time , usually 20 to 30 years for a school or hospital , the local government assumes ownership of the facility .
its proponents stress that there are numerous advantages to such partnerships .
according to the ppp task force of north-rhine westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- , which provides assistance to cities and districts in such matters , the biggest plus is savings of 6 to 15 percent compared to when a municipality plans , builds , finances and runs the building itself .
efficiency , spreading payments over time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schools financed by consortiums may be built faster one of the first ppp projects in nrw was a school and adjoining sports gymnasium in the city of frechen in the rhine-erft district between cologne and bonn .
not only was 12 percent saved compared to if the district had itself overseen the construction process , the consortium was able to hand over the keys just 15 months after the contract had been signed .
" we were very pleased with how quickly the project was completed , " said rhine-erft district project director anton-josef cremer .
" we are also happy about the efficiency when something must be fixed or attended to in the building .
it takes much less time than before . "
earlier , a crew from the responsible city or district would have been called in to fix a faulty boiler or replace a broken window , but the work was not always done quickly .
besides the practical aspects , the district is relieved from immediately coming up with a large sum of money to pay for the project , according to cremer .
the rhine-erft district will spread out the payments in the form of rent for 25 years , which substantially eases its tight financial situation .
but there is a downside .
the district no longer dictates who can use the building and how .
when they draw up usage contracts with the facility managers , the district officials must be specific about which clubs can use a school or gym .
if one group is forgotten , as the rhine-erft district did in the school pilot project , the contract must be renegotiated or the group must pay .
" naturally we can subsidize some groups , but we are going to have to make some hard choices about who receives how much money , " said cremer .
convincing politicians proving difficult local leaders are treading new waters when dealing with public-private partnerships .
the ppp task force in nrw , the first of its kind in the country when it was established in 2002 , has sometimes found it difficult to convince politicians that ppps are worthwhile .

public-private partnerships are one route municipalities have been taking . once more , 2005 was a negative year for city and town treasuries in germany .
municipalities around the country were 2.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.76 billion -rrb- in the red .
it was an improvement of 1.6 billion euros over 2004 , but the situation of german cities is not positive .
the city of dresden has taken the radical approach of eliminating its debts by selling its complete real estate holding - 48,000 apartments - for 1.7 billion euros to the us investment company fortress .
the transaction met with some skepticism from politicians and economists who feared that dresden was surrendering an important core asset .
but as local german governments search for alternative financing possibilities to offset their shrinking revenues , privatization deals look more and more appealing to many .
the new trend : ppp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden gave apartments a fresh coat of paint before selling them what has been a phenomenon primarily in the anglo-american world is beginning to take root in germany , namely the public-private partnership , or ppp .
the main goal of public-private projects is to allow cash-strapped local and state governments to undertake projects that are for many no longer feasible , such as hospitals , schools , and administrative buildings and even highways .
the ppp concept is relatively simple .
a private contractor , or frequently a consortium of companies , provides the financing and construction of a building .
the consortium acts as a landlord and also takes care of building maintenance .
the municipality , like a tenant , pays for use of the hospital or school .
after a period of time , usually 20 to 30 years for a school or hospital , the local government assumes ownership of the facility .
its proponents stress that there are numerous advantages to such partnerships .
according to the ppp task force of north-rhine westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- , which provides assistance to cities and districts in such matters , the biggest plus is savings of 6 to 15 percent compared to when a municipality plans , builds , finances and runs the building itself .

not only was 12 percent saved compared to if the district had itself overseen the construction process , the consortium was able to hand over the keys just 15 months after the contract had been signed .
" we were very pleased with how quickly the project was completed , " said rhine-erft district project director anton-josef cremer .
" we are also happy about the efficiency when something must be fixed or attended to in the building .
it takes much less time than before . "
earlier , a crew from the responsible city or district would have been called in to fix a faulty boiler or replace a broken window , but the work was not always done quickly .
besides the practical aspects , the district is relieved from immediately coming up with a large sum of money to pay for the project , according to cremer .
the rhine-erft district will spread out the payments in the form of rent for 25 years , which substantially eases its tight financial situation .
but there is a downside .
the district no longer dictates who can use the building and how .
when they draw up usage contracts with the facility managers , the district officials must be specific about which clubs can use a school or gym .
if one group is forgotten , as the rhine-erft district did in the school pilot project , the contract must be renegotiated or the group must pay .
" naturally we can subsidize some groups , but we are going to have to make some hard choices about who receives how much money , " said cremer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 03.04.2006 german public sector looks for private help großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the route to new schools could be private finance to counteract the financial crises many german cities find themselves in , they 've been looking to the private sector for help .
public-private partnerships are one route municipalities have been taking . once more , 2005 was a negative year for city and town treasuries in germany .
municipalities around the country were 2.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.76 billion -rrb- in the red .
it was an improvement of 1.6 billion euros over 2004 , but the situation of german cities is not positive .
the city of dresden has taken the radical approach of eliminating its debts by selling its complete real estate holding - 48,000 apartments - for 1.7 billion euros to the us investment company fortress .
the transaction met with some skepticism from politicians and economists who feared that dresden was surrendering an important core asset .
but as local german governments search for alternative financing possibilities to offset their shrinking revenues , privatization deals look more and more appealing to many .
the new trend : ppp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden gave apartments a fresh coat of paint before selling them what has been a phenomenon primarily in the anglo-american world is beginning to take root in germany , namely the public-private partnership , or ppp .
the main goal of public-private projects is to allow cash-strapped local and state governments to undertake projects that are for many no longer feasible , such as hospitals , schools , and administrative buildings and even highways .
the ppp concept is relatively simple .
a private contractor , or frequently a consortium of companies , provides the financing and construction of a building .
the consortium acts as a landlord and also takes care of building maintenance .
the municipality , like a tenant , pays for use of the hospital or school .
after a period of time , usually 20 to 30 years for a school or hospital , the local government assumes ownership of the facility .
its proponents stress that there are numerous advantages to such partnerships .
according to the ppp task force of north-rhine westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- , which provides assistance to cities and districts in such matters , the biggest plus is savings of 6 to 15 percent compared to when a municipality plans , builds , finances and runs the building itself .
efficiency , spreading payments over time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schools financed by consortiums may be built faster one of the first ppp projects in nrw was a school and adjoining sports gymnasium in the city of frechen in the rhine-erft district between cologne and bonn .
not only was 12 percent saved compared to if the district had itself overseen the construction process , the consortium was able to hand over the keys just 15 months after the contract had been signed .
" we were very pleased with how quickly the project was completed , " said rhine-erft district project director anton-josef cremer .
" we are also happy about the efficiency when something must be fixed or attended to in the building .
it takes much less time than before . "
earlier , a crew from the responsible city or district would have been called in to fix a faulty boiler or replace a broken window , but the work was not always done quickly .
besides the practical aspects , the district is relieved from immediately coming up with a large sum of money to pay for the project , according to cremer .
the rhine-erft district will spread out the payments in the form of rent for 25 years , which substantially eases its tight financial situation .
but there is a downside .
the district no longer dictates who can use the building and how .
when they draw up usage contracts with the facility managers , the district officials must be specific about which clubs can use a school or gym .
if one group is forgotten , as the rhine-erft district did in the school pilot project , the contract must be renegotiated or the group must pay .
" naturally we can subsidize some groups , but we are going to have to make some hard choices about who receives how much money , " said cremer .
convincing politicians proving difficult local leaders are treading new waters when dealing with public-private partnerships .
the ppp task force in nrw , the first of its kind in the country when it was established in 2002 , has sometimes found it difficult to convince politicians that ppps are worthwhile .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german state of north rhine-westphalia is using a ppp to build a new prison " local leaders can be somewhat skeptical when it comes to public-private projects .
some politicians do n't like letting go of the reins of control in such matters , " said task force director frank littwin .
nevertheless , littwin said , city halls and the state government in düsseldorf have been turning more and more to his group for assistance with large projects .
one of its most recent plans is to help nrw to build a new prison , a the first projecct of its kind in germany .
reflecting the money-saving measures almost all states and municipalities in germany are taking , the ppp task force has ever more work on its hands . john kluempers send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dresden agrees to sell real estate holdings to us investor in a deal that will wipe out the eastern german city of dresden 's debt in one go , us property investment company fortress deutschland has been given the go-ahead to buy the city 's entire residential real estate holdings .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.04.2006 gerhard schröder takes a blow over gazprom großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and putin signed the pipeline deal in september germany 's opposition fdp party has threatened to demand a parliamentary inquiry into the so-called " pipeline affair " involving the former government of gerhard schröder and russian gas group gazprom . following a report in the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper over the weekend about the approval of a billion euro -lrb- $ 1.2 billion -rrb- credit for gazprom 's baltic pipeline by former chancellor schröder 's government , fdp opposition party energy expert gudrun kopp said she would fight for a parliamentary investigation .
" there 's something fishy about the whole matter , " she told the bild daily .
schröder 's government approved the gazprom credit just weeks before schröder stepped down from government after elections in september . the green party , with whom schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- formed a coalition in government , has also not ruled out a parliamentary inquiry .
" you just ca n't do something like that , " said green party economics expert matthias berninger .
berninger said he was interested in discovering who else knew about the billion-euro loan guarantee . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loans must be approved before gas can flow bodo ramelow , deputy head of the left party parliamentary group , said his party is reviewing legal action that could be taken against members of schröder 's spd-green government should more damaging details emerge .
" we could be talking about the misappropriation of tax money here , " ramelow said . even schröder 's own party has criticized the former chancellor 's actions .
" you just ca n't ignore it when someone has messed things up , " garrelt duin of the spd told die welt newspaper . russian newspaper nezavisimaya gazeta wrote on monday that " gerhard schröder 's business relationship with gazprom is looking more and more unsavory ...
the image of the most important joint energy project for europe is suffering as a result . " on friday , schröder officially took up the post as head of the supervisory board of a consortium that plans to build the natural pipeline under the baltic sea from russia to germany .
gazprom holds 51 percent of the consortium 's shares . schröder has since defended his decision to head the board following criticism of alleged imprudent behavior . schröder said he was only offered the supervisory board post , for which he will earn an annual salary of 250,000 euros , after he left office in november .
" i can not see anything wrong with that , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a still-optimistic schröder he also told the handelsblatt business daily he had been unaware his -lrb- former -rrb- administration had guaranteed the credit gazprom 's pipeline .
he added that gazprom had no plans to take the loan .
" i did not know about these proceedings , " he said . " but the key point is that gazprom has already said that it has not and will not accept the financing option put forward by the banks .
thus , there will not be a federal loan guarantee for the two german banks , " he added . the economy ministry confirmed saturday that an inter-ministerial commission rushed through a " decision in principle " on oct .
24 last year while waiting for a new coalition to be formed by now chancellor angela merkel . schröder also told handelsblatt that : " federal loan guarantees are a tried and tested instrument to defend the economic interests of our country , " he said .
" that especially includes a reliable supply of natural resources for german industry . " schröder seems to have gained the upper hand in another battle as well .
he has repeatedly sued guido westerwelle , head of the free democrat -lrb- fdp -rrb- party , for verbal attacks about the gazprom affair .
on monday , following an appeal by schröder last week , the hamburg district court barred westerwelle from making further comments about schröder 's supervisory board position . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : schröder government approved gazprom credit the former german government of gerhard schröder guaranteed a credit of one billion euros -lrb- $ 1.2 billion -rrb- for the russian gas group gazprom 's baltic pipeline project , a german daily reported in its saturday edition .

" there 's something fishy about the whole matter , " she told the bild daily .
schröder 's government approved the gazprom credit just weeks before schröder stepped down from government after elections in september . the green party , with whom schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- formed a coalition in government , has also not ruled out a parliamentary inquiry .
" you just ca n't do something like that , " said green party economics expert matthias berninger .
berninger said he was interested in discovering who else knew about the billion-euro loan guarantee . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loans must be approved before gas can flow bodo ramelow , deputy head of the left party parliamentary group , said his party is reviewing legal action that could be taken against members of schröder 's spd-green government should more damaging details emerge .
" we could be talking about the misappropriation of tax money here , " ramelow said . even schröder 's own party has criticized the former chancellor 's actions .
" you just ca n't ignore it when someone has messed things up , " garrelt duin of the spd told die welt newspaper . russian newspaper nezavisimaya gazeta wrote on monday that " gerhard schröder 's business relationship with gazprom is looking more and more unsavory ...
the image of the most important joint energy project for europe is suffering as a result . " on friday , schröder officially took up the post as head of the supervisory board of a consortium that plans to build the natural pipeline under the baltic sea from russia to germany .
gazprom holds 51 percent of the consortium 's shares . schröder has since defended his decision to head the board following criticism of alleged imprudent behavior . schröder said he was only offered the supervisory board post , for which he will earn an annual salary of 250,000 euros , after he left office in november .

public-private partnerships are one route municipalities have been taking . once more , 2005 was a negative year for city and town treasuries in germany .
municipalities around the country were 2.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.76 billion -rrb- in the red .
it was an improvement of 1.6 billion euros over 2004 , but the situation of german cities is not positive .
the city of dresden has taken the radical approach of eliminating its debts by selling its complete real estate holding - 48,000 apartments - for 1.7 billion euros to the us investment company fortress .
the transaction met with some skepticism from politicians and economists who feared that dresden was surrendering an important core asset .
but as local german governments search for alternative financing possibilities to offset their shrinking revenues , privatization deals look more and more appealing to many .
the new trend : ppp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden gave apartments a fresh coat of paint before selling them what has been a phenomenon primarily in the anglo-american world is beginning to take root in germany , namely the public-private partnership , or ppp .
the main goal of public-private projects is to allow cash-strapped local and state governments to undertake projects that are for many no longer feasible , such as hospitals , schools , and administrative buildings and even highways .
the ppp concept is relatively simple .
a private contractor , or frequently a consortium of companies , provides the financing and construction of a building .
the consortium acts as a landlord and also takes care of building maintenance .
the municipality , like a tenant , pays for use of the hospital or school .
after a period of time , usually 20 to 30 years for a school or hospital , the local government assumes ownership of the facility .
its proponents stress that there are numerous advantages to such partnerships .
according to the ppp task force of north-rhine westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- , which provides assistance to cities and districts in such matters , the biggest plus is savings of 6 to 15 percent compared to when a municipality plans , builds , finances and runs the building itself .
efficiency , spreading payments over time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schools financed by consortiums may be built faster one of the first ppp projects in nrw was a school and adjoining sports gymnasium in the city of frechen in the rhine-erft district between cologne and bonn .
not only was 12 percent saved compared to if the district had itself overseen the construction process , the consortium was able to hand over the keys just 15 months after the contract had been signed .
" we were very pleased with how quickly the project was completed , " said rhine-erft district project director anton-josef cremer .
" we are also happy about the efficiency when something must be fixed or attended to in the building .
it takes much less time than before . "
earlier , a crew from the responsible city or district would have been called in to fix a faulty boiler or replace a broken window , but the work was not always done quickly .
besides the practical aspects , the district is relieved from immediately coming up with a large sum of money to pay for the project , according to cremer .
the rhine-erft district will spread out the payments in the form of rent for 25 years , which substantially eases its tight financial situation .
but there is a downside .
the district no longer dictates who can use the building and how .
when they draw up usage contracts with the facility managers , the district officials must be specific about which clubs can use a school or gym .
if one group is forgotten , as the rhine-erft district did in the school pilot project , the contract must be renegotiated or the group must pay .
" naturally we can subsidize some groups , but we are going to have to make some hard choices about who receives how much money , " said cremer .
convincing politicians proving difficult local leaders are treading new waters when dealing with public-private partnerships .
the ppp task force in nrw , the first of its kind in the country when it was established in 2002 , has sometimes found it difficult to convince politicians that ppps are worthwhile .

nevertheless , littwin said , city halls and the state government in düsseldorf have been turning more and more to his group for assistance with large projects .
one of its most recent plans is to help nrw to build a new prison , a the first projecct of its kind in germany .

public-private partnerships are one route municipalities have been taking . once more , 2005 was a negative year for city and town treasuries in germany .
municipalities around the country were 2.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.76 billion -rrb- in the red .
it was an improvement of 1.6 billion euros over 2004 , but the situation of german cities is not positive .
the city of dresden has taken the radical approach of eliminating its debts by selling its complete real estate holding - 48,000 apartments - for 1.7 billion euros to the us investment company fortress .
the transaction met with some skepticism from politicians and economists who feared that dresden was surrendering an important core asset .
but as local german governments search for alternative financing possibilities to offset their shrinking revenues , privatization deals look more and more appealing to many .
the new trend : ppp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden gave apartments a fresh coat of paint before selling them what has been a phenomenon primarily in the anglo-american world is beginning to take root in germany , namely the public-private partnership , or ppp .
the main goal of public-private projects is to allow cash-strapped local and state governments to undertake projects that are for many no longer feasible , such as hospitals , schools , and administrative buildings and even highways .
the ppp concept is relatively simple .
a private contractor , or frequently a consortium of companies , provides the financing and construction of a building .
the consortium acts as a landlord and also takes care of building maintenance .
the municipality , like a tenant , pays for use of the hospital or school .
after a period of time , usually 20 to 30 years for a school or hospital , the local government assumes ownership of the facility .
its proponents stress that there are numerous advantages to such partnerships .
according to the ppp task force of north-rhine westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- , which provides assistance to cities and districts in such matters , the biggest plus is savings of 6 to 15 percent compared to when a municipality plans , builds , finances and runs the building itself .

not only was 12 percent saved compared to if the district had itself overseen the construction process , the consortium was able to hand over the keys just 15 months after the contract had been signed .
" we were very pleased with how quickly the project was completed , " said rhine-erft district project director anton-josef cremer .
" we are also happy about the efficiency when something must be fixed or attended to in the building .
it takes much less time than before . "
earlier , a crew from the responsible city or district would have been called in to fix a faulty boiler or replace a broken window , but the work was not always done quickly .
besides the practical aspects , the district is relieved from immediately coming up with a large sum of money to pay for the project , according to cremer .
the rhine-erft district will spread out the payments in the form of rent for 25 years , which substantially eases its tight financial situation .
but there is a downside .
the district no longer dictates who can use the building and how .
when they draw up usage contracts with the facility managers , the district officials must be specific about which clubs can use a school or gym .
if one group is forgotten , as the rhine-erft district did in the school pilot project , the contract must be renegotiated or the group must pay .

" when you play against ten men for so long you expect to win , " hamburg manager thomas doll said .
" that was a giant step towards the champions league . " schalke were left to rue the sending off of their young brazilian defender rafinha after he lashed out at rafael van der vaart on 28 minutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sergej barbarez and the rest of the hamburg team were a step above schalke " rafa should not do that , but you should not go down like a bag of potatoes either , " schalke team manager andreas müller said . dutch international van der vaart picked himself up to open the coring in the 57th minute with a brilliant free-kick . brazilian striker ailton , on loan at hamburg from turkish side besiktas , then came back to haunt schalke who sold him in the summer . substituted into the match , ailton struck in the 80th minute after using his pace to power away from the schalke defense . kahn the april fool in cologne hamburg , who last appeared in the champions league back in 2001 , are now seven points behind munich after the bavarian giants drew 2-2 with fc cologne . it was april fool 's day and the joke was on german international goalkeeper oliver kahn who produced a major howler to allow cologne a share of the spoils . the 36-year-old kahn shrugged off a hip injury to face cologne but may wish he had n't bothered after allowing albert streit 's speculative shot to squirm under his body to restore cologne 's lead at 2-1 , surprising the cologne scorer as much as everyone watching . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a goal from roy makaay , right , got bayern one point in cologne kahn , who was replaced at half-time by michael rensing , will hope germany manager jürgen klinsmann missed his gaffe as he bids to prove he is germany 's number one ahead of this summer 's world cup finals . " i was helpless for the first goal , but i was at fault for the second goal and have to hold my hands up , " kahn said , before making a rare admission of guilt .
" but as a goalkeeper you know there will be errors like that from time to time . " arsenal goalkeeper jens lehmann , kahn 's rival for the number one jersey at the world cup , will no doubt watch the replays with a pleased grin . crowd unhappy over ballack departure fortunately , kahn has field players capable of getting him out of trouble - dutch international roy makaay equalized shortly before half-time . bayern have seen their lead cut to seven points but , barring an almighty collapse in their final six games , felix magath 's team will be collecting their 20th domestic title in may . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 2-2 draw and the crowd 's whistles made it a hard day for ballack german international captain michael ballack has been a driving force behind the title bid but the player , who looks set to join english champions chelsea on a free transfer in the summer , was jeered by the home bayern fans after a poor display . " it is always a problem when you have a player who is likely to be playing somewhere else in the near future , " bayern coach magath said .
" but it is not michael ballack 's fault that the game finished 2-2 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 03.04.2006 resignation aimed to protect deutsche bank großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysts are pleased with a five-year high and are n't shocked by breuer 's resignation a result of comments in 2002 questioning the credit worthiness of leo kirch 's media company , former deutsche bank supervisory board chairman rolf breuer resigned in a move some saw as exaggerated and others overdue . deutsche bank and breuer are still fighting claims that breuer 's comments damaged kirch holding by questioning the firm 's creditworthiness in 2002 .
breuer was chief executive officer of germany 's largest bank at the time . in january , germany 's highest court ruled breuer 's comments breached the bank 's contractual duty of not having a negative effect on a customer 's ability to receive credit from other sources .
one of kirch 's media units had loans of over 700 million euros -lrb- $ 848 million -rrb- . " it 's a shame that kirch is the reason for his departure , " wolfgang gerke , a professor of banking at the university of nuremberg-erlangen , told bloomburg .
" the remark he made was n't new .
everyone knew it .
it was on the edge of what one can say . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ceo for five years , breuer moved up the deutsche bank ladder from an apprenticeship in 1956 decision to protect deutsche bank the 69-year-old 's resignation may be a sign that the court case against him and the bank is reaching a head , as he admitted he stepped down " to relieve deutsche bank of further discussion regarding him personally , " according to a deutsche bank statement released sunday . kirch lawyer peter gauweiler , who along with other kirch representatives , has long called for breuer to step down , welcomed the announcement , telling the associated press he thought the move " was overdue . "
kirch 's lawyers said they anticipate receiving up to 1.5 billion euros in compensation should they win the case . dax reaches five-year high finance markets also greeted the change positively .
investment bank merrill lynch upgraded deutsche bank stocks to " buy " after sunday 's announcement that chief financial officer clemens börsig would take over breuer 's position .
anthony di iorio will then become cfo and hugo bänziger will join the board as chief risk officer , the bank announced . " investors are relying on deutsche bank being kept out of negative headlines after breuer 's resignation , " a trader told reuters . concerns from westlb analyst georg kanders that the resignation could add fuel to the kirch fire and scare away investors initially appeared unfounded .

during visits to mozambique , madagascar and botswana , the german leader will promote better understanding of african issues . success stories are rare in africa , a continent plagued by conflict and catastrophe .
even rarer are news reports focusing on the region 's positive aspects .
germany 's president hopes to change that .
his visit to the continent , starting on monday , takes placae under an optimistic motto .
rather than dwelling on africa 's problems , horst köhler wants to draw attention to what works . with stops in mozambique , madagascar and botswana , the president has selected three countries which have managed to free themselves from the yoke of poverty , disease and lack of education .
for köhler , africa is more than a continent in crisis .
he is convinced that europe 's neighbor has more to offer than the negative headlines so often associated with it .
and in his eyes , it is time the international community took more notice . africa must find its own way köhler has observed first hand the difficult political and economic reforms africa has undertaken in the past decades .
during his years as head of the international monetary fund , he traveled the continent six times .
but he has refrained from promoting an ultimate solution for the region 's problems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler visited benin in december 2004 as with his trip last year , which took him to sierra leone , benin and ethiopia , köhler has rejected a cure-all prescription for africa .
" no matter what we do , when we come as outsiders with our aid and our money , we must resist the temptation to press upon the africans our notions of life , " he said after returning from his previous trip . " of course africa has its own tragic history with slavery , colonialism and the east-west conflict ; but it has above all else its own culture , " köhler said .
" we should refrain from exporting our ideals one-to-one to africa , " he said . african role models in december 2004 , köhler launched his first major trip abroad with a visit to sierra leone .
once mired down in a brutal civil war , the country managed to pull itself out of conflict with the aid of a large un mission .
it was this turn in fortune the president focused on , and not the country 's continuing problems . the countries köhler is visiting this time have all found their own way , their own solution for dealing with poverty and the problems of political and economic instability .
botswana , the last country on the president 's itinerary , is clearly a role model in this regard .
the so-called " switzerland of africa " is no longer dependent on development aid .
instead , the country has become exemplary of sustainable and reform-oriented politics in africa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fully automized diamond sorting machine in the jwaneng mine in botswana botswana has the highest gross domestic product in africa .
it owes this relative prosperity to its large diamond deposits : one-third of the world 's diamonds originate here .
the country the size of france and with a population of 1.7 million invests its profits responsibly in infrastructure projects , social welfare , schools , and above all in the battle against aids . perhaps more so than in any other african country , the leaders of botswana have realized that if they do not focus their efforts on stopping the spread of aids , all their successes in social , economic and political development will be endangered .
with four out of 10 adults testing hiv positive , botswana has countered the catastrophic situation with a resolute policy : 12 percent of its national budget flows into the health system , one-third into education . madagascar 's liberal course while botswana has proven itself over the decade as a successful reform state , mozambique and madagascar have only recently begun to turn themselves around .
for both , germany remains an important donor nation . in the current and previous year , germany made available some 16.5 million euros -lrb- $ 20 million -rrb- for development programs in madagascar , with the prime benefactors being environmental projects and the protection and sustainable use of natural resources .
after the country 's civil war in 2001 , the economy began to improve . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : madagascar 's capital , antananarivo the fight against poverty is a major goal of the current leadership .
last year , economic growth hovered around 5 percent .
more than two-thirds of all people in madagascar live on less than $ 1 a day , and the public health system is not accessible to a majority of the poor . president marc ravalomanana has set out a liberal economic course for the island nation , with attention focused on infrastructure , education and privatization .
köhler , whose contact with the madagascar leader dates back to his days at the imf , supports ravalomanana . mozambique but it is mozambique that will initially set the accent for köhler 's trip .
it will also be the first time a german president has visited the country .
although mozambique is still dependent on two dozen donor countries , it is also one of the fastest growing economies in africa .
its adjusted growth rate for 2006 is expected to be over 7 percent .
some 70 million euros from external aid flow into education , rural development and economic reform . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mozambique 's capital , maputo it is here that mozambique faces its biggest challenges .
it must push forward with the diversification of its economy .
with the exception of a few large projects financed primarily by south african investors , the economy is dominated by farming , handcrafts and fishing .
for this reason , the country will be watching the large delegation of corporate representatives traveling with köhler in the hopes of winning more german investment projects . africa 's fate peaceful and democratic - all three countries can lay claim to these attributes , and they are all good examples of köhler 's vision for africa .
during his trip through the continent , the german leader will be pressing his message that the world needs to take africa seriously . he is convinced that the security , peace and welfare of europe can only be guaranteed as long as africa receives its own fair chance .
as he said during his inauguration speech : " for me our degree of humanity hangs on the fate of africa .
is it not a question of europe 's self respect to involve itself - in view of its own basic fundamentals , values and history - honestly and wholeheartedly with africa ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.04.2006 german president promotes african successes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler has made africa his political focus on his second trip to africa , horst köhler will focus on the continent 's success stories .
during visits to mozambique , madagascar and botswana , the german leader will promote better understanding of african issues . success stories are rare in africa , a continent plagued by conflict and catastrophe .
even rarer are news reports focusing on the region 's positive aspects .
germany 's president hopes to change that .
his visit to the continent , starting on monday , takes placae under an optimistic motto .
rather than dwelling on africa 's problems , horst köhler wants to draw attention to what works . with stops in mozambique , madagascar and botswana , the president has selected three countries which have managed to free themselves from the yoke of poverty , disease and lack of education .
for köhler , africa is more than a continent in crisis .
he is convinced that europe 's neighbor has more to offer than the negative headlines so often associated with it .
and in his eyes , it is time the international community took more notice . africa must find its own way köhler has observed first hand the difficult political and economic reforms africa has undertaken in the past decades .
during his years as head of the international monetary fund , he traveled the continent six times .
but he has refrained from promoting an ultimate solution for the region 's problems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler visited benin in december 2004 as with his trip last year , which took him to sierra leone , benin and ethiopia , köhler has rejected a cure-all prescription for africa .
" no matter what we do , when we come as outsiders with our aid and our money , we must resist the temptation to press upon the africans our notions of life , " he said after returning from his previous trip . " of course africa has its own tragic history with slavery , colonialism and the east-west conflict ; but it has above all else its own culture , " köhler said .
" we should refrain from exporting our ideals one-to-one to africa , " he said . african role models in december 2004 , köhler launched his first major trip abroad with a visit to sierra leone .
once mired down in a brutal civil war , the country managed to pull itself out of conflict with the aid of a large un mission .
it was this turn in fortune the president focused on , and not the country 's continuing problems . the countries köhler is visiting this time have all found their own way , their own solution for dealing with poverty and the problems of political and economic instability .
botswana , the last country on the president 's itinerary , is clearly a role model in this regard .
the so-called " switzerland of africa " is no longer dependent on development aid .
instead , the country has become exemplary of sustainable and reform-oriented politics in africa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fully automized diamond sorting machine in the jwaneng mine in botswana botswana has the highest gross domestic product in africa .
it owes this relative prosperity to its large diamond deposits : one-third of the world 's diamonds originate here .
the country the size of france and with a population of 1.7 million invests its profits responsibly in infrastructure projects , social welfare , schools , and above all in the battle against aids . perhaps more so than in any other african country , the leaders of botswana have realized that if they do not focus their efforts on stopping the spread of aids , all their successes in social , economic and political development will be endangered .
with four out of 10 adults testing hiv positive , botswana has countered the catastrophic situation with a resolute policy : 12 percent of its national budget flows into the health system , one-third into education . madagascar 's liberal course while botswana has proven itself over the decade as a successful reform state , mozambique and madagascar have only recently begun to turn themselves around .
for both , germany remains an important donor nation . in the current and previous year , germany made available some 16.5 million euros -lrb- $ 20 million -rrb- for development programs in madagascar , with the prime benefactors being environmental projects and the protection and sustainable use of natural resources .
after the country 's civil war in 2001 , the economy began to improve . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : madagascar 's capital , antananarivo the fight against poverty is a major goal of the current leadership .
last year , economic growth hovered around 5 percent .
more than two-thirds of all people in madagascar live on less than $ 1 a day , and the public health system is not accessible to a majority of the poor . president marc ravalomanana has set out a liberal economic course for the island nation , with attention focused on infrastructure , education and privatization .
köhler , whose contact with the madagascar leader dates back to his days at the imf , supports ravalomanana . mozambique but it is mozambique that will initially set the accent for köhler 's trip .
it will also be the first time a german president has visited the country .
although mozambique is still dependent on two dozen donor countries , it is also one of the fastest growing economies in africa .
its adjusted growth rate for 2006 is expected to be over 7 percent .
some 70 million euros from external aid flow into education , rural development and economic reform . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mozambique 's capital , maputo it is here that mozambique faces its biggest challenges .
it must push forward with the diversification of its economy .
with the exception of a few large projects financed primarily by south african investors , the economy is dominated by farming , handcrafts and fishing .
for this reason , the country will be watching the large delegation of corporate representatives traveling with köhler in the hopes of winning more german investment projects . africa 's fate peaceful and democratic - all three countries can lay claim to these attributes , and they are all good examples of köhler 's vision for africa .
during his trip through the continent , the german leader will be pressing his message that the world needs to take africa seriously . he is convinced that the security , peace and welfare of europe can only be guaranteed as long as africa receives its own fair chance .
as he said during his inauguration speech : " for me our degree of humanity hangs on the fate of africa .
is it not a question of europe 's self respect to involve itself - in view of its own basic fundamentals , values and history - honestly and wholeheartedly with africa ?

nuclear power will likely heat up the debate . amid concern about europe 's dependence on russian and middle eastern oil and gas , sharp disagreements over the role of nuclear power still rage in germany .
chancellor merkel , economy minister michael glos and environment minister sigmar gabriel are scheduled to meet with top managers from german utilities and other major firms in the chancellor 's office in berlin on monday evening .
it will be the first of a series of summits and working group meetings aimed at developing strategies for the next 15 years . " we must understand that we have a task that reaches far beyond this parliamentary term , so all subjects will be on the table and different opinions will certainly be exchanged on some points , " merkel told reporters on monday before the meeting .
representatives of labor unions and consumer groups , as well as klaus töpfer , the head of the united nations environment program , have also been invited to the talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel nuclear power will be a hot topic " nuclear power will also be on the agenda , " said jürgen rüttgers of the christian democratic party -lrb- to which merkel belongs -rrb- and premier of north rhine-westfalia .
" the social democratic party and green party ca n't ignore the question of where 30 percent of our energy in germany is to come from in the future , " said rüttgers , referring to the amount nuclear plants have supplied until now . the country 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have been divided over nuclear power .
recent threats by russian gas giant gazprom to cut off gas supplies to ukraine if it did not pay higher prices prompted conservatives near merkel to demand that germany slash a planned phase-out of nuclear energy in germany . the gradual shutdown of all germany 's nuclear power plants was agreed upon in 2000 by the government of former spd chancellor gerhard schröder and his then-coalition partners , the greens . despite germany 's increasing dependence on russian gas - gazprom and two german firms are building a gas pipeline from siberia to germany - the spd are firm on the phase-out and forced the conservatives to back their line in a coalition agreement after last year 's elections . but pro-nuclear conservatives have not given up .
a paper for the summit authored by christian union parliamentarians said that nuclear energy " remains a competitive and co2-free form of energy that is absolutely essential for the foreseeable future . " alternative energies are a long-term goal germany has 17 nuclear power plants , with nuclear reactors providing 30 percent of the electricity the country 's 82 million people require .
some states , however , use a much higher percentage of atomic energy and strongly oppose the phase-out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of germany 's 110-meter-high offshore windmills in the north sea christian wulff , conservative state premier of lower saxony , said germany 's precarious economic recovery could not handle an increase in already-high power costs .
we need an appropriate energy mix that is not based on ideology but on technology , environmental friendliness and price , " he said in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper . environment minister gabriel of the spd disagreed and told the welt am sonntag paper that there was no need for nuclear energy and that even coal , used to produce half of germany 's electricity , was undergoing a " renaissance . "
he also said that " by 2020 it will be possible to cover 20 to 25 percent of our energy demand with renewable sources . " the center-left spd and conservative cdu / csu - as " grand coalition " partners in government - do agree that germany must boost investment in environmentally friendly alternative sources of energy . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g8 split on nuclear power in energy talks g8 countries were divided thursday on ways to ensure long-term world energy security , as the eu admitted its members had diverging views on ambitious plans for developing nuclear power being pushed by russia and the us .

nuclear power will likely heat up the debate . amid concern about europe 's dependence on russian and middle eastern oil and gas , sharp disagreements over the role of nuclear power still rage in germany .
chancellor merkel , economy minister michael glos and environment minister sigmar gabriel are scheduled to meet with top managers from german utilities and other major firms in the chancellor 's office in berlin on monday evening .
it will be the first of a series of summits and working group meetings aimed at developing strategies for the next 15 years . " we must understand that we have a task that reaches far beyond this parliamentary term , so all subjects will be on the table and different opinions will certainly be exchanged on some points , " merkel told reporters on monday before the meeting .
representatives of labor unions and consumer groups , as well as klaus töpfer , the head of the united nations environment program , have also been invited to the talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel nuclear power will be a hot topic " nuclear power will also be on the agenda , " said jürgen rüttgers of the christian democratic party -lrb- to which merkel belongs -rrb- and premier of north rhine-westfalia .
" the social democratic party and green party ca n't ignore the question of where 30 percent of our energy in germany is to come from in the future , " said rüttgers , referring to the amount nuclear plants have supplied until now . the country 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have been divided over nuclear power .
recent threats by russian gas giant gazprom to cut off gas supplies to ukraine if it did not pay higher prices prompted conservatives near merkel to demand that germany slash a planned phase-out of nuclear energy in germany . the gradual shutdown of all germany 's nuclear power plants was agreed upon in 2000 by the government of former spd chancellor gerhard schröder and his then-coalition partners , the greens . despite germany 's increasing dependence on russian gas - gazprom and two german firms are building a gas pipeline from siberia to germany - the spd are firm on the phase-out and forced the conservatives to back their line in a coalition agreement after last year 's elections . but pro-nuclear conservatives have not given up .
a paper for the summit authored by christian union parliamentarians said that nuclear energy " remains a competitive and co2-free form of energy that is absolutely essential for the foreseeable future . " alternative energies are a long-term goal germany has 17 nuclear power plants , with nuclear reactors providing 30 percent of the electricity the country 's 82 million people require .
some states , however , use a much higher percentage of atomic energy and strongly oppose the phase-out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of germany 's 110-meter-high offshore windmills in the north sea christian wulff , conservative state premier of lower saxony , said germany 's precarious economic recovery could not handle an increase in already-high power costs .
we need an appropriate energy mix that is not based on ideology but on technology , environmental friendliness and price , " he said in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper . environment minister gabriel of the spd disagreed and told the welt am sonntag paper that there was no need for nuclear energy and that even coal , used to produce half of germany 's electricity , was undergoing a " renaissance . "
he also said that " by 2020 it will be possible to cover 20 to 25 percent of our energy demand with renewable sources . " the center-left spd and conservative cdu / csu - as " grand coalition " partners in government - do agree that germany must boost investment in environmentally friendly alternative sources of energy . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g8 split on nuclear power in energy talks g8 countries were divided thursday on ways to ensure long-term world energy security , as the eu admitted its members had diverging views on ambitious plans for developing nuclear power being pushed by russia and the us .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 03.04.2006 resignation aimed to protect deutsche bank großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysts are pleased with a five-year high and are n't shocked by breuer 's resignation a result of comments in 2002 questioning the credit worthiness of leo kirch 's media company , former deutsche bank supervisory board chairman rolf breuer resigned in a move some saw as exaggerated and others overdue . deutsche bank and breuer are still fighting claims that breuer 's comments damaged kirch holding by questioning the firm 's creditworthiness in 2002 .
breuer was chief executive officer of germany 's largest bank at the time . in january , germany 's highest court ruled breuer 's comments breached the bank 's contractual duty of not having a negative effect on a customer 's ability to receive credit from other sources .
one of kirch 's media units had loans of over 700 million euros -lrb- $ 848 million -rrb- . " it 's a shame that kirch is the reason for his departure , " wolfgang gerke , a professor of banking at the university of nuremberg-erlangen , told bloomburg .
" the remark he made was n't new .
everyone knew it .
it was on the edge of what one can say . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ceo for five years , breuer moved up the deutsche bank ladder from an apprenticeship in 1956 decision to protect deutsche bank the 69-year-old 's resignation may be a sign that the court case against him and the bank is reaching a head , as he admitted he stepped down " to relieve deutsche bank of further discussion regarding him personally , " according to a deutsche bank statement released sunday . kirch lawyer peter gauweiler , who along with other kirch representatives , has long called for breuer to step down , welcomed the announcement , telling the associated press he thought the move " was overdue . "
kirch 's lawyers said they anticipate receiving up to 1.5 billion euros in compensation should they win the case . dax reaches five-year high finance markets also greeted the change positively .
investment bank merrill lynch upgraded deutsche bank stocks to " buy " after sunday 's announcement that chief financial officer clemens börsig would take over breuer 's position .
anthony di iorio will then become cfo and hugo bänziger will join the board as chief risk officer , the bank announced . " investors are relying on deutsche bank being kept out of negative headlines after breuer 's resignation , " a trader told reuters . concerns from westlb analyst georg kanders that the resignation could add fuel to the kirch fire and scare away investors initially appeared unfounded .
the german dax index broke the 6,000-point mark for the first time in five years and deutsche bank stocks were up 0.8 percent to 94.98 when trading opened monday . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche bank supervisory board chief steps down germany 's largest bank said the chief of its supervisory board would relinquish his position in may .

breuer was chief executive officer of germany 's largest bank at the time . in january , germany 's highest court ruled breuer 's comments breached the bank 's contractual duty of not having a negative effect on a customer 's ability to receive credit from other sources .
one of kirch 's media units had loans of over 700 million euros -lrb- $ 848 million -rrb- . " it 's a shame that kirch is the reason for his departure , " wolfgang gerke , a professor of banking at the university of nuremberg-erlangen , told bloomburg .
" the remark he made was n't new .
everyone knew it .
it was on the edge of what one can say . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ceo for five years , breuer moved up the deutsche bank ladder from an apprenticeship in 1956 decision to protect deutsche bank the 69-year-old 's resignation may be a sign that the court case against him and the bank is reaching a head , as he admitted he stepped down " to relieve deutsche bank of further discussion regarding him personally , " according to a deutsche bank statement released sunday . kirch lawyer peter gauweiler , who along with other kirch representatives , has long called for breuer to step down , welcomed the announcement , telling the associated press he thought the move " was overdue . "
kirch 's lawyers said they anticipate receiving up to 1.5 billion euros in compensation should they win the case . dax reaches five-year high finance markets also greeted the change positively .
investment bank merrill lynch upgraded deutsche bank stocks to " buy " after sunday 's announcement that chief financial officer clemens börsig would take over breuer 's position .
anthony di iorio will then become cfo and hugo bänziger will join the board as chief risk officer , the bank announced . " investors are relying on deutsche bank being kept out of negative headlines after breuer 's resignation , " a trader told reuters . concerns from westlb analyst georg kanders that the resignation could add fuel to the kirch fire and scare away investors initially appeared unfounded .
the german dax index broke the 6,000-point mark for the first time in five years and deutsche bank stocks were up 0.8 percent to 94.98 when trading opened monday . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche bank supervisory board chief steps down germany 's largest bank said the chief of its supervisory board would relinquish his position in may .

" it is now up to iran to make a choice ... between isolation brought about by its own actions or a return to the negotiating table , " added steinmeier , the meeting 's host . not full unity over iran cracks appeared between the major powers in berlin over how to act if iran does not comply . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president remains defiant the un statement leaves open what consequences might follow if tehran does not halt uranium enrichment , and russia and china insisted that economic sanctions or military action did not belong on the table . the non-binding un security council declaration was seen as a bid to placate russia and china , which have opposed any hint of punitive measures against iran , an ally and key trading partner .

nuclear power will likely heat up the debate . amid concern about europe 's dependence on russian and middle eastern oil and gas , sharp disagreements over the role of nuclear power still rage in germany .
chancellor merkel , economy minister michael glos and environment minister sigmar gabriel are scheduled to meet with top managers from german utilities and other major firms in the chancellor 's office in berlin on monday evening .
it will be the first of a series of summits and working group meetings aimed at developing strategies for the next 15 years . " we must understand that we have a task that reaches far beyond this parliamentary term , so all subjects will be on the table and different opinions will certainly be exchanged on some points , " merkel told reporters on monday before the meeting .
representatives of labor unions and consumer groups , as well as klaus töpfer , the head of the united nations environment program , have also been invited to the talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel nuclear power will be a hot topic " nuclear power will also be on the agenda , " said jürgen rüttgers of the christian democratic party -lrb- to which merkel belongs -rrb- and premier of north rhine-westfalia .
" the social democratic party and green party ca n't ignore the question of where 30 percent of our energy in germany is to come from in the future , " said rüttgers , referring to the amount nuclear plants have supplied until now . the country 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have been divided over nuclear power .
recent threats by russian gas giant gazprom to cut off gas supplies to ukraine if it did not pay higher prices prompted conservatives near merkel to demand that germany slash a planned phase-out of nuclear energy in germany . the gradual shutdown of all germany 's nuclear power plants was agreed upon in 2000 by the government of former spd chancellor gerhard schröder and his then-coalition partners , the greens . despite germany 's increasing dependence on russian gas - gazprom and two german firms are building a gas pipeline from siberia to germany - the spd are firm on the phase-out and forced the conservatives to back their line in a coalition agreement after last year 's elections . but pro-nuclear conservatives have not given up .
a paper for the summit authored by christian union parliamentarians said that nuclear energy " remains a competitive and co2-free form of energy that is absolutely essential for the foreseeable future . " alternative energies are a long-term goal germany has 17 nuclear power plants , with nuclear reactors providing 30 percent of the electricity the country 's 82 million people require .
some states , however , use a much higher percentage of atomic energy and strongly oppose the phase-out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of germany 's 110-meter-high offshore windmills in the north sea christian wulff , conservative state premier of lower saxony , said germany 's precarious economic recovery could not handle an increase in already-high power costs .
we need an appropriate energy mix that is not based on ideology but on technology , environmental friendliness and price , " he said in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper . environment minister gabriel of the spd disagreed and told the welt am sonntag paper that there was no need for nuclear energy and that even coal , used to produce half of germany 's electricity , was undergoing a " renaissance . "
he also said that " by 2020 it will be possible to cover 20 to 25 percent of our energy demand with renewable sources . " the center-left spd and conservative cdu / csu - as " grand coalition " partners in government - do agree that germany must boost investment in environmentally friendly alternative sources of energy . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g8 split on nuclear power in energy talks g8 countries were divided thursday on ways to ensure long-term world energy security , as the eu admitted its members had diverging views on ambitious plans for developing nuclear power being pushed by russia and the us .

her trademark style ?
" strong and fearless . " angela merkel 's sartorial transformation is nothing short of breathtaking .
once ridiculed by society mavens for her dowdy dress sense , merkel has now managed to silence even those critics with her latest turn as a fashion muse for german designer , wolfgang joop . joop was apparently so taken with merkel 's image change that he has dedicated a clothing line from his new fall / winter collection to her . " the open , clear and steely strength in angela merkel 's eyes inspired me , " joop told the german tabloid bild . strength is in he added that her " strong and fearless " style was representative of a change in the fashion zeitgeist . " the days of tra la la and garden parties are over , " the designer declared .
" the new practicality is in . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's style is " strong and fearless , " says joop .
but will women want to buy it ?
a sketch for the new " merkel collection " shows the chancellor in a business-like pose , wearing a dark tailored suit with cropped pants .
according to joop , it 's a style that will appeal to the " worldly woman . " " it 's not a style that everyone will like , " he told bild .
" but if you try to please everyone , you end up pleasing no one . " there 's been no word yet on whether chancellor merkel herself is pleased with her new role as a fashion icon .
nor , for that matter , on whether she is even a fan of joop 's clothing . she did once pay a visit to his atelier , the designer said , but not to buy haute couture .
rather , merkel was all business , trying to win joop as an " ambassador " for germany . little did she know that this very dedication to the task at hand would be the inspiration that would propel her personal style onto fashion runways the world over . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stylists battle to claim merkel makeover in an astonishing transformation , cdu leader angela merkel went from dowdy schoolmarm to polished powerfrau in a matter of months .

" when you play against ten men for so long you expect to win , " hamburg manager thomas doll said .
" that was a giant step towards the champions league . " schalke were left to rue the sending off of their young brazilian defender rafinha after he lashed out at rafael van der vaart on 28 minutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sergej barbarez and the rest of the hamburg team were a step above schalke " rafa should not do that , but you should not go down like a bag of potatoes either , " schalke team manager andreas müller said . dutch international van der vaart picked himself up to open the coring in the 57th minute with a brilliant free-kick . brazilian striker ailton , on loan at hamburg from turkish side besiktas , then came back to haunt schalke who sold him in the summer . substituted into the match , ailton struck in the 80th minute after using his pace to power away from the schalke defense . kahn the april fool in cologne hamburg , who last appeared in the champions league back in 2001 , are now seven points behind munich after the bavarian giants drew 2-2 with fc cologne . it was april fool 's day and the joke was on german international goalkeeper oliver kahn who produced a major howler to allow cologne a share of the spoils . the 36-year-old kahn shrugged off a hip injury to face cologne but may wish he had n't bothered after allowing albert streit 's speculative shot to squirm under his body to restore cologne 's lead at 2-1 , surprising the cologne scorer as much as everyone watching . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a goal from roy makaay , right , got bayern one point in cologne kahn , who was replaced at half-time by michael rensing , will hope germany manager jürgen klinsmann missed his gaffe as he bids to prove he is germany 's number one ahead of this summer 's world cup finals . " i was helpless for the first goal , but i was at fault for the second goal and have to hold my hands up , " kahn said , before making a rare admission of guilt .
" but as a goalkeeper you know there will be errors like that from time to time . " arsenal goalkeeper jens lehmann , kahn 's rival for the number one jersey at the world cup , will no doubt watch the replays with a pleased grin . crowd unhappy over ballack departure fortunately , kahn has field players capable of getting him out of trouble - dutch international roy makaay equalized shortly before half-time . bayern have seen their lead cut to seven points but , barring an almighty collapse in their final six games , felix magath 's team will be collecting their 20th domestic title in may . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 2-2 draw and the crowd 's whistles made it a hard day for ballack german international captain michael ballack has been a driving force behind the title bid but the player , who looks set to join english champions chelsea on a free transfer in the summer , was jeered by the home bayern fans after a poor display . " it is always a problem when you have a player who is likely to be playing somewhere else in the near future , " bayern coach magath said .
" but it is not michael ballack 's fault that the game finished 2-2 . " klose continues scoring while kahn and ballack had an afternoon to forget their international teammate miroslav klose continued to do no wrong . bremen striker klose scored a 70th minute penalty to help bremen to a vital 1-0 win over eintracht frankfurt on saturday . it was klose 's 20th goal of a prolific season and helped bremen consolidate third position , three points behind hamburg but four points clear of schalke .

" this is a strong sign to iran that negotiation , not confrontation , should be their course , " rice said . " it is now up to iran to make a choice ... between isolation brought about by its own actions or a return to the negotiating table , " added steinmeier , the meeting 's host . not full unity over iran cracks appeared between the major powers in berlin over how to act if iran does not comply . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president remains defiant the un statement leaves open what consequences might follow if tehran does not halt uranium enrichment , and russia and china insisted that economic sanctions or military action did not belong on the table . the non-binding un security council declaration was seen as a bid to placate russia and china , which have opposed any hint of punitive measures against iran , an ally and key trading partner .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.04.2006 german president promotes african successes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler has made africa his political focus on his second trip to africa , horst köhler will focus on the continent 's success stories .
during visits to mozambique , madagascar and botswana , the german leader will promote better understanding of african issues . success stories are rare in africa , a continent plagued by conflict and catastrophe .
even rarer are news reports focusing on the region 's positive aspects .
germany 's president hopes to change that .
his visit to the continent , starting on monday , takes placae under an optimistic motto .
rather than dwelling on africa 's problems , horst köhler wants to draw attention to what works . with stops in mozambique , madagascar and botswana , the president has selected three countries which have managed to free themselves from the yoke of poverty , disease and lack of education .
for köhler , africa is more than a continent in crisis .
he is convinced that europe 's neighbor has more to offer than the negative headlines so often associated with it .
and in his eyes , it is time the international community took more notice . africa must find its own way köhler has observed first hand the difficult political and economic reforms africa has undertaken in the past decades .
during his years as head of the international monetary fund , he traveled the continent six times .
but he has refrained from promoting an ultimate solution for the region 's problems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler visited benin in december 2004 as with his trip last year , which took him to sierra leone , benin and ethiopia , köhler has rejected a cure-all prescription for africa .
" no matter what we do , when we come as outsiders with our aid and our money , we must resist the temptation to press upon the africans our notions of life , " he said after returning from his previous trip . " of course africa has its own tragic history with slavery , colonialism and the east-west conflict ; but it has above all else its own culture , " köhler said .
" we should refrain from exporting our ideals one-to-one to africa , " he said . african role models in december 2004 , köhler launched his first major trip abroad with a visit to sierra leone .
once mired down in a brutal civil war , the country managed to pull itself out of conflict with the aid of a large un mission .
it was this turn in fortune the president focused on , and not the country 's continuing problems . the countries köhler is visiting this time have all found their own way , their own solution for dealing with poverty and the problems of political and economic instability .
botswana , the last country on the president 's itinerary , is clearly a role model in this regard .
the so-called " switzerland of africa " is no longer dependent on development aid .
instead , the country has become exemplary of sustainable and reform-oriented politics in africa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fully automized diamond sorting machine in the jwaneng mine in botswana botswana has the highest gross domestic product in africa .
it owes this relative prosperity to its large diamond deposits : one-third of the world 's diamonds originate here .
the country the size of france and with a population of 1.7 million invests its profits responsibly in infrastructure projects , social welfare , schools , and above all in the battle against aids . perhaps more so than in any other african country , the leaders of botswana have realized that if they do not focus their efforts on stopping the spread of aids , all their successes in social , economic and political development will be endangered .
with four out of 10 adults testing hiv positive , botswana has countered the catastrophic situation with a resolute policy : 12 percent of its national budget flows into the health system , one-third into education . madagascar 's liberal course while botswana has proven itself over the decade as a successful reform state , mozambique and madagascar have only recently begun to turn themselves around .
for both , germany remains an important donor nation . in the current and previous year , germany made available some 16.5 million euros -lrb- $ 20 million -rrb- for development programs in madagascar , with the prime benefactors being environmental projects and the protection and sustainable use of natural resources .
after the country 's civil war in 2001 , the economy began to improve . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : madagascar 's capital , antananarivo the fight against poverty is a major goal of the current leadership .
last year , economic growth hovered around 5 percent .
more than two-thirds of all people in madagascar live on less than $ 1 a day , and the public health system is not accessible to a majority of the poor . president marc ravalomanana has set out a liberal economic course for the island nation , with attention focused on infrastructure , education and privatization .
köhler , whose contact with the madagascar leader dates back to his days at the imf , supports ravalomanana . mozambique but it is mozambique that will initially set the accent for köhler 's trip .
it will also be the first time a german president has visited the country .
although mozambique is still dependent on two dozen donor countries , it is also one of the fastest growing economies in africa .
its adjusted growth rate for 2006 is expected to be over 7 percent .
some 70 million euros from external aid flow into education , rural development and economic reform . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mozambique 's capital , maputo it is here that mozambique faces its biggest challenges .
it must push forward with the diversification of its economy .
with the exception of a few large projects financed primarily by south african investors , the economy is dominated by farming , handcrafts and fishing .
for this reason , the country will be watching the large delegation of corporate representatives traveling with köhler in the hopes of winning more german investment projects . africa 's fate peaceful and democratic - all three countries can lay claim to these attributes , and they are all good examples of köhler 's vision for africa .
during his trip through the continent , the german leader will be pressing his message that the world needs to take africa seriously . he is convinced that the security , peace and welfare of europe can only be guaranteed as long as africa receives its own fair chance .
as he said during his inauguration speech : " for me our degree of humanity hangs on the fate of africa .
is it not a question of europe 's self respect to involve itself - in view of its own basic fundamentals , values and history - honestly and wholeheartedly with africa ?

" but as a goalkeeper you know there will be errors like that from time to time .

" it is always a problem when you have a player who is likely to be playing somewhere else in the near future , " bayern coach magath said .
" but it is not michael ballack 's fault that the game finished 2-2 . " klose continues scoring while kahn and ballack had an afternoon to forget their international teammate miroslav klose continued to do no wrong . bremen striker klose scored a 70th minute penalty to help bremen to a vital 1-0 win over eintracht frankfurt on saturday . it was klose 's 20th goal of a prolific season and helped bremen consolidate third position , three points behind hamburg but four points clear of schalke .

" there 's something fishy about the whole matter , " she told the bild daily .
schröder 's government approved the gazprom credit just weeks before schröder stepped down from government after elections in september . the green party , with whom schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- formed a coalition in government , has also not ruled out a parliamentary inquiry .
" you just ca n't do something like that , " said green party economics expert matthias berninger .
berninger said he was interested in discovering who else knew about the billion-euro loan guarantee . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loans must be approved before gas can flow bodo ramelow , deputy head of the left party parliamentary group , said his party is reviewing legal action that could be taken against members of schröder 's spd-green government should more damaging details emerge .
" we could be talking about the misappropriation of tax money here , " ramelow said . even schröder 's own party has criticized the former chancellor 's actions .
" you just ca n't ignore it when someone has messed things up , " garrelt duin of the spd told die welt newspaper . russian newspaper nezavisimaya gazeta wrote on monday that " gerhard schröder 's business relationship with gazprom is looking more and more unsavory ...
the image of the most important joint energy project for europe is suffering as a result . " on friday , schröder officially took up the post as head of the supervisory board of a consortium that plans to build the natural pipeline under the baltic sea from russia to germany .
gazprom holds 51 percent of the consortium 's shares . schröder has since defended his decision to head the board following criticism of alleged imprudent behavior . schröder said he was only offered the supervisory board post , for which he will earn an annual salary of 250,000 euros , after he left office in november .
" i can not see anything wrong with that , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a still-optimistic schröder he also told the handelsblatt business daily he had been unaware his -lrb- former -rrb- administration had guaranteed the credit gazprom 's pipeline .
he added that gazprom had no plans to take the loan .
" i did not know about these proceedings , " he said . " but the key point is that gazprom has already said that it has not and will not accept the financing option put forward by the banks .
thus , there will not be a federal loan guarantee for the two german banks , " he added . the economy ministry confirmed saturday that an inter-ministerial commission rushed through a " decision in principle " on oct .
24 last year while waiting for a new coalition to be formed by now chancellor angela merkel . schröder also told handelsblatt that : " federal loan guarantees are a tried and tested instrument to defend the economic interests of our country , " he said .
" that especially includes a reliable supply of natural resources for german industry . " schröder seems to have gained the upper hand in another battle as well .
he has repeatedly sued guido westerwelle , head of the free democrat -lrb- fdp -rrb- party , for verbal attacks about the gazprom affair .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.04.2006 nuclear power tiff to dominate merkel 's energy summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear power plants provide about a third of germany 's electricity german chancellor angela merkel will meet with ministers and industry chiefs on monday to plot strategies for long-term energy security .
nuclear power will likely heat up the debate . amid concern about europe 's dependence on russian and middle eastern oil and gas , sharp disagreements over the role of nuclear power still rage in germany .
chancellor merkel , economy minister michael glos and environment minister sigmar gabriel are scheduled to meet with top managers from german utilities and other major firms in the chancellor 's office in berlin on monday evening .
it will be the first of a series of summits and working group meetings aimed at developing strategies for the next 15 years . " we must understand that we have a task that reaches far beyond this parliamentary term , so all subjects will be on the table and different opinions will certainly be exchanged on some points , " merkel told reporters on monday before the meeting .
representatives of labor unions and consumer groups , as well as klaus töpfer , the head of the united nations environment program , have also been invited to the talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel nuclear power will be a hot topic " nuclear power will also be on the agenda , " said jürgen rüttgers of the christian democratic party -lrb- to which merkel belongs -rrb- and premier of north rhine-westfalia .
" the social democratic party and green party ca n't ignore the question of where 30 percent of our energy in germany is to come from in the future , " said rüttgers , referring to the amount nuclear plants have supplied until now . the country 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have been divided over nuclear power .
recent threats by russian gas giant gazprom to cut off gas supplies to ukraine if it did not pay higher prices prompted conservatives near merkel to demand that germany slash a planned phase-out of nuclear energy in germany . the gradual shutdown of all germany 's nuclear power plants was agreed upon in 2000 by the government of former spd chancellor gerhard schröder and his then-coalition partners , the greens . despite germany 's increasing dependence on russian gas - gazprom and two german firms are building a gas pipeline from siberia to germany - the spd are firm on the phase-out and forced the conservatives to back their line in a coalition agreement after last year 's elections . but pro-nuclear conservatives have not given up .
a paper for the summit authored by christian union parliamentarians said that nuclear energy " remains a competitive and co2-free form of energy that is absolutely essential for the foreseeable future . " alternative energies are a long-term goal germany has 17 nuclear power plants , with nuclear reactors providing 30 percent of the electricity the country 's 82 million people require .
some states , however , use a much higher percentage of atomic energy and strongly oppose the phase-out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of germany 's 110-meter-high offshore windmills in the north sea christian wulff , conservative state premier of lower saxony , said germany 's precarious economic recovery could not handle an increase in already-high power costs .
we need an appropriate energy mix that is not based on ideology but on technology , environmental friendliness and price , " he said in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper . environment minister gabriel of the spd disagreed and told the welt am sonntag paper that there was no need for nuclear energy and that even coal , used to produce half of germany 's electricity , was undergoing a " renaissance . "
he also said that " by 2020 it will be possible to cover 20 to 25 percent of our energy demand with renewable sources . " the center-left spd and conservative cdu / csu - as " grand coalition " partners in government - do agree that germany must boost investment in environmentally friendly alternative sources of energy . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g8 split on nuclear power in energy talks g8 countries were divided thursday on ways to ensure long-term world energy security , as the eu admitted its members had diverging views on ambitious plans for developing nuclear power being pushed by russia and the us .

nuclear power will likely heat up the debate . amid concern about europe 's dependence on russian and middle eastern oil and gas , sharp disagreements over the role of nuclear power still rage in germany .
chancellor merkel , economy minister michael glos and environment minister sigmar gabriel are scheduled to meet with top managers from german utilities and other major firms in the chancellor 's office in berlin on monday evening .
it will be the first of a series of summits and working group meetings aimed at developing strategies for the next 15 years . " we must understand that we have a task that reaches far beyond this parliamentary term , so all subjects will be on the table and different opinions will certainly be exchanged on some points , " merkel told reporters on monday before the meeting .
representatives of labor unions and consumer groups , as well as klaus töpfer , the head of the united nations environment program , have also been invited to the talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel nuclear power will be a hot topic " nuclear power will also be on the agenda , " said jürgen rüttgers of the christian democratic party -lrb- to which merkel belongs -rrb- and premier of north rhine-westfalia .
" the social democratic party and green party ca n't ignore the question of where 30 percent of our energy in germany is to come from in the future , " said rüttgers , referring to the amount nuclear plants have supplied until now . the country 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have been divided over nuclear power .
recent threats by russian gas giant gazprom to cut off gas supplies to ukraine if it did not pay higher prices prompted conservatives near merkel to demand that germany slash a planned phase-out of nuclear energy in germany . the gradual shutdown of all germany 's nuclear power plants was agreed upon in 2000 by the government of former spd chancellor gerhard schröder and his then-coalition partners , the greens . despite germany 's increasing dependence on russian gas - gazprom and two german firms are building a gas pipeline from siberia to germany - the spd are firm on the phase-out and forced the conservatives to back their line in a coalition agreement after last year 's elections . but pro-nuclear conservatives have not given up .
a paper for the summit authored by christian union parliamentarians said that nuclear energy " remains a competitive and co2-free form of energy that is absolutely essential for the foreseeable future . " alternative energies are a long-term goal germany has 17 nuclear power plants , with nuclear reactors providing 30 percent of the electricity the country 's 82 million people require .
some states , however , use a much higher percentage of atomic energy and strongly oppose the phase-out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of germany 's 110-meter-high offshore windmills in the north sea christian wulff , conservative state premier of lower saxony , said germany 's precarious economic recovery could not handle an increase in already-high power costs .
we need an appropriate energy mix that is not based on ideology but on technology , environmental friendliness and price , " he said in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper . environment minister gabriel of the spd disagreed and told the welt am sonntag paper that there was no need for nuclear energy and that even coal , used to produce half of germany 's electricity , was undergoing a " renaissance . "
he also said that " by 2020 it will be possible to cover 20 to 25 percent of our energy demand with renewable sources . " the center-left spd and conservative cdu / csu - as " grand coalition " partners in government - do agree that germany must boost investment in environmentally friendly alternative sources of energy . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g8 split on nuclear power in energy talks g8 countries were divided thursday on ways to ensure long-term world energy security , as the eu admitted its members had diverging views on ambitious plans for developing nuclear power being pushed by russia and the us .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.04.2006 gerhard schröder takes a blow over gazprom großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and putin signed the pipeline deal in september germany 's opposition fdp party has threatened to demand a parliamentary inquiry into the so-called " pipeline affair " involving the former government of gerhard schröder and russian gas group gazprom . following a report in the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper over the weekend about the approval of a billion euro -lrb- $ 1.2 billion -rrb- credit for gazprom 's baltic pipeline by former chancellor schröder 's government , fdp opposition party energy expert gudrun kopp said she would fight for a parliamentary investigation .
" there 's something fishy about the whole matter , " she told the bild daily .
schröder 's government approved the gazprom credit just weeks before schröder stepped down from government after elections in september . the green party , with whom schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- formed a coalition in government , has also not ruled out a parliamentary inquiry .
" you just ca n't do something like that , " said green party economics expert matthias berninger .
berninger said he was interested in discovering who else knew about the billion-euro loan guarantee . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loans must be approved before gas can flow bodo ramelow , deputy head of the left party parliamentary group , said his party is reviewing legal action that could be taken against members of schröder 's spd-green government should more damaging details emerge .
" we could be talking about the misappropriation of tax money here , " ramelow said . even schröder 's own party has criticized the former chancellor 's actions .
" you just ca n't ignore it when someone has messed things up , " garrelt duin of the spd told die welt newspaper . russian newspaper nezavisimaya gazeta wrote on monday that " gerhard schröder 's business relationship with gazprom is looking more and more unsavory ...
the image of the most important joint energy project for europe is suffering as a result . " on friday , schröder officially took up the post as head of the supervisory board of a consortium that plans to build the natural pipeline under the baltic sea from russia to germany .
gazprom holds 51 percent of the consortium 's shares . schröder has since defended his decision to head the board following criticism of alleged imprudent behavior . schröder said he was only offered the supervisory board post , for which he will earn an annual salary of 250,000 euros , after he left office in november .
" i can not see anything wrong with that , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a still-optimistic schröder he also told the handelsblatt business daily he had been unaware his -lrb- former -rrb- administration had guaranteed the credit gazprom 's pipeline .
he added that gazprom had no plans to take the loan .
" i did not know about these proceedings , " he said . " but the key point is that gazprom has already said that it has not and will not accept the financing option put forward by the banks .
thus , there will not be a federal loan guarantee for the two german banks , " he added . the economy ministry confirmed saturday that an inter-ministerial commission rushed through a " decision in principle " on oct .
24 last year while waiting for a new coalition to be formed by now chancellor angela merkel . schröder also told handelsblatt that : " federal loan guarantees are a tried and tested instrument to defend the economic interests of our country , " he said .
" that especially includes a reliable supply of natural resources for german industry . " schröder seems to have gained the upper hand in another battle as well .
he has repeatedly sued guido westerwelle , head of the free democrat -lrb- fdp -rrb- party , for verbal attacks about the gazprom affair .
on monday , following an appeal by schröder last week , the hamburg district court barred westerwelle from making further comments about schröder 's supervisory board position . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : schröder government approved gazprom credit the former german government of gerhard schröder guaranteed a credit of one billion euros -lrb- $ 1.2 billion -rrb- for the russian gas group gazprom 's baltic pipeline project , a german daily reported in its saturday edition .

nuclear power will likely heat up the debate . amid concern about europe 's dependence on russian and middle eastern oil and gas , sharp disagreements over the role of nuclear power still rage in germany .
chancellor merkel , economy minister michael glos and environment minister sigmar gabriel are scheduled to meet with top managers from german utilities and other major firms in the chancellor 's office in berlin on monday evening .
it will be the first of a series of summits and working group meetings aimed at developing strategies for the next 15 years . " we must understand that we have a task that reaches far beyond this parliamentary term , so all subjects will be on the table and different opinions will certainly be exchanged on some points , " merkel told reporters on monday before the meeting .
representatives of labor unions and consumer groups , as well as klaus töpfer , the head of the united nations environment program , have also been invited to the talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel nuclear power will be a hot topic " nuclear power will also be on the agenda , " said jürgen rüttgers of the christian democratic party -lrb- to which merkel belongs -rrb- and premier of north rhine-westfalia .
" the social democratic party and green party ca n't ignore the question of where 30 percent of our energy in germany is to come from in the future , " said rüttgers , referring to the amount nuclear plants have supplied until now . the country 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have been divided over nuclear power .
recent threats by russian gas giant gazprom to cut off gas supplies to ukraine if it did not pay higher prices prompted conservatives near merkel to demand that germany slash a planned phase-out of nuclear energy in germany . the gradual shutdown of all germany 's nuclear power plants was agreed upon in 2000 by the government of former spd chancellor gerhard schröder and his then-coalition partners , the greens . despite germany 's increasing dependence on russian gas - gazprom and two german firms are building a gas pipeline from siberia to germany - the spd are firm on the phase-out and forced the conservatives to back their line in a coalition agreement after last year 's elections . but pro-nuclear conservatives have not given up .
a paper for the summit authored by christian union parliamentarians said that nuclear energy " remains a competitive and co2-free form of energy that is absolutely essential for the foreseeable future . " alternative energies are a long-term goal germany has 17 nuclear power plants , with nuclear reactors providing 30 percent of the electricity the country 's 82 million people require .
some states , however , use a much higher percentage of atomic energy and strongly oppose the phase-out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of germany 's 110-meter-high offshore windmills in the north sea christian wulff , conservative state premier of lower saxony , said germany 's precarious economic recovery could not handle an increase in already-high power costs .
we need an appropriate energy mix that is not based on ideology but on technology , environmental friendliness and price , " he said in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper . environment minister gabriel of the spd disagreed and told the welt am sonntag paper that there was no need for nuclear energy and that even coal , used to produce half of germany 's electricity , was undergoing a " renaissance . "
he also said that " by 2020 it will be possible to cover 20 to 25 percent of our energy demand with renewable sources . " the center-left spd and conservative cdu / csu - as " grand coalition " partners in government - do agree that germany must boost investment in environmentally friendly alternative sources of energy . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g8 split on nuclear power in energy talks g8 countries were divided thursday on ways to ensure long-term world energy security , as the eu admitted its members had diverging views on ambitious plans for developing nuclear power being pushed by russia and the us .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.04.2006 german president promotes african successes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler has made africa his political focus on his second trip to africa , horst köhler will focus on the continent 's success stories .
during visits to mozambique , madagascar and botswana , the german leader will promote better understanding of african issues . success stories are rare in africa , a continent plagued by conflict and catastrophe .
even rarer are news reports focusing on the region 's positive aspects .
germany 's president hopes to change that .
his visit to the continent , starting on monday , takes placae under an optimistic motto .
rather than dwelling on africa 's problems , horst köhler wants to draw attention to what works . with stops in mozambique , madagascar and botswana , the president has selected three countries which have managed to free themselves from the yoke of poverty , disease and lack of education .
for köhler , africa is more than a continent in crisis .
he is convinced that europe 's neighbor has more to offer than the negative headlines so often associated with it .
and in his eyes , it is time the international community took more notice . africa must find its own way köhler has observed first hand the difficult political and economic reforms africa has undertaken in the past decades .
during his years as head of the international monetary fund , he traveled the continent six times .
but he has refrained from promoting an ultimate solution for the region 's problems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler visited benin in december 2004 as with his trip last year , which took him to sierra leone , benin and ethiopia , köhler has rejected a cure-all prescription for africa .
" no matter what we do , when we come as outsiders with our aid and our money , we must resist the temptation to press upon the africans our notions of life , " he said after returning from his previous trip . " of course africa has its own tragic history with slavery , colonialism and the east-west conflict ; but it has above all else its own culture , " köhler said .
" we should refrain from exporting our ideals one-to-one to africa , " he said . african role models in december 2004 , köhler launched his first major trip abroad with a visit to sierra leone .
once mired down in a brutal civil war , the country managed to pull itself out of conflict with the aid of a large un mission .
it was this turn in fortune the president focused on , and not the country 's continuing problems . the countries köhler is visiting this time have all found their own way , their own solution for dealing with poverty and the problems of political and economic instability .
botswana , the last country on the president 's itinerary , is clearly a role model in this regard .
the so-called " switzerland of africa " is no longer dependent on development aid .
instead , the country has become exemplary of sustainable and reform-oriented politics in africa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fully automized diamond sorting machine in the jwaneng mine in botswana botswana has the highest gross domestic product in africa .
it owes this relative prosperity to its large diamond deposits : one-third of the world 's diamonds originate here .
the country the size of france and with a population of 1.7 million invests its profits responsibly in infrastructure projects , social welfare , schools , and above all in the battle against aids . perhaps more so than in any other african country , the leaders of botswana have realized that if they do not focus their efforts on stopping the spread of aids , all their successes in social , economic and political development will be endangered .
with four out of 10 adults testing hiv positive , botswana has countered the catastrophic situation with a resolute policy : 12 percent of its national budget flows into the health system , one-third into education . madagascar 's liberal course while botswana has proven itself over the decade as a successful reform state , mozambique and madagascar have only recently begun to turn themselves around .
for both , germany remains an important donor nation . in the current and previous year , germany made available some 16.5 million euros -lrb- $ 20 million -rrb- for development programs in madagascar , with the prime benefactors being environmental projects and the protection and sustainable use of natural resources .
after the country 's civil war in 2001 , the economy began to improve . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : madagascar 's capital , antananarivo the fight against poverty is a major goal of the current leadership .
last year , economic growth hovered around 5 percent .
more than two-thirds of all people in madagascar live on less than $ 1 a day , and the public health system is not accessible to a majority of the poor . president marc ravalomanana has set out a liberal economic course for the island nation , with attention focused on infrastructure , education and privatization .
köhler , whose contact with the madagascar leader dates back to his days at the imf , supports ravalomanana . mozambique but it is mozambique that will initially set the accent for köhler 's trip .
it will also be the first time a german president has visited the country .
although mozambique is still dependent on two dozen donor countries , it is also one of the fastest growing economies in africa .
its adjusted growth rate for 2006 is expected to be over 7 percent .
some 70 million euros from external aid flow into education , rural development and economic reform . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mozambique 's capital , maputo it is here that mozambique faces its biggest challenges .
it must push forward with the diversification of its economy .
with the exception of a few large projects financed primarily by south african investors , the economy is dominated by farming , handcrafts and fishing .
for this reason , the country will be watching the large delegation of corporate representatives traveling with köhler in the hopes of winning more german investment projects . africa 's fate peaceful and democratic - all three countries can lay claim to these attributes , and they are all good examples of köhler 's vision for africa .
during his trip through the continent , the german leader will be pressing his message that the world needs to take africa seriously . he is convinced that the security , peace and welfare of europe can only be guaranteed as long as africa receives its own fair chance .
as he said during his inauguration speech : " for me our degree of humanity hangs on the fate of africa .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.04.2006 german president promotes african successes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler has made africa his political focus on his second trip to africa , horst köhler will focus on the continent 's success stories .
during visits to mozambique , madagascar and botswana , the german leader will promote better understanding of african issues . success stories are rare in africa , a continent plagued by conflict and catastrophe .
even rarer are news reports focusing on the region 's positive aspects .
germany 's president hopes to change that .
his visit to the continent , starting on monday , takes placae under an optimistic motto .
rather than dwelling on africa 's problems , horst köhler wants to draw attention to what works . with stops in mozambique , madagascar and botswana , the president has selected three countries which have managed to free themselves from the yoke of poverty , disease and lack of education .
for köhler , africa is more than a continent in crisis .
he is convinced that europe 's neighbor has more to offer than the negative headlines so often associated with it .
and in his eyes , it is time the international community took more notice . africa must find its own way köhler has observed first hand the difficult political and economic reforms africa has undertaken in the past decades .
during his years as head of the international monetary fund , he traveled the continent six times .
but he has refrained from promoting an ultimate solution for the region 's problems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler visited benin in december 2004 as with his trip last year , which took him to sierra leone , benin and ethiopia , köhler has rejected a cure-all prescription for africa .
" no matter what we do , when we come as outsiders with our aid and our money , we must resist the temptation to press upon the africans our notions of life , " he said after returning from his previous trip . " of course africa has its own tragic history with slavery , colonialism and the east-west conflict ; but it has above all else its own culture , " köhler said .
" we should refrain from exporting our ideals one-to-one to africa , " he said . african role models in december 2004 , köhler launched his first major trip abroad with a visit to sierra leone .
once mired down in a brutal civil war , the country managed to pull itself out of conflict with the aid of a large un mission .
it was this turn in fortune the president focused on , and not the country 's continuing problems . the countries köhler is visiting this time have all found their own way , their own solution for dealing with poverty and the problems of political and economic instability .
botswana , the last country on the president 's itinerary , is clearly a role model in this regard .
the so-called " switzerland of africa " is no longer dependent on development aid .
instead , the country has become exemplary of sustainable and reform-oriented politics in africa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fully automized diamond sorting machine in the jwaneng mine in botswana botswana has the highest gross domestic product in africa .
it owes this relative prosperity to its large diamond deposits : one-third of the world 's diamonds originate here .
the country the size of france and with a population of 1.7 million invests its profits responsibly in infrastructure projects , social welfare , schools , and above all in the battle against aids . perhaps more so than in any other african country , the leaders of botswana have realized that if they do not focus their efforts on stopping the spread of aids , all their successes in social , economic and political development will be endangered .
with four out of 10 adults testing hiv positive , botswana has countered the catastrophic situation with a resolute policy : 12 percent of its national budget flows into the health system , one-third into education . madagascar 's liberal course while botswana has proven itself over the decade as a successful reform state , mozambique and madagascar have only recently begun to turn themselves around .
for both , germany remains an important donor nation . in the current and previous year , germany made available some 16.5 million euros -lrb- $ 20 million -rrb- for development programs in madagascar , with the prime benefactors being environmental projects and the protection and sustainable use of natural resources .
after the country 's civil war in 2001 , the economy began to improve . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : madagascar 's capital , antananarivo the fight against poverty is a major goal of the current leadership .
last year , economic growth hovered around 5 percent .
more than two-thirds of all people in madagascar live on less than $ 1 a day , and the public health system is not accessible to a majority of the poor . president marc ravalomanana has set out a liberal economic course for the island nation , with attention focused on infrastructure , education and privatization .
köhler , whose contact with the madagascar leader dates back to his days at the imf , supports ravalomanana . mozambique but it is mozambique that will initially set the accent for köhler 's trip .
it will also be the first time a german president has visited the country .
although mozambique is still dependent on two dozen donor countries , it is also one of the fastest growing economies in africa .
its adjusted growth rate for 2006 is expected to be over 7 percent .
some 70 million euros from external aid flow into education , rural development and economic reform . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mozambique 's capital , maputo it is here that mozambique faces its biggest challenges .
it must push forward with the diversification of its economy .
with the exception of a few large projects financed primarily by south african investors , the economy is dominated by farming , handcrafts and fishing .
for this reason , the country will be watching the large delegation of corporate representatives traveling with köhler in the hopes of winning more german investment projects . africa 's fate peaceful and democratic - all three countries can lay claim to these attributes , and they are all good examples of köhler 's vision for africa .
during his trip through the continent , the german leader will be pressing his message that the world needs to take africa seriously . he is convinced that the security , peace and welfare of europe can only be guaranteed as long as africa receives its own fair chance .
as he said during his inauguration speech : " for me our degree of humanity hangs on the fate of africa .

" when you play against ten men for so long you expect to win , " hamburg manager thomas doll said .
" that was a giant step towards the champions league . " schalke were left to rue the sending off of their young brazilian defender rafinha after he lashed out at rafael van der vaart on 28 minutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sergej barbarez and the rest of the hamburg team were a step above schalke " rafa should not do that , but you should not go down like a bag of potatoes either , " schalke team manager andreas müller said . dutch international van der vaart picked himself up to open the coring in the 57th minute with a brilliant free-kick . brazilian striker ailton , on loan at hamburg from turkish side besiktas , then came back to haunt schalke who sold him in the summer . substituted into the match , ailton struck in the 80th minute after using his pace to power away from the schalke defense . kahn the april fool in cologne hamburg , who last appeared in the champions league back in 2001 , are now seven points behind munich after the bavarian giants drew 2-2 with fc cologne . it was april fool 's day and the joke was on german international goalkeeper oliver kahn who produced a major howler to allow cologne a share of the spoils . the 36-year-old kahn shrugged off a hip injury to face cologne but may wish he had n't bothered after allowing albert streit 's speculative shot to squirm under his body to restore cologne 's lead at 2-1 , surprising the cologne scorer as much as everyone watching . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a goal from roy makaay , right , got bayern one point in cologne kahn , who was replaced at half-time by michael rensing , will hope germany manager jürgen klinsmann missed his gaffe as he bids to prove he is germany 's number one ahead of this summer 's world cup finals . " i was helpless for the first goal , but i was at fault for the second goal and have to hold my hands up , " kahn said , before making a rare admission of guilt .
" but as a goalkeeper you know there will be errors like that from time to time . " arsenal goalkeeper jens lehmann , kahn 's rival for the number one jersey at the world cup , will no doubt watch the replays with a pleased grin . crowd unhappy over ballack departure fortunately , kahn has field players capable of getting him out of trouble - dutch international roy makaay equalized shortly before half-time . bayern have seen their lead cut to seven points but , barring an almighty collapse in their final six games , felix magath 's team will be collecting their 20th domestic title in may . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 2-2 draw and the crowd 's whistles made it a hard day for ballack german international captain michael ballack has been a driving force behind the title bid but the player , who looks set to join english champions chelsea on a free transfer in the summer , was jeered by the home bayern fans after a poor display . " it is always a problem when you have a player who is likely to be playing somewhere else in the near future , " bayern coach magath said .
" but it is not michael ballack 's fault that the game finished 2-2 . " klose continues scoring while kahn and ballack had an afternoon to forget their international teammate miroslav klose continued to do no wrong . bremen striker klose scored a 70th minute penalty to help bremen to a vital 1-0 win over eintracht frankfurt on saturday . it was klose 's 20th goal of a prolific season and helped bremen consolidate third position , three points behind hamburg but four points clear of schalke .

nuclear power will likely heat up the debate . amid concern about europe 's dependence on russian and middle eastern oil and gas , sharp disagreements over the role of nuclear power still rage in germany .
chancellor merkel , economy minister michael glos and environment minister sigmar gabriel are scheduled to meet with top managers from german utilities and other major firms in the chancellor 's office in berlin on monday evening .
it will be the first of a series of summits and working group meetings aimed at developing strategies for the next 15 years . " we must understand that we have a task that reaches far beyond this parliamentary term , so all subjects will be on the table and different opinions will certainly be exchanged on some points , " merkel told reporters on monday before the meeting .
representatives of labor unions and consumer groups , as well as klaus töpfer , the head of the united nations environment program , have also been invited to the talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel nuclear power will be a hot topic " nuclear power will also be on the agenda , " said jürgen rüttgers of the christian democratic party -lrb- to which merkel belongs -rrb- and premier of north rhine-westfalia .
" the social democratic party and green party ca n't ignore the question of where 30 percent of our energy in germany is to come from in the future , " said rüttgers , referring to the amount nuclear plants have supplied until now . the country 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have been divided over nuclear power .
recent threats by russian gas giant gazprom to cut off gas supplies to ukraine if it did not pay higher prices prompted conservatives near merkel to demand that germany slash a planned phase-out of nuclear energy in germany . the gradual shutdown of all germany 's nuclear power plants was agreed upon in 2000 by the government of former spd chancellor gerhard schröder and his then-coalition partners , the greens . despite germany 's increasing dependence on russian gas - gazprom and two german firms are building a gas pipeline from siberia to germany - the spd are firm on the phase-out and forced the conservatives to back their line in a coalition agreement after last year 's elections . but pro-nuclear conservatives have not given up .
a paper for the summit authored by christian union parliamentarians said that nuclear energy " remains a competitive and co2-free form of energy that is absolutely essential for the foreseeable future . " alternative energies are a long-term goal germany has 17 nuclear power plants , with nuclear reactors providing 30 percent of the electricity the country 's 82 million people require .
some states , however , use a much higher percentage of atomic energy and strongly oppose the phase-out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of germany 's 110-meter-high offshore windmills in the north sea christian wulff , conservative state premier of lower saxony , said germany 's precarious economic recovery could not handle an increase in already-high power costs .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.04.2006 german president promotes african successes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler has made africa his political focus on his second trip to africa , horst köhler will focus on the continent 's success stories .
during visits to mozambique , madagascar and botswana , the german leader will promote better understanding of african issues . success stories are rare in africa , a continent plagued by conflict and catastrophe .
even rarer are news reports focusing on the region 's positive aspects .
germany 's president hopes to change that .
his visit to the continent , starting on monday , takes placae under an optimistic motto .
rather than dwelling on africa 's problems , horst köhler wants to draw attention to what works . with stops in mozambique , madagascar and botswana , the president has selected three countries which have managed to free themselves from the yoke of poverty , disease and lack of education .
for köhler , africa is more than a continent in crisis .
he is convinced that europe 's neighbor has more to offer than the negative headlines so often associated with it .
and in his eyes , it is time the international community took more notice . africa must find its own way köhler has observed first hand the difficult political and economic reforms africa has undertaken in the past decades .
during his years as head of the international monetary fund , he traveled the continent six times .
but he has refrained from promoting an ultimate solution for the region 's problems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler visited benin in december 2004 as with his trip last year , which took him to sierra leone , benin and ethiopia , köhler has rejected a cure-all prescription for africa .
" no matter what we do , when we come as outsiders with our aid and our money , we must resist the temptation to press upon the africans our notions of life , " he said after returning from his previous trip . " of course africa has its own tragic history with slavery , colonialism and the east-west conflict ; but it has above all else its own culture , " köhler said .
" we should refrain from exporting our ideals one-to-one to africa , " he said . african role models in december 2004 , köhler launched his first major trip abroad with a visit to sierra leone .
once mired down in a brutal civil war , the country managed to pull itself out of conflict with the aid of a large un mission .
it was this turn in fortune the president focused on , and not the country 's continuing problems . the countries köhler is visiting this time have all found their own way , their own solution for dealing with poverty and the problems of political and economic instability .
botswana , the last country on the president 's itinerary , is clearly a role model in this regard .
the so-called " switzerland of africa " is no longer dependent on development aid .
instead , the country has become exemplary of sustainable and reform-oriented politics in africa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fully automized diamond sorting machine in the jwaneng mine in botswana botswana has the highest gross domestic product in africa .
it owes this relative prosperity to its large diamond deposits : one-third of the world 's diamonds originate here .
the country the size of france and with a population of 1.7 million invests its profits responsibly in infrastructure projects , social welfare , schools , and above all in the battle against aids . perhaps more so than in any other african country , the leaders of botswana have realized that if they do not focus their efforts on stopping the spread of aids , all their successes in social , economic and political development will be endangered .
with four out of 10 adults testing hiv positive , botswana has countered the catastrophic situation with a resolute policy : 12 percent of its national budget flows into the health system , one-third into education . madagascar 's liberal course while botswana has proven itself over the decade as a successful reform state , mozambique and madagascar have only recently begun to turn themselves around .
for both , germany remains an important donor nation . in the current and previous year , germany made available some 16.5 million euros -lrb- $ 20 million -rrb- for development programs in madagascar , with the prime benefactors being environmental projects and the protection and sustainable use of natural resources .
after the country 's civil war in 2001 , the economy began to improve . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : madagascar 's capital , antananarivo the fight against poverty is a major goal of the current leadership .
last year , economic growth hovered around 5 percent .
more than two-thirds of all people in madagascar live on less than $ 1 a day , and the public health system is not accessible to a majority of the poor . president marc ravalomanana has set out a liberal economic course for the island nation , with attention focused on infrastructure , education and privatization .
köhler , whose contact with the madagascar leader dates back to his days at the imf , supports ravalomanana . mozambique but it is mozambique that will initially set the accent for köhler 's trip .
it will also be the first time a german president has visited the country .
although mozambique is still dependent on two dozen donor countries , it is also one of the fastest growing economies in africa .
its adjusted growth rate for 2006 is expected to be over 7 percent .
some 70 million euros from external aid flow into education , rural development and economic reform . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mozambique 's capital , maputo it is here that mozambique faces its biggest challenges .
it must push forward with the diversification of its economy .
with the exception of a few large projects financed primarily by south african investors , the economy is dominated by farming , handcrafts and fishing .
for this reason , the country will be watching the large delegation of corporate representatives traveling with köhler in the hopes of winning more german investment projects . africa 's fate peaceful and democratic - all three countries can lay claim to these attributes , and they are all good examples of köhler 's vision for africa .
during his trip through the continent , the german leader will be pressing his message that the world needs to take africa seriously . he is convinced that the security , peace and welfare of europe can only be guaranteed as long as africa receives its own fair chance .
as he said during his inauguration speech : " for me our degree of humanity hangs on the fate of africa .
is it not a question of europe 's self respect to involve itself - in view of its own basic fundamentals , values and history - honestly and wholeheartedly with africa ?

breuer was chief executive officer of germany 's largest bank at the time . in january , germany 's highest court ruled breuer 's comments breached the bank 's contractual duty of not having a negative effect on a customer 's ability to receive credit from other sources .
one of kirch 's media units had loans of over 700 million euros -lrb- $ 848 million -rrb- . " it 's a shame that kirch is the reason for his departure , " wolfgang gerke , a professor of banking at the university of nuremberg-erlangen , told bloomburg .
" the remark he made was n't new .
everyone knew it .
it was on the edge of what one can say . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ceo for five years , breuer moved up the deutsche bank ladder from an apprenticeship in 1956 decision to protect deutsche bank the 69-year-old 's resignation may be a sign that the court case against him and the bank is reaching a head , as he admitted he stepped down " to relieve deutsche bank of further discussion regarding him personally , " according to a deutsche bank statement released sunday . kirch lawyer peter gauweiler , who along with other kirch representatives , has long called for breuer to step down , welcomed the announcement , telling the associated press he thought the move " was overdue . "
kirch 's lawyers said they anticipate receiving up to 1.5 billion euros in compensation should they win the case . dax reaches five-year high finance markets also greeted the change positively .
investment bank merrill lynch upgraded deutsche bank stocks to " buy " after sunday 's announcement that chief financial officer clemens börsig would take over breuer 's position .
anthony di iorio will then become cfo and hugo bänziger will join the board as chief risk officer , the bank announced . " investors are relying on deutsche bank being kept out of negative headlines after breuer 's resignation , " a trader told reuters . concerns from westlb analyst georg kanders that the resignation could add fuel to the kirch fire and scare away investors initially appeared unfounded .

" when you play against ten men for so long you expect to win , " hamburg manager thomas doll said .
" that was a giant step towards the champions league . " schalke were left to rue the sending off of their young brazilian defender rafinha after he lashed out at rafael van der vaart on 28 minutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sergej barbarez and the rest of the hamburg team were a step above schalke " rafa should not do that , but you should not go down like a bag of potatoes either , " schalke team manager andreas müller said . dutch international van der vaart picked himself up to open the coring in the 57th minute with a brilliant free-kick . brazilian striker ailton , on loan at hamburg from turkish side besiktas , then came back to haunt schalke who sold him in the summer . substituted into the match , ailton struck in the 80th minute after using his pace to power away from the schalke defense . kahn the april fool in cologne hamburg , who last appeared in the champions league back in 2001 , are now seven points behind munich after the bavarian giants drew 2-2 with fc cologne . it was april fool 's day and the joke was on german international goalkeeper oliver kahn who produced a major howler to allow cologne a share of the spoils . the 36-year-old kahn shrugged off a hip injury to face cologne but may wish he had n't bothered after allowing albert streit 's speculative shot to squirm under his body to restore cologne 's lead at 2-1 , surprising the cologne scorer as much as everyone watching . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a goal from roy makaay , right , got bayern one point in cologne kahn , who was replaced at half-time by michael rensing , will hope germany manager jürgen klinsmann missed his gaffe as he bids to prove he is germany 's number one ahead of this summer 's world cup finals . " i was helpless for the first goal , but i was at fault for the second goal and have to hold my hands up , " kahn said , before making a rare admission of guilt .
" but as a goalkeeper you know there will be errors like that from time to time . " arsenal goalkeeper jens lehmann , kahn 's rival for the number one jersey at the world cup , will no doubt watch the replays with a pleased grin . crowd unhappy over ballack departure fortunately , kahn has field players capable of getting him out of trouble - dutch international roy makaay equalized shortly before half-time . bayern have seen their lead cut to seven points but , barring an almighty collapse in their final six games , felix magath 's team will be collecting their 20th domestic title in may . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 2-2 draw and the crowd 's whistles made it a hard day for ballack german international captain michael ballack has been a driving force behind the title bid but the player , who looks set to join english champions chelsea on a free transfer in the summer , was jeered by the home bayern fans after a poor display . " it is always a problem when you have a player who is likely to be playing somewhere else in the near future , " bayern coach magath said .
" but it is not michael ballack 's fault that the game finished 2-2 . " klose continues scoring while kahn and ballack had an afternoon to forget their international teammate miroslav klose continued to do no wrong . bremen striker klose scored a 70th minute penalty to help bremen to a vital 1-0 win over eintracht frankfurt on saturday . it was klose 's 20th goal of a prolific season and helped bremen consolidate third position , three points behind hamburg but four points clear of schalke . " his goal was worth its weight in gold , " said bremen sporting director klaus allofs . " we are in a champions league place now and that was the target before next weekend 's match against bayern .

public-private partnerships are one route municipalities have been taking . once more , 2005 was a negative year for city and town treasuries in germany .
municipalities around the country were 2.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.76 billion -rrb- in the red .
it was an improvement of 1.6 billion euros over 2004 , but the situation of german cities is not positive .
the city of dresden has taken the radical approach of eliminating its debts by selling its complete real estate holding - 48,000 apartments - for 1.7 billion euros to the us investment company fortress .
the transaction met with some skepticism from politicians and economists who feared that dresden was surrendering an important core asset .
but as local german governments search for alternative financing possibilities to offset their shrinking revenues , privatization deals look more and more appealing to many .
the new trend : ppp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden gave apartments a fresh coat of paint before selling them what has been a phenomenon primarily in the anglo-american world is beginning to take root in germany , namely the public-private partnership , or ppp .
the main goal of public-private projects is to allow cash-strapped local and state governments to undertake projects that are for many no longer feasible , such as hospitals , schools , and administrative buildings and even highways .
the ppp concept is relatively simple .
a private contractor , or frequently a consortium of companies , provides the financing and construction of a building .
the consortium acts as a landlord and also takes care of building maintenance .
the municipality , like a tenant , pays for use of the hospital or school .
after a period of time , usually 20 to 30 years for a school or hospital , the local government assumes ownership of the facility .
its proponents stress that there are numerous advantages to such partnerships .
according to the ppp task force of north-rhine westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- , which provides assistance to cities and districts in such matters , the biggest plus is savings of 6 to 15 percent compared to when a municipality plans , builds , finances and runs the building itself .
efficiency , spreading payments over time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schools financed by consortiums may be built faster one of the first ppp projects in nrw was a school and adjoining sports gymnasium in the city of frechen in the rhine-erft district between cologne and bonn .
not only was 12 percent saved compared to if the district had itself overseen the construction process , the consortium was able to hand over the keys just 15 months after the contract had been signed .
" we were very pleased with how quickly the project was completed , " said rhine-erft district project director anton-josef cremer .
" we are also happy about the efficiency when something must be fixed or attended to in the building .
it takes much less time than before . "
earlier , a crew from the responsible city or district would have been called in to fix a faulty boiler or replace a broken window , but the work was not always done quickly .
besides the practical aspects , the district is relieved from immediately coming up with a large sum of money to pay for the project , according to cremer .
the rhine-erft district will spread out the payments in the form of rent for 25 years , which substantially eases its tight financial situation .
but there is a downside .
the district no longer dictates who can use the building and how .
when they draw up usage contracts with the facility managers , the district officials must be specific about which clubs can use a school or gym .
if one group is forgotten , as the rhine-erft district did in the school pilot project , the contract must be renegotiated or the group must pay .
" naturally we can subsidize some groups , but we are going to have to make some hard choices about who receives how much money , " said cremer .

the ppp task force in nrw , the first of its kind in the country when it was established in 2002 , has sometimes found it difficult to convince politicians that ppps are worthwhile .

the city of dresden has taken the radical approach of eliminating its debts by selling its complete real estate holding - 48,000 apartments - for 1.7 billion euros to the us investment company fortress .

the main goal of public-private projects is to allow cash-strapped local and state governments to undertake projects that are for many no longer feasible , such as hospitals , schools , and administrative buildings and even highways .

according to the ppp task force of north-rhine westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- , which provides assistance to cities and districts in such matters , the biggest plus is savings of 6 to 15 percent compared to when a municipality plans , builds , finances and runs the building itself .

besides the practical aspects , the district is relieved from immediately coming up with a large sum of money to pay for the project , according to cremer .
the rhine-erft district will spread out the payments in the form of rent for 25 years , which substantially eases its tight financial situation .
but there is a downside .
the district no longer dictates who can use the building and how .
when they draw up usage contracts with the facility managers , the district officials must be specific about which clubs can use a school or gym .
if one group is forgotten , as the rhine-erft district did in the school pilot project , the contract must be renegotiated or the group must pay .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.04.2006 german president promotes african successes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler has made africa his political focus on his second trip to africa , horst köhler will focus on the continent 's success stories .
during visits to mozambique , madagascar and botswana , the german leader will promote better understanding of african issues . success stories are rare in africa , a continent plagued by conflict and catastrophe .
even rarer are news reports focusing on the region 's positive aspects .
germany 's president hopes to change that .
his visit to the continent , starting on monday , takes placae under an optimistic motto .
rather than dwelling on africa 's problems , horst köhler wants to draw attention to what works . with stops in mozambique , madagascar and botswana , the president has selected three countries which have managed to free themselves from the yoke of poverty , disease and lack of education .
for köhler , africa is more than a continent in crisis .
he is convinced that europe 's neighbor has more to offer than the negative headlines so often associated with it .
and in his eyes , it is time the international community took more notice . africa must find its own way köhler has observed first hand the difficult political and economic reforms africa has undertaken in the past decades .
during his years as head of the international monetary fund , he traveled the continent six times .
but he has refrained from promoting an ultimate solution for the region 's problems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler visited benin in december 2004 as with his trip last year , which took him to sierra leone , benin and ethiopia , köhler has rejected a cure-all prescription for africa .
" no matter what we do , when we come as outsiders with our aid and our money , we must resist the temptation to press upon the africans our notions of life , " he said after returning from his previous trip . " of course africa has its own tragic history with slavery , colonialism and the east-west conflict ; but it has above all else its own culture , " köhler said .
" we should refrain from exporting our ideals one-to-one to africa , " he said . african role models in december 2004 , köhler launched his first major trip abroad with a visit to sierra leone .
once mired down in a brutal civil war , the country managed to pull itself out of conflict with the aid of a large un mission .
it was this turn in fortune the president focused on , and not the country 's continuing problems . the countries köhler is visiting this time have all found their own way , their own solution for dealing with poverty and the problems of political and economic instability .
botswana , the last country on the president 's itinerary , is clearly a role model in this regard .
the so-called " switzerland of africa " is no longer dependent on development aid .
instead , the country has become exemplary of sustainable and reform-oriented politics in africa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fully automized diamond sorting machine in the jwaneng mine in botswana botswana has the highest gross domestic product in africa .
it owes this relative prosperity to its large diamond deposits : one-third of the world 's diamonds originate here .
the country the size of france and with a population of 1.7 million invests its profits responsibly in infrastructure projects , social welfare , schools , and above all in the battle against aids . perhaps more so than in any other african country , the leaders of botswana have realized that if they do not focus their efforts on stopping the spread of aids , all their successes in social , economic and political development will be endangered .
with four out of 10 adults testing hiv positive , botswana has countered the catastrophic situation with a resolute policy : 12 percent of its national budget flows into the health system , one-third into education . madagascar 's liberal course while botswana has proven itself over the decade as a successful reform state , mozambique and madagascar have only recently begun to turn themselves around .
for both , germany remains an important donor nation . in the current and previous year , germany made available some 16.5 million euros -lrb- $ 20 million -rrb- for development programs in madagascar , with the prime benefactors being environmental projects and the protection and sustainable use of natural resources .
after the country 's civil war in 2001 , the economy began to improve . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : madagascar 's capital , antananarivo the fight against poverty is a major goal of the current leadership .
last year , economic growth hovered around 5 percent .
more than two-thirds of all people in madagascar live on less than $ 1 a day , and the public health system is not accessible to a majority of the poor . president marc ravalomanana has set out a liberal economic course for the island nation , with attention focused on infrastructure , education and privatization .
köhler , whose contact with the madagascar leader dates back to his days at the imf , supports ravalomanana . mozambique but it is mozambique that will initially set the accent for köhler 's trip .
it will also be the first time a german president has visited the country .
although mozambique is still dependent on two dozen donor countries , it is also one of the fastest growing economies in africa .
its adjusted growth rate for 2006 is expected to be over 7 percent .
some 70 million euros from external aid flow into education , rural development and economic reform . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mozambique 's capital , maputo it is here that mozambique faces its biggest challenges .
it must push forward with the diversification of its economy .
with the exception of a few large projects financed primarily by south african investors , the economy is dominated by farming , handcrafts and fishing .
for this reason , the country will be watching the large delegation of corporate representatives traveling with köhler in the hopes of winning more german investment projects . africa 's fate peaceful and democratic - all three countries can lay claim to these attributes , and they are all good examples of köhler 's vision for africa .
during his trip through the continent , the german leader will be pressing his message that the world needs to take africa seriously . he is convinced that the security , peace and welfare of europe can only be guaranteed as long as africa receives its own fair chance .
as he said during his inauguration speech : " for me our degree of humanity hangs on the fate of africa .
is it not a question of europe 's self respect to involve itself - in view of its own basic fundamentals , values and history - honestly and wholeheartedly with africa ?

the talks with iraqi pm ibrahim jaafari and president jalal talabani come as iraqi politicians are struggling to form a government of national unity .
the two are expected to give an update on the progress of the talks shortly .
ms rice said the us regarded the formation of the government as a " matter of urgency " .
mr straw added : " we need to see progress and that is in everybody 's interest . "
the visit comes amid continuing violence in iraq , including : at least four bodies are found in the iraqi capital , baghdad insurgents are reported to have blown up a small shia mosque in the village of kibba near baquba , north-east of baghdad , but there are no reports of any casualties six insurgents are killed in an explosion in a house on the southern outskirts of baghdad .
police said they died when a bomb they were preparing exploded prematurely four other insurgents were killed in two failed attacks against american and iraqi forces near balad , north of baghdad , the us military says two pilots of a us helicopter that crashed after coming under hostile fire on saturday are presumed dead , the us military says two us soldiers were also killed by a roadside bomb while on patrol in central baghdad late on saturday ' fresh messages ' there is mounting pressure on mr jaafari , of the majority shia alliance , to stand down as prime minister .
he has failed to win the support of minority kurds and sunnis and now faces opposition within his alliance . "
we 're going to urge that the negotiations be wrapped up " condoleezza rice analysis : ironic twist for rice last week senior shia politicians said us ambassador to iraq , zalmay khalilzad , had told them president george w bush " does n't want , does n't support , does n't accept " the retention of mr jaafari .
mr jaafari responded by saying the comments undermined mr bush 's commitment to democracy in iraq .
speaking to reporters travelling with her to iraq , ms rice said : " the fact that we 're going out to have these discussions with the iraqi leadership is a sign of the urgency which we attach to a need for a government of national unity . "
she added it was " important to have fresh messages from time to time from washington and from london " .
mr straw said the us and uk would recognise and respect whoever emerged as leader .
the white house has denied the us is backing away from mr jaafari .
but the bbc 's mike wooldridge in baghdad said it might explain the apparent stiffness when ms rice posed for photographs before talking to the prime minister on sunday .
after the president met ms rice and mr straw , mr talabani 's office released a statement saying they had discussed " the efforts exerted by the representatives of the political blocs " , the associated press news agency reported .
mr talabani also briefed them on the negotiations , and the decision to form a political council and ministerial committee for national security , the statement said .
ms rice and mr straw also met vice-president adil abdul mahdi and other iraqi leaders .
sunni arab politician adnan al-dulaimi told ap the talks had been about " the iraqi problem in general , about the government formation and the security problem .
" we also talked about hurrying up in forming the government because the iraqi people have grown bored of waiting .
our points of view matched . "
testing trip mr jaafari was chosen as pm by the ruling shia-led bloc after it won december 's election .
but kurdish and sunni arab parties have rejected the nomination and have threatened to boycott a government unless he withdraws .
the delay in forming a government is thought to be partly responsible for fuelling the increasing sectarian violence which has struck iraq since last month 's bombing of a key shia shrine at samarra .
ms rice arrived in iraq after a testing trip to the uk .
she admitted the us had made thousands of tactical errors in iraq , but later said she was only speaking figuratively .
she also had to face a number of anti-iraq war protests in north-west england .

after speaking to david higgins , chief executive of the olympic delivery authority , the observer reports that at least £ 2bn extra may be needed .
the department for culture , media and sport said the amount quoted by the newspaper was " pure conjecture " .
a spokesman pointed out mr higgins had not given any new figures to the paper .
the observer report come as the games ' budget is scrutinised by accountants kpmg .
the budget will be finalised in the summer and the paper reports concerns that the project will overshoot earlier price estimates or will fall behind schedule .
mr higgins , who helped prepare sydney for the hugely successful olympic games in 2000 and oversaw the construction of the bluewater shopping centre in kent , played down the risk that taxpayers would be left with a massive bill .
' catalyst ' at the heart of the higher costs will be plans to redevelop the lower lea valley , a part of east london where the games will take place .
currently the budget for infrastructure is set at £ 1bn , the paper said .
" this is a valley that has the capacity for 35,000 new homes , " mr higgins told the observer .
" the olympic site ... is the catalyst for the entire development . "
" the response and interest from uk plc since we won the games has been fantastic " philip beard , london 2012 organising committee olympics lining up financial rewards " back in my old job , one of the things we worked on was the expansion of milton keynes - 15,000 homes over a 16-year period , " he explained .
" the total public sector contribution was £ 1.5bn just on infrastructure that was required to cope with the expansion . "
developing the lower lea valley would be a more complicated project , and as a result probably more expensive , because " it 's got contaminated land , it 's got power lines and a river system " , he explained .
and from a social point of view " it is difficult because you 're putting it into a community where education levels , health levels and job participation levels are all lower than the national average " .
spread load according to the observer , mr higgins said that the private sector will help finance preparations for the games because it will stand to benefit once the 17-day event has finished .
the olympic delivery authority -lrb- oda -rrb- is currently identifying companies that would be able to occupy olympic facilities after the games in order to get them to contribute to construction costs .
the paper says mr higgins also believes that utility companies should be asked to pay towards the cost of the new infrastructure as they will benefit from the demand that is generated by the new homes that are built .
a spokesman for the department for culture , media and sport said : " the figure quoted of £ 2bn is pure conjecture by the journalist .
" as the observer itself makes clear in the article , david higgins did not in fact give any new figures for any new infrastructure spending that might be needed .
" what he did say was that the oda is continuing to work with government and kpmg to review and refine details of the infrastructure .

after speaking to david higgins , chief executive of the olympic delivery authority , the observer reports that at least £ 2bn extra may be needed .
the department for culture , media and sport said the amount quoted by the newspaper was " pure conjecture " .
a spokesman pointed out mr higgins had not given any new figures to the paper .
the observer report come as the games ' budget is scrutinised by accountants kpmg .
the budget will be finalised in the summer and the paper reports concerns that the project will overshoot earlier price estimates or will fall behind schedule .
mr higgins , who helped prepare sydney for the hugely successful olympic games in 2000 and oversaw the construction of the bluewater shopping centre in kent , played down the risk that taxpayers would be left with a massive bill .
' catalyst ' at the heart of the higher costs will be plans to redevelop the lower lea valley , a part of east london where the games will take place .
currently the budget for infrastructure is set at £ 1bn , the paper said .
" this is a valley that has the capacity for 35,000 new homes , " mr higgins told the observer .
" the olympic site ... is the catalyst for the entire development . "
the response and interest from uk plc since we won the games has been fantastic philip beard , london 2012 organising committee olympics lining up financial rewards " back in my old job , one of the things we worked on was the expansion of milton keynes - 15,000 homes over a 16-year period , " he explained .
" the total public sector contribution was £ 1.5bn just on infrastructure that was required to cope with the expansion . "
developing the lower lea valley would be a more complicated project , and as a result probably more expensive , because " it 's got contaminated land , it 's got power lines and a river system " , he explained .
and from a social point of view " it is difficult because you 're putting it into a community where education levels , health levels and job participation levels are all lower than the national average " .
spread load according to the observer , mr higgins said that the private sector will help finance preparations for the games because it will stand to benefit once the 17-day event has finished .
the olympic delivery authority -lrb- oda -rrb- is currently identifying companies that would be able to occupy olympic facilities after the games in order to get them to contribute to construction costs .
the paper says mr higgins also believes that utility companies should be asked to pay towards the cost of the new infrastructure as they will benefit from the demand that is generated by the new homes that are built .
a spokesman for the department for culture , media and sport said : " the figure quoted of £ 2bn is pure conjecture by the journalist .
" as the observer itself makes clear in the article , david higgins did not in fact give any new figures for any new infrastructure spending that might be needed .
" what he did say was that the oda is continuing to work with government and kpmg to review and refine details of the infrastructure .
" we have been doing that work since winning -lsb- the bid to host the olympics -rsb- in singapore last july .

off and running ... with some competitors bedecked in tartan but the country now occupies a special place in the heart of the 25-year-old moroccan after he won the third scotland run 10k in new york .
the queens athlete recorded a 31mins 30secs time at the head of a record 6,500 field , 88 of whom were from scotland .
the event was part of tartan week in new york , which promotes scotland .
some of the participants were brave enough to don kilts for the 6.2 miles race under cloudless skies and a blazing sun in central park .
others took advantage of the face painting tent to have saltires daubed on themselves as part of a celebration of all things scottish .
race results 1 .
elmustafa mchkirate : 31.30 2 .
paul mwangwi : 31.34 3 .
robert wong : 31.43 1 .
michelle rorke : 35.49 2 .
victoria ganushina : 36.29 3 .
julia stamps : 37.16 in pictures : scotland run like the name of its location , the race was central to the key message being pushed by the scottish executive : " come and sample scotland as a place to visit , to work and to live . "
for ann hinegardner , senior vice-president , business development , with the event partners new york road runners that message was loud and clear .
" look at all those folks , " she said as she pointed to a giant post-run strip the willow led by the porridge men , who earlier played a haunting rendition of the star spangled banner to herald the start of the event .
" this is unheard of that people stay this long after a race . "
kicking up a storm with the post-race strip the willow she has worked with the scottish executive to market the scotland run at similar events in scotland , such as the great scottish run half-marathon and 10k in glasgow and the loch ness festival of running .
many of the scottish participants in new york said they had become interested in making the transatlantic trip after reading leaflets in the " goody bags " handed out after races at home .
the promotional efforts within the new york road runners organisation have paid dividends too , with an overall 25 % increase in the numbers taking part this year compared to last .
" running is for everybody whether you live in the us or in scotland - it 's a great unifier , " ann said .
philip riddle , visitscotland , was passionate about the country " you run and you get fit , you learn about your body .
but at the same time it 's a good way to educate people about other cultures .
we try each year to add more about scotland and its people . "
for philip riddle , chief executive of visitscotland , who had taken his turn at the microphone to extol scotland 's virtues , the turnout and reaction of new yorkers and scots alike were reasons to be happy .
" it 's all part of the events that make tartan week such a big thing , " he said .
but after all the hype on the day has died down , how does visitscotland define success ?
" we 've got a website so we can measure the traffic to the site , " mr riddell said .
" we can try to get in touch with people and see if they have turned today 's interest into a trip . "
the top three men receive their prizes , with the winner on the right over at the scottish executive tent , international marketing manager clare smith reinforced the message that success could be judged in part at least by a shift in perceptions of scotland .
for the fastest man in the race , elmustafa mchkirate , coming first earned him a trip to scotland later this year to take part in the great scottish run in glasgow .

off and running ... with some competitors bedecked in tartan but the country now occupies a special place in the heart of the 25-year-old moroccan after he won the third scotland run 10k in new york .
the queens athlete recorded a 31mins 30secs time at the head of a record 6,500 field , 88 of whom were from scotland .
the event was part of tartan week in new york , which promotes scotland .
some of the participants were brave enough to don kilts for the 6.2 miles race under cloudless skies and a blazing sun in central park .
others took advantage of the face painting tent to have saltires daubed on themselves as part of a celebration of all things scottish .
race results 1 .
elmustafa mchkirate : 31.30 2 .
paul mwangwi : 31.34 3 .
robert wong : 31.43 1 .
michelle rorke : 35.49 2 .
victoria ganushina : 36.29 3 .
julia stamps : 37.16 in pictures : scotland run like the name of its location , the race was central to the key message being pushed by the scottish executive : " come and sample scotland as a place to visit , to work and to live . "
for ann hinegardner , senior vice-president , business development , with the event partners new york road runners that message was loud and clear .
" look at all those folks , " she said as she pointed to a giant post-run strip the willow led by the porridge men , who earlier played a haunting rendition of the star spangled banner to herald the start of the event .
" this is unheard of that people stay this long after a race . "
kicking up a storm with the post-race strip the willow she has worked with the scottish executive to market the scotland run at similar events in scotland , such as the great scottish run half-marathon and 10k in glasgow and the loch ness festival of running .
many of the scottish participants in new york said they had become interested in making the transatlantic trip after reading leaflets in the " goody bags " handed out after races at home .
the promotional efforts within the new york road runners organisation have paid dividends too , with an overall 25 % increase in the numbers taking part this year compared to last .
" running is for everybody whether you live in the us or in scotland - it 's a great unifier , " ann said .
philip riddle , visitscotland , was passionate about the country " you run and you get fit , you learn about your body .
but at the same time it 's a good way to educate people about other cultures .
we try each year to add more about scotland and its people . "
for philip riddle , chief executive of visitscotland , who had taken his turn at the microphone to extol scotland 's virtues , the turnout and reaction of new yorkers and scots alike were reasons to be happy .
" it 's all part of the events that make tartan week such a big thing , " he said .
but after all the hype on the day has died down , how does visitscotland define success ?
" we 've got a website so we can measure the traffic to the site , " mr riddell said .
" we can try to get in touch with people and see if they have turned today 's interest into a trip . "
the top three men receive their prizes , with the winner on the right over at the scottish executive tent , international marketing manager clare smith reinforced the message that success could be judged in part at least by a shift in perceptions of scotland .
for the fastest man in the race , elmustafa mchkirate , coming first earned him a trip to scotland later this year to take part in the great scottish run in glasgow .

there is trouble ahead for uncle sam in his own backyard .
big trouble .
it is one of the most important and yet largely untold stories of our world in 2006 .
george w bush has lost latin america .
while the bush administration has been fighting wars in iraq and afghanistan , relations between the united states and the countries of latin america have become a festering sore - the worst for years .
virtually anyone paying attention to events in venezuela and nicaragua in the north to peru and bolivia further south , plus in different ways mexico , argentina and brazil , comes to the same conclusion : there is a wave of profound anti-american feeling stretching from the texas border to the antarctic .
and almost everyone believes it will get worse .
president bush came into office declaring that latin america was a priority .
that 's hardly surprising .
it 's been a priority for every american president since james monroe in 1823 whose " monroe doctrine " told european nations to keep out of latin american affairs .
in pursuit of american interests , the us has overthrown or undermined around 40 latin american governments in the 20th century .
for his part , president bush even suggested that the united states had no more important ally than ... wait for it ...
mexico .
none of that survived the attacks of 9/11 .
more ulcers ?
mr bush launched his war on terror and re-discovered the usefulness of allies like britain .
while washington 's attention turned to al-qaeda , the taleban , iraq and now iran , in country after country in latin america voters chose governments of the left , sometimes the implacably " anti-gringo " left , loudly out of sympathy with george bush 's vision of the world , and reflecting a continent with the world 's greatest gulf between rich and poor . "
-lsb- violeta chamorro -rsb- told me that washington politicians could always find money for wars in latin america - but rarely for peace " the next country to fall to a strongly anti-american populist politician could be peru .
voters there go to the polls on 9 april to elect a president and congress .
the presidential frontrunner is ollanta humala , a retired army commander who led a failed military uprising in october 2000 and who is now ahead in the opinion polls .
now , opinion polls in peru are not especially reliable .
they under-represent poor voters in the countryside .
but that is the point .
the rural poor form the backbone of mr humala 's support .
if he is ahead even in the flawed opinion polls which tend to under-count his key constituency , mr humala is confident he can take the presidency .
and if he does , there will be more ulcers in george bush 's white house .
shades of red like president hugo chavez in venezuela and president evo morales in bolivia , mr humala talks of the evils of what he calls " the neo-liberal economic model that has failed to benefit our nation " .
he dismisses the role of multinational companies that " offer no benefits " to the people of peru , and he speaks of a new division in the world .
where once cuba 's fidel castro could harangue the us with talk of the colonisers and the colonised , ollanta humala attacks globalisation as a plot to undermine peru 's national sovereignty and benefit only the rich on the backs of latin america 's poor .
" some countries globalise , and others are globalised , " is how he puts it .
" the third world belongs in the latter category . "
all this may discourage foreign investment , but it is mild compared to venezuela 's hugo chavez .
he compares president bush to hitler .
" the imperialist , genocidal , fascist attitude of the us president has no limits , " mr chavez says .
" i think hitler would be like a suckling baby next to george w bush . "
if you were to colour a map of anti-americanism in latin america , for nearly 50 years fidel castro 's cuba has been the deepest red .
three of the most economically developed countries - brazil , chile and argentina - are now in varying shades of left-of-centre pink .
peru - if mr humala wins - would join venezuela and bolivia in bright post-box red , with two other countries - mexico and nicaragua - possibly about to follow .
bogeyman returns ?
nicaragua is close to my heart .
what has happened there for the past 20 years sums up the failures of us policy across latin america .
as a young reporter i travelled across nicaragua witnessing the fall of the left-wing sandinista government led by the revolutionary daniel ortega . "
now in this new century things are changing , and -lsb- latin america 's -rsb- potential is being realised " for years mr ortega was washington 's enemy number one , the ultimate bogeyman .
president bush 's father , george bush senior , was a key player in undermining mr ortega and the sandinistas .
mr bush senior had been director of central intelligence and ronald reagan 's vice-president before he became president of the united states in january 1989 .
during the reagan administration money was channelled - illegally democrats said - to the nicaraguan " contra " guerrillas , a motley crew of cia trained anti-communists , paramilitaries and thugs .
the resulting scandal - known as " iran-contra " - almost brought down the reagan administration .
george bush senior survived the scandal , and as president managed to see his policies finally work when nicaragua 's own people threw out the sandinistas in a democratic election in 1990 .
after the polls closed in the capital , managua , i stood in a counting station next to a young sandinista woman in green military fatigues .
shaking with emotion she brushed away a tear as the voting papers piled up for the washington-supported opposition candidate , violeta chamorro .
" adios , muchachos , " the sandinista girl called out to her defeated comrades , " companeros de mi vida ! ! ! "
-lrb- goodbye boys , comrades of my life . -rrb-
money issue that was then .
this is now .
the young sandinista revolutionary , daniel ortega , is back .
he may well be re-elected president of nicaragua .
can you imagine it ?
the man who survived cia plots and contra death squads , who relinquished power peacefully to washington 's candidate , violeta chamorro , sweeping back into the nicaraguan presidency ?
it will be a huge embarrassment for george bush junior , a symbol of everything that has gone wrong with american foreign policy in the hemisphere .
and guess who predicted it would go wrong ?
violeta chamorro herself .
the night before her election victory over mr ortega i was invited to dinner at the walled compound of mrs chamorro 's house in managua .
she told me that washington politicians could always find money for wars in latin america - but rarely for peace in latin america .
she said even a slice of the money used to back the anti-communist contra guerrillas could build a new nicaragua - but she predicted that if she won the election washington would declare victory - and then cut off the money supply .
she was right .
potential realised and now ?
well , most of my travelling in latin america in the 1990s was to cover bad news : insurgency in peru , american troops invading panama , the killings by the contras in nicaragua , the repressive regime of fidel castro in cuba , and armed thugs burning the rainforest in brazil .
even then , the potential of this wonderful continent was obvious .
now in this new century things are changing , and the potential is being realised .
with the exception of cuba and haiti , democracy has flourished , almost everywhere .
latin american voters have thrown out their governments and - often - given a two-fingered salute to washington .
that is their prerogative .
economically , some countries - including peru - have been roaring ahead .
their cultures are flourishing too .
a new generation of novelists is following the path blazed by gabriel garcia marquez , mario vargas llosa , and carlos fuentes .
the music ?
in this special series , we 'll be hearing from novalima from peru - just one of the talented new bands .
and the cinema ?
if you have n't seen some of the new hot films from mexico or argentina , then you are missing a real treat .
i will be reporting shortly for newsnight from argentina on the new generation cinema which is hotter than a chilli pepper and cooler than a long-neck beer .
plus we 'll be covering the run-up to peru 's elections live from lima , and assessing the huge leftward shift from argentina to venezuela .
oh , yes , and i 've also been an extra in a film being made in buenos aires .
-lrb- i do n't think the oscar judges are likely to get too interested .
but it was fun . -rrb-
i hope , in other words , that newsnight 's inside latin american season will capture some of the spice and rhythms of a continent full of life , and hope and promise .
inside latin america week starts on bbc two 's newsnight on 3 april , at 2230 bst .

there is trouble ahead for uncle sam in his own backyard .
big trouble .
peru 's ollanta humala talks of the evils of " the neo-liberal model " it is one of the most important and yet largely untold stories of our world in 2006 .
george w bush has lost latin america .
while the bush administration has been fighting wars in iraq and afghanistan , relations between the united states and the countries of latin america have become a festering sore - the worst for years .
virtually anyone paying attention to events in venezuela and nicaragua in the north to peru and bolivia further south , plus in different ways mexico , argentina and brazil , comes to the same conclusion : there is a wave of profound anti-american feeling stretching from the texas border to the antarctic .
and almost everyone believes it will get worse .
president bush came into office declaring that latin america was a priority .
that 's hardly surprising .
it 's been a priority for every american president since james monroe in 1823 whose " monroe doctrine " told european nations to keep out of latin american affairs .
in pursuit of american interests , the us has overthrown or undermined around 40 latin american governments in the 20th century .
for his part , president bush even suggested that the united states had no more important ally than ... wait for it ...
mexico .
none of that survived the attacks of 9/11 .
more ulcers ?
mr bush launched his war on terror and re-discovered the usefulness of allies like britain .
while washington 's attention turned to al-qaeda , the taleban , iraq and now iran , in country after country in latin america voters chose governments of the left , sometimes the implacably " anti-gringo " left , loudly out of sympathy with george bush 's vision of the world , and reflecting a continent with the world 's greatest gulf between rich and poor .
-lsb- violeta chamorro -rsb- told me that washington politicians could always find money for wars in latin america - but rarely for peace the next country to fall to a strongly anti-american populist politician could be peru .
voters there go to the polls on 9 april to elect a president and congress .
the presidential frontrunner is ollanta humala , a retired army commander who led a failed military uprising in october 2000 and who is now ahead in the opinion polls .
now , opinion polls in peru are not especially reliable .
they under-represent poor voters in the countryside .
but that is the point .
the rural poor form the backbone of mr humala 's support .
if he is ahead even in the flawed opinion polls which tend to under-count his key constituency , mr humala is confident he can take the presidency .
and if he does , there will be more ulcers in george bush 's white house .
shades of red like president hugo chavez in venezuela and president evo morales in bolivia , mr humala talks of the evils of what he calls " the neo-liberal economic model that has failed to benefit our nation " .
he dismisses the role of multinational companies that " offer no benefits " to the people of peru , and he speaks of a new division in the world .
daniel ortega , once enemy number one , could be back in power where once cuba 's fidel castro could harangue the us with talk of the colonisers and the colonised , ollanta humala attacks globalisation as a plot to undermine peru 's national sovereignty and benefit only the rich on the backs of latin america 's poor .
" some countries globalise , and others are globalised , " is how he puts it .
" the third world belongs in the latter category . "
all this may discourage foreign investment , but it is mild compared to venezuela 's hugo chavez .
he compares president bush to hitler .
" the imperialist , genocidal , fascist attitude of the us president has no limits , " mr chavez says .
" i think hitler would be like a suckling baby next to george w bush . "
if you were to colour a map of anti-americanism in latin america , for nearly 50 years fidel castro 's cuba has been the deepest red .
three of the most economically developed countries - brazil , chile and argentina - are now in varying shades of left-of-centre pink .
peru - if mr humala wins - would join venezuela and bolivia in bright post-box red , with two other countries - mexico and nicaragua - possibly about to follow .
bogeyman returns ?
nicaragua is close to my heart .
what has happened there for the past 20 years sums up the failures of us policy across latin america .
as a young reporter i travelled across nicaragua witnessing the fall of the left-wing sandinista government led by the revolutionary daniel ortega .
now in this new century things are changing , and -lsb- latin america 's -rsb- potential is being realised for years mr ortega was washington 's enemy number one , the ultimate bogeyman .
president bush 's father , george bush senior , was a key player in undermining mr ortega and the sandinistas .
mr bush senior had been director of central intelligence and ronald reagan 's vice-president before he became president of the united states in january 1989 .
during the reagan administration money was channelled - illegally democrats said - to the nicaraguan " contra " guerrillas , a motley crew of cia trained anti-communists , paramilitaries and thugs .
the resulting scandal - known as " iran-contra " - almost brought down the reagan administration .
george bush senior survived the scandal , and as president managed to see his policies finally work when nicaragua 's own people threw out the sandinistas in a democratic election in 1990 .

he may well be re-elected president of nicaragua .
can you imagine it ?
the man who survived cia plots and contra death squads , who relinquished power peacefully to washington 's candidate , violeta chamorro , sweeping back into the nicaraguan presidency ?
it will be a huge embarrassment for george bush junior , a symbol of everything that has gone wrong with american foreign policy in the hemisphere .
and guess who predicted it would go wrong ?
violeta chamorro herself .
the night before her election victory over mr ortega i was invited to dinner at the walled compound of mrs chamorro 's house in managua .
she told me that washington politicians could always find money for wars in latin america - but rarely for peace in latin america .
she said even a slice of the money used to back the anti-communist contra guerrillas could build a new nicaragua - but she predicted that if she won the election washington would declare victory - and then cut off the money supply .
she was right .
potential realised and now ?
well , most of my travelling in latin america in the 1990s was to cover bad news : insurgency in peru , american troops invading panama , the killings by the contras in nicaragua , the repressive regime of fidel castro in cuba , and armed thugs burning the rainforest in brazil .
even then , the potential of this wonderful continent was obvious .
now in this new century things are changing , and the potential is being realised .
with the exception of cuba and haiti , democracy has flourished , almost everywhere .
latin american voters have thrown out their governments and - often - given a two-fingered salute to washington .
that is their prerogative .
economically , some countries - including peru - have been roaring ahead .
their cultures are flourishing too .
a new generation of novelists is following the path blazed by gabriel garcia marquez , mario vargas llosa , and carlos fuentes .
the music ?
in this special series , we 'll be hearing from novalima from peru - just one of the talented new bands .
and the cinema ?
if you have n't seen some of the new hot films from mexico or argentina , then you are missing a real treat .
i will be reporting shortly for newsnight from argentina on the new generation cinema which is hotter than a chilli pepper and cooler than a long-neck beer .
plus we 'll be covering the run-up to peru 's elections live from lima , and assessing the huge leftward shift from argentina to venezuela .
oh , yes , and i 've also been an extra in a film being made in buenos aires .
-lrb- i do n't think the oscar judges are likely to get too interested .
but it was fun . -rrb-
i hope , in other words , that newsnight 's inside latin american season will capture some of the spice and rhythms of a continent full of life , and hope and promise .

there is trouble ahead for uncle sam in his own backyard .
big trouble .
peru 's ollanta humala talks of the evils of " the neo-liberal model " it is one of the most important and yet largely untold stories of our world in 2006 .
george w bush has lost latin america .
while the bush administration has been fighting wars in iraq and afghanistan , relations between the united states and the countries of latin america have become a festering sore - the worst for years .
virtually anyone paying attention to events in venezuela and nicaragua in the north to peru and bolivia further south , plus in different ways mexico , argentina and brazil , comes to the same conclusion : there is a wave of profound anti-american feeling stretching from the texas border to the antarctic .
and almost everyone believes it will get worse .
president bush came into office declaring that latin america was a priority .
that 's hardly surprising .
it 's been a priority for every american president since james monroe in 1823 whose " monroe doctrine " told european nations to keep out of latin american affairs .
in pursuit of american interests , the us has overthrown or undermined around 40 latin american governments in the 20th century .
for his part , president bush even suggested that the united states had no more important ally than ... wait for it ...
mexico .
none of that survived the attacks of 9/11 .
more ulcers ?
mr bush launched his war on terror and re-discovered the usefulness of allies like britain .
while washington 's attention turned to al-qaeda , the taleban , iraq and now iran , in country after country in latin america voters chose governments of the left , sometimes the implacably " anti-gringo " left , loudly out of sympathy with george bush 's vision of the world , and reflecting a continent with the world 's greatest gulf between rich and poor .
-lsb- violeta chamorro -rsb- told me that washington politicians could always find money for wars in latin america - but rarely for peace the next country to fall to a strongly anti-american populist politician could be peru .
voters there go to the polls on 9 april to elect a president and congress .
the presidential frontrunner is ollanta humala , a retired army commander who led a failed military uprising in october 2000 and who is now ahead in the opinion polls .
now , opinion polls in peru are not especially reliable .
they under-represent poor voters in the countryside .
but that is the point .
the rural poor form the backbone of mr humala 's support .
if he is ahead even in the flawed opinion polls which tend to under-count his key constituency , mr humala is confident he can take the presidency .
and if he does , there will be more ulcers in george bush 's white house .
shades of red like president hugo chavez in venezuela and president evo morales in bolivia , mr humala talks of the evils of what he calls " the neo-liberal economic model that has failed to benefit our nation " .
he dismisses the role of multinational companies that " offer no benefits " to the people of peru , and he speaks of a new division in the world .
daniel ortega , once enemy number one , could be back in power where once cuba 's fidel castro could harangue the us with talk of the colonisers and the colonised , ollanta humala attacks globalisation as a plot to undermine peru 's national sovereignty and benefit only the rich on the backs of latin america 's poor .
" some countries globalise , and others are globalised , " is how he puts it .
" the third world belongs in the latter category . "
all this may discourage foreign investment , but it is mild compared to venezuela 's hugo chavez .
he compares president bush to hitler .
" the imperialist , genocidal , fascist attitude of the us president has no limits , " mr chavez says .
" i think hitler would be like a suckling baby next to george w bush . "
if you were to colour a map of anti-americanism in latin america , for nearly 50 years fidel castro 's cuba has been the deepest red .
three of the most economically developed countries - brazil , chile and argentina - are now in varying shades of left-of-centre pink .
peru - if mr humala wins - would join venezuela and bolivia in bright post-box red , with two other countries - mexico and nicaragua - possibly about to follow .
bogeyman returns ?
nicaragua is close to my heart .
what has happened there for the past 20 years sums up the failures of us policy across latin america .
as a young reporter i travelled across nicaragua witnessing the fall of the left-wing sandinista government led by the revolutionary daniel ortega .
now in this new century things are changing , and -lsb- latin america 's -rsb- potential is being realised for years mr ortega was washington 's enemy number one , the ultimate bogeyman .
president bush 's father , george bush senior , was a key player in undermining mr ortega and the sandinistas .
mr bush senior had been director of central intelligence and ronald reagan 's vice-president before he became president of the united states in january 1989 .
during the reagan administration money was channelled - illegally democrats said - to the nicaraguan " contra " guerrillas , a motley crew of cia trained anti-communists , paramilitaries and thugs .
the resulting scandal - known as " iran-contra " - almost brought down the reagan administration .
george bush senior survived the scandal , and as president managed to see his policies finally work when nicaragua 's own people threw out the sandinistas in a democratic election in 1990 .
after the polls closed in the capital , managua , i stood in a counting station next to a young sandinista woman in green military fatigues .
shaking with emotion she brushed away a tear as the voting papers piled up for the washington-supported opposition candidate , violeta chamorro .
" adios , muchachos , " the sandinista girl called out to her defeated comrades , " companeros de mi vida ! ! ! "
-lrb- goodbye boys , comrades of my life . -rrb-
money issue that was then .
this is now .

julie powell 's tales of french cooking beat the intimate diary of a prostitute and a guide to the uk 's best " greasy spoon " cafes to take the blooker prize .
the contest was set up for bloggers who have turned their episodic journals into books .
in the last few years , regularly updated web logs , or blogs , have become a major feature of the internet .
there are believed to be more than 60 million blogs in existence .
" blooks are the new books , a hybrid literary form at the cutting edge of both literature and technology , " said bob young , founder of self-publishing site lulu which organised and sponsored the prize .
community support the winning blog began life as a online diary of the attempt by julie powell to cook the recipes in the 1961 cookbook by julia child , mastering the art of french cooking .
blooker winners overall and non-fiction : julie and julia : 365 days , 524 recipes , 1 tiny apartment kitchen by julie powell fiction : four and twenty blackbirds by cherie priest comic book : totally boned : a joe and monkey collection by zach miller her blog built up a cult following .
the entries were published as a book last year and has since sold almost 100,000 copies .
" the community aspect of blogging and the interaction with others kept me honest , kept me writing and kept me from sinking into my habitual black hole of self-loathing , " said ms powell .
a total of 89 entries vied for the blooker , including two strong contenders from the uk .
one was the notorious belle de jour , who blogged about life as a prostitute .
the other was russell davies , who turned his affection for greasy spoon cafes into a blog called eggbaconchipsandbeans and a book detailing the 50 best cafes in the uk .
" those who dismiss blogging as ' mere ' confessional writing and complaining about one 's day job fail to appreciate just how engrossing those genres can be when handled by a talented writer like julie powell , " said writer and activist cory doctorow , who was on the judging panel .
" the story of how blogging , writing in public , changed powell 's life is both memorable and inspirational . "

these would be more than a thousand million-million times the strength of earth 's magnetic field , the uk-german team reports in science magazine .
its computer simulations fit with the theory that mergers of neutron stars drive some of the bursts of high-energy radiation that sweep across space .
however , the group says more work is needed to explain the link in detail .
dr daniel price from the university of exeter , uk , and professor stephan rosswog from the international university bremen , germany , carried out their modelling on a supercomputer .
the simulations required many months of programming .
-lrb- follow the internet links for the team 's simulation movies -rrb- .
the study gives fresh insight into the mechanisms that could lie behind extremely powerful , split-second flashes of light called short gamma-ray bursts -lrb- grbs -rrb- .
quick start the space-borne telescopes swift and hete-2 have indicated the source of at least some of these 100-millisecond bursts could result from two compact , magnetised objects falling on to each other .
theory suggests these objects could be two neutron stars , the remnant cores of massive stars that have imploded after running out of nuclear fuel .
neutron stars corpses of massive stars that have collapsed and exploded typical masses little more than our sun ; radii about 10 km superdense objects - more dense than atomic nuclei neutron star binaries are focus of intense scientific study now being observed for their gravitational waves colliding binaries thought to be source of short grbs neutron star collisions with black holes also a possibility grbs signal the most violent events in the universe although about the same mass as our sun , neutron stars would be little more than 10km across .
such objects are expected to have intense magnetic fields anyway but the new simulations show that a collision between a pair of them could produce something altogether more spectacular - and sufficiently intense to launch a grb .
key to this link is the very rapid speed with which the giant magnetic fields are seen to develop in the modelled collisions .
this has to be so if neutron star mergers are to explain the short gamma-ray bursts .
" our simulations are of the first 12 milliseconds but all the action goes on in the first couple of milliseconds the stars hit each other .
you get this very strong shear that rotates and winds the magnetic field up , " dr price told the bbc news website .
professor rosswog added : " this is an incredible result .
magnetic fields that we are familiar with , say from a magnet at your refrigerator , have a strength of about 100 gauss .
such a collision produces fields that are an incredible 10-million-million times stronger . "
in tandem grbs have been one of the great unexplained phenomena in astronomy since they were first detected in the 1960s .
it is only in recent years , with the launch of new space telescopes , that scientists have had the tools capable of studying in detail these very bright , but fleeting , events .
computer modelling of the type carried out by the uk-german team is essential companion work to the observations , as it helps to unravel the extreme physics involved .
" there were certain speculations about how you could grow the magnetic fields , but now we know they develop very quickly .
this means we have a firm theoretical basis on which to push forward with this model of how binary neutron stars produce gamma-ray bursts , " dr price said .
the results of the simulations are being presented this week at the uk royal astronomical society 's national astronomy meeting in leicester , and at the nuclear astrophysics conference at ringberg castle , tegernsee .

but her early years were dogged by well-documented problems with depression and substance abuse .
the rehabilitated blige says she hopes her experiences can be inspirational to others .
" my life is a testimony , " she says .
" how did i come from abuse , hurt and rejection to become mary j blige the superstar ?
" all i can do is walk the walk .
if anyone sees it and catches on , hopefully it inspires them to walk a different walk in their own lives . "
the us soul star also offers words of support to george michael following his recent caution for possessing cannabis .
' love and respect ' but the triple grammy recipient , who recorded a duet with michael in 1999 , refuses to judge the british singer .
" i love and respect george and it 's not my place to make a judgement call , " she tells the bbc news website .
" his life is his life .
being human beings , we all make mistakes and we all mess up . "
blige is back in the charts thanks to a duet with u2 on their hit one , which is the finale on her current album the breakthrough .
" it 's such a powerful song , " she says .
" no matter what race or colour we are , at the end of the day we all live here together .
" why do we always have to wait for something like hurricane katrina or 9/11 to happen for us to hold hands or talk to each other on the train ? "
blige first performed one in 2002 and , in her own words , " fell in love with it " .
" the song moved me from the first guitar strum , " she says .
" i felt i had to put it on my album . "
according to blige , the version that appears on the breakthrough has the band 's full blessing .
" what they love is that i deliver the same emotion and sincerity bono delivered on his version .
" as long as you do it in a way that 's truthful and honest , it 's a home run . "
trepidation having made her film acting debut in the 2001 drama prison song , blige is set to return to the big screen in an mtv-produced biopic of jazz legend nina simone .
the singer said she was drawn to the project by the similarities she saw between her life and simone 's .
" she was strong , she said what she felt and she loved people .
that 's been the story of my life , all my life . "
nor does blige have any trepidation about imitating the late icon 's remarkably expressive voice .
" it will be easy for me .
i can go from barry white d to aretha franklin high , so i 'll be fine . "
blige is not the first hip-hop figure to swap the recording booth for the soundstage .
chris " ludacris " bridges appeared in the oscar-winning crash , while curtis " 50 cent " jackson made his acting debut last year in the semi-autobiographical get rich or die tryin ' .
50 cent 's film was criticised in some quarters for allegedly glamorising gun violence , a charge that blige dismisses .
" in his defence , he told his story the way he knew how .
he had to live and hustle on the streets in order to become 50 cent .
" if they 're carrying guns , that 's what they 're going to talk about .
to each his own . "

however , concerns associated with the current system have begun to grow , writes internet law professor michael geist .
net governance was discussed at the un internet summit last year the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers -lrb- icann -rrb- , the us-based body charged with managing the net 's domain name system , just wrapped up a week-long meeting in wellington , new zealand on friday , and it now finds itself the target of criticism from some its closest allies .
icann , which then-us president bill clinton established in the late 1990s , initially viewed itself as a technical body mandated with ensuring that the net functioned in a stable and secure manner .
while stability and security remain an important objective , today no one seriously questions the fact that internet governance extends far beyond technical concerns .
the introduction of new top-level domains is a major issue for domain name registrars , who rightly note that icann exerts strong regulatory control over the size and scope of the domain name marketplace .
it has moved frustratingly slowly in establishing new domain name extensions , with only handful , such as .biz or .info , appearing on the market in recent years .
online politics governments have also taken an increasing interest in icann , focusing primarily on their own national country-code top-level domains such as .uk for the united kingdom .
the power of icann , and by extension the us government , to influence these domains has raised serious questions about the intersection between the internet and national sovereignty as governments maintain that they should be final arbiters over their country-code domains .
internet governance policies strike at the core of free speech , privacy , and a competitive marketplace many governments have also wondered why icann has been so slow to establish multi-lingual domains that would allow their citizens to register domain names in their native language .
while the issue has been a priority for many developing countries , icann has not moved at net speeds on the issue .
other icann policies have attracted the interest of a diverse group of communities .
the privacy community has worked with icann for years without success to establish an appropriate " whois " policy , which addresses the conditions under which the personal information of someone registering a domain name is publicly disclosed .
the free speech community has actively called on icann to examine its policy for resolving domain name disputes , expressing disappointment that the current policy has been used to shut down legitimate criticism websites .
despite the mounting frustration with icann , until recently it could count on support from the us government and the administrators for several leading country-code domains .
at last year 's world summit on the information society in tunisia , icann overcame opposition from europe and the developing world to retain responsibility over the domain name system .
over the past month , however , even icann 's most ardent supporters have begun to express doubts about the organization 's lack of transparency and accountability .
pressure on icann last week , us congressman rick boucher called for a congressional investigation into icann and its recent decision to settle litigation with verisign , which manages the lucrative .com registry .
the settlement , which awards verisign near permanent control over the .com domain , has faced sharp criticism from across the internet governance community .
countries like china want a greater say over how the net is run in canada , the canadian internet registration authority , cira , recently published an open letter to icann calling on it to implement greater accountability , transparency , and fair processes .
backing up its words with actions , cira said that until icann addressed these concerns , it would suspend payment of thousands of dollars in contributions and cease consideration of a new contractual agreement with the organisation .
moreover , cira added that it would no longer host or sponsor any icann-related events .
the net supervisory body has also come under fire from the public interest registry , pir , which manages the .org domain .
last week it called on icann to address concerns over the thriving business of grabbing domain names that have not been re-registered .
pir noted that many registrants are unaware that their domain names are valuable and that allowing them to lapse may lead to their misuse .
it pointed specifically to one instance where a domain name associated with a rape crisis centre was not re-registered and soon after pointed to a pornographic website .
internet governance policies strike at the core of free speech , privacy , and a competitive marketplace .
icann 's seeming inability to address these issues in an accountable , transparent , and timely manner has alienated some of its strongest supporters , opening the door to the prospect for major changes to the global internet governance landscape .

however , concerns associated with the current system have begun to grow , writes internet law professor michael geist .
net governance was discussed at the un internet summit last year the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers -lrb- icann -rrb- , the us-based body charged with managing the net 's domain name system , just wrapped up a week-long meeting in wellington , new zealand on friday , and it now finds itself the target of criticism from some its closest allies .
icann , which then-us president bill clinton established in the late 1990s , initially viewed itself as a technical body mandated with ensuring that the net functioned in a stable and secure manner .
while stability and security remain an important objective , today no one seriously questions the fact that internet governance extends far beyond technical concerns .
the introduction of new top-level domains is a major issue for domain name registrars , who rightly note that icann exerts strong regulatory control over the size and scope of the domain name marketplace .
it has moved frustratingly slowly in establishing new domain name extensions , with only handful , such as .biz or .info , appearing on the market in recent years .
online politics governments have also taken an increasing interest in icann , focusing primarily on their own national country-code top-level domains such as .uk for the united kingdom .
the power of icann , and by extension the us government , to influence these domains has raised serious questions about the intersection between the internet and national sovereignty as governments maintain that they should be final arbiters over their country-code domains .
internet governance policies strike at the core of free speech , privacy , and a competitive marketplace many governments have also wondered why icann has been so slow to establish multi-lingual domains that would allow their citizens to register domain names in their native language .
while the issue has been a priority for many developing countries , icann has not moved at net speeds on the issue .
other icann policies have attracted the interest of a diverse group of communities .
the privacy community has worked with icann for years without success to establish an appropriate " whois " policy , which addresses the conditions under which the personal information of someone registering a domain name is publicly disclosed .
the free speech community has actively called on icann to examine its policy for resolving domain name disputes , expressing disappointment that the current policy has been used to shut down legitimate criticism websites .
despite the mounting frustration with icann , until recently it could count on support from the us government and the administrators for several leading country-code domains .
at last year 's world summit on the information society in tunisia , icann overcame opposition from europe and the developing world to retain responsibility over the domain name system .
over the past month , however , even icann 's most ardent supporters have begun to express doubts about the organization 's lack of transparency and accountability .
pressure on icann last week , us congressman rick boucher called for a congressional investigation into icann and its recent decision to settle litigation with verisign , which manages the lucrative .com registry .
the settlement , which awards verisign near permanent control over the .com domain , has faced sharp criticism from across the internet governance community .
countries like china want a greater say over how the net is run in canada , the canadian internet registration authority , cira , recently published an open letter to icann calling on it to implement greater accountability , transparency , and fair processes .
backing up its words with actions , cira said that until icann addressed these concerns , it would suspend payment of thousands of dollars in contributions and cease consideration of a new contractual agreement with the organisation .
moreover , cira added that it would no longer host or sponsor any icann-related events .
the net supervisory body has also come under fire from the public interest registry , pir , which manages the .org domain .
last week it called on icann to address concerns over the thriving business of grabbing domain names that have not been re-registered .
pir noted that many registrants are unaware that their domain names are valuable and that allowing them to lapse may lead to their misuse .
it pointed specifically to one instance where a domain name associated with a rape crisis centre was not re-registered and soon after pointed to a pornographic website .
internet governance policies strike at the core of free speech , privacy , and a competitive marketplace .
icann 's seeming inability to address these issues in an accountable , transparent , and timely manner has alienated some of its strongest supporters , opening the door to the prospect for major changes to the global internet governance landscape .

however , concerns associated with the current system have begun to grow , writes internet law professor michael geist .
net governance was discussed at the un internet summit last year the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers -lrb- icann -rrb- , the us-based body charged with managing the net 's domain name system , just wrapped up a week-long meeting in wellington , new zealand on friday , and it now finds itself the target of criticism from some its closest allies .
icann , which then-us president bill clinton established in the late 1990s , initially viewed itself as a technical body mandated with ensuring that the net functioned in a stable and secure manner .
while stability and security remain an important objective , today no one seriously questions the fact that internet governance extends far beyond technical concerns .
the introduction of new top-level domains is a major issue for domain name registrars , who rightly note that icann exerts strong regulatory control over the size and scope of the domain name marketplace .
it has moved frustratingly slowly in establishing new domain name extensions , with only handful , such as .biz or .info , appearing on the market in recent years .
online politics governments have also taken an increasing interest in icann , focusing primarily on their own national country-code top-level domains such as .uk for the united kingdom .
the power of icann , and by extension the us government , to influence these domains has raised serious questions about the intersection between the internet and national sovereignty as governments maintain that they should be final arbiters over their country-code domains .
internet governance policies strike at the core of free speech , privacy , and a competitive marketplace many governments have also wondered why icann has been so slow to establish multi-lingual domains that would allow their citizens to register domain names in their native language .
while the issue has been a priority for many developing countries , icann has not moved at net speeds on the issue .
other icann policies have attracted the interest of a diverse group of communities .
the privacy community has worked with icann for years without success to establish an appropriate " whois " policy , which addresses the conditions under which the personal information of someone registering a domain name is publicly disclosed .
the free speech community has actively called on icann to examine its policy for resolving domain name disputes , expressing disappointment that the current policy has been used to shut down legitimate criticism websites .
despite the mounting frustration with icann , until recently it could count on support from the us government and the administrators for several leading country-code domains .
at last year 's world summit on the information society in tunisia , icann overcame opposition from europe and the developing world to retain responsibility over the domain name system .
over the past month , however , even icann 's most ardent supporters have begun to express doubts about the organization 's lack of transparency and accountability .
pressure on icann last week , us congressman rick boucher called for a congressional investigation into icann and its recent decision to settle litigation with verisign , which manages the lucrative .com registry .
the settlement , which awards verisign near permanent control over the .com domain , has faced sharp criticism from across the internet governance community .
countries like china want a greater say over how the net is run in canada , the canadian internet registration authority , cira , recently published an open letter to icann calling on it to implement greater accountability , transparency , and fair processes .
backing up its words with actions , cira said that until icann addressed these concerns , it would suspend payment of thousands of dollars in contributions and cease consideration of a new contractual agreement with the organisation .
moreover , cira added that it would no longer host or sponsor any icann-related events .
the net supervisory body has also come under fire from the public interest registry , pir , which manages the .org domain .
last week it called on icann to address concerns over the thriving business of grabbing domain names that have not been re-registered .
pir noted that many registrants are unaware that their domain names are valuable and that allowing them to lapse may lead to their misuse .
it pointed specifically to one instance where a domain name associated with a rape crisis centre was not re-registered and soon after pointed to a pornographic website .
internet governance policies strike at the core of free speech , privacy , and a competitive marketplace .
icann 's seeming inability to address these issues in an accountable , transparent , and timely manner has alienated some of its strongest supporters , opening the door to the prospect for major changes to the global internet governance landscape .
michael geist holds the canada research chair in internet and e-commerce law at the university of ottawa , faculty of law .
he is a member of cira board of directors and of public interest registry 's global advisory council .

second class stamps rise to 23p .
the company cleared the way for the increases on friday by accepting a plan that lays out prices until 2010 .
under the agreement with regulator postcomm , it can not increase the price of a first-class stamp to more than 37p before 2010 .
it is facing new rivals and is battling to plug a pension deficit .
greater choice the uk postal market was opened up to greater competition from 1 january , and the royal mail has been calling for greater freedom to increase its prices and limit losses .
the company has been losing money on domestic uk mail but has made up for the shortfall with its profitable business mail service .
however , postcomm said that customers can not be expected to take the full burden of price increases and the company needs to find ways of cutting costs and becoming more efficient .
a royal mail spokesman said the price rise was part of the normal round of adjustments and came only after lengthy consultations with postcomm .
" new financial year , new prices , " he said .
' obligations ' postcomm said it has agreed in part to the increase because of the problems royal mail was having with its " enormous " pensions deficit .
under the new agreement , first-class franking prices have also increased to 31p for mail weighing up to 60g , while a second-class franking price will be set at 22p .
royal mail special delivery next day has increased by 25p to £ 4.10 for mail up to 100g .
" we believe this framework will enable royal mail to invest in the business , meet its obligations to the pension fund and build on these achievements going forwards , " postcomm chairman nigel stapleton said in march .
meanwhile , post office financial services announced that it is to launch its first ever savings account .
the instant saver account offers an interest rate of 3.75 % , boosted to 4.75 % for the first year .
savers are allowed to make six penalty-free withdrawals a year .
after this quota is used up , savers have to pay to make withdrawals .
the highest paying savings account in the market currently pay close to 5 % .
