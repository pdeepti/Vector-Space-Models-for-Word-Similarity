but the electronic music scene has been fighting back with events of its own where vinyl and samplers rule . the undisputed leader is the sonar festival in barcelona , spain , which runs from june 15-17 . helped by the warm weather , the seaside location and the buzz of the city , the sonar organizers also consistently select a line up of big name djs and the most exciting breakthrough acts . expect electronica , hip hop and techno with appearances by london-based goldfrapp and legendary producer dj shadow expected to be major draws during the three-day event . disco is n ot dead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whoever said that disco dancing was passe ?
" there are two main focuses this year , " said enric palau , one of the three co-founders of the event , which began in 1994 . " one is the ' the year of japan ' event with 20 artists from japan including hip hop , breakbeat and beatboxing people , " he said .
" the second is ' black music . '
we would n't have electronic music without disco or the first samples of rap .
and reggae has been important for the minimal techno of today . " about 80,000 to 90,000 people attended last year and the same number are expected on the sonar site this year . " barcelona is the perfect environment for the festival , " palau said .
" the work we do has helped position barcelona on the map for cultural and music events . " europe goes electro n ic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hey ms. dj , pump up the jam !
elsewhere in spain , the benicassim festival from july 20-23 features both guitar and electronic acts and draws big crowds for four days of dancing under the sometimes unrelenting spanish sun . in france , the nuits sonores festival in lyon is already winning plaudits as a gallic rival to spain 's sonar despite this year being only the fourth edition . unlike sonar , however , which is concentrated on one site , nuits sonores infiltrates the whole of the unesco-listed city of lyon with performances in 50 different locations .
a warehouse at the confluence of the two rivers in lyon , the rhone and the saone , serves as the focal point of the festival which runs from may 24-28 and which attracted 40,000-50,000 visitors last year . " it 's a panorama of electronic music with all styles represented , " said 35-year-old vincent carry , one of three co-founders from the city .
" the line-up goes from techno house to breakbeat and electroclash .
the comparison with sonar is made by a lot of people .
artistically , we have a lot in common with them . " from belgium to berli n a n d beyo n d in neighboring belgium , the summer festival season is rich and diverse with the electronic scene led by the 10 days off event from july 14-24 as part of the giant gentse feesten , which takes over the picturesque town of ghent in july . " i think gentse feesten is the biggest city festival in europe , " said phillip de liser , an organizer of 10 days off .
" about two million people came last year . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berlin love parade was cancelled in 2004 due to lack of funds he underlined the influence of berlin on the electronic music scene in europe at the moment .
berliners or international djs based in berlin are set to be an important draw for this year 's festival . " the best electronic music is coming from berlin at the moment , " de liser said .
" berlin is really the capital for electronic music at the moment .
it is n't london anymore . " berlin itself hosts the popkomm electronic festival from september 20-22 which hosted 1,200 artists in 20 clubs in 2005 . in the middle of the summer , the berlin love parade on july 15 will could again bring over a million people onto the streets of the formerly divided city for a day of hedonism and ear-popping dance music .
the city of cologne in western germany , the other hotspot for german electronic music , livens up when the c / o pop festival gets underway on august 23-27 . uk still big o n festivals in britain , the glastonbury festival from june 22-24 continues to be the biggest music event of summer , with both guitar and electronic acts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : homeland festival is now called hifi homelands festival , renamed hifi this year is a two-day event dedicated to dance music on the weekend of may 27-28 and attracts large crowds from london , which is a short trip from the festival 's site in winchester , hampshire . further north , the t in the park festival from july 8-9 is the scottish answer to glastonbury , while the big chill festival from august 4-6 has a growing reputation and expects a crowd of 29,000 people this year .
located next to a lake in a deer park in western england , the big chill combines nature with cutting edge music programming .

his face grave , benedict stood a few moments in prayer , removing his hat before bowing solemnly and placing a bowl containing a lighted candle before the grim wall . the 79-year-old pontiff then greeted a line of 32 survivors , men and women , who were waiting to meet him .
some grasped his hands warmly , some knelt to kiss his papal ring , many seemed eager to thank him for visiting the camp .
benedict clasped the hands of the first survivor waiting in line , a woman , wearing the striped scarf that polish political prisoners wore at the camp . passing down the line , an elderly polish man kissed the pope on both cheeks , a gypsy survivor of the camp pressed the pope 's hand to his lips .
henryk mandelbaum , 83 , wearing the distinctive striped cap of the sonderkommando - jewish prisoners who emptied the gas chambers where their fellow jews perished - kissed the papal ring .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an emotional visit the pope , who earlier said he would visit auschwitz camp as a " son of the german people , " was later expected to utter a prayer in german for the victims of nazi brutality .
first visit as pope benedict , a member of hitler youth as a teenager , afterwards descended into the bowels of the grim barracks to pray before a lighted candle in the cell where catholic priest maximilian kolbe died in 1941 .
kolbe had offered to take the place of a prisoner whom the nazis had sentenced to death by starvation . benedict , on the last day of a four-day visit to poland , was later to recite a speech expected to focus on reconciliation between germans and poles after more than 60 years of distrust caused by the german occupation of the country during world war ii . it was benedict 's third visit to auschwitz .
as joseph ratzinger , archbishop of munich , he accompanied the polish-born john paul ii during his first visit to the camp as pope in 1979 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 28.05.2006 german cabinet proposes surgery to doctor practice law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a doctor drain in the west , a doctor shortage in the east germany 's cabinet drafted a new law this week designed to ward off the doctor drain from parts of eastern germany . plenty of doctors are unemployed in germany , but even so , few of them are willing to work out in the country , or in eastern germany - where there 's long been a serious shortfall . with fewer and fewer doctors setting up rural practices , especially in the country 's more economically deprived areas , the last decade has seen local authorities desperately looking for ways to attract doctors to work in eastern germany 's clinics and countryside . previous suggestions have involved sending freshly minted doctors off to the boondocks for a compulsory year to counter the shortage , with the general consensus being that financial rewards are not enough to tempt the medics out of the cities . the trouble is that with the younger generation moving to urban centers in search of work , few ambitious young doctors are keen to either take over practices or set up new ones in areas where the patients ' average age is likely to be around 80 .
moreover , pay in eastern germany can be up to one-fifth less than in western parts of the country . liberalizing practitioner law by relaxing practitioner law , the government now hopes to counter the doctor shortage by allowing doctors to operate more than one practice , including outside the region where their license was acquired , and to hire colleagues to work for them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few doctors are willing to work in the middle of nowhere the new legislation would also allow doctors to divide their time between hospitals and private practices by blurring the line between outpatient and inpatient treatment . addressing another aspect of the problem , the cabinet also proposed throwing out the law preventing doctors over 55 from setting up practice and extending the retirement age beyond 68 , thereby making age restrictions more flexible in regions where the doctor shortage is particularly acute . stemming the doctor drain although the health ministry does not expect the law to usher in major changes , it hopes to stem the doctor drain in large swathes of the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many young doctors are put off by the prospect of mainly treating older people until now , general practitioners were not allowed to employ specialized colleagues unless they were registered as a group practice .
by suspending this restriction and permitting doctors both to open branches and hire other doctors , the reform is designed to encourage younger doctors - as well as women - who are keen to work on a part-time basis , to branch out in to outpatient treatment without taking on the risks of setting up a private practice . if it is approved by germany 's parliament , the law will be good news for depressed regions such as brandenburg and mecklenburg , where hospitals are obliged to hire doctors from abroad in the absence of german ones .
these meanwhile , are increasingly opting to head to britain and switzerland , lured by the promise of better salaries and conditions . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de doctors defect to blissful britain germany 's health system is a troubled soul .

moreover , pay in eastern germany can be up to one-fifth less than in western parts of the country . liberalizing practitioner law by relaxing practitioner law , the government now hopes to counter the doctor shortage by allowing doctors to operate more than one practice , including outside the region where their license was acquired , and to hire colleagues to work for them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few doctors are willing to work in the middle of nowhere the new legislation would also allow doctors to divide their time between hospitals and private practices by blurring the line between outpatient and inpatient treatment . addressing another aspect of the problem , the cabinet also proposed throwing out the law preventing doctors over 55 from setting up practice and extending the retirement age beyond 68 , thereby making age restrictions more flexible in regions where the doctor shortage is particularly acute . stemming the doctor drain although the health ministry does not expect the law to usher in major changes , it hopes to stem the doctor drain in large swathes of the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many young doctors are put off by the prospect of mainly treating older people until now , general practitioners were not allowed to employ specialized colleagues unless they were registered as a group practice .
by suspending this restriction and permitting doctors both to open branches and hire other doctors , the reform is designed to encourage younger doctors - as well as women - who are keen to work on a part-time basis , to branch out in to outpatient treatment without taking on the risks of setting up a private practice . if it is approved by germany 's parliament , the law will be good news for depressed regions such as brandenburg and mecklenburg , where hospitals are obliged to hire doctors from abroad in the absence of german ones .

moreover , pay in eastern germany can be up to one-fifth less than in western parts of the country . liberalizing practitioner law by relaxing practitioner law , the government now hopes to counter the doctor shortage by allowing doctors to operate more than one practice , including outside the region where their license was acquired , and to hire colleagues to work for them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few doctors are willing to work in the middle of nowhere the new legislation would also allow doctors to divide their time between hospitals and private practices by blurring the line between outpatient and inpatient treatment . addressing another aspect of the problem , the cabinet also proposed throwing out the law preventing doctors over 55 from setting up practice and extending the retirement age beyond 68 , thereby making age restrictions more flexible in regions where the doctor shortage is particularly acute . stemming the doctor drain although the health ministry does not expect the law to usher in major changes , it hopes to stem the doctor drain in large swathes of the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many young doctors are put off by the prospect of mainly treating older people until now , general practitioners were not allowed to employ specialized colleagues unless they were registered as a group practice .
by suspending this restriction and permitting doctors both to open branches and hire other doctors , the reform is designed to encourage younger doctors - as well as women - who are keen to work on a part-time basis , to branch out in to outpatient treatment without taking on the risks of setting up a private practice . if it is approved by germany 's parliament , the law will be good news for depressed regions such as brandenburg and mecklenburg , where hospitals are obliged to hire doctors from abroad in the absence of german ones .
these meanwhile , are increasingly opting to head to britain and switzerland , lured by the promise of better salaries and conditions . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de doctors defect to blissful britain germany 's health system is a troubled soul .

several people were injured during the clashes , among them german parliamentarian volker beck . volker beck of germany 's green party was one of the foreign activists who traveled to moscow in support of the city 's first-ever gay rights rally .
and he was among those who gathered in the city center on saturday even though authorities had banned the march . the activists were soon surrounded by dozens of religious and nationalist extremists , who chanted anti-gay slogans and tried to break up the gathering .
police units then moved on the crowd .
during the clashes that followed volker beck was punched in the face and slightly injured . " i was attacked by a neo-nazi .
first with a stone then with a fist , " he said .
" this incident clearly shows that gays are not safe in this country .
police failed to protect us , they even prevented us from escaping , so we were exposed to the dangerous situation without any protection . "
intolerance from mayor following the turmoil , the german politician was detained and only released after authorities recognized his parliamentary credentials .
police also arrested gay rights activist nikolai alekseyev , the driving force behind the march , along with other demonstrators who attempted to lay flowers on the tomb of the unknown soldier , just outside the kremlin walls .
several protesters who tried to break up the gay rally were also being held .

moscow 's mayor yuri luzkhov had warned that the event would " provoke outrage in society " because homosexuality was " not natural . "

moreover , pay in eastern germany can be up to one-fifth less than in western parts of the country . liberalizing practitioner law by relaxing practitioner law , the government now hopes to counter the doctor shortage by allowing doctors to operate more than one practice , including outside the region where their license was acquired , and to hire colleagues to work for them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few doctors are willing to work in the middle of nowhere the new legislation would also allow doctors to divide their time between hospitals and private practices by blurring the line between outpatient and inpatient treatment . addressing another aspect of the problem , the cabinet also proposed throwing out the law preventing doctors over 55 from setting up practice and extending the retirement age beyond 68 , thereby making age restrictions more flexible in regions where the doctor shortage is particularly acute . stemming the doctor drain although the health ministry does not expect the law to usher in major changes , it hopes to stem the doctor drain in large swathes of the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many young doctors are put off by the prospect of mainly treating older people until now , general practitioners were not allowed to employ specialized colleagues unless they were registered as a group practice .
by suspending this restriction and permitting doctors both to open branches and hire other doctors , the reform is designed to encourage younger doctors - as well as women - who are keen to work on a part-time basis , to branch out in to outpatient treatment without taking on the risks of setting up a private practice . if it is approved by germany 's parliament , the law will be good news for depressed regions such as brandenburg and mecklenburg , where hospitals are obliged to hire doctors from abroad in the absence of german ones .

moreover , pay in eastern germany can be up to one-fifth less than in western parts of the country . liberalizing practitioner law by relaxing practitioner law , the government now hopes to counter the doctor shortage by allowing doctors to operate more than one practice , including outside the region where their license was acquired , and to hire colleagues to work for them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few doctors are willing to work in the middle of nowhere the new legislation would also allow doctors to divide their time between hospitals and private practices by blurring the line between outpatient and inpatient treatment . addressing another aspect of the problem , the cabinet also proposed throwing out the law preventing doctors over 55 from setting up practice and extending the retirement age beyond 68 , thereby making age restrictions more flexible in regions where the doctor shortage is particularly acute . stemming the doctor drain although the health ministry does not expect the law to usher in major changes , it hopes to stem the doctor drain in large swathes of the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many young doctors are put off by the prospect of mainly treating older people until now , general practitioners were not allowed to employ specialized colleagues unless they were registered as a group practice .
by suspending this restriction and permitting doctors both to open branches and hire other doctors , the reform is designed to encourage younger doctors - as well as women - who are keen to work on a part-time basis , to branch out in to outpatient treatment without taking on the risks of setting up a private practice . if it is approved by germany 's parliament , the law will be good news for depressed regions such as brandenburg and mecklenburg , where hospitals are obliged to hire doctors from abroad in the absence of german ones .

torsten frings was also on target as luxembourg suffered a repeat of the 7-0 thrashing inflicted on them by germany ahead of the 1998 world cup . " it is good for us to overcome this hurdle in such convincing fashion , " said coach jürgen klinsmann .
" we told the strikers before the match that they would have a lot of chances and should take them .
they did just that and it was good for their confidence . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a party for germany 's fans while germany enjoyed a one-sided victory , france and the netherlands both had to settle for victories by a single goal in their matches against mexico and cameroon respectively . controversy surrounding barthez france had florent malouda to thank for their 1-0 victory at the stade de france in a match which saw zinedine zidane clock up 100 appearances for his country .
it was the veteran midfielder 's last match in paris , the scene of his finest hour eight years ago when his two headed goals inspired france to their world cup final victory over brazil .
malouda ensured it would be a happy farewell for zidane with a spectacular finish from a djibril cisse cross . the match was marred however by persistent jeers and whistles directed at french ' keeper fabien barthez .
barthez , who had earlier this week been the subject of a controversy at france 's world cup base that saw goalkeeping rival gregory coupet storm out of the team hotel only to return later , has never been popular with parisian fans .
at one point chants of ' coupet , coupet ' rang around the stadium to the disgust of members of the french squad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's florent malouda -lrb- l . -rrb- tackles franco guillermo of mexico " you just ca n't understand it , " said coach raymond domenech .
" the players were stunned .
it just does n't make any sense - we 're preparing for a world cup and that sort of thing happens .
you ca n't put it into words . "
nistelrooy shines there were no such controversies in rotterdam however , as the netherlands served notice that they could be one of the teams to watch in germany with a 1-0 win over the ' indomitable lions ' of cameroon . ruud van nistelrooy marked his 50th international appearance with the winning goal as the dutch downed the africans with some stylish football .
van nistelrooy , who is reported to be heading for the exit at manchester united after falling out with sir alex ferguson , gave a reminder of his eye for goal by finishing from close range on 23 minutes .
it was van nistelrooy 's 26th goal in half a century of appearances for the netherlands , a phenomenal strike rate that indicates why several leading clubs are likely to pounce if he is forced out of old trafford .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nistelrooy -lrb- r . -rrb- celebrates his goal against cameroon " at times we were very good , " said coach marco van basten .
" we should be satisfied with that because we played well against a quality side .
it did n't feel like a friendly match from a physical point of view . " holland face ivory coast , argentina and serbia-montenegro in group c of the world cup , and will have taken note of friendlies involving two of their first round opponents elsewhere saturday .
the ivory coast impressed after coming from behind to thwart switzerland with a 1-1 draw , while serbia-montenegro were held to an identical scoreline by uruguay in belgrade . in other friendlies involving world cup teams saturday , spain were held to a disappointing 0-0 draw against russia in albacete .
two of england 's first round opponents meanwhile , paraguay and trinidad and tobago , both struggled .
trinidad and tobago lost 2-1 to wales while paraguay were held to a 1-1 draw with denmark , who failed to qualify for the world cup . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup group games worth watching with 48 games kicking off over 15 days , the world cup group stage can leave even devout soccer fans wondering when to tune in and when to take a break .

but the electronic music scene has been fighting back with events of its own where vinyl and samplers rule . the undisputed leader is the sonar festival in barcelona , spain , which runs from june 15-17 . helped by the warm weather , the seaside location and the buzz of the city , the sonar organizers also consistently select a line up of big name djs and the most exciting breakthrough acts . expect electronica , hip hop and techno with appearances by london-based goldfrapp and legendary producer dj shadow expected to be major draws during the three-day event . disco is n ot dead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whoever said that disco dancing was passe ?
" there are two main focuses this year , " said enric palau , one of the three co-founders of the event , which began in 1994 . " one is the ' the year of japan ' event with 20 artists from japan including hip hop , breakbeat and beatboxing people , " he said .
" the second is ' black music . '
we would n't have electronic music without disco or the first samples of rap .
and reggae has been important for the minimal techno of today . " about 80,000 to 90,000 people attended last year and the same number are expected on the sonar site this year . " barcelona is the perfect environment for the festival , " palau said .
" the work we do has helped position barcelona on the map for cultural and music events . " europe goes electro n ic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hey ms. dj , pump up the jam !
elsewhere in spain , the benicassim festival from july 20-23 features both guitar and electronic acts and draws big crowds for four days of dancing under the sometimes unrelenting spanish sun . in france , the nuits sonores festival in lyon is already winning plaudits as a gallic rival to spain 's sonar despite this year being only the fourth edition . unlike sonar , however , which is concentrated on one site , nuits sonores infiltrates the whole of the unesco-listed city of lyon with performances in 50 different locations .
a warehouse at the confluence of the two rivers in lyon , the rhone and the saone , serves as the focal point of the festival which runs from may 24-28 and which attracted 40,000-50,000 visitors last year . " it 's a panorama of electronic music with all styles represented , " said 35-year-old vincent carry , one of three co-founders from the city .
" the line-up goes from techno house to breakbeat and electroclash .
the comparison with sonar is made by a lot of people .
artistically , we have a lot in common with them . " from belgium to berli n a n d beyo n d in neighboring belgium , the summer festival season is rich and diverse with the electronic scene led by the 10 days off event from july 14-24 as part of the giant gentse feesten , which takes over the picturesque town of ghent in july . " i think gentse feesten is the biggest city festival in europe , " said phillip de liser , an organizer of 10 days off .
" about two million people came last year . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berlin love parade was cancelled in 2004 due to lack of funds he underlined the influence of berlin on the electronic music scene in europe at the moment .
berliners or international djs based in berlin are set to be an important draw for this year 's festival . " the best electronic music is coming from berlin at the moment , " de liser said .
" berlin is really the capital for electronic music at the moment .
it is n't london anymore . " berlin itself hosts the popkomm electronic festival from september 20-22 which hosted 1,200 artists in 20 clubs in 2005 . in the middle of the summer , the berlin love parade on july 15 will could again bring over a million people onto the streets of the formerly divided city for a day of hedonism and ear-popping dance music .
the city of cologne in western germany , the other hotspot for german electronic music , livens up when the c / o pop festival gets underway on august 23-27 . uk still big o n festivals in britain , the glastonbury festival from june 22-24 continues to be the biggest music event of summer , with both guitar and electronic acts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : homeland festival is now called hifi homelands festival , renamed hifi this year is a two-day event dedicated to dance music on the weekend of may 27-28 and attracts large crowds from london , which is a short trip from the festival 's site in winchester , hampshire . further north , the t in the park festival from july 8-9 is the scottish answer to glastonbury , while the big chill festival from august 4-6 has a growing reputation and expects a crowd of 29,000 people this year .

it was the veteran midfielder 's last match in paris , the scene of his finest hour eight years ago when his two headed goals inspired france to their world cup final victory over brazil .

van nistelrooy , who is reported to be heading for the exit at manchester united after falling out with sir alex ferguson , gave a reminder of his eye for goal by finishing from close range on 23 minutes .

van nistelrooy , who is reported to be heading for the exit at manchester united after falling out with sir alex ferguson , gave a reminder of his eye for goal by finishing from close range on 23 minutes .
it was van nistelrooy 's 26th goal in half a century of appearances for the netherlands , a phenomenal strike rate that indicates why several leading clubs are likely to pounce if he is forced out of old trafford .

-lrb- 2156 cet -rrb- on saturday night .
the first train to travel through the underground tunnel of the station , which took 11 years to complete , half an hour later . plans for the capital 's central station were made shortly after the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 , and the opening come just in time to accommodate football fans from around europe two weeks ahead of the football world cup 2006 championships kicking off in munich on june 9 . the station was originally meant to be known as lehrter bahnhof but has had a name change to indicate that it is the once divided city 's main station .
for the first time , the capital 's rail network in the south and north is now linked to its counterpart in the east and west .
aids scare the long-awaited opening was marred by an incident on friday night in which a drunken youth slashed at least 31 people with a knife just after a fireworks display at the station ended .
the 16-year-old attacked passersby at random , cutting them in the back and on the face , on a street near the reichstag , home of germany 's parliament .
he was caught and arrested around 15 minutes later .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the teenager already had a police record for assault and vandalism police said it was the worst attack of its kind yet in berlin .
chancellor angela merkel described it as " a horrible event . " the rampage unleashed an aids scare as one of the victims was hiv positive , and there are fears that others may have been infected with the virus by contaminated blood on the knife .
by sunday midday , 56 people , including medics , had contacted berlin clinics to be treated after having possibly contracted the disease .
a spokeswoman for the charite university clinic said the victims ' chances of communicating hiv were very low .
the likelihood of infection through knife wounds was one to 300 , she told reuters .
fears for world cup interior minister wolfgang schäuble sought to calm fears that security at the world 's biggest soccer event was at risk , telling ard television that the " tragic event had nothing to do with the world cup . " " nobody should worry about security during the world cup , everything that can be done to minimize the risk has been done and is being done , " he added . but a recent spate of brutal attacks blamed on far-right-wingers has caused concern for the safety of foreign visitors .
it has also sparked a heated debate about whether germany has a growing problem with racism and xenophobia , especially in the former communist east of the country . last weekend a politician of turkish origin was beaten and slashed with a broken bottle in lichtenberg , a suburb of berlin known as a neo-nazi stronghold . a government report released two days later found that right-wing violence increased by 23 percent in 2005 . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de teenage knifeman wounds 28 in berlin a 16-year-old youth armed with a knife wounded 28 people in a late-night rampage in downtown berlin , leaving one victim fighting for life in hospital , police said early saturday .

his face grave , benedict stood a few moments in prayer , removing his hat before bowing solemnly and placing a bowl containing a lighted candle before the grim wall . the 79-year-old pontiff then greeted a line of 32 survivors , men and women , who were waiting to meet him .
some grasped his hands warmly , some knelt to kiss his papal ring , many seemed eager to thank him for visiting the camp .
benedict clasped the hands of the first survivor waiting in line , a woman , wearing the striped scarf that polish political prisoners wore at the camp . passing down the line , an elderly polish man kissed the pope on both cheeks , a gypsy survivor of the camp pressed the pope 's hand to his lips .
henryk mandelbaum , 83 , wearing the distinctive striped cap of the sonderkommando - jewish prisoners who emptied the gas chambers where their fellow jews perished - kissed the papal ring .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an emotional visit the pope , who earlier said he would visit auschwitz camp as a " son of the german people , " was later expected to utter a prayer in german for the victims of nazi brutality .
first visit as pope benedict , a member of hitler youth as a teenager , afterwards descended into the bowels of the grim barracks to pray before a lighted candle in the cell where catholic priest maximilian kolbe died in 1941 .
kolbe had offered to take the place of a prisoner whom the nazis had sentenced to death by starvation . benedict , on the last day of a four-day visit to poland , was later to recite a speech expected to focus on reconciliation between germans and poles after more than 60 years of distrust caused by the german occupation of the country during world war ii . it was benedict 's third visit to auschwitz .
as joseph ratzinger , archbishop of munich , he accompanied the polish-born john paul ii during his first visit to the camp as pope in 1979 .
a year later , he came as part of a delegation of german bishops .
told poles to hold fast earlier sunday the pontiff urged nearly one million poles at a giant mass in krakow to fight growing secularism by spreading their christian faith across europe and the world .
benedict called on the people of europe 's most roman catholic country " to share with other people of europe and the world the treasure of your faith . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benedict 's predecessor , john paul ii visited auschwitz in 1979 poland became " a place of special witness to the faith " when benedict 's predecessor john paul ii was elected pope in 1978 , he said in his homily during the nearly three-hour mass in a park in the southern city . " you were called to give this witness before the world , " the pontiff said , adding that poland 's strong catholicism had become " perhaps even more urgent than ever " with the death of john paul ii last year . ahead of the expected solemnity of the auschwitz visit , the morning mass was a joyous celebration of benedict 's visit .
the 900,000 turnout was the biggest since the pontiff began a pilgrimage in the footsteps of john paul ii on thursday , surpassing the 600,000 young people who flocked to the park the night before to join him for a prayer meeting .
tens of thousands had camped out overnight in tents or lay on the ground in sleeping bags in the 48-hectare -lrb- 119-acre -rrb- field .
bastion of roman catholicism the pontiff was welcomed to the blonia park with hymns , cheers and shouts of joy as his popemobile slowly made its way through the dense crowd before he celebrated mass on a giant , flower-bedecked altar .

-lrb- 2156 cet -rrb- on saturday night .
the first train to travel through the underground tunnel of the station , which took 11 years to complete , half an hour later . plans for the capital 's central station were made shortly after the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 , and the opening come just in time to accommodate football fans from around europe two weeks ahead of the football world cup 2006 championships kicking off in munich on june 9 . the station was originally meant to be known as lehrter bahnhof but has had a name change to indicate that it is the once divided city 's main station .
for the first time , the capital 's rail network in the south and north is now linked to its counterpart in the east and west .
aids scare the long-awaited opening was marred by an incident on friday night in which a drunken youth slashed at least 31 people with a knife just after a fireworks display at the station ended .
the 16-year-old attacked passersby at random , cutting them in the back and on the face , on a street near the reichstag , home of germany 's parliament .
he was caught and arrested around 15 minutes later .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the teenager already had a police record for assault and vandalism police said it was the worst attack of its kind yet in berlin .
chancellor angela merkel described it as " a horrible event . " the rampage unleashed an aids scare as one of the victims was hiv positive , and there are fears that others may have been infected with the virus by contaminated blood on the knife .
by sunday midday , 56 people , including medics , had contacted berlin clinics to be treated after having possibly contracted the disease .
a spokeswoman for the charite university clinic said the victims ' chances of communicating hiv were very low .
the likelihood of infection through knife wounds was one to 300 , she told reuters .
fears for world cup interior minister wolfgang schäuble sought to calm fears that security at the world 's biggest soccer event was at risk , telling ard television that the " tragic event had nothing to do with the world cup . " " nobody should worry about security during the world cup , everything that can be done to minimize the risk has been done and is being done , " he added . but a recent spate of brutal attacks blamed on far-right-wingers has caused concern for the safety of foreign visitors .
it has also sparked a heated debate about whether germany has a growing problem with racism and xenophobia , especially in the former communist east of the country . last weekend a politician of turkish origin was beaten and slashed with a broken bottle in lichtenberg , a suburb of berlin known as a neo-nazi stronghold . a government report released two days later found that right-wing violence increased by 23 percent in 2005 . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de teenage knifeman wounds 28 in berlin a 16-year-old youth armed with a knife wounded 28 people in a late-night rampage in downtown berlin , leaving one victim fighting for life in hospital , police said early saturday .

torsten frings was also on target as luxembourg suffered a repeat of the 7-0 thrashing inflicted on them by germany ahead of the 1998 world cup . " it is good for us to overcome this hurdle in such convincing fashion , " said coach jürgen klinsmann .
" we told the strikers before the match that they would have a lot of chances and should take them .
they did just that and it was good for their confidence . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a party for germany 's fans while germany enjoyed a one-sided victory , france and the netherlands both had to settle for victories by a single goal in their matches against mexico and cameroon respectively . controversy surrounding barthez france had florent malouda to thank for their 1-0 victory at the stade de france in a match which saw zinedine zidane clock up 100 appearances for his country .
it was the veteran midfielder 's last match in paris , the scene of his finest hour eight years ago when his two headed goals inspired france to their world cup final victory over brazil .
malouda ensured it would be a happy farewell for zidane with a spectacular finish from a djibril cisse cross . the match was marred however by persistent jeers and whistles directed at french ' keeper fabien barthez .
barthez , who had earlier this week been the subject of a controversy at france 's world cup base that saw goalkeeping rival gregory coupet storm out of the team hotel only to return later , has never been popular with parisian fans .
at one point chants of ' coupet , coupet ' rang around the stadium to the disgust of members of the french squad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's florent malouda -lrb- l . -rrb- tackles franco guillermo of mexico " you just ca n't understand it , " said coach raymond domenech .
" the players were stunned .
it just does n't make any sense - we 're preparing for a world cup and that sort of thing happens .
you ca n't put it into words . "
nistelrooy shines there were no such controversies in rotterdam however , as the netherlands served notice that they could be one of the teams to watch in germany with a 1-0 win over the ' indomitable lions ' of cameroon . ruud van nistelrooy marked his 50th international appearance with the winning goal as the dutch downed the africans with some stylish football .
van nistelrooy , who is reported to be heading for the exit at manchester united after falling out with sir alex ferguson , gave a reminder of his eye for goal by finishing from close range on 23 minutes .
it was van nistelrooy 's 26th goal in half a century of appearances for the netherlands , a phenomenal strike rate that indicates why several leading clubs are likely to pounce if he is forced out of old trafford .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nistelrooy -lrb- r . -rrb- celebrates his goal against cameroon " at times we were very good , " said coach marco van basten .
" we should be satisfied with that because we played well against a quality side .
it did n't feel like a friendly match from a physical point of view . " holland face ivory coast , argentina and serbia-montenegro in group c of the world cup , and will have taken note of friendlies involving two of their first round opponents elsewhere saturday .
the ivory coast impressed after coming from behind to thwart switzerland with a 1-1 draw , while serbia-montenegro were held to an identical scoreline by uruguay in belgrade . in other friendlies involving world cup teams saturday , spain were held to a disappointing 0-0 draw against russia in albacete .
two of england 's first round opponents meanwhile , paraguay and trinidad and tobago , both struggled .
trinidad and tobago lost 2-1 to wales while paraguay were held to a 1-1 draw with denmark , who failed to qualify for the world cup . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup group games worth watching with 48 games kicking off over 15 days , the world cup group stage can leave even devout soccer fans wondering when to tune in and when to take a break .

moreover , pay in eastern germany can be up to one-fifth less than in western parts of the country . liberalizing practitioner law by relaxing practitioner law , the government now hopes to counter the doctor shortage by allowing doctors to operate more than one practice , including outside the region where their license was acquired , and to hire colleagues to work for them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few doctors are willing to work in the middle of nowhere the new legislation would also allow doctors to divide their time between hospitals and private practices by blurring the line between outpatient and inpatient treatment . addressing another aspect of the problem , the cabinet also proposed throwing out the law preventing doctors over 55 from setting up practice and extending the retirement age beyond 68 , thereby making age restrictions more flexible in regions where the doctor shortage is particularly acute . stemming the doctor drain although the health ministry does not expect the law to usher in major changes , it hopes to stem the doctor drain in large swathes of the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many young doctors are put off by the prospect of mainly treating older people until now , general practitioners were not allowed to employ specialized colleagues unless they were registered as a group practice .
by suspending this restriction and permitting doctors both to open branches and hire other doctors , the reform is designed to encourage younger doctors - as well as women - who are keen to work on a part-time basis , to branch out in to outpatient treatment without taking on the risks of setting up a private practice . if it is approved by germany 's parliament , the law will be good news for depressed regions such as brandenburg and mecklenburg , where hospitals are obliged to hire doctors from abroad in the absence of german ones .

but the electronic music scene has been fighting back with events of its own where vinyl and samplers rule . the undisputed leader is the sonar festival in barcelona , spain , which runs from june 15-17 . helped by the warm weather , the seaside location and the buzz of the city , the sonar organizers also consistently select a line up of big name djs and the most exciting breakthrough acts . expect electronica , hip hop and techno with appearances by london-based goldfrapp and legendary producer dj shadow expected to be major draws during the three-day event . disco is n ot dead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whoever said that disco dancing was passe ?
" there are two main focuses this year , " said enric palau , one of the three co-founders of the event , which began in 1994 . " one is the ' the year of japan ' event with 20 artists from japan including hip hop , breakbeat and beatboxing people , " he said .
" the second is ' black music . '
we would n't have electronic music without disco or the first samples of rap .
and reggae has been important for the minimal techno of today . " about 80,000 to 90,000 people attended last year and the same number are expected on the sonar site this year . " barcelona is the perfect environment for the festival , " palau said .
" the work we do has helped position barcelona on the map for cultural and music events . " europe goes electro n ic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hey ms. dj , pump up the jam !
elsewhere in spain , the benicassim festival from july 20-23 features both guitar and electronic acts and draws big crowds for four days of dancing under the sometimes unrelenting spanish sun . in france , the nuits sonores festival in lyon is already winning plaudits as a gallic rival to spain 's sonar despite this year being only the fourth edition . unlike sonar , however , which is concentrated on one site , nuits sonores infiltrates the whole of the unesco-listed city of lyon with performances in 50 different locations .
a warehouse at the confluence of the two rivers in lyon , the rhone and the saone , serves as the focal point of the festival which runs from may 24-28 and which attracted 40,000-50,000 visitors last year . " it 's a panorama of electronic music with all styles represented , " said 35-year-old vincent carry , one of three co-founders from the city .
" the line-up goes from techno house to breakbeat and electroclash .
the comparison with sonar is made by a lot of people .
artistically , we have a lot in common with them . " from belgium to berli n a n d beyo n d in neighboring belgium , the summer festival season is rich and diverse with the electronic scene led by the 10 days off event from july 14-24 as part of the giant gentse feesten , which takes over the picturesque town of ghent in july . " i think gentse feesten is the biggest city festival in europe , " said phillip de liser , an organizer of 10 days off .
" about two million people came last year . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berlin love parade was cancelled in 2004 due to lack of funds he underlined the influence of berlin on the electronic music scene in europe at the moment .
berliners or international djs based in berlin are set to be an important draw for this year 's festival . " the best electronic music is coming from berlin at the moment , " de liser said .
" berlin is really the capital for electronic music at the moment .
it is n't london anymore . " berlin itself hosts the popkomm electronic festival from september 20-22 which hosted 1,200 artists in 20 clubs in 2005 . in the middle of the summer , the berlin love parade on july 15 will could again bring over a million people onto the streets of the formerly divided city for a day of hedonism and ear-popping dance music .
the city of cologne in western germany , the other hotspot for german electronic music , livens up when the c / o pop festival gets underway on august 23-27 . uk still big o n festivals in britain , the glastonbury festival from june 22-24 continues to be the biggest music event of summer , with both guitar and electronic acts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : homeland festival is now called hifi homelands festival , renamed hifi this year is a two-day event dedicated to dance music on the weekend of may 27-28 and attracts large crowds from london , which is a short trip from the festival 's site in winchester , hampshire . further north , the t in the park festival from july 8-9 is the scottish answer to glastonbury , while the big chill festival from august 4-6 has a growing reputation and expects a crowd of 29,000 people this year .
located next to a lake in a deer park in western england , the big chill combines nature with cutting edge music programming .

several people were injured during the clashes , among them german parliamentarian volker beck . volker beck of germany 's green party was one of the foreign activists who traveled to moscow in support of the city 's first-ever gay rights rally .
and he was among those who gathered in the city center on saturday even though authorities had banned the march . the activists were soon surrounded by dozens of religious and nationalist extremists , who chanted anti-gay slogans and tried to break up the gathering .
police units then moved on the crowd .
during the clashes that followed volker beck was punched in the face and slightly injured . " i was attacked by a neo-nazi .
first with a stone then with a fist , " he said .

he also claimed that 99 percent of the people in moscow were supportive of the ban . homosexuality was considered a crime in russia until 1993 and a mental illness until 1999 .
even today same-sex couples almost never make a public display of their affection .

moreover , pay in eastern germany can be up to one-fifth less than in western parts of the country . liberalizing practitioner law by relaxing practitioner law , the government now hopes to counter the doctor shortage by allowing doctors to operate more than one practice , including outside the region where their license was acquired , and to hire colleagues to work for them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few doctors are willing to work in the middle of nowhere the new legislation would also allow doctors to divide their time between hospitals and private practices by blurring the line between outpatient and inpatient treatment . addressing another aspect of the problem , the cabinet also proposed throwing out the law preventing doctors over 55 from setting up practice and extending the retirement age beyond 68 , thereby making age restrictions more flexible in regions where the doctor shortage is particularly acute . stemming the doctor drain although the health ministry does not expect the law to usher in major changes , it hopes to stem the doctor drain in large swathes of the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many young doctors are put off by the prospect of mainly treating older people until now , general practitioners were not allowed to employ specialized colleagues unless they were registered as a group practice .
by suspending this restriction and permitting doctors both to open branches and hire other doctors , the reform is designed to encourage younger doctors - as well as women - who are keen to work on a part-time basis , to branch out in to outpatient treatment without taking on the risks of setting up a private practice . if it is approved by germany 's parliament , the law will be good news for depressed regions such as brandenburg and mecklenburg , where hospitals are obliged to hire doctors from abroad in the absence of german ones .
these meanwhile , are increasingly opting to head to britain and switzerland , lured by the promise of better salaries and conditions . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de doctors defect to blissful britain germany 's health system is a troubled soul .

moreover , pay in eastern germany can be up to one-fifth less than in western parts of the country . liberalizing practitioner law by relaxing practitioner law , the government now hopes to counter the doctor shortage by allowing doctors to operate more than one practice , including outside the region where their license was acquired , and to hire colleagues to work for them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few doctors are willing to work in the middle of nowhere the new legislation would also allow doctors to divide their time between hospitals and private practices by blurring the line between outpatient and inpatient treatment . addressing another aspect of the problem , the cabinet also proposed throwing out the law preventing doctors over 55 from setting up practice and extending the retirement age beyond 68 , thereby making age restrictions more flexible in regions where the doctor shortage is particularly acute . stemming the doctor drain although the health ministry does not expect the law to usher in major changes , it hopes to stem the doctor drain in large swathes of the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many young doctors are put off by the prospect of mainly treating older people until now , general practitioners were not allowed to employ specialized colleagues unless they were registered as a group practice .
by suspending this restriction and permitting doctors both to open branches and hire other doctors , the reform is designed to encourage younger doctors - as well as women - who are keen to work on a part-time basis , to branch out in to outpatient treatment without taking on the risks of setting up a private practice . if it is approved by germany 's parliament , the law will be good news for depressed regions such as brandenburg and mecklenburg , where hospitals are obliged to hire doctors from abroad in the absence of german ones .

the winces of pain elicited by the financial incision of reform may be beginning to fade , but the laments of young doctors are growing louder and many are leaving for britain .

moreover , pay in eastern germany can be up to one-fifth less than in western parts of the country . liberalizing practitioner law by relaxing practitioner law , the government now hopes to counter the doctor shortage by allowing doctors to operate more than one practice , including outside the region where their license was acquired , and to hire colleagues to work for them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few doctors are willing to work in the middle of nowhere the new legislation would also allow doctors to divide their time between hospitals and private practices by blurring the line between outpatient and inpatient treatment . addressing another aspect of the problem , the cabinet also proposed throwing out the law preventing doctors over 55 from setting up practice and extending the retirement age beyond 68 , thereby making age restrictions more flexible in regions where the doctor shortage is particularly acute . stemming the doctor drain although the health ministry does not expect the law to usher in major changes , it hopes to stem the doctor drain in large swathes of the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many young doctors are put off by the prospect of mainly treating older people until now , general practitioners were not allowed to employ specialized colleagues unless they were registered as a group practice .
by suspending this restriction and permitting doctors both to open branches and hire other doctors , the reform is designed to encourage younger doctors - as well as women - who are keen to work on a part-time basis , to branch out in to outpatient treatment without taking on the risks of setting up a private practice . if it is approved by germany 's parliament , the law will be good news for depressed regions such as brandenburg and mecklenburg , where hospitals are obliged to hire doctors from abroad in the absence of german ones .
these meanwhile , are increasingly opting to head to britain and switzerland , lured by the promise of better salaries and conditions . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de doctors defect to blissful britain germany 's health system is a troubled soul .

torsten frings was also on target as luxembourg suffered a repeat of the 7-0 thrashing inflicted on them by germany ahead of the 1998 world cup . " it is good for us to overcome this hurdle in such convincing fashion , " said coach jürgen klinsmann .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a party for germany 's fans while germany enjoyed a one-sided victory , france and the netherlands both had to settle for victories by a single goal in their matches against mexico and cameroon respectively . controversy surrounding barthez france had florent malouda to thank for their 1-0 victory at the stade de france in a match which saw zinedine zidane clock up 100 appearances for his country .
it was the veteran midfielder 's last match in paris , the scene of his finest hour eight years ago when his two headed goals inspired france to their world cup final victory over brazil .
malouda ensured it would be a happy farewell for zidane with a spectacular finish from a djibril cisse cross . the match was marred however by persistent jeers and whistles directed at french ' keeper fabien barthez .
barthez , who had earlier this week been the subject of a controversy at france 's world cup base that saw goalkeeping rival gregory coupet storm out of the team hotel only to return later , has never been popular with parisian fans .
at one point chants of ' coupet , coupet ' rang around the stadium to the disgust of members of the french squad .

nistelrooy shines there were no such controversies in rotterdam however , as the netherlands served notice that they could be one of the teams to watch in germany with a 1-0 win over the ' indomitable lions ' of cameroon . ruud van nistelrooy marked his 50th international appearance with the winning goal as the dutch downed the africans with some stylish football .
van nistelrooy , who is reported to be heading for the exit at manchester united after falling out with sir alex ferguson , gave a reminder of his eye for goal by finishing from close range on 23 minutes .
it was van nistelrooy 's 26th goal in half a century of appearances for the netherlands , a phenomenal strike rate that indicates why several leading clubs are likely to pounce if he is forced out of old trafford .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nistelrooy -lrb- r . -rrb- celebrates his goal against cameroon " at times we were very good , " said coach marco van basten .

moreover , pay in eastern germany can be up to one-fifth less than in western parts of the country . liberalizing practitioner law by relaxing practitioner law , the government now hopes to counter the doctor shortage by allowing doctors to operate more than one practice , including outside the region where their license was acquired , and to hire colleagues to work for them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few doctors are willing to work in the middle of nowhere the new legislation would also allow doctors to divide their time between hospitals and private practices by blurring the line between outpatient and inpatient treatment . addressing another aspect of the problem , the cabinet also proposed throwing out the law preventing doctors over 55 from setting up practice and extending the retirement age beyond 68 , thereby making age restrictions more flexible in regions where the doctor shortage is particularly acute . stemming the doctor drain although the health ministry does not expect the law to usher in major changes , it hopes to stem the doctor drain in large swathes of the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many young doctors are put off by the prospect of mainly treating older people until now , general practitioners were not allowed to employ specialized colleagues unless they were registered as a group practice .
by suspending this restriction and permitting doctors both to open branches and hire other doctors , the reform is designed to encourage younger doctors - as well as women - who are keen to work on a part-time basis , to branch out in to outpatient treatment without taking on the risks of setting up a private practice . if it is approved by germany 's parliament , the law will be good news for depressed regions such as brandenburg and mecklenburg , where hospitals are obliged to hire doctors from abroad in the absence of german ones .

-lrb- 2156 cet -rrb- on saturday night .
the first train to travel through the underground tunnel of the station , which took 11 years to complete , half an hour later . plans for the capital 's central station were made shortly after the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 , and the opening come just in time to accommodate football fans from around europe two weeks ahead of the football world cup 2006 championships kicking off in munich on june 9 . the station was originally meant to be known as lehrter bahnhof but has had a name change to indicate that it is the once divided city 's main station .
for the first time , the capital 's rail network in the south and north is now linked to its counterpart in the east and west .
aids scare the long-awaited opening was marred by an incident on friday night in which a drunken youth slashed at least 31 people with a knife just after a fireworks display at the station ended .
the 16-year-old attacked passersby at random , cutting them in the back and on the face , on a street near the reichstag , home of germany 's parliament .
he was caught and arrested around 15 minutes later .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the teenager already had a police record for assault and vandalism police said it was the worst attack of its kind yet in berlin .
chancellor angela merkel described it as " a horrible event . " the rampage unleashed an aids scare as one of the victims was hiv positive , and there are fears that others may have been infected with the virus by contaminated blood on the knife .
by sunday midday , 56 people , including medics , had contacted berlin clinics to be treated after having possibly contracted the disease .
a spokeswoman for the charite university clinic said the victims ' chances of communicating hiv were very low .
the likelihood of infection through knife wounds was one to 300 , she told reuters .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a party for germany 's fans while germany enjoyed a one-sided victory , france and the netherlands both had to settle for victories by a single goal in their matches against mexico and cameroon respectively . controversy surrounding barthez france had florent malouda to thank for their 1-0 victory at the stade de france in a match which saw zinedine zidane clock up 100 appearances for his country .
it was the veteran midfielder 's last match in paris , the scene of his finest hour eight years ago when his two headed goals inspired france to their world cup final victory over brazil .
malouda ensured it would be a happy farewell for zidane with a spectacular finish from a djibril cisse cross . the match was marred however by persistent jeers and whistles directed at french ' keeper fabien barthez .
barthez , who had earlier this week been the subject of a controversy at france 's world cup base that saw goalkeeping rival gregory coupet storm out of the team hotel only to return later , has never been popular with parisian fans .
at one point chants of ' coupet , coupet ' rang around the stadium to the disgust of members of the french squad .

van nistelrooy , who is reported to be heading for the exit at manchester united after falling out with sir alex ferguson , gave a reminder of his eye for goal by finishing from close range on 23 minutes .
it was van nistelrooy 's 26th goal in half a century of appearances for the netherlands , a phenomenal strike rate that indicates why several leading clubs are likely to pounce if he is forced out of old trafford .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nistelrooy -lrb- r . -rrb- celebrates his goal against cameroon " at times we were very good , " said coach marco van basten .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a party for germany 's fans while germany enjoyed a one-sided victory , france and the netherlands both had to settle for victories by a single goal in their matches against mexico and cameroon respectively . controversy surrounding barthez france had florent malouda to thank for their 1-0 victory at the stade de france in a match which saw zinedine zidane clock up 100 appearances for his country .
it was the veteran midfielder 's last match in paris , the scene of his finest hour eight years ago when his two headed goals inspired france to their world cup final victory over brazil .
malouda ensured it would be a happy farewell for zidane with a spectacular finish from a djibril cisse cross . the match was marred however by persistent jeers and whistles directed at french ' keeper fabien barthez .
barthez , who had earlier this week been the subject of a controversy at france 's world cup base that saw goalkeeping rival gregory coupet storm out of the team hotel only to return later , has never been popular with parisian fans .
at one point chants of ' coupet , coupet ' rang around the stadium to the disgust of members of the french squad .

nistelrooy shines there were no such controversies in rotterdam however , as the netherlands served notice that they could be one of the teams to watch in germany with a 1-0 win over the ' indomitable lions ' of cameroon . ruud van nistelrooy marked his 50th international appearance with the winning goal as the dutch downed the africans with some stylish football .
van nistelrooy , who is reported to be heading for the exit at manchester united after falling out with sir alex ferguson , gave a reminder of his eye for goal by finishing from close range on 23 minutes .
it was van nistelrooy 's 26th goal in half a century of appearances for the netherlands , a phenomenal strike rate that indicates why several leading clubs are likely to pounce if he is forced out of old trafford .

moreover , pay in eastern germany can be up to one-fifth less than in western parts of the country . liberalizing practitioner law by relaxing practitioner law , the government now hopes to counter the doctor shortage by allowing doctors to operate more than one practice , including outside the region where their license was acquired , and to hire colleagues to work for them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few doctors are willing to work in the middle of nowhere the new legislation would also allow doctors to divide their time between hospitals and private practices by blurring the line between outpatient and inpatient treatment . addressing another aspect of the problem , the cabinet also proposed throwing out the law preventing doctors over 55 from setting up practice and extending the retirement age beyond 68 , thereby making age restrictions more flexible in regions where the doctor shortage is particularly acute . stemming the doctor drain although the health ministry does not expect the law to usher in major changes , it hopes to stem the doctor drain in large swathes of the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many young doctors are put off by the prospect of mainly treating older people until now , general practitioners were not allowed to employ specialized colleagues unless they were registered as a group practice .
by suspending this restriction and permitting doctors both to open branches and hire other doctors , the reform is designed to encourage younger doctors - as well as women - who are keen to work on a part-time basis , to branch out in to outpatient treatment without taking on the risks of setting up a private practice . if it is approved by germany 's parliament , the law will be good news for depressed regions such as brandenburg and mecklenburg , where hospitals are obliged to hire doctors from abroad in the absence of german ones .
these meanwhile , are increasingly opting to head to britain and switzerland , lured by the promise of better salaries and conditions . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de doctors defect to blissful britain germany 's health system is a troubled soul .
the winces of pain elicited by the financial incision of reform may be beginning to fade , but the laments of young doctors are growing louder and many are leaving for britain .

the 900,000 turnout was the biggest since the pontiff began a pilgrimage in the footsteps of john paul ii on thursday , surpassing the 600,000 young people who flocked to the park the night before to join him for a prayer meeting .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 28.05.2006 german cabinet proposes surgery to doctor practice law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a doctor drain in the west , a doctor shortage in the east germany 's cabinet drafted a new law this week designed to ward off the doctor drain from parts of eastern germany . plenty of doctors are unemployed in germany , but even so , few of them are willing to work out in the country , or in eastern germany - where there 's long been a serious shortfall . with fewer and fewer doctors setting up rural practices , especially in the country 's more economically deprived areas , the last decade has seen local authorities desperately looking for ways to attract doctors to work in eastern germany 's clinics and countryside . previous suggestions have involved sending freshly minted doctors off to the boondocks for a compulsory year to counter the shortage , with the general consensus being that financial rewards are not enough to tempt the medics out of the cities . the trouble is that with the younger generation moving to urban centers in search of work , few ambitious young doctors are keen to either take over practices or set up new ones in areas where the patients ' average age is likely to be around 80 .
moreover , pay in eastern germany can be up to one-fifth less than in western parts of the country . liberalizing practitioner law by relaxing practitioner law , the government now hopes to counter the doctor shortage by allowing doctors to operate more than one practice , including outside the region where their license was acquired , and to hire colleagues to work for them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few doctors are willing to work in the middle of nowhere the new legislation would also allow doctors to divide their time between hospitals and private practices by blurring the line between outpatient and inpatient treatment . addressing another aspect of the problem , the cabinet also proposed throwing out the law preventing doctors over 55 from setting up practice and extending the retirement age beyond 68 , thereby making age restrictions more flexible in regions where the doctor shortage is particularly acute . stemming the doctor drain although the health ministry does not expect the law to usher in major changes , it hopes to stem the doctor drain in large swathes of the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many young doctors are put off by the prospect of mainly treating older people until now , general practitioners were not allowed to employ specialized colleagues unless they were registered as a group practice .
by suspending this restriction and permitting doctors both to open branches and hire other doctors , the reform is designed to encourage younger doctors - as well as women - who are keen to work on a part-time basis , to branch out in to outpatient treatment without taking on the risks of setting up a private practice . if it is approved by germany 's parliament , the law will be good news for depressed regions such as brandenburg and mecklenburg , where hospitals are obliged to hire doctors from abroad in the absence of german ones .
these meanwhile , are increasingly opting to head to britain and switzerland , lured by the promise of better salaries and conditions . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de doctors defect to blissful britain germany 's health system is a troubled soul .
the winces of pain elicited by the financial incision of reform may be beginning to fade , but the laments of young doctors are growing louder and many are leaving for britain .

his face grave , benedict stood a few moments in prayer , removing his hat before bowing solemnly and placing a bowl containing a lighted candle before the grim wall . the 79-year-old pontiff then greeted a line of 32 survivors , men and women , who were waiting to meet him .
some grasped his hands warmly , some knelt to kiss his papal ring , many seemed eager to thank him for visiting the camp .
benedict clasped the hands of the first survivor waiting in line , a woman , wearing the striped scarf that polish political prisoners wore at the camp . passing down the line , an elderly polish man kissed the pope on both cheeks , a gypsy survivor of the camp pressed the pope 's hand to his lips .
henryk mandelbaum , 83 , wearing the distinctive striped cap of the sonderkommando - jewish prisoners who emptied the gas chambers where their fellow jews perished - kissed the papal ring .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an emotional visit the pope , who earlier said he would visit auschwitz camp as a " son of the german people , " was later expected to utter a prayer in german for the victims of nazi brutality .
first visit as pope benedict , a member of hitler youth as a teenager , afterwards descended into the bowels of the grim barracks to pray before a lighted candle in the cell where catholic priest maximilian kolbe died in 1941 .
kolbe had offered to take the place of a prisoner whom the nazis had sentenced to death by starvation . benedict , on the last day of a four-day visit to poland , was later to recite a speech expected to focus on reconciliation between germans and poles after more than 60 years of distrust caused by the german occupation of the country during world war ii . it was benedict 's third visit to auschwitz .
as joseph ratzinger , archbishop of munich , he accompanied the polish-born john paul ii during his first visit to the camp as pope in 1979 .
a year later , he came as part of a delegation of german bishops .
told poles to hold fast earlier sunday the pontiff urged nearly one million poles at a giant mass in krakow to fight growing secularism by spreading their christian faith across europe and the world .
benedict called on the people of europe 's most roman catholic country " to share with other people of europe and the world the treasure of your faith . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benedict 's predecessor , john paul ii visited auschwitz in 1979 poland became " a place of special witness to the faith " when benedict 's predecessor john paul ii was elected pope in 1978 , he said in his homily during the nearly three-hour mass in a park in the southern city . " you were called to give this witness before the world , " the pontiff said , adding that poland 's strong catholicism had become " perhaps even more urgent than ever " with the death of john paul ii last year . ahead of the expected solemnity of the auschwitz visit , the morning mass was a joyous celebration of benedict 's visit .
the 900,000 turnout was the biggest since the pontiff began a pilgrimage in the footsteps of john paul ii on thursday , surpassing the 600,000 young people who flocked to the park the night before to join him for a prayer meeting .
tens of thousands had camped out overnight in tents or lay on the ground in sleeping bags in the 48-hectare -lrb- 119-acre -rrb- field .
bastion of roman catholicism the pontiff was welcomed to the blonia park with hymns , cheers and shouts of joy as his popemobile slowly made its way through the dense crowd before he celebrated mass on a giant , flower-bedecked altar .
from the joyous , flag-waving welcome , the crowd stilled to hear benedict 's mass , the second and final open-air service during his polish pilgrimage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the popemobile in warsaw " you must be strong with the strength of faith .
you must be faithful .
today , more than in any other age , you need this strength , " benedict exhorted them in his homily , repeating the words of his predecessor during his first mass in krakow as pope in 1979 . poland is seen as a bastion of roman catholicism in an increasingly secular european union , where the church is pitted against a growing body of legislation it sees as threatening traditional christian values . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de kaczynski : good polish-german relations important for europe polish president lech kaczynski said on wednesday that good relations with germany were " important for all of europe " after he met with german chancellor angela merkel on his first visit to berlin .

moreover , pay in eastern germany can be up to one-fifth less than in western parts of the country . liberalizing practitioner law by relaxing practitioner law , the government now hopes to counter the doctor shortage by allowing doctors to operate more than one practice , including outside the region where their license was acquired , and to hire colleagues to work for them .

by suspending this restriction and permitting doctors both to open branches and hire other doctors , the reform is designed to encourage younger doctors - as well as women - who are keen to work on a part-time basis , to branch out in to outpatient treatment without taking on the risks of setting up a private practice . if it is approved by germany 's parliament , the law will be good news for depressed regions such as brandenburg and mecklenburg , where hospitals are obliged to hire doctors from abroad in the absence of german ones .

his face grave , benedict stood a few moments in prayer , removing his hat before bowing solemnly and placing a bowl containing a lighted candle before the grim wall . the 79-year-old pontiff then greeted a line of 32 survivors , men and women , who were waiting to meet him .
some grasped his hands warmly , some knelt to kiss his papal ring , many seemed eager to thank him for visiting the camp .
benedict clasped the hands of the first survivor waiting in line , a woman , wearing the striped scarf that polish political prisoners wore at the camp . passing down the line , an elderly polish man kissed the pope on both cheeks , a gypsy survivor of the camp pressed the pope 's hand to his lips .
henryk mandelbaum , 83 , wearing the distinctive striped cap of the sonderkommando - jewish prisoners who emptied the gas chambers where their fellow jews perished - kissed the papal ring .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an emotional visit the pope , who earlier said he would visit auschwitz camp as a " son of the german people , " was later expected to utter a prayer in german for the victims of nazi brutality .
first visit as pope benedict , a member of hitler youth as a teenager , afterwards descended into the bowels of the grim barracks to pray before a lighted candle in the cell where catholic priest maximilian kolbe died in 1941 .
kolbe had offered to take the place of a prisoner whom the nazis had sentenced to death by starvation . benedict , on the last day of a four-day visit to poland , was later to recite a speech expected to focus on reconciliation between germans and poles after more than 60 years of distrust caused by the german occupation of the country during world war ii . it was benedict 's third visit to auschwitz .
as joseph ratzinger , archbishop of munich , he accompanied the polish-born john paul ii during his first visit to the camp as pope in 1979 .
a year later , he came as part of a delegation of german bishops .
told poles to hold fast earlier sunday the pontiff urged nearly one million poles at a giant mass in krakow to fight growing secularism by spreading their christian faith across europe and the world .
benedict called on the people of europe 's most roman catholic country " to share with other people of europe and the world the treasure of your faith . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benedict 's predecessor , john paul ii visited auschwitz in 1979 poland became " a place of special witness to the faith " when benedict 's predecessor john paul ii was elected pope in 1978 , he said in his homily during the nearly three-hour mass in a park in the southern city . " you were called to give this witness before the world , " the pontiff said , adding that poland 's strong catholicism had become " perhaps even more urgent than ever " with the death of john paul ii last year . ahead of the expected solemnity of the auschwitz visit , the morning mass was a joyous celebration of benedict 's visit .
the 900,000 turnout was the biggest since the pontiff began a pilgrimage in the footsteps of john paul ii on thursday , surpassing the 600,000 young people who flocked to the park the night before to join him for a prayer meeting .
tens of thousands had camped out overnight in tents or lay on the ground in sleeping bags in the 48-hectare -lrb- 119-acre -rrb- field .
bastion of roman catholicism the pontiff was welcomed to the blonia park with hymns , cheers and shouts of joy as his popemobile slowly made its way through the dense crowd before he celebrated mass on a giant , flower-bedecked altar .
from the joyous , flag-waving welcome , the crowd stilled to hear benedict 's mass , the second and final open-air service during his polish pilgrimage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the popemobile in warsaw " you must be strong with the strength of faith .
you must be faithful .
today , more than in any other age , you need this strength , " benedict exhorted them in his homily , repeating the words of his predecessor during his first mass in krakow as pope in 1979 . poland is seen as a bastion of roman catholicism in an increasingly secular european union , where the church is pitted against a growing body of legislation it sees as threatening traditional christian values . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de kaczynski : good polish-german relations important for europe polish president lech kaczynski said on wednesday that good relations with germany were " important for all of europe " after he met with german chancellor angela merkel on his first visit to berlin .

moreover , pay in eastern germany can be up to one-fifth less than in western parts of the country . liberalizing practitioner law by relaxing practitioner law , the government now hopes to counter the doctor shortage by allowing doctors to operate more than one practice , including outside the region where their license was acquired , and to hire colleagues to work for them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few doctors are willing to work in the middle of nowhere the new legislation would also allow doctors to divide their time between hospitals and private practices by blurring the line between outpatient and inpatient treatment . addressing another aspect of the problem , the cabinet also proposed throwing out the law preventing doctors over 55 from setting up practice and extending the retirement age beyond 68 , thereby making age restrictions more flexible in regions where the doctor shortage is particularly acute . stemming the doctor drain although the health ministry does not expect the law to usher in major changes , it hopes to stem the doctor drain in large swathes of the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many young doctors are put off by the prospect of mainly treating older people until now , general practitioners were not allowed to employ specialized colleagues unless they were registered as a group practice .
by suspending this restriction and permitting doctors both to open branches and hire other doctors , the reform is designed to encourage younger doctors - as well as women - who are keen to work on a part-time basis , to branch out in to outpatient treatment without taking on the risks of setting up a private practice . if it is approved by germany 's parliament , the law will be good news for depressed regions such as brandenburg and mecklenburg , where hospitals are obliged to hire doctors from abroad in the absence of german ones .

" berlin is really the capital for electronic music at the moment .

but the electronic music scene has been fighting back with events of its own where vinyl and samplers rule . the undisputed leader is the sonar festival in barcelona , spain , which runs from june 15-17 . helped by the warm weather , the seaside location and the buzz of the city , the sonar organizers also consistently select a line up of big name djs and the most exciting breakthrough acts . expect electronica , hip hop and techno with appearances by london-based goldfrapp and legendary producer dj shadow expected to be major draws during the three-day event . disco is n ot dead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whoever said that disco dancing was passe ?
" there are two main focuses this year , " said enric palau , one of the three co-founders of the event , which began in 1994 . " one is the ' the year of japan ' event with 20 artists from japan including hip hop , breakbeat and beatboxing people , " he said .
" the second is ' black music . '
we would n't have electronic music without disco or the first samples of rap .
and reggae has been important for the minimal techno of today . " about 80,000 to 90,000 people attended last year and the same number are expected on the sonar site this year . " barcelona is the perfect environment for the festival , " palau said .
" the work we do has helped position barcelona on the map for cultural and music events . " europe goes electro n ic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hey ms. dj , pump up the jam !
elsewhere in spain , the benicassim festival from july 20-23 features both guitar and electronic acts and draws big crowds for four days of dancing under the sometimes unrelenting spanish sun . in france , the nuits sonores festival in lyon is already winning plaudits as a gallic rival to spain 's sonar despite this year being only the fourth edition . unlike sonar , however , which is concentrated on one site , nuits sonores infiltrates the whole of the unesco-listed city of lyon with performances in 50 different locations .
a warehouse at the confluence of the two rivers in lyon , the rhone and the saone , serves as the focal point of the festival which runs from may 24-28 and which attracted 40,000-50,000 visitors last year . " it 's a panorama of electronic music with all styles represented , " said 35-year-old vincent carry , one of three co-founders from the city .
" the line-up goes from techno house to breakbeat and electroclash .
the comparison with sonar is made by a lot of people .
artistically , we have a lot in common with them . " from belgium to berli n a n d beyo n d in neighboring belgium , the summer festival season is rich and diverse with the electronic scene led by the 10 days off event from july 14-24 as part of the giant gentse feesten , which takes over the picturesque town of ghent in july . " i think gentse feesten is the biggest city festival in europe , " said phillip de liser , an organizer of 10 days off .
" about two million people came last year . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berlin love parade was cancelled in 2004 due to lack of funds he underlined the influence of berlin on the electronic music scene in europe at the moment .
berliners or international djs based in berlin are set to be an important draw for this year 's festival . " the best electronic music is coming from berlin at the moment , " de liser said .
" berlin is really the capital for electronic music at the moment .
it is n't london anymore . " berlin itself hosts the popkomm electronic festival from september 20-22 which hosted 1,200 artists in 20 clubs in 2005 . in the middle of the summer , the berlin love parade on july 15 will could again bring over a million people onto the streets of the formerly divided city for a day of hedonism and ear-popping dance music .
the city of cologne in western germany , the other hotspot for german electronic music , livens up when the c / o pop festival gets underway on august 23-27 . uk still big o n festivals in britain , the glastonbury festival from june 22-24 continues to be the biggest music event of summer , with both guitar and electronic acts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : homeland festival is now called hifi homelands festival , renamed hifi this year is a two-day event dedicated to dance music on the weekend of may 27-28 and attracts large crowds from london , which is a short trip from the festival 's site in winchester , hampshire . further north , the t in the park festival from july 8-9 is the scottish answer to glastonbury , while the big chill festival from august 4-6 has a growing reputation and expects a crowd of 29,000 people this year .
located next to a lake in a deer park in western england , the big chill combines nature with cutting edge music programming .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 28.05.2006 german cabinet proposes surgery to doctor practice law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a doctor drain in the west , a doctor shortage in the east germany 's cabinet drafted a new law this week designed to ward off the doctor drain from parts of eastern germany . plenty of doctors are unemployed in germany , but even so , few of them are willing to work out in the country , or in eastern germany - where there 's long been a serious shortfall . with fewer and fewer doctors setting up rural practices , especially in the country 's more economically deprived areas , the last decade has seen local authorities desperately looking for ways to attract doctors to work in eastern germany 's clinics and countryside . previous suggestions have involved sending freshly minted doctors off to the boondocks for a compulsory year to counter the shortage , with the general consensus being that financial rewards are not enough to tempt the medics out of the cities . the trouble is that with the younger generation moving to urban centers in search of work , few ambitious young doctors are keen to either take over practices or set up new ones in areas where the patients ' average age is likely to be around 80 .
moreover , pay in eastern germany can be up to one-fifth less than in western parts of the country . liberalizing practitioner law by relaxing practitioner law , the government now hopes to counter the doctor shortage by allowing doctors to operate more than one practice , including outside the region where their license was acquired , and to hire colleagues to work for them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few doctors are willing to work in the middle of nowhere the new legislation would also allow doctors to divide their time between hospitals and private practices by blurring the line between outpatient and inpatient treatment . addressing another aspect of the problem , the cabinet also proposed throwing out the law preventing doctors over 55 from setting up practice and extending the retirement age beyond 68 , thereby making age restrictions more flexible in regions where the doctor shortage is particularly acute . stemming the doctor drain although the health ministry does not expect the law to usher in major changes , it hopes to stem the doctor drain in large swathes of the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many young doctors are put off by the prospect of mainly treating older people until now , general practitioners were not allowed to employ specialized colleagues unless they were registered as a group practice .
by suspending this restriction and permitting doctors both to open branches and hire other doctors , the reform is designed to encourage younger doctors - as well as women - who are keen to work on a part-time basis , to branch out in to outpatient treatment without taking on the risks of setting up a private practice . if it is approved by germany 's parliament , the law will be good news for depressed regions such as brandenburg and mecklenburg , where hospitals are obliged to hire doctors from abroad in the absence of german ones .
these meanwhile , are increasingly opting to head to britain and switzerland , lured by the promise of better salaries and conditions . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de doctors defect to blissful britain germany 's health system is a troubled soul .
the winces of pain elicited by the financial incision of reform may be beginning to fade , but the laments of young doctors are growing louder and many are leaving for britain .

but the electronic music scene has been fighting back with events of its own where vinyl and samplers rule . the undisputed leader is the sonar festival in barcelona , spain , which runs from june 15-17 . helped by the warm weather , the seaside location and the buzz of the city , the sonar organizers also consistently select a line up of big name djs and the most exciting breakthrough acts . expect electronica , hip hop and techno with appearances by london-based goldfrapp and legendary producer dj shadow expected to be major draws during the three-day event . disco is n ot dead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whoever said that disco dancing was passe ?
" there are two main focuses this year , " said enric palau , one of the three co-founders of the event , which began in 1994 . " one is the ' the year of japan ' event with 20 artists from japan including hip hop , breakbeat and beatboxing people , " he said .
" the second is ' black music . '
we would n't have electronic music without disco or the first samples of rap .
and reggae has been important for the minimal techno of today . " about 80,000 to 90,000 people attended last year and the same number are expected on the sonar site this year . " barcelona is the perfect environment for the festival , " palau said .
" the work we do has helped position barcelona on the map for cultural and music events . " europe goes electro n ic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hey ms. dj , pump up the jam !
elsewhere in spain , the benicassim festival from july 20-23 features both guitar and electronic acts and draws big crowds for four days of dancing under the sometimes unrelenting spanish sun . in france , the nuits sonores festival in lyon is already winning plaudits as a gallic rival to spain 's sonar despite this year being only the fourth edition . unlike sonar , however , which is concentrated on one site , nuits sonores infiltrates the whole of the unesco-listed city of lyon with performances in 50 different locations .
a warehouse at the confluence of the two rivers in lyon , the rhone and the saone , serves as the focal point of the festival which runs from may 24-28 and which attracted 40,000-50,000 visitors last year . " it 's a panorama of electronic music with all styles represented , " said 35-year-old vincent carry , one of three co-founders from the city .
" the line-up goes from techno house to breakbeat and electroclash .
the comparison with sonar is made by a lot of people .
artistically , we have a lot in common with them . " from belgium to berli n a n d beyo n d in neighboring belgium , the summer festival season is rich and diverse with the electronic scene led by the 10 days off event from july 14-24 as part of the giant gentse feesten , which takes over the picturesque town of ghent in july . " i think gentse feesten is the biggest city festival in europe , " said phillip de liser , an organizer of 10 days off .
" about two million people came last year . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berlin love parade was cancelled in 2004 due to lack of funds he underlined the influence of berlin on the electronic music scene in europe at the moment .
berliners or international djs based in berlin are set to be an important draw for this year 's festival . " the best electronic music is coming from berlin at the moment , " de liser said .
" berlin is really the capital for electronic music at the moment .
it is n't london anymore . " berlin itself hosts the popkomm electronic festival from september 20-22 which hosted 1,200 artists in 20 clubs in 2005 . in the middle of the summer , the berlin love parade on july 15 will could again bring over a million people onto the streets of the formerly divided city for a day of hedonism and ear-popping dance music .
the city of cologne in western germany , the other hotspot for german electronic music , livens up when the c / o pop festival gets underway on august 23-27 . uk still big o n festivals in britain , the glastonbury festival from june 22-24 continues to be the biggest music event of summer , with both guitar and electronic acts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : homeland festival is now called hifi homelands festival , renamed hifi this year is a two-day event dedicated to dance music on the weekend of may 27-28 and attracts large crowds from london , which is a short trip from the festival 's site in winchester , hampshire . further north , the t in the park festival from july 8-9 is the scottish answer to glastonbury , while the big chill festival from august 4-6 has a growing reputation and expects a crowd of 29,000 people this year .
located next to a lake in a deer park in western england , the big chill combines nature with cutting edge music programming .

his face grave , benedict stood a few moments in prayer , removing his hat before bowing solemnly and placing a bowl containing a lighted candle before the grim wall . the 79-year-old pontiff then greeted a line of 32 survivors , men and women , who were waiting to meet him .
some grasped his hands warmly , some knelt to kiss his papal ring , many seemed eager to thank him for visiting the camp .
benedict clasped the hands of the first survivor waiting in line , a woman , wearing the striped scarf that polish political prisoners wore at the camp . passing down the line , an elderly polish man kissed the pope on both cheeks , a gypsy survivor of the camp pressed the pope 's hand to his lips .

his face grave , benedict stood a few moments in prayer , removing his hat before bowing solemnly and placing a bowl containing a lighted candle before the grim wall . the 79-year-old pontiff then greeted a line of 32 survivors , men and women , who were waiting to meet him .
some grasped his hands warmly , some knelt to kiss his papal ring , many seemed eager to thank him for visiting the camp .
benedict clasped the hands of the first survivor waiting in line , a woman , wearing the striped scarf that polish political prisoners wore at the camp . passing down the line , an elderly polish man kissed the pope on both cheeks , a gypsy survivor of the camp pressed the pope 's hand to his lips .
henryk mandelbaum , 83 , wearing the distinctive striped cap of the sonderkommando - jewish prisoners who emptied the gas chambers where their fellow jews perished - kissed the papal ring .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an emotional visit the pope , who earlier said he would visit auschwitz camp as a " son of the german people , " was later expected to utter a prayer in german for the victims of nazi brutality .
first visit as pope benedict , a member of hitler youth as a teenager , afterwards descended into the bowels of the grim barracks to pray before a lighted candle in the cell where catholic priest maximilian kolbe died in 1941 .
kolbe had offered to take the place of a prisoner whom the nazis had sentenced to death by starvation . benedict , on the last day of a four-day visit to poland , was later to recite a speech expected to focus on reconciliation between germans and poles after more than 60 years of distrust caused by the german occupation of the country during world war ii . it was benedict 's third visit to auschwitz .
as joseph ratzinger , archbishop of munich , he accompanied the polish-born john paul ii during his first visit to the camp as pope in 1979 .
a year later , he came as part of a delegation of german bishops .
told poles to hold fast earlier sunday the pontiff urged nearly one million poles at a giant mass in krakow to fight growing secularism by spreading their christian faith across europe and the world .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 28.05.2006 german cabinet proposes surgery to doctor practice law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a doctor drain in the west , a doctor shortage in the east germany 's cabinet drafted a new law this week designed to ward off the doctor drain from parts of eastern germany . plenty of doctors are unemployed in germany , but even so , few of them are willing to work out in the country , or in eastern germany - where there 's long been a serious shortfall . with fewer and fewer doctors setting up rural practices , especially in the country 's more economically deprived areas , the last decade has seen local authorities desperately looking for ways to attract doctors to work in eastern germany 's clinics and countryside . previous suggestions have involved sending freshly minted doctors off to the boondocks for a compulsory year to counter the shortage , with the general consensus being that financial rewards are not enough to tempt the medics out of the cities . the trouble is that with the younger generation moving to urban centers in search of work , few ambitious young doctors are keen to either take over practices or set up new ones in areas where the patients ' average age is likely to be around 80 .
moreover , pay in eastern germany can be up to one-fifth less than in western parts of the country . liberalizing practitioner law by relaxing practitioner law , the government now hopes to counter the doctor shortage by allowing doctors to operate more than one practice , including outside the region where their license was acquired , and to hire colleagues to work for them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few doctors are willing to work in the middle of nowhere the new legislation would also allow doctors to divide their time between hospitals and private practices by blurring the line between outpatient and inpatient treatment . addressing another aspect of the problem , the cabinet also proposed throwing out the law preventing doctors over 55 from setting up practice and extending the retirement age beyond 68 , thereby making age restrictions more flexible in regions where the doctor shortage is particularly acute . stemming the doctor drain although the health ministry does not expect the law to usher in major changes , it hopes to stem the doctor drain in large swathes of the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many young doctors are put off by the prospect of mainly treating older people until now , general practitioners were not allowed to employ specialized colleagues unless they were registered as a group practice .
by suspending this restriction and permitting doctors both to open branches and hire other doctors , the reform is designed to encourage younger doctors - as well as women - who are keen to work on a part-time basis , to branch out in to outpatient treatment without taking on the risks of setting up a private practice . if it is approved by germany 's parliament , the law will be good news for depressed regions such as brandenburg and mecklenburg , where hospitals are obliged to hire doctors from abroad in the absence of german ones .
these meanwhile , are increasingly opting to head to britain and switzerland , lured by the promise of better salaries and conditions . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de doctors defect to blissful britain germany 's health system is a troubled soul .
the winces of pain elicited by the financial incision of reform may be beginning to fade , but the laments of young doctors are growing louder and many are leaving for britain .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 28.05.2006 german cabinet proposes surgery to doctor practice law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a doctor drain in the west , a doctor shortage in the east germany 's cabinet drafted a new law this week designed to ward off the doctor drain from parts of eastern germany . plenty of doctors are unemployed in germany , but even so , few of them are willing to work out in the country , or in eastern germany - where there 's long been a serious shortfall . with fewer and fewer doctors setting up rural practices , especially in the country 's more economically deprived areas , the last decade has seen local authorities desperately looking for ways to attract doctors to work in eastern germany 's clinics and countryside . previous suggestions have involved sending freshly minted doctors off to the boondocks for a compulsory year to counter the shortage , with the general consensus being that financial rewards are not enough to tempt the medics out of the cities . the trouble is that with the younger generation moving to urban centers in search of work , few ambitious young doctors are keen to either take over practices or set up new ones in areas where the patients ' average age is likely to be around 80 .
moreover , pay in eastern germany can be up to one-fifth less than in western parts of the country . liberalizing practitioner law by relaxing practitioner law , the government now hopes to counter the doctor shortage by allowing doctors to operate more than one practice , including outside the region where their license was acquired , and to hire colleagues to work for them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few doctors are willing to work in the middle of nowhere the new legislation would also allow doctors to divide their time between hospitals and private practices by blurring the line between outpatient and inpatient treatment . addressing another aspect of the problem , the cabinet also proposed throwing out the law preventing doctors over 55 from setting up practice and extending the retirement age beyond 68 , thereby making age restrictions more flexible in regions where the doctor shortage is particularly acute . stemming the doctor drain although the health ministry does not expect the law to usher in major changes , it hopes to stem the doctor drain in large swathes of the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many young doctors are put off by the prospect of mainly treating older people until now , general practitioners were not allowed to employ specialized colleagues unless they were registered as a group practice .
by suspending this restriction and permitting doctors both to open branches and hire other doctors , the reform is designed to encourage younger doctors - as well as women - who are keen to work on a part-time basis , to branch out in to outpatient treatment without taking on the risks of setting up a private practice . if it is approved by germany 's parliament , the law will be good news for depressed regions such as brandenburg and mecklenburg , where hospitals are obliged to hire doctors from abroad in the absence of german ones .
these meanwhile , are increasingly opting to head to britain and switzerland , lured by the promise of better salaries and conditions . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de doctors defect to blissful britain germany 's health system is a troubled soul .
the winces of pain elicited by the financial incision of reform may be beginning to fade , but the laments of young doctors are growing louder and many are leaving for britain .

torsten frings was also on target as luxembourg suffered a repeat of the 7-0 thrashing inflicted on them by germany ahead of the 1998 world cup . " it is good for us to overcome this hurdle in such convincing fashion , " said coach jürgen klinsmann .
" we told the strikers before the match that they would have a lot of chances and should take them .
they did just that and it was good for their confidence . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a party for germany 's fans while germany enjoyed a one-sided victory , france and the netherlands both had to settle for victories by a single goal in their matches against mexico and cameroon respectively . controversy surrounding barthez france had florent malouda to thank for their 1-0 victory at the stade de france in a match which saw zinedine zidane clock up 100 appearances for his country .
it was the veteran midfielder 's last match in paris , the scene of his finest hour eight years ago when his two headed goals inspired france to their world cup final victory over brazil .
malouda ensured it would be a happy farewell for zidane with a spectacular finish from a djibril cisse cross . the match was marred however by persistent jeers and whistles directed at french ' keeper fabien barthez .
barthez , who had earlier this week been the subject of a controversy at france 's world cup base that saw goalkeeping rival gregory coupet storm out of the team hotel only to return later , has never been popular with parisian fans .
at one point chants of ' coupet , coupet ' rang around the stadium to the disgust of members of the french squad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's florent malouda -lrb- l . -rrb- tackles franco guillermo of mexico " you just ca n't understand it , " said coach raymond domenech .
" the players were stunned .
it just does n't make any sense - we 're preparing for a world cup and that sort of thing happens .
you ca n't put it into words . "
nistelrooy shines there were no such controversies in rotterdam however , as the netherlands served notice that they could be one of the teams to watch in germany with a 1-0 win over the ' indomitable lions ' of cameroon . ruud van nistelrooy marked his 50th international appearance with the winning goal as the dutch downed the africans with some stylish football .
van nistelrooy , who is reported to be heading for the exit at manchester united after falling out with sir alex ferguson , gave a reminder of his eye for goal by finishing from close range on 23 minutes .
it was van nistelrooy 's 26th goal in half a century of appearances for the netherlands , a phenomenal strike rate that indicates why several leading clubs are likely to pounce if he is forced out of old trafford .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nistelrooy -lrb- r . -rrb- celebrates his goal against cameroon " at times we were very good , " said coach marco van basten .
" we should be satisfied with that because we played well against a quality side .
it did n't feel like a friendly match from a physical point of view . " holland face ivory coast , argentina and serbia-montenegro in group c of the world cup , and will have taken note of friendlies involving two of their first round opponents elsewhere saturday .
the ivory coast impressed after coming from behind to thwart switzerland with a 1-1 draw , while serbia-montenegro were held to an identical scoreline by uruguay in belgrade . in other friendlies involving world cup teams saturday , spain were held to a disappointing 0-0 draw against russia in albacete .
two of england 's first round opponents meanwhile , paraguay and trinidad and tobago , both struggled .
trinidad and tobago lost 2-1 to wales while paraguay were held to a 1-1 draw with denmark , who failed to qualify for the world cup . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup group games worth watching with 48 games kicking off over 15 days , the world cup group stage can leave even devout soccer fans wondering when to tune in and when to take a break .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a party for germany 's fans while germany enjoyed a one-sided victory , france and the netherlands both had to settle for victories by a single goal in their matches against mexico and cameroon respectively . controversy surrounding barthez france had florent malouda to thank for their 1-0 victory at the stade de france in a match which saw zinedine zidane clock up 100 appearances for his country .
it was the veteran midfielder 's last match in paris , the scene of his finest hour eight years ago when his two headed goals inspired france to their world cup final victory over brazil .
malouda ensured it would be a happy farewell for zidane with a spectacular finish from a djibril cisse cross . the match was marred however by persistent jeers and whistles directed at french ' keeper fabien barthez .
barthez , who had earlier this week been the subject of a controversy at france 's world cup base that saw goalkeeping rival gregory coupet storm out of the team hotel only to return later , has never been popular with parisian fans .
at one point chants of ' coupet , coupet ' rang around the stadium to the disgust of members of the french squad .

" the players were stunned .
it just does n't make any sense - we 're preparing for a world cup and that sort of thing happens .

nistelrooy shines there were no such controversies in rotterdam however , as the netherlands served notice that they could be one of the teams to watch in germany with a 1-0 win over the ' indomitable lions ' of cameroon . ruud van nistelrooy marked his 50th international appearance with the winning goal as the dutch downed the africans with some stylish football .
van nistelrooy , who is reported to be heading for the exit at manchester united after falling out with sir alex ferguson , gave a reminder of his eye for goal by finishing from close range on 23 minutes .
it was van nistelrooy 's 26th goal in half a century of appearances for the netherlands , a phenomenal strike rate that indicates why several leading clubs are likely to pounce if he is forced out of old trafford .

torsten frings was also on target as luxembourg suffered a repeat of the 7-0 thrashing inflicted on them by germany ahead of the 1998 world cup . " it is good for us to overcome this hurdle in such convincing fashion , " said coach jürgen klinsmann .
" we told the strikers before the match that they would have a lot of chances and should take them .
they did just that and it was good for their confidence . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a party for germany 's fans while germany enjoyed a one-sided victory , france and the netherlands both had to settle for victories by a single goal in their matches against mexico and cameroon respectively . controversy surrounding barthez france had florent malouda to thank for their 1-0 victory at the stade de france in a match which saw zinedine zidane clock up 100 appearances for his country .
it was the veteran midfielder 's last match in paris , the scene of his finest hour eight years ago when his two headed goals inspired france to their world cup final victory over brazil .
malouda ensured it would be a happy farewell for zidane with a spectacular finish from a djibril cisse cross . the match was marred however by persistent jeers and whistles directed at french ' keeper fabien barthez .
barthez , who had earlier this week been the subject of a controversy at france 's world cup base that saw goalkeeping rival gregory coupet storm out of the team hotel only to return later , has never been popular with parisian fans .
at one point chants of ' coupet , coupet ' rang around the stadium to the disgust of members of the french squad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's florent malouda -lrb- l . -rrb- tackles franco guillermo of mexico " you just ca n't understand it , " said coach raymond domenech .
" the players were stunned .
it just does n't make any sense - we 're preparing for a world cup and that sort of thing happens .
you ca n't put it into words . "
nistelrooy shines there were no such controversies in rotterdam however , as the netherlands served notice that they could be one of the teams to watch in germany with a 1-0 win over the ' indomitable lions ' of cameroon . ruud van nistelrooy marked his 50th international appearance with the winning goal as the dutch downed the africans with some stylish football .
van nistelrooy , who is reported to be heading for the exit at manchester united after falling out with sir alex ferguson , gave a reminder of his eye for goal by finishing from close range on 23 minutes .
it was van nistelrooy 's 26th goal in half a century of appearances for the netherlands , a phenomenal strike rate that indicates why several leading clubs are likely to pounce if he is forced out of old trafford .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nistelrooy -lrb- r . -rrb- celebrates his goal against cameroon " at times we were very good , " said coach marco van basten .
" we should be satisfied with that because we played well against a quality side .
it did n't feel like a friendly match from a physical point of view . " holland face ivory coast , argentina and serbia-montenegro in group c of the world cup , and will have taken note of friendlies involving two of their first round opponents elsewhere saturday .
the ivory coast impressed after coming from behind to thwart switzerland with a 1-1 draw , while serbia-montenegro were held to an identical scoreline by uruguay in belgrade . in other friendlies involving world cup teams saturday , spain were held to a disappointing 0-0 draw against russia in albacete .
two of england 's first round opponents meanwhile , paraguay and trinidad and tobago , both struggled .
trinidad and tobago lost 2-1 to wales while paraguay were held to a 1-1 draw with denmark , who failed to qualify for the world cup . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup group games worth watching with 48 games kicking off over 15 days , the world cup group stage can leave even devout soccer fans wondering when to tune in and when to take a break .

for the first time , the capital 's rail network in the south and north is now linked to its counterpart in the east and west .
aids scare the long-awaited opening was marred by an incident on friday night in which a drunken youth slashed at least 31 people with a knife just after a fireworks display at the station ended .
the 16-year-old attacked passersby at random , cutting them in the back and on the face , on a street near the reichstag , home of germany 's parliament .
he was caught and arrested around 15 minutes later .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the teenager already had a police record for assault and vandalism police said it was the worst attack of its kind yet in berlin .
chancellor angela merkel described it as " a horrible event . " the rampage unleashed an aids scare as one of the victims was hiv positive , and there are fears that others may have been infected with the virus by contaminated blood on the knife .
by sunday midday , 56 people , including medics , had contacted berlin clinics to be treated after having possibly contracted the disease .
a spokeswoman for the charite university clinic said the victims ' chances of communicating hiv were very low .
the likelihood of infection through knife wounds was one to 300 , she told reuters .
fears for world cup interior minister wolfgang schäuble sought to calm fears that security at the world 's biggest soccer event was at risk , telling ard television that the " tragic event had nothing to do with the world cup . " " nobody should worry about security during the world cup , everything that can be done to minimize the risk has been done and is being done , " he added . but a recent spate of brutal attacks blamed on far-right-wingers has caused concern for the safety of foreign visitors .
it has also sparked a heated debate about whether germany has a growing problem with racism and xenophobia , especially in the former communist east of the country . last weekend a politician of turkish origin was beaten and slashed with a broken bottle in lichtenberg , a suburb of berlin known as a neo-nazi stronghold . a government report released two days later found that right-wing violence increased by 23 percent in 2005 . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de teenage knifeman wounds 28 in berlin a 16-year-old youth armed with a knife wounded 28 people in a late-night rampage in downtown berlin , leaving one victim fighting for life in hospital , police said early saturday .

-lrb- 2156 cet -rrb- on saturday night .
the first train to travel through the underground tunnel of the station , which took 11 years to complete , half an hour later . plans for the capital 's central station were made shortly after the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 , and the opening come just in time to accommodate football fans from around europe two weeks ahead of the football world cup 2006 championships kicking off in munich on june 9 . the station was originally meant to be known as lehrter bahnhof but has had a name change to indicate that it is the once divided city 's main station .
for the first time , the capital 's rail network in the south and north is now linked to its counterpart in the east and west .
aids scare the long-awaited opening was marred by an incident on friday night in which a drunken youth slashed at least 31 people with a knife just after a fireworks display at the station ended .
the 16-year-old attacked passersby at random , cutting them in the back and on the face , on a street near the reichstag , home of germany 's parliament .
he was caught and arrested around 15 minutes later .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the teenager already had a police record for assault and vandalism police said it was the worst attack of its kind yet in berlin .
chancellor angela merkel described it as " a horrible event . " the rampage unleashed an aids scare as one of the victims was hiv positive , and there are fears that others may have been infected with the virus by contaminated blood on the knife .
by sunday midday , 56 people , including medics , had contacted berlin clinics to be treated after having possibly contracted the disease .
a spokeswoman for the charite university clinic said the victims ' chances of communicating hiv were very low .
the likelihood of infection through knife wounds was one to 300 , she told reuters .
fears for world cup interior minister wolfgang schäuble sought to calm fears that security at the world 's biggest soccer event was at risk , telling ard television that the " tragic event had nothing to do with the world cup . " " nobody should worry about security during the world cup , everything that can be done to minimize the risk has been done and is being done , " he added . but a recent spate of brutal attacks blamed on far-right-wingers has caused concern for the safety of foreign visitors .
it has also sparked a heated debate about whether germany has a growing problem with racism and xenophobia , especially in the former communist east of the country . last weekend a politician of turkish origin was beaten and slashed with a broken bottle in lichtenberg , a suburb of berlin known as a neo-nazi stronghold . a government report released two days later found that right-wing violence increased by 23 percent in 2005 . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de teenage knifeman wounds 28 in berlin a 16-year-old youth armed with a knife wounded 28 people in a late-night rampage in downtown berlin , leaving one victim fighting for life in hospital , police said early saturday .

in an interview for bbc radio 4 's desert island discs he told how suspect agents " interrogated " him in yalta in what may have been a recruitment drive .
the mp also talked about his disabled son , who suffers from a combination of epilepsy and cerebral palsy .
he picked an eclectic mix of music for his desert island , ranging from benny hill to the killers and mendelssohn .
the witney mp told sue lawley he would take a crate of whisky as his luxury and tv chef hugh fearnley-whittingstall 's river cottage cookbook as his book .
cameron 's discs ernie -lrb- the fastest milkman in the west -rrb- - benny hill tangled up in blue - bob dylan this charming man - the smiths on wings of song - mendelssohn wish you were here - pink floyd fake plastic trees - radiohead perfect circle - rem all these things i 've done - the killers the story behind cameron 's favourite song the suspected kgb approach from russian intelligence came while he was travelling in his year out between school and university .
he met a friend in moscow and went to yalta on the black sea coast , where two russians speaking " perfect english " had turned up on a beach mostly used by foreigners .
" they took us out to dinner and interrogated us in a friendly way about life in england and what we thought and politics , " he said .
" we were obviously very careful and guarded in what we said but later when i got to university my politics tutor said that was definitely an attempt . "
wonderful boy mr cameron said the incident had raised eyebrows when he was being vetted to become a special adviser at the treasury in the 1990s .
his story had made the vetting officer fill his notebook , he said .
hill spent four weeks at number one mr cameron also talked openly and honestly about the shock of learning of his son ivan 's disability .
born in 2001 , ivan is the eldest child of mr cameron and his wife sam and has a rare condition combining epilepsy and cerebral palsy that has left him needing 24-hour care .
mr cameron told interviewer sue lawley the condition was apparent within a few days of ivan 's birth .
he said : " you obviously worry about everything as a parent and you start asking questions .
" initially , we were told it was fine , then we went to hospital and they ran some tests and we were told he had a very rare condition which has very poor outcomes .
he said the news hit " almost like mourning the loss of something , because you are mourning the gap between your expectation and what has happened , " he said .
he is a wonderful boy .
he has got the most lovely eyes and he definitely interacts with us in the way he looks at you and the way he moves his head , david cameron , conservative leader " the thing that worries us is his quality of life and trying to make sure he does have a good quality of life . "
but he added : " he is a wonderful boy .
he has got the most lovely eyes and he definitely interacts with us in the way he looks at you and the way he moves his head , but he often is in a lot of pain . "
he and his wife are " positive , optimistic people " he said and are determined to give ivan all they can and ensure he is part of the family .
the couple have two other children , nancy , now two and arthur born earlier this year , both of whom were born without ivan 's medical problems .
in the interview mr cameron also suggested he quite enjoyed his jousts with tony blair in the house of commons .
he said : " prime minister 's questions with tony blair there is some sort of light and shadow and he 's got a sense of humour ...
" i 'm not sure with gordon -lsb- brown -rsb- how many light moments there will be . "
childhood memories mr cameron insisted he had not given up on his promise to end " punch and judy " politics .
but he admitted the commons was a theatre , adding " you have to do a bit of bopping from time to time . "
the tory leader said the live version of bob dylan 's tangled up in blue would be the song he would take to his desert island if only allowed one record .
the sound of the audience and dylan 's " rasping voice " would make him feel less lonely , he said .
mr cameron revealed his childhood musical hero is none other than saucy old-school comic benny hill .
he said the comedian 's 1971 chart-topper ernie -lrb- the fastest milkman in the west -rrb- was the only song he knows all the words to .
" this really just reminds me of my childhood , " he said .

around 34,000 fans travelled to see the club play barnsley in the league one play-off-final .
one coach had its windows smashed after it was hit with stones near sophia gardens in the city , south wales police said .
transport police made 15 arrests after the match but praised fans ' behaviour .
it is understood the coach was carrying swansea fans but had not been parked in one of the designated areas .
british transport police 's area commander chief supt peter mchugh said : " generally the atmosphere was peaceful .
" sadly however , there remains a small minority who consider engaging in disorder and ruining it for others .
the vast majority of fans were well behaved . "
most of the arrests were for public order offences .
after drawing 2-2 at the end of extra time , the club missed out on what would have been their return to english football 's second tier after 22 years .
the club said demand for tickets for the game in cardiff has been unprecedented with many fans queuing for hours at the liberty stadium when tickets went on sale to secure their place at the final .
police said there were no arrests before the match earlier this week the swans were given extra tickets by the football league to meet demand .
michelle hills , manager of the liberty stadium shop , said demand for swansea city merchandise had been huge in the build-up to the match .
she said : " sales this week have been absolutely fantastic , the atmosphere around the club is brilliant at the moment .
" we 've had a t-shirt made especially for the final and it 's selling out .
" as soon as it 's on the shelf , it 's gone . "
it was the second game for swansea at the millennium stadium in the space of two months , following their 2-1 victory over carlisle in the football league trophy final in april .

amnesty is celebrating 45 years of activism by highlighting governments using the net to suppress dissent .
the campaign will highlight abuses of rights the net is used for , and push for the release of those jailed for speaking out online .
it will also name hi-tech firms aiding governments that limit online protests .
pledge bank called irrepressible.info , the campaign will revolve around a website with the same name .
while the human rights group has run separate campaigns about web repression and the jailing of net dissidents before now , irrepressible.info will bring them all together .
it aims to throw light on the many different ways that the freedom to use the net is limited by governments .
for instance , said a spokesman for amnesty , around the globe net cafes are being closed down , home pcs are being confiscated , chat in discussion forums is being watched and blogs are being censored or removed .
amnesty internet pledge " i believe the internet should be a force for political freedom , not repression .
people have the right to seek and receive information and to express their peaceful beliefs online without fear or interference .
i call on governments to stop the unwarranted restriction of freedom of expression on the internet and on companies to stop helping them do it " internet censorship around the world " the internet has become a new frontier in the struggle for human rights , " said kate allen , uk director of amnesty international .
" its potential to empower and educate , to allow people to share and mobilise opinion has led to government crackdowns . "
ms allen added that there were growing numbers of cases in which those who have turned to the net to discuss change or protest about government policies have been jailed for what they said .
for instance , she said , chinese journalist shi tao is serving a 10-year jail sentence for sending an e-mail overseas which detailed the restrictions the chinese government wanted to impose on papers writing about the 15th anniversary of the tiananmen square massacre .
have your say " the internet is an international tool for free thought " elliot , exmouth , devon send us your comments hi-tech firm yahoo helped identify the journalist via his e-mail account .
amnesty is calling for the jailed journalist to be released immediately .
however mary osako , a spokeswoman for yahoo , said the case was " distressing " to the firm .
" we condemn punishment of any activity internationally recognised as free expression , whether that punishment takes place in china or anywhere else in the world , " she said .
she added the company had received " a valid and legal demand " for information and responded to it as required by the law .
she went on : " the choice in china or other countries is not whether to comply with law enforcement demands for information .
rather , the choice is whether or not to remain in a country .
" we balance the requirement to comply with laws that are not necessarily consistent with our own values against our strong belief that active involvement in china contributes to the continued modernization of the country - as well as a benefit to chinese citizens - through the advancement of communications , commerce and access to information . "
profit and principles the amnesty campaign will seek to get net users to sign a pledge that opposes repressive use of the net .
the pledges will be collated and presented to a meeting of the un 's internet governance forum that is due to meet in athens in november 2006 .
amnesty wants to get people using an icon in e-mail signatures or on websites that contains text from censored sites .
the group also wants to run an e-mail campaign to target companies to stop putting " profit before principles " and respect human rights everywhere they operate .
reports will be prepared on those countries that place restrictions on what can be said online or use it to keep an eye on those expressing discontent .
" irrepressible.info will harness the power of the internet and of individuals to oppose repression and stand up for free speech , " said ms allen .

she went on : " the choice in china or other countries is not whether to comply with law enforcement demands for information .
rather , the choice is whether or not to remain in a country .
" we balance the requirement to comply with laws that are not necessarily consistent with our own values against our strong belief that active involvement in china contributes to the continued modernization of the country - as well as a benefit to chinese citizens - through the advancement of communications , commerce and access to information .

amnesty wants to get people using an icon in e-mail signatures or on websites that contains text from censored sites .
the group also wants to run an e-mail campaign to target companies to stop putting " profit before principles " and respect human rights everywhere they operate .
reports will be prepared on those countries that place restrictions on what can be said online or use it to keep an eye on those expressing discontent .
" irrepressible.info will harness the power of the internet and of individuals to oppose repression and stand up for free speech , " said ms allen .

india 's animation industry is set to get a shot in the arm with several well-known bollywood actors agreeing to lend their voices for a new animation film to be made by an american director .
the director of the animated series spiderman and the starship troopers , vincent michael edwards , says it is an indian project and is scheduled for a year-end release .
initially the actors were reluctant to sign up for the movie .
" they did not want to lend their voices to what they thought would be a ' b ' grade animation film , " mr edwards said .
" however , once they realised this was going to be a top class product that would help rather than hinder their careers , they were happy to do it . "
while hollywood stars have often lent their voices for animated features , bollywood stars are yet to catch on .
' profound difference ' top bollywood star shahrukh khan and his son aryan had dubbed the hindi version of disney / pixar 's feature the incredibles in 2004 , but there are very few other instances of actors voicing indian animation films .
mr edwards said he is working with an all-indian staff and the talent and quality of work is on a par with that found in the united states .
but he believes it will be sometime before the industry becomes capable of making its own high-end features .
there are a number of talented artisans that work well under guidance but they need more time to be able to come up with a good product that is globally marketable director vincent michael edwards " there is a profound difference between working with a fairly conceived blueprint and conceptualising one .
" there are a number of talented artisans that work well under guidance but they need more time to be able to come up with a good product that is globally marketable . "
the indian animation industry has already been globally recognised for its quality work at low costs , with many international production houses and entertainment companies such as walt disney outsourcing work .
industry estimates state the cost of making a full-length animated film in india will be almost 60 % cheaper than a similar film made in the us .
major deal and the potential for growth is tremendous .
in its annual report on the indian entertainment and media industry , the federation of indian chambers of commerce and industry has stated the industry can grow by 35 % and reach an annual turnover of 42 billion rupees -lrb- $ 933m -rrb- by 2009 .
presently , it is estimated at 12 billion rupees -lrb- $ 279m -rrb- , just 1 % of the global animation content development market estimated at 1,125 billion rupees -lrb- $ 25bn -rrb- .
mumbai 's crest animation studios has done work for many international producers .
recently , their us subsidiary richcrest animation signed an agreement with lionsgate entertainment in los angeles for jointly producing and financing three full-length animated films .
with constant upgrading of skills we will make our own quality animation features very soon crest animation 's a k madhavan chief executive a k madhavan says at present , india lacks " the world market sensibility in story telling techniques and -lrb- pre and post -rrb- production skills " .
despite that , he is upbeat .
" with constant upgrading of skills we will make our own quality animation features very soon . "
a full-length indigenously-made animated film , hanuman , was released last year and has had a successful run at the box office .

he does not care who loves or hates him - be they israelis or arabs .
the one aim in life for the former soldier and veteran politician was to ensure total security for israel on his terms .
for most of his career , that meant keeping maximum land and political rights for the jewish state and giving the very minimum of both to the palestinians .
his mission - his enemies call it a dangerous obsession - has been to fight for israel 's security , believing all the while that the end justifies the means .
but his plans for israeli settlers to withdraw from the gaza strip and parts of the west bank - completed in august 2005 - provoked ire from his staunchest supporters and were repeatedly voted down by his right-wing likud party .
he finally left likud in november to found a new party , kadima -lrb- forward -rrb- , which scored a narrow win in the march 2006 parliamentary election .
before he could lead kadima into the election , though , mr sharon effectively left israel 's political stage .
news that he had suffered a mild stroke on 18 december came as a surprise to his personal doctor , boleslaw goldman , who said that he had had no serious health problems in the past other than being very overweight .
on 4 january he suffered a second , more serious stroke .
he has fallen into a coma and shows few signs of emerging , despite several operations .
his deputy , ehud olmert , assumed his powers and was named prime minister after kadima 's election win .
tough commander mr sharon was born in palestine in 1928 , when it was a british mandate .
i do believe ariel sharon is a man of peace george w bush us president , speaking in 2002 as a young man he joined the jewish underground military organisation haganah , and fought in the arab-israeli war in 1948-49 after the creation of the jewish state .
in the 1950s he led a number of punitive military operations - one incident in 1953 when 50 houses in the village of qibya were blown up , killing 69 residents .
another in 1955 resulted in the deaths of 38 egyptian troops in the gaza strip .
mr sharon rose to the rank of brigadier general and commanded a division during the six-day war of june 1967 in which israel captured east jerusalem , the west bank and gaza strip .
the harsh occupation measures that he enforced there gave many palestinians their first taste of a man who has become their sworn enemy .
lebanon disaster mr sharon was first elected to the knesset in 1973 , but resigned a year later to serve as a security adviser to yitzhak rabin .
political career 1973 : elected knesset member for likud 1975-77 : prime minister yitzhak rabin 's special security adviser 1977-81 : minister of agriculture 1981-83 : minister of defence 1984-90 : minister of trade and industry 1990-92 : minister of construction and housing 1996-98 : minister of national infrastructure 1998-99 : foreign minister 2001-today : prime minister 2005 : left likud to found kadima he was later re-elected to the israeli parliament in 1977 .
mr sharon masterminded israel 's disastrous invasion of lebanon in 1982 .
as defence minister , and without explicitly telling prime minister menachem begin , he sent the israeli army all the way to beirut , a strike which ended in the expulsion of yasser arafat 's palestine liberation organisation -lrb- plo -rrb- from lebanon .
the move stopped the plo using lebanon to launch attacks against israel , but also resulted in the massacre of hundreds of palestinians by lebanese christian militiamen in two beirut refugee camps under israeli control .
mr sharon was removed from office in 1983 by an israeli tribunal investigating the 1982 lebanon invasion , finding him indirectly responsible for the killings .
political comeback for most politicians , an indictment of that kind would have meant the end of a political career .
sharon came to politics from a front-line army career but mr sharon remained a popular figure among the israeli right , and he felt that if he bided his time , then another opportunity would present itself .
as housing minister in the early 1990s , he presided over the biggest building drive in jewish settlements in the west bank and gaza since israel occupied the territories in 1967 .
after binyamin netanyahu 's right-wing coalition came to power in 1996 , the new israeli prime minister bowed to pressure to include the former army general in his cabinet .
on appointing him as foreign minister in 1998 , mr netanyahu said mr sharon was the best man for the job .

he does not care who loves or hates him - be they israelis or arabs .
the one aim in life for the former soldier and veteran politician was to ensure total security for israel on his terms .
for most of his career , that meant keeping maximum land and political rights for the jewish state and giving the very minimum of both to the palestinians .
his mission - his enemies call it a dangerous obsession - has been to fight for israel 's security , believing all the while that the end justifies the means .
but his plans for israeli settlers to withdraw from the gaza strip and parts of the west bank - completed in august 2005 - provoked ire from his staunchest supporters and were repeatedly voted down by his right-wing likud party .
he finally left likud in november to found a new party , kadima -lrb- forward -rrb- , which scored a narrow win in the march 2006 parliamentary election .
before he could lead kadima into the election , though , mr sharon effectively left israel 's political stage .
news that he had suffered a mild stroke on 18 december came as a surprise to his personal doctor , boleslaw goldman , who said that he had had no serious health problems in the past other than being very overweight .
on 4 january he suffered a second , more serious stroke .
he has fallen into a coma and shows few signs of emerging , despite several operations .

another in 1955 resulted in the deaths of 38 egyptian troops in the gaza strip .
mr sharon rose to the rank of brigadier general and commanded a division during the six-day war of june 1967 in which israel captured east jerusalem , the west bank and gaza strip .

the move stopped the plo using lebanon to launch attacks against israel , but also resulted in the massacre of hundreds of palestinians by lebanese christian militiamen in two beirut refugee camps under israeli control .
mr sharon was removed from office in 1983 by an israeli tribunal investigating the 1982 lebanon invasion , finding him indirectly responsible for the killings .

he does not care who loves or hates him - be they israelis or arabs .
the one aim in life for the former soldier and veteran politician was to ensure total security for israel on his terms .
for most of his career , that meant keeping maximum land and political rights for the jewish state and giving the very minimum of both to the palestinians .
his mission - his enemies call it a dangerous obsession - has been to fight for israel 's security , believing all the while that the end justifies the means .
but his plans for israeli settlers to withdraw from the gaza strip and parts of the west bank - completed in august 2005 - provoked ire from his staunchest supporters and were repeatedly voted down by his right-wing likud party .
he finally left likud in november to found a new party , kadima -lrb- forward -rrb- , which scored a narrow win in the march 2006 parliamentary election .
before he could lead kadima into the election , though , mr sharon effectively left israel 's political stage .
news that he had suffered a mild stroke on 18 december came as a surprise to his personal doctor , boleslaw goldman , who said that he had had no serious health problems in the past other than being very overweight .
on 4 january he suffered a second , more serious stroke .
he has fallen into a coma and shows few signs of emerging , despite several operations .
his deputy , ehud olmert , assumed his powers and was named prime minister after kadima 's election win .
tough commander mr sharon was born in palestine in 1928 , when it was a british mandate .
i do believe ariel sharon is a man of peace george w bush us president , speaking in 2002 as a young man he joined the jewish underground military organisation haganah , and fought in the arab-israeli war in 1948-49 after the creation of the jewish state .
in the 1950s he led a number of punitive military operations - one incident in 1953 when 50 houses in the village of qibya were blown up , killing 69 residents .
another in 1955 resulted in the deaths of 38 egyptian troops in the gaza strip .
mr sharon rose to the rank of brigadier general and commanded a division during the six-day war of june 1967 in which israel captured east jerusalem , the west bank and gaza strip .
the harsh occupation measures that he enforced there gave many palestinians their first taste of a man who has become their sworn enemy .
lebanon disaster mr sharon was first elected to the knesset in 1973 , but resigned a year later to serve as a security adviser to yitzhak rabin .
political career 1973 : elected knesset member for likud 1975-77 : prime minister yitzhak rabin 's special security adviser 1977-81 : minister of agriculture 1981-83 : minister of defence 1984-90 : minister of trade and industry 1990-92 : minister of construction and housing 1996-98 : minister of national infrastructure 1998-99 : foreign minister 2001-today : prime minister 2005 : left likud to found kadima he was later re-elected to the israeli parliament in 1977 .
mr sharon masterminded israel 's disastrous invasion of lebanon in 1982 .
as defence minister , and without explicitly telling prime minister menachem begin , he sent the israeli army all the way to beirut , a strike which ended in the expulsion of yasser arafat 's palestine liberation organisation -lrb- plo -rrb- from lebanon .
the move stopped the plo using lebanon to launch attacks against israel , but also resulted in the massacre of hundreds of palestinians by lebanese christian militiamen in two beirut refugee camps under israeli control .
mr sharon was removed from office in 1983 by an israeli tribunal investigating the 1982 lebanon invasion , finding him indirectly responsible for the killings .
political comeback for most politicians , an indictment of that kind would have meant the end of a political career .
sharon came to politics from a front-line army career but mr sharon remained a popular figure among the israeli right , and he felt that if he bided his time , then another opportunity would present itself .
as housing minister in the early 1990s , he presided over the biggest building drive in jewish settlements in the west bank and gaza since israel occupied the territories in 1967 .
after binyamin netanyahu 's right-wing coalition came to power in 1996 , the new israeli prime minister bowed to pressure to include the former army general in his cabinet .
on appointing him as foreign minister in 1998 , mr netanyahu said mr sharon was the best man for the job .
" we should n't deal with bygones , " he said .
" he has a record throughout his public life and during the past 15 years that people should be proud of . "
mr sharon went on to become leader of the right-wing likud party in opposition after mr netanyahu 's decisive defeat in the 1999 general election .
his son omri recently pleaded guilty to providing false testimony and falsifying documents following an investigation into corruption in the funding of mr sharon 's bid to lead likud .
however , mr sharon has consistently denied involvement , and has not been charged .
after the failure of the 2000 camp david talks , mr sharon sought to stir a public groundswell against the then prime minister ehud barak , depicting him as a usurper ready to trade jerusalem for a peace agreement .
' ' barak does not have the right to give up jerusalem , which the people received as a legacy , " mr sharon said at a parliamentary session .
new times , new party his controversial visit in 2000 to the al-aqsa mosque compound in east jerusalem , a site which is also holy to jews , was one of the sparks for the second palestinian intifada -lrb- uprising -rrb- .
critics say mr sharon knew the visit would trigger violence and gambled on the israeli public turning to a tough leader like him who would know how to handle it firmly .
0n 6 february 2001 he won a landslide victory , pledging to achieve " security and true peace " while insisting he would not be bound by previous negotiations with the palestinians .
us president george w bush called mr sharon a " man of peace " but his years in office have seen the prospects for a negotiated settlement with the palestinians recede at times , while the policy with syria appears to be marking time .
following a spate of suicide bombings and attacks by palestinian militants in israel in the 1990s and beyond , mr sharon sought to fortify the state by building the controversial west bank barrier .
however , he went on to withdraw from gaza and four settlements in the northern west bank in the face of great hostility at home .
he ruled out any further unilateral withdrawals and said he envisioned a map of israel 's eventual borders - not to be made public until the end of final-status talks with the palestinians .
amid the growing dissent within likud over the withdrawal from gaza , ariel sharon left the party in 2005 along with many allies to form kadima .
the party was seen by some largely as a vehicle for mr sharon , bringing together disparate politicians under the unifying influence of the veteran leader , but has been forced to find its own voice now that its founder has left the political stage .

the move stopped the plo using lebanon to launch attacks against israel , but also resulted in the massacre of hundreds of palestinians by lebanese christian militiamen in two beirut refugee camps under israeli control .
mr sharon was removed from office in 1983 by an israeli tribunal investigating the 1982 lebanon invasion , finding him indirectly responsible for the killings .
political comeback for most politicians , an indictment of that kind would have meant the end of a political career .
sharon came to politics from a front-line army career but mr sharon remained a popular figure among the israeli right , and he felt that if he bided his time , then another opportunity would present itself .
as housing minister in the early 1990s , he presided over the biggest building drive in jewish settlements in the west bank and gaza since israel occupied the territories in 1967 .
after binyamin netanyahu 's right-wing coalition came to power in 1996 , the new israeli prime minister bowed to pressure to include the former army general in his cabinet .
on appointing him as foreign minister in 1998 , mr netanyahu said mr sharon was the best man for the job .
" we should n't deal with bygones , " he said .
" he has a record throughout his public life and during the past 15 years that people should be proud of . "
mr sharon went on to become leader of the right-wing likud party in opposition after mr netanyahu 's decisive defeat in the 1999 general election .
his son omri recently pleaded guilty to providing false testimony and falsifying documents following an investigation into corruption in the funding of mr sharon 's bid to lead likud .
however , mr sharon has consistently denied involvement , and has not been charged .
after the failure of the 2000 camp david talks , mr sharon sought to stir a public groundswell against the then prime minister ehud barak , depicting him as a usurper ready to trade jerusalem for a peace agreement .
' ' barak does not have the right to give up jerusalem , which the people received as a legacy , " mr sharon said at a parliamentary session .

critics say mr sharon knew the visit would trigger violence and gambled on the israeli public turning to a tough leader like him who would know how to handle it firmly .
0n 6 february 2001 he won a landslide victory , pledging to achieve " security and true peace " while insisting he would not be bound by previous negotiations with the palestinians .
us president george w bush called mr sharon a " man of peace " but his years in office have seen the prospects for a negotiated settlement with the palestinians recede at times , while the policy with syria appears to be marking time .
following a spate of suicide bombings and attacks by palestinian militants in israel in the 1990s and beyond , mr sharon sought to fortify the state by building the controversial west bank barrier .
however , he went on to withdraw from gaza and four settlements in the northern west bank in the face of great hostility at home .
he ruled out any further unilateral withdrawals and said he envisioned a map of israel 's eventual borders - not to be made public until the end of final-status talks with the palestinians .
amid the growing dissent within likud over the withdrawal from gaza , ariel sharon left the party in 2005 along with many allies to form kadima .
the party was seen by some largely as a vehicle for mr sharon , bringing together disparate politicians under the unifying influence of the veteran leader , but has been forced to find its own voice now that its founder has left the political stage .

his mission - his enemies call it a dangerous obsession - has been to fight for israel 's security , believing all the while that the end justifies the means .
but his plans for israeli settlers to withdraw from the gaza strip and parts of the west bank - completed in august 2005 - provoked ire from his staunchest supporters and were repeatedly voted down by his right-wing likud party .

he does not care who loves or hates him - be they israelis or arabs .
the one aim in life for the former soldier and veteran politician was to ensure total security for israel on his terms .
for most of his career , that meant keeping maximum land and political rights for the jewish state and giving the very minimum of both to the palestinians .
his mission - his enemies call it a dangerous obsession - has been to fight for israel 's security , believing all the while that the end justifies the means .
but his plans for israeli settlers to withdraw from the gaza strip and parts of the west bank - completed in august 2005 - provoked ire from his staunchest supporters and were repeatedly voted down by his right-wing likud party .
he finally left likud in november to found a new party , kadima -lrb- forward -rrb- , which scored a narrow win in the march 2006 parliamentary election .
before he could lead kadima into the election , though , mr sharon effectively left israel 's political stage .
news that he had suffered a mild stroke on 18 december came as a surprise to his personal doctor , boleslaw goldman , who said that he had had no serious health problems in the past other than being very overweight .
on 4 january he suffered a second , more serious stroke .
he has fallen into a coma and shows few signs of emerging , despite several operations .
his deputy , ehud olmert , assumed his powers and was named prime minister after kadima 's election win .
tough commander mr sharon was born in palestine in 1928 , when it was a british mandate .
i do believe ariel sharon is a man of peace george w bush us president , speaking in 2002 as a young man he joined the jewish underground military organisation haganah , and fought in the arab-israeli war in 1948-49 after the creation of the jewish state .
in the 1950s he led a number of punitive military operations - one incident in 1953 when 50 houses in the village of qibya were blown up , killing 69 residents .
another in 1955 resulted in the deaths of 38 egyptian troops in the gaza strip .
mr sharon rose to the rank of brigadier general and commanded a division during the six-day war of june 1967 in which israel captured east jerusalem , the west bank and gaza strip .
the harsh occupation measures that he enforced there gave many palestinians their first taste of a man who has become their sworn enemy .
lebanon disaster mr sharon was first elected to the knesset in 1973 , but resigned a year later to serve as a security adviser to yitzhak rabin .

mr sharon masterminded israel 's disastrous invasion of lebanon in 1982 .
as defence minister , and without explicitly telling prime minister menachem begin , he sent the israeli army all the way to beirut , a strike which ended in the expulsion of yasser arafat 's palestine liberation organisation -lrb- plo -rrb- from lebanon .
the move stopped the plo using lebanon to launch attacks against israel , but also resulted in the massacre of hundreds of palestinians by lebanese christian militiamen in two beirut refugee camps under israeli control .
mr sharon was removed from office in 1983 by an israeli tribunal investigating the 1982 lebanon invasion , finding him indirectly responsible for the killings .
political comeback for most politicians , an indictment of that kind would have meant the end of a political career .
sharon came to politics from a front-line army career but mr sharon remained a popular figure among the israeli right , and he felt that if he bided his time , then another opportunity would present itself .
as housing minister in the early 1990s , he presided over the biggest building drive in jewish settlements in the west bank and gaza since israel occupied the territories in 1967 .
after binyamin netanyahu 's right-wing coalition came to power in 1996 , the new israeli prime minister bowed to pressure to include the former army general in his cabinet .
on appointing him as foreign minister in 1998 , mr netanyahu said mr sharon was the best man for the job .
" we should n't deal with bygones , " he said .
" he has a record throughout his public life and during the past 15 years that people should be proud of . "
mr sharon went on to become leader of the right-wing likud party in opposition after mr netanyahu 's decisive defeat in the 1999 general election .
his son omri recently pleaded guilty to providing false testimony and falsifying documents following an investigation into corruption in the funding of mr sharon 's bid to lead likud .
however , mr sharon has consistently denied involvement , and has not been charged .
after the failure of the 2000 camp david talks , mr sharon sought to stir a public groundswell against the then prime minister ehud barak , depicting him as a usurper ready to trade jerusalem for a peace agreement .
' ' barak does not have the right to give up jerusalem , which the people received as a legacy , " mr sharon said at a parliamentary session .
new times , new party his controversial visit in 2000 to the al-aqsa mosque compound in east jerusalem , a site which is also holy to jews , was one of the sparks for the second palestinian intifada -lrb- uprising -rrb- .
critics say mr sharon knew the visit would trigger violence and gambled on the israeli public turning to a tough leader like him who would know how to handle it firmly .
0n 6 february 2001 he won a landslide victory , pledging to achieve " security and true peace " while insisting he would not be bound by previous negotiations with the palestinians .
us president george w bush called mr sharon a " man of peace " but his years in office have seen the prospects for a negotiated settlement with the palestinians recede at times , while the policy with syria appears to be marking time .
following a spate of suicide bombings and attacks by palestinian militants in israel in the 1990s and beyond , mr sharon sought to fortify the state by building the controversial west bank barrier .
however , he went on to withdraw from gaza and four settlements in the northern west bank in the face of great hostility at home .
he ruled out any further unilateral withdrawals and said he envisioned a map of israel 's eventual borders - not to be made public until the end of final-status talks with the palestinians .
amid the growing dissent within likud over the withdrawal from gaza , ariel sharon left the party in 2005 along with many allies to form kadima .
