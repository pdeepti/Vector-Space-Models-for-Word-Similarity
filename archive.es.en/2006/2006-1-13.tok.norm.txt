some believe the real reason is a lack of interest and rising costs . it was going to be the first of its kind and an opening that would have shamed other sporting galas with its proposed pomp , preening and pop stars .
but with just five months to go before the fifa 2006 world cup gets underway , the star-studded spectacular - which would have heralded the long-awaited arrival of soccer 's greatest spectacle on german soil - has been unceremoniously dumped from the agenda . despite promising that the massive stage , which would have creaked like the knees of an aging rock star under the weight of such luminaries as brian eno , peter gabriel and the black eyed peas , would not damage the field at berlin ’ s olympiastadion , fifa cancelled the event apparently for just that reason . however , some in the german press know a cover-up when they smell one and it is likely to be revealed over the weekend that the gala event was actually cancelled because it is floating very few people 's boats .
lack of ticket sales , it is alleged , is the real reason for the cancellation . the berliner zeitung newspaper is expected to go public with revelations that the estimated 25 million euro -lrb- $ 30 million -rrb- costs are rising higher and faster than a david beckham penalty and that tickets are selling slower than those for a lothar matthäus spoken word event . blatter shedding crocodile tears for canceled event ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa president sepp blatter is an advocate of the beautiful game .
fifa are having none of it , however .
president sepp blatter maintained on friday that the gala had been cancelled on strictly sporting grounds . " personally , i still think the idea of holding such a high-profile opening event is a good one , " said blatter .
" fifa has not taken the decision to cancel the event at such a late stage lightly , but as world football 's governing body ; we must put sporting considerations first . " for conspiracy theorists , blatter 's statement arrived with a distinct whiff of fish .
the fifa president , when questioned in the past about the possibility of huge cultural event to launch the world cup , said : " football fans want to see matches .
they do n't want speeches , they want a few songs and they want to see football . "

the music , dance and performance art extravaganza was due to take place on june 7 , just six days before the first world cup match at the stadium on june 13 between world champions brazil and croatia .
fifa fears that a new pitch laid own to replace the grass trampled in the opening ceremony would not be in satisfactory condition for the match to take place . " it has since become clear that there would be considerable risks involved , not only in dismantling the stages and the event 's technical installations in time but also in laying a new field , which has to be in perfect playing condition by june 12 , " fifa said in a statement . things go from bad to worse for organizing committee bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could der kaiser be making a disguised gesture to his critics here ?
it is the latest embarrassing turn in the gala 's ill-fated story .
fifa had already rescheduled the gala ceremony and the first group match in berlin last year to give an extra 48 hours to lay down new rolls of grass and give the turf time to take hold . and the cancellation comes as another blow to the german organizing committee , which is currently sulking over a report from german consumer protection agency stiftung warentest , which warned that there were serious safety concerns at all 12 world cup venues . the gala 's artistic director , austrian andre heller , was naturally gutted by the news .

the international community still prefers pursuing negotiations , experts say . responding to iran 's decision to resume sensitive nuclear fuel work , europe 's three major powers on thursday asked for an emergency meeting of the un nuclear watchdog international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- to refer the issue to the un security council , which could slap sanctions . " we believe the time has now come for the security council to become involved to reinforce the authority of iaea resolutions , " the foreign ministers of britain , france and germany , who have been trying to coax iran into renouncing a nuclear weapons capability , said in berlin . us middle east experts interviewed dismiss the prospects of biting sanctions on iran . ray takeyh , a senior fellow at the council on foreign relations , felt that the europeans would be reluctant to slap tough sanctions against tehran . " but there are other things you may be able to do : diplomatic sanctions , reducing the size of iranian representatives abroad , reducing the size of the embassies , maybe barring some transfers of technology , " he said . " there are things you can do along the margins , which can be not very substantial but do have some symbolic importance at least . " too early to tell un diplomats said it was premature to discuss the various sanctions options given that the ball was still in the iaea court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : picture shows the uranium enrichment complex in the iranian town of isfahan they said the issue was unlikely to come before the 15-member council before next month when the united states takes over the rotating presidency of the powerful body . a european official speaking on the margins of the berlin meeting said the iaea board of governors could be convened " in the coming weeks . "
he refused to be more specific . " what we want to do is use the authority and weight of the security council to bring home to iran the importance of abiding the resolution of the iaea , " the official said .
" do n't expect us to move straight to sanctions . " negotiations broke down britain , france and germany have been leading more than two years of delicate negotiations with iran to allay western fears that it is seeking to develop a weapons programme , a charge the islamic republic strongly denies . iran sparked a furious international reaction this week for breaking seals on three nuclear facilities in order to resume nuclear fuel work . " the iranians have significant oil and gas reserves and the excess capacity in the system is quite tight , " jon alterman , middle east program director at the center for strategic and international studies in washington , told afp . " so the iranian bet is that with the current oil energy market there is no way that serious sanctions that will cripple the government are possibly in sight , " he told afp .
" the assumption is that the world can talk and bluster but at the end of the day it will not threaten -lrb- their -rrb- grip on power . " russia and china ? alterman pointed out that neither russia nor china - two veto-wielding permanent members of the security council which have significant economic interests in iran - were likely to back biting sanctions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea 's director general mohamed elbaradei has the key role in the dispute " if push comes to shove , they -lrb- russians and chinese -rrb- do n't want a war with the iranians but they want the iranians to reduce the level of tension that they are creating , " he added .
" and sanctions will not frighten the government of iran . " alterman saw the whole negotiating process as " a time game . " as to the prospect for us or israeli military action against iranian facilities , he said : " i do n't see the prospect of either one in the near term but i could envisage any number of scenarios in the next five years where that would be an option .

german intelligence agency expert erich schmidt-eenboom offers his take on the allegations that german secret agents were involved in assessing targets during the us military invasion in iraq . dw-world : both the süddeutsche zeitung and the television channel ard have reported that german agents helped the us pick out bombing targets - including saddam hussein .
what do you think of the accusations ? erich schmidt eenboom : they are partly justified .
the federal intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- surely kept up contact with their partner agency , the defense intelligence agency , despite the political tension between washington and berlin during the iraq war .
they surely also did that with the backing of the chancellor 's office .
as a result , the knowledgeable bnd agents in baghdad probably gathered information on targets to avoid but also , in my opinion , worthwhile targets . what they ca n't be accused of is functioning as real-time scouts , with the information they relayed back being used for us bombing attacks soon after . was it normal that bnd workers continued their work in iraq , even after the german embassy was closed ? the bnd has been baghdad since the early 1980s , and it has a very big and important office there .
the desire and need of the federal government for information , both leading up to the war and during the war , was large and gathering information locally is one of a foreign intelligence agency 's core duties . how far did intelligence cooperation go during the iraq war ?
and how much did the office of chancellor gerhard schröder know ?
the intelligence coordinator in the chancellor 's office , -lrb- current foreign minister frank-walter -rrb- steinmeier , surely knew the extent of the cooperation , and was kept up to date on the information exchange on the working level , which is defined by strict regulations .
the bnd agents most definitely did not have direct radio or fax communication with american agencies .
the contact probably always went through the -lrb- bnd headquarters -rrb- in pullach . the coalition government won a lot of respect in the arab world for their rejection of the iraq war .
will their reputation suffer a setback following these revelations ? partly , because i think that 's what 's behind the publication of these stories .
we 're experiencing a sort of psychological attack on the part of the american intelligence agencies against the old social democratic-green party coalition government , but also against the new government following merkel 's demand that the us close guantanamo bay .
the americans want to make clear - especially in light of their bad image following the cia torture allegations - that germany is n't as pure as assumed , because they were more involved in the iraq war than they said they were . is it possible that germany could become the target of islamic terrorists as a result of these allegations ? i do n't think so .
islamic terrorists , especially those in iraq , have other priorities , namely the american occupiers .
i think the growing militancy in afghanistan is more likely to have an effect in germany , creating a threatening scenario especially ahead and during the soccer world cup . to what extent ? that is hard to predict .
we 're experiencing a radicalization of youth and a professionalization of terrorism in afghanistan , but also in bosnia .
at one point , the terrorists and terrorism will no longer only be directed at german soldiers in those places , but against the motherland , against the country that sent them , namely germany .
it 's hard to say at what point that will happen and with what sort of intensity .
erich schmidt-eenboom is director of the research institute for peace policies and considered one of germany 's top experts on the bnd .
he was unwittingly spied on during his research into the bnd in the 1990s , an act for which the former intelligence agency head has apologized .

the international community still prefers pursuing negotiations , experts say . responding to iran 's decision to resume sensitive nuclear fuel work , europe 's three major powers on thursday asked for an emergency meeting of the un nuclear watchdog international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- to refer the issue to the un security council , which could slap sanctions . " we believe the time has now come for the security council to become involved to reinforce the authority of iaea resolutions , " the foreign ministers of britain , france and germany , who have been trying to coax iran into renouncing a nuclear weapons capability , said in berlin . us middle east experts interviewed dismiss the prospects of biting sanctions on iran . ray takeyh , a senior fellow at the council on foreign relations , felt that the europeans would be reluctant to slap tough sanctions against tehran . " but there are other things you may be able to do : diplomatic sanctions , reducing the size of iranian representatives abroad , reducing the size of the embassies , maybe barring some transfers of technology , " he said .

according to bush , the two spent some 45 minutes along together in the white house oval office . chancellor merkel told the assembled press at the joint press conference after the talks that germany would not be intimidated by iran .
she added that iran 's statements on israel and the holocaust were " totally unacceptable . " western countries " will not be intimidated " by iran 's decision to go ahead with its nuclear program , merkel said friday at a press conference with us president george w. bush .
" it 's essential , we feel , that the eu-3 -lrb- britain , france and germany -rrb- , together with the united states , take a common position here , become active , " merkel said following her first official meeting with bush as german chancellor . " we will not be intimidated by any country such as iran , " she vowed , adding that it was essential to persuade as many countries as possible to speak with one voice on the issue .
both leaders , however , expressed a desire to follow a diplomatic course in an attempt to come to a solution .
" we spent some time talking about the iranian issue and the desire to solve this issue diplomatically - by working together , " bush said . big job ahead bush opened the press conference by saying it was an honor to have chancellor merkel at the white house and that germany was a " valued ally " of the united states . " we 've got an important job ahead of us to work on key issues , like iran , " bush said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two stressed the common ground they share he thanked germany for the part it has played in the international security assistance force in afghanistan and , although the two countries have had their differences , welcomed germany ’ s support in the quest for democracy and stability in iraq . " it 's a difficult issue in our relationship and i understand that , " he said , but added the two countries shared a desire for the iraqi people to live in freedom . chancellor merkel said the two leaders had had a " very open and candid " discussion which was marked by a " spirit of trust " and opened a new chapter in the german-american relationship . guantanamo one highly anticipated subject was that of guantanamo bay on the island of cuba , where the us has a prison for terrorism suspects which falls outside the purview of us law .
last weekend , merkel had criticized the prison in a magazine interview , saying it should not exist " indefinitely . "
she said she would bring it up with the us president during their meeting . when bush was asked by a reporter about the topic , he said the german leader had indeed broached the subject and that he would like " to see a way forward . "
but he defended the treatment of prisoners there and said as long as there is a terrorist threat , guantanamo would still be needed . about 500 " war on terror " detainees are held at guantanamo , some for up to four years .

according to bush , the two spent some 45 minutes along together in the white house oval office . chancellor merkel told the assembled press at the joint press conference after the talks that germany would not be intimidated by iran .
she added that iran 's statements on israel and the holocaust were " totally unacceptable . " western countries " will not be intimidated " by iran 's decision to go ahead with its nuclear program , merkel said friday at a press conference with us president george w. bush .
" it 's essential , we feel , that the eu-3 -lrb- britain , france and germany -rrb- , together with the united states , take a common position here , become active , " merkel said following her first official meeting with bush as german chancellor . " we will not be intimidated by any country such as iran , " she vowed , adding that it was essential to persuade as many countries as possible to speak with one voice on the issue .
both leaders , however , expressed a desire to follow a diplomatic course in an attempt to come to a solution .
" we spent some time talking about the iranian issue and the desire to solve this issue diplomatically - by working together , " bush said . big job ahead bush opened the press conference by saying it was an honor to have chancellor merkel at the white house and that germany was a " valued ally " of the united states .

she said she would bring it up with the us president during their meeting . when bush was asked by a reporter about the topic , he said the german leader had indeed broached the subject and that he would like " to see a way forward . "

according to bush , the two spent some 45 minutes along together in the white house oval office . chancellor merkel told the assembled press at the joint press conference after the talks that germany would not be intimidated by iran .
she added that iran 's statements on israel and the holocaust were " totally unacceptable . " western countries " will not be intimidated " by iran 's decision to go ahead with its nuclear program , merkel said friday at a press conference with us president george w. bush .
" it 's essential , we feel , that the eu-3 -lrb- britain , france and germany -rrb- , together with the united states , take a common position here , become active , " merkel said following her first official meeting with bush as german chancellor . " we will not be intimidated by any country such as iran , " she vowed , adding that it was essential to persuade as many countries as possible to speak with one voice on the issue .
both leaders , however , expressed a desire to follow a diplomatic course in an attempt to come to a solution .
" we spent some time talking about the iranian issue and the desire to solve this issue diplomatically - by working together , " bush said . big job ahead bush opened the press conference by saying it was an honor to have chancellor merkel at the white house and that germany was a " valued ally " of the united states .

she said she would bring it up with the us president during their meeting . when bush was asked by a reporter about the topic , he said the german leader had indeed broached the subject and that he would like " to see a way forward . "
but he defended the treatment of prisoners there and said as long as there is a terrorist threat , guantanamo would still be needed . about 500 " war on terror " detainees are held at guantanamo , some for up to four years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a detainee inside the united states naval station in guantanamo bay , cuba merkel said that germany and other countries needed to come up with proposals on how to best deal with detainees " who do n't feel bound by any law . "
she said it was important to find how international law could address the issue and added that the un was a good forum in which to do that . " the common ground is that we have shared values even though from time to time we have differences of opinion , " she said . economic ties merkel said that while terrorism was the greatest challenge facing the world in the 21st century , she did not only want to define the two countries ' relationship by that issue alone .
she stressed that economic and trade issues were also crucial , particularly in the era of globalization and the rising economic power of china . she said for the countries to meet the challenges in today 's global world , they needed to be economically strong .
she added that there were some tendencies toward isolationism within the eu , but that countries should not go down that path . good pals ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor schörder and president bush were often at odds when asked if he and chancellor merkel had gotten on better than the president had with her predecessor , gerhard schröder , with whom he shared as relationship that was often icy , bush laughed and skirted the question . the two men were barely on speaking terms by the time schröder left office in november .

" mozart would have taken part in television shows and events , " he said .
" he wanted to be heard , and if he was alive today , i could imagine that he would be a pop star of some sort . " though the horse-drawn carriages and cobbled streets of his day are a far cry from the private jets and chauffeur-driven stretch limos today 's celebrities enjoy , mozart toured europe a number of times in his 35 years .
the opener was a four-year event that kicked off when he was just six years old and stormed through some 70 cities and royal courts across the continent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mozart 's father played the role of instructor , tutor and manager while proceeds from the initial tour went mainly to leopold mozart , wolfgang amadeus ' father , the younger mozart would have been happy to have the extra income from television appearances , cd sales and royalties to finance the luxurious apartments , trips to casinos and evenings out he enjoyed , according to hewig . the mozart brand known by name to nearly everyone in the world , regardless of their affection for classical music , mozart 's music is impossible to avoid .
" eine kleine nachtmusik " - whether recognized as " serenade no. 13 for strings in g major " or not - has been used to sell everything from pancakes to cars .
he can be heard piped through the telephone while on hold as well as by passengers waiting for the next train in munich 's subway stations . but it 's not only the music that brings in the money , especially as 2006 has been named mozart year in honor of his 250th birthday on jan .
27 .
salzburg 's mozartland , which bills itself as " the ultimate shop for mozart fans , " offers everything from mozart chocolates to sweatpants bearing the composer 's name . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : child composer whose works astonished adults of the period " the ' mozart ' brand is one of the best known in the world , " said arthur oberascher , head of the austrian national tourist office , estimating the brand 's value at about 5.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.5 billion -rrb- .
" it is no wonder we are seeing such a profusion of by-products . " a well-documented genius but even more than the abundance of mozart merchandise flooding the market , the extensive documentation of mozart 's life , including diaries and hundreds of letters he wrote , add another layer to interpretations of his music and virtually guarantee that even strangers to classical music find something about him that catches their interest . " mozart 's music brought an additional dimension to my life , and it 's my opinion that this ' drug ' can be administered to anyone , " said rudolf dörler of the stuttgart mozart society .
" his letters also show a struggling , positive person who continually gives encouragement in a number of ways . " the themes of mozart 's letters cover the same issues as can be found in today 's celebrity gossip pages .
some of the letters ' touch on the erotic , others border on obscene and still more detail his financial concerns , the death of his mother and the anxiety his father caused him . unusual tones for the times bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mozart experienced a variety of financial problems and died in debt under the demanding eye of his father , a successful musician in his own right , johann chrysostom wolfgang amadeus mozart composed his first piece of music at the age of five , wrote the first of 22 operas when he was 12 .
a more gifted child prodigy has yet to be found , according to hewig . mozart 's developed a musical style unlike what audiences of the day were accustomed to , and ultimately resulted in him failing to get a regular job with one of europe 's royal courts .
it also meant he had to make sure the music he wrote sold successfully . " mozart was uncompromising when it came to the quality of his music , " hewig said .
" but he wanted it to be well received , not to compose obscure music for small groups . " to do it , mozart worked hard , composing music in 30 of the 35 years he was alive , creating an oeuvre of about 630 pieces , including 27 piano concertos , over 40 symphonies and such famous operas as " the marriage of figaro , " " the magic flute " and " don giovanni , " which he is rumored to have finished in six weeks . " mozart was supremely confident of his skills , " dörler said .
" from today 's point of view , he had reason to be .

the european union , meanwhile , has promised more than $ 100 million to aid the global fight against the spread of the flu . the world health organization reported the mutation in the h5n1 virus after detecting it in the dna of two turkish patients on friday .
though the mutation allows the virus to adapt more easily to humans than to birds , experts said it was too early for widespread concern . " it 's a single discovery , which appearing isolated in a virus is not of much importance at the moment , " said dr. christian drosten , a virologist at the bernhardt-nocht institute for tropical medicine in hamburg in an interview .
" such single mutations do n't indicate whether a virus has gotten more dangerous . " test developed to detect mutations the report nevertheless raised the caution level .
the flu epidemic of 1918 , which killed tens of millions of people in a span of 18 months , jumped directly from birds to humans , according to researchers at the scripps research institute in california .
scientists and health care officials have watched the avian flu in turkey warily for signs of the same . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the virus has yet to jump from birds to humans in large numbers scripps scientists announced this week that they had developed a test to detect such mutations , warning health officials when the virus might jump ship from birds to humans .
at the moment , the h5n1 strain of the virus still primarily infects birds and only rarely passes to people .
since late 2003 , more than 70 people have been killed by the strain as it spread from asia to europe .
two have died in turkey and 15 have been infected since the beginning of the year , bringing the flu to europe 's doorstep and prompting a host of monitoring measures from european governments in recent days . virus showing no major changes on friday , the eu pledged $ 100 million -lrb- 82.6 million euros -rrb- in aid to go toward stopping the spread of the virus , and turkey stepped up bird inspections .
doctors on friday said they were testing whether the death of a 4-year-old girl in eastern turkey was caused by the virus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : avian flu is on europe 's doorstep drosten , the berlin scientist , said the development of the virus in turkey in the coming weeks will give scientists ideas on how to combat it .
at the moment , the virus is behaving the same way as it did in hong kong three years ago , where only the people who had contact with infected birds were themselves infected . he said mutations are difficult to combat .
" what you can do is to suppress the process by which mutations come about - the replication , " he said .
" in the case of h5n1 , that means eliminating the masses of replicated viruses by killing the infected birds .

but rather than solving the problem , the tactic creates new difficulties , says deutsche welle 's peter philipp . the simmering anger in berlin , london and paris in the last few days was an indication that iran 's resumption of research into nuclear fuel - particularly at the highly controversial natan enrichment plant - would not be without a drastic reaction . but the eu troika foreign ministers ' decision to refer iran to the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , and if necessary haul it before the un security council , does n't do justice to the expectations .

they would also be counterproductive for the economic interests of the europeans , who have until now furiously wooed iran on trade issues . besides , it is n't even clear yet whether sanctions will be agreed upon and whether they can then be forced on iran .
china , for instance , probably wo n't be interested in doing so , since it is dependant on iran for oil and gas .
and even russia 's stance is ambiguous , given that moscow is deeply involved in the development of iran 's nuclear plants . possible bitter retaliation but the biggest fallout from forced sanctions could be iran 's decision to get out of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
the country has been complying with the treaty 's guidelines so far , allowing the inspection of its nuclear facilities and cooperating with the vienna-based iaea . but all that could , with one stroke , come to an abrupt halt .
that would in turn increase mistrust on the part of the americans and some of the europeans and would lead to a deadlock , since the use of force would continue to be ruled out - the lessons of iraq were memorable enough . the developments in tehran will be followed calmly , because everyone knows well that sanctions would probably hurt the europeans more than iran .
that is common knowledge in washington and also a source of regret . europe just a paper tiger but what is even more regrettable is the fact that europe has once again shown itself to be a paper tiger and exposed itself to ridicule by the hardliners in tehran . it 's happened before , when the former ayatollah ali khomeini sneered at the exit of european diplomats : " let them go : they 'll come crawling back again .

german intelligence agency expert erich schmidt-eenboom offers his take on the allegations that german secret agents were involved in assessing targets during the us military invasion in iraq . dw-world : both the süddeutsche zeitung and the television channel ard have reported that german agents helped the us pick out bombing targets - including saddam hussein .
what do you think of the accusations ? erich schmidt eenboom : they are partly justified .
the federal intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- surely kept up contact with their partner agency , the defense intelligence agency , despite the political tension between washington and berlin during the iraq war .
they surely also did that with the backing of the chancellor 's office .
as a result , the knowledgeable bnd agents in baghdad probably gathered information on targets to avoid but also , in my opinion , worthwhile targets . what they ca n't be accused of is functioning as real-time scouts , with the information they relayed back being used for us bombing attacks soon after . was it normal that bnd workers continued their work in iraq , even after the german embassy was closed ? the bnd has been baghdad since the early 1980s , and it has a very big and important office there .
the desire and need of the federal government for information , both leading up to the war and during the war , was large and gathering information locally is one of a foreign intelligence agency 's core duties . how far did intelligence cooperation go during the iraq war ?
and how much did the office of chancellor gerhard schröder know ?
the intelligence coordinator in the chancellor 's office , -lrb- current foreign minister frank-walter -rrb- steinmeier , surely knew the extent of the cooperation , and was kept up to date on the information exchange on the working level , which is defined by strict regulations .
the bnd agents most definitely did not have direct radio or fax communication with american agencies .
the contact probably always went through the -lrb- bnd headquarters -rrb- in pullach . the coalition government won a lot of respect in the arab world for their rejection of the iraq war .
will their reputation suffer a setback following these revelations ? partly , because i think that 's what 's behind the publication of these stories .
we 're experiencing a sort of psychological attack on the part of the american intelligence agencies against the old social democratic-green party coalition government , but also against the new government following merkel 's demand that the us close guantanamo bay .
the americans want to make clear - especially in light of their bad image following the cia torture allegations - that germany is n't as pure as assumed , because they were more involved in the iraq war than they said they were . is it possible that germany could become the target of islamic terrorists as a result of these allegations ? i do n't think so .
islamic terrorists , especially those in iraq , have other priorities , namely the american occupiers .
i think the growing militancy in afghanistan is more likely to have an effect in germany , creating a threatening scenario especially ahead and during the soccer world cup . to what extent ? that is hard to predict .
we 're experiencing a radicalization of youth and a professionalization of terrorism in afghanistan , but also in bosnia .
at one point , the terrorists and terrorism will no longer only be directed at german soldiers in those places , but against the motherland , against the country that sent them , namely germany .
it 's hard to say at what point that will happen and with what sort of intensity .
erich schmidt-eenboom is director of the research institute for peace policies and considered one of germany 's top experts on the bnd .
he was unwittingly spied on during his research into the bnd in the 1990s , an act for which the former intelligence agency head has apologized .

" consumers are more ready to spend more money on better food . " one recent study shows that 35 to 40 percent of the population buys bio-products at least once a month ; possibly half of all germans even more regularly .
while the core demographic is educated shoppers with higher incomes , the trend is showing that more families with young children and pensioners are going ever more frequently to bio-stores . growth rate has been rising since 2000 the growth rate for organic products has been rising steadily since the turn of the century .

the law does not refer to specific forms of retaliation , but counter-measures could include resumption of uranium enrichment as well as refusing to adhere to the additional protocol of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , which gives increased inspection powers to the iaea . the additional protocol was signed by the previous reformist government but was never ratified by parliamentarians in the conservative-run parliament . compliance with the additional protocol is seen as being crucial to an iaea probe into allegations that iran is using an atomic energy drive as a cover for weapons development . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us remains wary of iran 's nuclear motives in washington , us secretary of state condoleezza rice accused tehran of a " deliberate escalation " of the dispute , and said it was in " dangerous defiance of the entire international community .

" the head of iran 's nuclear negotiating team javad vaidi said on state television thursday : " we are still hopeful that the negotiations can make progress . "
however , he warned that " if the europeans want to carry out the threats , it will cause iran 's behavior to change and intensify the present situation . " mottaki urged the europeans to deal with iran 's nuclear activities with " discretion , patience and a rational attitude . " " we advise the europeans to separate the question of research from producing the nuclear fuel and do not propagate around the nuclear research activities which had been unjustly suspended , " he said . " if they want to discuss making nuclear fuel we are ready to follow up with the negotiations with the eu-3 , " he said .
if the negotiations are broken off by the europeans " iran will only be in contact with the iaea to maintain its legitimate and natural rights .

but the trend is down to more than just health scares . as international green week , the yearly food , agriculture and horticulture exhibition , opens in berlin on friday , the organic food industry can feel very pleased with itself .
recent findings show that more people are turning towards bio-products in germany . however , the organic seal of quality comes at a price ; and usually it is a relatively high one compared to non-bio products .
but it seems that money is increasingly less important in german consumers ' quest for safe and healthy food . meat scandals have driven trend , not created it researchers have noted a definite change in german shopping habits of late , with ecologically sound products being the preferred target .

" numerous investigations by different research institutes have shown this . " according to the zmp 's own research , consumers believe that organic products are fresher and taste better - and price is a secondary condition .
" the attitude towards more expensive foods has changed , " rippin said .
" consumers are more ready to spend more money on better food . " one recent study shows that 35 to 40 percent of the population buys bio-products at least once a month ; possibly half of all germans even more regularly .
while the core demographic is educated shoppers with higher incomes , the trend is showing that more families with young children and pensioners are going ever more frequently to bio-stores . growth rate has been rising since 2000 the growth rate for organic products has been rising steadily since the turn of the century .

purely organic supermarkets have ridden the wave and boomed in the first half of the decade . those who expected a certain amount of stagnation in the market have been waiting in vain .

german intelligence agency expert erich schmidt-eenboom offers his take on the allegations that german secret agents were involved in assessing targets during the us military invasion in iraq . dw-world : both the süddeutsche zeitung and the television channel ard have reported that german agents helped the us pick out bombing targets - including saddam hussein .
what do you think of the accusations ? erich schmidt eenboom : they are partly justified .
the federal intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- surely kept up contact with their partner agency , the defense intelligence agency , despite the political tension between washington and berlin during the iraq war .
they surely also did that with the backing of the chancellor 's office .
as a result , the knowledgeable bnd agents in baghdad probably gathered information on targets to avoid but also , in my opinion , worthwhile targets . what they ca n't be accused of is functioning as real-time scouts , with the information they relayed back being used for us bombing attacks soon after . was it normal that bnd workers continued their work in iraq , even after the german embassy was closed ? the bnd has been baghdad since the early 1980s , and it has a very big and important office there .
the desire and need of the federal government for information , both leading up to the war and during the war , was large and gathering information locally is one of a foreign intelligence agency 's core duties . how far did intelligence cooperation go during the iraq war ?
and how much did the office of chancellor gerhard schröder know ?
the intelligence coordinator in the chancellor 's office , -lrb- current foreign minister frank-walter -rrb- steinmeier , surely knew the extent of the cooperation , and was kept up to date on the information exchange on the working level , which is defined by strict regulations .
the bnd agents most definitely did not have direct radio or fax communication with american agencies .
the contact probably always went through the -lrb- bnd headquarters -rrb- in pullach . the coalition government won a lot of respect in the arab world for their rejection of the iraq war .
will their reputation suffer a setback following these revelations ? partly , because i think that 's what 's behind the publication of these stories .
we 're experiencing a sort of psychological attack on the part of the american intelligence agencies against the old social democratic-green party coalition government , but also against the new government following merkel 's demand that the us close guantanamo bay .
the americans want to make clear - especially in light of their bad image following the cia torture allegations - that germany is n't as pure as assumed , because they were more involved in the iraq war than they said they were . is it possible that germany could become the target of islamic terrorists as a result of these allegations ? i do n't think so .
islamic terrorists , especially those in iraq , have other priorities , namely the american occupiers .
i think the growing militancy in afghanistan is more likely to have an effect in germany , creating a threatening scenario especially ahead and during the soccer world cup . to what extent ? that is hard to predict .
we 're experiencing a radicalization of youth and a professionalization of terrorism in afghanistan , but also in bosnia .
at one point , the terrorists and terrorism will no longer only be directed at german soldiers in those places , but against the motherland , against the country that sent them , namely germany .
it 's hard to say at what point that will happen and with what sort of intensity .
erich schmidt-eenboom is director of the research institute for peace policies and considered one of germany 's top experts on the bnd .
he was unwittingly spied on during his research into the bnd in the 1990s , an act for which the former intelligence agency head has apologized .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.01.2006 opinion : sanctions will hurt europe more than iran großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's vocal opposition in europe to iran 's nuclear dabbling germany , france and britain may refer iran to the un security council for nuclear breaches .
but rather than solving the problem , the tactic creates new difficulties , says deutsche welle 's peter philipp . the simmering anger in berlin , london and paris in the last few days was an indication that iran 's resumption of research into nuclear fuel - particularly at the highly controversial natan enrichment plant - would not be without a drastic reaction . but the eu troika foreign ministers ' decision to refer iran to the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , and if necessary haul it before the un security council , does n't do justice to the expectations .
instead , it 's akin to making a mountain of a molehill . new , bigger headaches ? the europeans have once again shown they are n't in a position to solve international problems .
in this case , they have not only failed to solve the problem , but perhaps also created the basis for new and bigger ones . should the us get its way and push through the imposition of sanctions on iran in the un security council , people in washington as well as in brussels , as indeed elsewhere in europe , are well aware that such sanctions - no matter how they are formulated - are n't an effective way of getting a country " on the right course . " it did n't work in iraq or in cuba and it has an even slimmer chance of working in iran . sanctions would be counterproductive that 's because iran currently earns well with its oil and gas exports and the iranian people too , despite all the criticism , are firmly backing their government on the nuclear issue . sanctions would just drive the iranians into the arms of their conservative leadership .
they would also be counterproductive for the economic interests of the europeans , who have until now furiously wooed iran on trade issues . besides , it is n't even clear yet whether sanctions will be agreed upon and whether they can then be forced on iran .
china , for instance , probably wo n't be interested in doing so , since it is dependant on iran for oil and gas .
and even russia 's stance is ambiguous , given that moscow is deeply involved in the development of iran 's nuclear plants . possible bitter retaliation but the biggest fallout from forced sanctions could be iran 's decision to get out of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
the country has been complying with the treaty 's guidelines so far , allowing the inspection of its nuclear facilities and cooperating with the vienna-based iaea . but all that could , with one stroke , come to an abrupt halt .
that would in turn increase mistrust on the part of the americans and some of the europeans and would lead to a deadlock , since the use of force would continue to be ruled out - the lessons of iraq were memorable enough . the developments in tehran will be followed calmly , because everyone knows well that sanctions would probably hurt the europeans more than iran .
that is common knowledge in washington and also a source of regret . europe just a paper tiger but what is even more regrettable is the fact that europe has once again shown itself to be a paper tiger and exposed itself to ridicule by the hardliners in tehran . it 's happened before , when the former ayatollah ali khomeini sneered at the exit of european diplomats : " let them go : they 'll come crawling back again .

german intelligence agency expert erich schmidt-eenboom offers his take on the allegations that german secret agents were involved in assessing targets during the us military invasion in iraq . dw-world : both the süddeutsche zeitung and the television channel ard have reported that german agents helped the us pick out bombing targets - including saddam hussein .
what do you think of the accusations ? erich schmidt eenboom : they are partly justified .
the federal intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- surely kept up contact with their partner agency , the defense intelligence agency , despite the political tension between washington and berlin during the iraq war .
they surely also did that with the backing of the chancellor 's office .
as a result , the knowledgeable bnd agents in baghdad probably gathered information on targets to avoid but also , in my opinion , worthwhile targets . what they ca n't be accused of is functioning as real-time scouts , with the information they relayed back being used for us bombing attacks soon after . was it normal that bnd workers continued their work in iraq , even after the german embassy was closed ? the bnd has been baghdad since the early 1980s , and it has a very big and important office there .
the desire and need of the federal government for information , both leading up to the war and during the war , was large and gathering information locally is one of a foreign intelligence agency 's core duties . how far did intelligence cooperation go during the iraq war ?
and how much did the office of chancellor gerhard schröder know ?
the intelligence coordinator in the chancellor 's office , -lrb- current foreign minister frank-walter -rrb- steinmeier , surely knew the extent of the cooperation , and was kept up to date on the information exchange on the working level , which is defined by strict regulations .

the international community still prefers pursuing negotiations , experts say . responding to iran 's decision to resume sensitive nuclear fuel work , europe 's three major powers on thursday asked for an emergency meeting of the un nuclear watchdog international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- to refer the issue to the un security council , which could slap sanctions . " we believe the time has now come for the security council to become involved to reinforce the authority of iaea resolutions , " the foreign ministers of britain , france and germany , who have been trying to coax iran into renouncing a nuclear weapons capability , said in berlin . us middle east experts interviewed dismiss the prospects of biting sanctions on iran . ray takeyh , a senior fellow at the council on foreign relations , felt that the europeans would be reluctant to slap tough sanctions against tehran . " but there are other things you may be able to do : diplomatic sanctions , reducing the size of iranian representatives abroad , reducing the size of the embassies , maybe barring some transfers of technology , " he said . " there are things you can do along the margins , which can be not very substantial but do have some symbolic importance at least . " too early to tell un diplomats said it was premature to discuss the various sanctions options given that the ball was still in the iaea court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : picture shows the uranium enrichment complex in the iranian town of isfahan they said the issue was unlikely to come before the 15-member council before next month when the united states takes over the rotating presidency of the powerful body . a european official speaking on the margins of the berlin meeting said the iaea board of governors could be convened " in the coming weeks . "
he refused to be more specific . " what we want to do is use the authority and weight of the security council to bring home to iran the importance of abiding the resolution of the iaea , " the official said .
" do n't expect us to move straight to sanctions . " negotiations broke down britain , france and germany have been leading more than two years of delicate negotiations with iran to allay western fears that it is seeking to develop a weapons programme , a charge the islamic republic strongly denies . iran sparked a furious international reaction this week for breaking seals on three nuclear facilities in order to resume nuclear fuel work . " the iranians have significant oil and gas reserves and the excess capacity in the system is quite tight , " jon alterman , middle east program director at the center for strategic and international studies in washington , told afp . " so the iranian bet is that with the current oil energy market there is no way that serious sanctions that will cripple the government are possibly in sight , " he told afp .
" the assumption is that the world can talk and bluster but at the end of the day it will not threaten -lrb- their -rrb- grip on power . " russia and china ? alterman pointed out that neither russia nor china - two veto-wielding permanent members of the security council which have significant economic interests in iran - were likely to back biting sanctions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea 's director general mohamed elbaradei has the key role in the dispute " if push comes to shove , they -lrb- russians and chinese -rrb- do n't want a war with the iranians but they want the iranians to reduce the level of tension that they are creating , " he added .
" and sanctions will not frighten the government of iran . " alterman saw the whole negotiating process as " a time game . " as to the prospect for us or israeli military action against iranian facilities , he said : " i do n't see the prospect of either one in the near term but i could envisage any number of scenarios in the next five years where that would be an option .

german intelligence agency expert erich schmidt-eenboom offers his take on the allegations that german secret agents were involved in assessing targets during the us military invasion in iraq . dw-world : both the süddeutsche zeitung and the television channel ard have reported that german agents helped the us pick out bombing targets - including saddam hussein .
what do you think of the accusations ? erich schmidt eenboom : they are partly justified .
the federal intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- surely kept up contact with their partner agency , the defense intelligence agency , despite the political tension between washington and berlin during the iraq war .
they surely also did that with the backing of the chancellor 's office .
as a result , the knowledgeable bnd agents in baghdad probably gathered information on targets to avoid but also , in my opinion , worthwhile targets . what they ca n't be accused of is functioning as real-time scouts , with the information they relayed back being used for us bombing attacks soon after . was it normal that bnd workers continued their work in iraq , even after the german embassy was closed ? the bnd has been baghdad since the early 1980s , and it has a very big and important office there .
the desire and need of the federal government for information , both leading up to the war and during the war , was large and gathering information locally is one of a foreign intelligence agency 's core duties . how far did intelligence cooperation go during the iraq war ?
and how much did the office of chancellor gerhard schröder know ?
the intelligence coordinator in the chancellor 's office , -lrb- current foreign minister frank-walter -rrb- steinmeier , surely knew the extent of the cooperation , and was kept up to date on the information exchange on the working level , which is defined by strict regulations .
the bnd agents most definitely did not have direct radio or fax communication with american agencies .
the contact probably always went through the -lrb- bnd headquarters -rrb- in pullach . the coalition government won a lot of respect in the arab world for their rejection of the iraq war .
will their reputation suffer a setback following these revelations ? partly , because i think that 's what 's behind the publication of these stories .
we 're experiencing a sort of psychological attack on the part of the american intelligence agencies against the old social democratic-green party coalition government , but also against the new government following merkel 's demand that the us close guantanamo bay .
the americans want to make clear - especially in light of their bad image following the cia torture allegations - that germany is n't as pure as assumed , because they were more involved in the iraq war than they said they were . is it possible that germany could become the target of islamic terrorists as a result of these allegations ? i do n't think so .
islamic terrorists , especially those in iraq , have other priorities , namely the american occupiers .
i think the growing militancy in afghanistan is more likely to have an effect in germany , creating a threatening scenario especially ahead and during the soccer world cup . to what extent ? that is hard to predict .
we 're experiencing a radicalization of youth and a professionalization of terrorism in afghanistan , but also in bosnia .
at one point , the terrorists and terrorism will no longer only be directed at german soldiers in those places , but against the motherland , against the country that sent them , namely germany .
it 's hard to say at what point that will happen and with what sort of intensity .
erich schmidt-eenboom is director of the research institute for peace policies and considered one of germany 's top experts on the bnd .
he was unwittingly spied on during his research into the bnd in the 1990s , an act for which the former intelligence agency head has apologized .
lenz hörburger interviewed erich schmidt-eenboom -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : german secret agents helped in iraq invasion a scandal is brewing in political berlin after two news organizations reported wednesday that german intelligence agents helped the us during military operations in iraq .
germany 's foreign minister denied the reports .
-lrb- jan .
12 , 2006 -rrb- german officials may have helped cia detain german during bundestag hearings on wednesday , the german government denied any involvement in the alleged cia abductions of suspected terrorists , but not all parliamentarians were convinced .
-lrb- dec .
14 , 2005 -rrb- germany to extend troops ' mandate in war on terror the outgoing german cabinet agreed on wednesday to extend the mandate of the country 's troops in the us-led " operation enduring freedom " by a year from november 15 , a spokesman said .

some believe the real reason is a lack of interest and rising costs . it was going to be the first of its kind and an opening that would have shamed other sporting galas with its proposed pomp , preening and pop stars .
but with just five months to go before the fifa 2006 world cup gets underway , the star-studded spectacular - which would have heralded the long-awaited arrival of soccer 's greatest spectacle on german soil - has been unceremoniously dumped from the agenda . despite promising that the massive stage , which would have creaked like the knees of an aging rock star under the weight of such luminaries as brian eno , peter gabriel and the black eyed peas , would not damage the field at berlin ’ s olympiastadion , fifa cancelled the event apparently for just that reason . however , some in the german press know a cover-up when they smell one and it is likely to be revealed over the weekend that the gala event was actually cancelled because it is floating very few people 's boats .
lack of ticket sales , it is alleged , is the real reason for the cancellation . the berliner zeitung newspaper is expected to go public with revelations that the estimated 25 million euro -lrb- $ 30 million -rrb- costs are rising higher and faster than a david beckham penalty and that tickets are selling slower than those for a lothar matthäus spoken word event . blatter shedding crocodile tears for canceled event ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa president sepp blatter is an advocate of the beautiful game .
fifa are having none of it , however .
president sepp blatter maintained on friday that the gala had been cancelled on strictly sporting grounds . " personally , i still think the idea of holding such a high-profile opening event is a good one , " said blatter .
" fifa has not taken the decision to cancel the event at such a late stage lightly , but as world football 's governing body ; we must put sporting considerations first . " for conspiracy theorists , blatter 's statement arrived with a distinct whiff of fish .
the fifa president , when questioned in the past about the possibility of huge cultural event to launch the world cup , said : " football fans want to see matches .
they do n't want speeches , they want a few songs and they want to see football . "
with such a ringing endorsement , critics believe , the gala was living on borrowed time from the off . first group game would come just six days after gala bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's olympiastadion will host reigning champion brazil 's first game .
the music , dance and performance art extravaganza was due to take place on june 7 , just six days before the first world cup match at the stadium on june 13 between world champions brazil and croatia .
fifa fears that a new pitch laid own to replace the grass trampled in the opening ceremony would not be in satisfactory condition for the match to take place . " it has since become clear that there would be considerable risks involved , not only in dismantling the stages and the event 's technical installations in time but also in laying a new field , which has to be in perfect playing condition by june 12 , " fifa said in a statement . things go from bad to worse for organizing committee bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could der kaiser be making a disguised gesture to his critics here ?
it is the latest embarrassing turn in the gala 's ill-fated story .
fifa had already rescheduled the gala ceremony and the first group match in berlin last year to give an extra 48 hours to lay down new rolls of grass and give the turf time to take hold . and the cancellation comes as another blow to the german organizing committee , which is currently sulking over a report from german consumer protection agency stiftung warentest , which warned that there were serious safety concerns at all 12 world cup venues . the gala 's artistic director , austrian andre heller , was naturally gutted by the news .

some believe the real reason is a lack of interest and rising costs . it was going to be the first of its kind and an opening that would have shamed other sporting galas with its proposed pomp , preening and pop stars .
but with just five months to go before the fifa 2006 world cup gets underway , the star-studded spectacular - which would have heralded the long-awaited arrival of soccer 's greatest spectacle on german soil - has been unceremoniously dumped from the agenda . despite promising that the massive stage , which would have creaked like the knees of an aging rock star under the weight of such luminaries as brian eno , peter gabriel and the black eyed peas , would not damage the field at berlin ’ s olympiastadion , fifa cancelled the event apparently for just that reason . however , some in the german press know a cover-up when they smell one and it is likely to be revealed over the weekend that the gala event was actually cancelled because it is floating very few people 's boats .
lack of ticket sales , it is alleged , is the real reason for the cancellation . the berliner zeitung newspaper is expected to go public with revelations that the estimated 25 million euro -lrb- $ 30 million -rrb- costs are rising higher and faster than a david beckham penalty and that tickets are selling slower than those for a lothar matthäus spoken word event . blatter shedding crocodile tears for canceled event ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa president sepp blatter is an advocate of the beautiful game .
fifa are having none of it , however .
president sepp blatter maintained on friday that the gala had been cancelled on strictly sporting grounds . " personally , i still think the idea of holding such a high-profile opening event is a good one , " said blatter .
" fifa has not taken the decision to cancel the event at such a late stage lightly , but as world football 's governing body ; we must put sporting considerations first . " for conspiracy theorists , blatter 's statement arrived with a distinct whiff of fish .

" if the dossier is sent to the security council , the european countries will lose the means which are currently at their disposal , because ... the government will be obliged , in conformity with the law adopted by parliament , to end all its voluntary measures of cooperation , " iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki was quoted as saying by the official irna news agency . iran 's standoff with the international community escalated after tehran on tuesday resumed sensitive nuclear research linked to uranium enrichment , which produces fuel for nuclear power reactors but can also be used to make atomic bombs . europe 's three major powers responded by calling for an emergency meeting of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , while un chief kofi annan said iran was still keen on pursuing nuclear talks with european powers . british foreign secretary jack straw said consensus was growing among the international community , including russia , for action but said the military option was not being considered . " i think in current circumstances it would not be conceivable , it would not be appropriate , " he said .
" iran is not iraq , we 're working with the international community to resolve this in a peaceful and diplomatic manner . " iran in " dangerous defiance " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad is a controversial figure internationally in december iran 's hardline president mahmoud ahmadinejad signed off on legislation that could limit un inspections at iran 's nuclear sites if its case is taken to the security council . the law obliges the government to " stop voluntary and non-legally binding measures and implement its scientific , research and executive programs " if the security council gets involved . ahmadinejad has ordered iran 's atomic energy agency to be prepared to apply the law , the fars news agency reported .
the law does not refer to specific forms of retaliation , but counter-measures could include resumption of uranium enrichment as well as refusing to adhere to the additional protocol of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , which gives increased inspection powers to the iaea . the additional protocol was signed by the previous reformist government but was never ratified by parliamentarians in the conservative-run parliament . compliance with the additional protocol is seen as being crucial to an iaea probe into allegations that iran is using an atomic energy drive as a cover for weapons development . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us remains wary of iran 's nuclear motives in washington , us secretary of state condoleezza rice accused tehran of a " deliberate escalation " of the dispute , and said it was in " dangerous defiance of the entire international community . " while threatening to halt cooperation , iranian officials have nevertheless signaled their willingness for negotiations to be continued , but on their terms . iran still interested in talks after a telephone conversation with iran 's top nuclear negotiator ali larijani , annan said thursday that tehran was still keen on pursuing " serious " nuclear talks with european powers . " he affirmed to me that they are interested in serious and constructive negotiation , but within a timeframe , " annan said , quoting larijani as saying that the previous round of negotiations " had lasted two and a half years without any results . " the head of iran 's nuclear negotiating team javad vaidi said on state television thursday : " we are still hopeful that the negotiations can make progress . "
however , he warned that " if the europeans want to carry out the threats , it will cause iran 's behavior to change and intensify the present situation . " mottaki urged the europeans to deal with iran 's nuclear activities with " discretion , patience and a rational attitude . " " we advise the europeans to separate the question of research from producing the nuclear fuel and do not propagate around the nuclear research activities which had been unjustly suspended , " he said . " if they want to discuss making nuclear fuel we are ready to follow up with the negotiations with the eu-3 , " he said .

but the trend is down to more than just health scares . as international green week , the yearly food , agriculture and horticulture exhibition , opens in berlin on friday , the organic food industry can feel very pleased with itself .
recent findings show that more people are turning towards bio-products in germany . however , the organic seal of quality comes at a price ; and usually it is a relatively high one compared to non-bio products .
but it seems that money is increasingly less important in german consumers ' quest for safe and healthy food . meat scandals have driven trend , not created it researchers have noted a definite change in german shopping habits of late , with ecologically sound products being the preferred target .
markus rippin from germany 's central market and price monitoring agency -lrb- zmp -rrb- believes that , while recent factors have driven the trend , it 's no flash in the pan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recent meat scandal in germany is only one factor in the turn towards organic produce " this trend is showing longevity , and is not just influenced by events like bse , " he told german broadcaster tageschau .
" numerous investigations by different research institutes have shown this . " according to the zmp 's own research , consumers believe that organic products are fresher and taste better - and price is a secondary condition .
" the attitude towards more expensive foods has changed , " rippin said .
" consumers are more ready to spend more money on better food . " one recent study shows that 35 to 40 percent of the population buys bio-products at least once a month ; possibly half of all germans even more regularly .
while the core demographic is educated shoppers with higher incomes , the trend is showing that more families with young children and pensioners are going ever more frequently to bio-stores . growth rate has been rising since 2000 the growth rate for organic products has been rising steadily since the turn of the century .
in 2000 , the german organic food industry was predicting a year-on-year growth of 10 percent .
by 2004 , products such as vegetable juice had seen a 55 percent rise .
other products experiencing similar growth include milk products and baby food . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organic bread ?
yes , please !
last year , an estimated 4 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.8 billion -rrb- were spent on organically produced food in germany , an increase of 10 to 15 percent in revenue from 2004 .
the revenue produced from bio-food in germany has been steadily on the rise for the past five years with 2001 seeing a massive 30 percent surge in profits . more stores , more diversity extending trend 's lifespan since then , more and more stores , especially supermarkets and drugstores , have been increasing their selections of bio-food to meet consumer demand .
purely organic supermarkets have ridden the wave and boomed in the first half of the decade . those who expected a certain amount of stagnation in the market have been waiting in vain .
on the contrary , ever more organic products are featuring on the shelves of increasingly diverse businesses , from clothing to paint .
the distribution network for bio-products has also improved , meaning the supply is equipped to meet demand . it appears that the organic success story has yet to reach its final page . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de celebrating an ecologically friendly christmas most people want to celebrate the holidays in traditional fashion and have fun doing so .

but the trend is down to more than just health scares . as international green week , the yearly food , agriculture and horticulture exhibition , opens in berlin on friday , the organic food industry can feel very pleased with itself .
recent findings show that more people are turning towards bio-products in germany . however , the organic seal of quality comes at a price ; and usually it is a relatively high one compared to non-bio products .
but it seems that money is increasingly less important in german consumers ' quest for safe and healthy food . meat scandals have driven trend , not created it researchers have noted a definite change in german shopping habits of late , with ecologically sound products being the preferred target .
markus rippin from germany 's central market and price monitoring agency -lrb- zmp -rrb- believes that , while recent factors have driven the trend , it 's no flash in the pan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recent meat scandal in germany is only one factor in the turn towards organic produce " this trend is showing longevity , and is not just influenced by events like bse , " he told german broadcaster tageschau .
" numerous investigations by different research institutes have shown this . " according to the zmp 's own research , consumers believe that organic products are fresher and taste better - and price is a secondary condition .
" the attitude towards more expensive foods has changed , " rippin said .
" consumers are more ready to spend more money on better food . " one recent study shows that 35 to 40 percent of the population buys bio-products at least once a month ; possibly half of all germans even more regularly .
while the core demographic is educated shoppers with higher incomes , the trend is showing that more families with young children and pensioners are going ever more frequently to bio-stores . growth rate has been rising since 2000 the growth rate for organic products has been rising steadily since the turn of the century .
in 2000 , the german organic food industry was predicting a year-on-year growth of 10 percent .
by 2004 , products such as vegetable juice had seen a 55 percent rise .
other products experiencing similar growth include milk products and baby food . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organic bread ?
yes , please !
last year , an estimated 4 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.8 billion -rrb- were spent on organically produced food in germany , an increase of 10 to 15 percent in revenue from 2004 .
the revenue produced from bio-food in germany has been steadily on the rise for the past five years with 2001 seeing a massive 30 percent surge in profits . more stores , more diversity extending trend 's lifespan since then , more and more stores , especially supermarkets and drugstores , have been increasing their selections of bio-food to meet consumer demand .
purely organic supermarkets have ridden the wave and boomed in the first half of the decade . those who expected a certain amount of stagnation in the market have been waiting in vain .
on the contrary , ever more organic products are featuring on the shelves of increasingly diverse businesses , from clothing to paint .
the distribution network for bio-products has also improved , meaning the supply is equipped to meet demand . it appears that the organic success story has yet to reach its final page . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de celebrating an ecologically friendly christmas most people want to celebrate the holidays in traditional fashion and have fun doing so .

according to bush , the two spent some 45 minutes along together in the white house oval office . chancellor merkel told the assembled press at the joint press conference after the talks that germany would not be intimidated by iran .
she added that iran 's statements on israel and the holocaust were " totally unacceptable . " western countries " will not be intimidated " by iran 's decision to go ahead with its nuclear program , merkel said friday at a press conference with us president george w. bush .
" it 's essential , we feel , that the eu-3 -lrb- britain , france and germany -rrb- , together with the united states , take a common position here , become active , " merkel said following her first official meeting with bush as german chancellor . " we will not be intimidated by any country such as iran , " she vowed , adding that it was essential to persuade as many countries as possible to speak with one voice on the issue .
both leaders , however , expressed a desire to follow a diplomatic course in an attempt to come to a solution .
" we spent some time talking about the iranian issue and the desire to solve this issue diplomatically - by working together , " bush said . big job ahead bush opened the press conference by saying it was an honor to have chancellor merkel at the white house and that germany was a " valued ally " of the united states . " we 've got an important job ahead of us to work on key issues , like iran , " bush said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two stressed the common ground they share he thanked germany for the part it has played in the international security assistance force in afghanistan and , although the two countries have had their differences , welcomed germany ’ s support in the quest for democracy and stability in iraq . " it 's a difficult issue in our relationship and i understand that , " he said , but added the two countries shared a desire for the iraqi people to live in freedom . chancellor merkel said the two leaders had had a " very open and candid " discussion which was marked by a " spirit of trust " and opened a new chapter in the german-american relationship . guantanamo one highly anticipated subject was that of guantanamo bay on the island of cuba , where the us has a prison for terrorism suspects which falls outside the purview of us law .
last weekend , merkel had criticized the prison in a magazine interview , saying it should not exist " indefinitely . "
she said she would bring it up with the us president during their meeting . when bush was asked by a reporter about the topic , he said the german leader had indeed broached the subject and that he would like " to see a way forward . "
but he defended the treatment of prisoners there and said as long as there is a terrorist threat , guantanamo would still be needed . about 500 " war on terror " detainees are held at guantanamo , some for up to four years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a detainee inside the united states naval station in guantanamo bay , cuba merkel said that germany and other countries needed to come up with proposals on how to best deal with detainees " who do n't feel bound by any law . "
she said it was important to find how international law could address the issue and added that the un was a good forum in which to do that . " the common ground is that we have shared values even though from time to time we have differences of opinion , " she said . economic ties merkel said that while terrorism was the greatest challenge facing the world in the 21st century , she did not only want to define the two countries ' relationship by that issue alone .
she stressed that economic and trade issues were also crucial , particularly in the era of globalization and the rising economic power of china . she said for the countries to meet the challenges in today 's global world , they needed to be economically strong .
she added that there were some tendencies toward isolationism within the eu , but that countries should not go down that path . good pals ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor schörder and president bush were often at odds when asked if he and chancellor merkel had gotten on better than the president had with her predecessor , gerhard schröder , with whom he shared as relationship that was often icy , bush laughed and skirted the question . the two men were barely on speaking terms by the time schröder left office in november .
bush did say , however , wanted to send his best regards to the former chancellor . regarding to the current german leader , merkel , bush said : " she 's smart , capable , and there 's a spirit to her that is appealing .
she loves freedom . " merkel told reporters after the talks that she will return to the united states in may to attend the annual meeting of the american jewish committee .

the european union , meanwhile , has promised more than $ 100 million to aid the global fight against the spread of the flu . the world health organization reported the mutation in the h5n1 virus after detecting it in the dna of two turkish patients on friday .
though the mutation allows the virus to adapt more easily to humans than to birds , experts said it was too early for widespread concern . " it 's a single discovery , which appearing isolated in a virus is not of much importance at the moment , " said dr. christian drosten , a virologist at the bernhardt-nocht institute for tropical medicine in hamburg in an interview .
" such single mutations do n't indicate whether a virus has gotten more dangerous . " test developed to detect mutations the report nevertheless raised the caution level .
the flu epidemic of 1918 , which killed tens of millions of people in a span of 18 months , jumped directly from birds to humans , according to researchers at the scripps research institute in california .
scientists and health care officials have watched the avian flu in turkey warily for signs of the same . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the virus has yet to jump from birds to humans in large numbers scripps scientists announced this week that they had developed a test to detect such mutations , warning health officials when the virus might jump ship from birds to humans .
at the moment , the h5n1 strain of the virus still primarily infects birds and only rarely passes to people .
since late 2003 , more than 70 people have been killed by the strain as it spread from asia to europe .
two have died in turkey and 15 have been infected since the beginning of the year , bringing the flu to europe 's doorstep and prompting a host of monitoring measures from european governments in recent days . virus showing no major changes on friday , the eu pledged $ 100 million -lrb- 82.6 million euros -rrb- in aid to go toward stopping the spread of the virus , and turkey stepped up bird inspections .
doctors on friday said they were testing whether the death of a 4-year-old girl in eastern turkey was caused by the virus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : avian flu is on europe 's doorstep drosten , the berlin scientist , said the development of the virus in turkey in the coming weeks will give scientists ideas on how to combat it .
at the moment , the virus is behaving the same way as it did in hong kong three years ago , where only the people who had contact with infected birds were themselves infected . he said mutations are difficult to combat .
" what you can do is to suppress the process by which mutations come about - the replication , " he said .

" if the dossier is sent to the security council , the european countries will lose the means which are currently at their disposal , because ... the government will be obliged , in conformity with the law adopted by parliament , to end all its voluntary measures of cooperation , " iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki was quoted as saying by the official irna news agency . iran 's standoff with the international community escalated after tehran on tuesday resumed sensitive nuclear research linked to uranium enrichment , which produces fuel for nuclear power reactors but can also be used to make atomic bombs . europe 's three major powers responded by calling for an emergency meeting of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , while un chief kofi annan said iran was still keen on pursuing nuclear talks with european powers . british foreign secretary jack straw said consensus was growing among the international community , including russia , for action but said the military option was not being considered . " i think in current circumstances it would not be conceivable , it would not be appropriate , " he said .
" iran is not iraq , we 're working with the international community to resolve this in a peaceful and diplomatic manner . " iran in " dangerous defiance " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad is a controversial figure internationally in december iran 's hardline president mahmoud ahmadinejad signed off on legislation that could limit un inspections at iran 's nuclear sites if its case is taken to the security council . the law obliges the government to " stop voluntary and non-legally binding measures and implement its scientific , research and executive programs " if the security council gets involved . ahmadinejad has ordered iran 's atomic energy agency to be prepared to apply the law , the fars news agency reported .
the law does not refer to specific forms of retaliation , but counter-measures could include resumption of uranium enrichment as well as refusing to adhere to the additional protocol of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , which gives increased inspection powers to the iaea . the additional protocol was signed by the previous reformist government but was never ratified by parliamentarians in the conservative-run parliament . compliance with the additional protocol is seen as being crucial to an iaea probe into allegations that iran is using an atomic energy drive as a cover for weapons development . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us remains wary of iran 's nuclear motives in washington , us secretary of state condoleezza rice accused tehran of a " deliberate escalation " of the dispute , and said it was in " dangerous defiance of the entire international community . " while threatening to halt cooperation , iranian officials have nevertheless signaled their willingness for negotiations to be continued , but on their terms . iran still interested in talks after a telephone conversation with iran 's top nuclear negotiator ali larijani , annan said thursday that tehran was still keen on pursuing " serious " nuclear talks with european powers . " he affirmed to me that they are interested in serious and constructive negotiation , but within a timeframe , " annan said , quoting larijani as saying that the previous round of negotiations " had lasted two and a half years without any results . " the head of iran 's nuclear negotiating team javad vaidi said on state television thursday : " we are still hopeful that the negotiations can make progress . "
however , he warned that " if the europeans want to carry out the threats , it will cause iran 's behavior to change and intensify the present situation . " mottaki urged the europeans to deal with iran 's nuclear activities with " discretion , patience and a rational attitude . " " we advise the europeans to separate the question of research from producing the nuclear fuel and do not propagate around the nuclear research activities which had been unjustly suspended , " he said . " if they want to discuss making nuclear fuel we are ready to follow up with the negotiations with the eu-3 , " he said .
if the negotiations are broken off by the europeans " iran will only be in contact with the iaea to maintain its legitimate and natural rights .

" mozart would have taken part in television shows and events , " he said .
" he wanted to be heard , and if he was alive today , i could imagine that he would be a pop star of some sort . " though the horse-drawn carriages and cobbled streets of his day are a far cry from the private jets and chauffeur-driven stretch limos today 's celebrities enjoy , mozart toured europe a number of times in his 35 years .
the opener was a four-year event that kicked off when he was just six years old and stormed through some 70 cities and royal courts across the continent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mozart 's father played the role of instructor , tutor and manager while proceeds from the initial tour went mainly to leopold mozart , wolfgang amadeus ' father , the younger mozart would have been happy to have the extra income from television appearances , cd sales and royalties to finance the luxurious apartments , trips to casinos and evenings out he enjoyed , according to hewig . the mozart brand known by name to nearly everyone in the world , regardless of their affection for classical music , mozart 's music is impossible to avoid .
" eine kleine nachtmusik " - whether recognized as " serenade no. 13 for strings in g major " or not - has been used to sell everything from pancakes to cars .
he can be heard piped through the telephone while on hold as well as by passengers waiting for the next train in munich 's subway stations . but it 's not only the music that brings in the money , especially as 2006 has been named mozart year in honor of his 250th birthday on jan .

according to bush , the two spent some 45 minutes along together in the white house oval office . chancellor merkel told the assembled press at the joint press conference after the talks that germany would not be intimidated by iran .
she added that iran 's statements on israel and the holocaust were " totally unacceptable . " western countries " will not be intimidated " by iran 's decision to go ahead with its nuclear program , merkel said friday at a press conference with us president george w. bush .
" it 's essential , we feel , that the eu-3 -lrb- britain , france and germany -rrb- , together with the united states , take a common position here , become active , " merkel said following her first official meeting with bush as german chancellor . " we will not be intimidated by any country such as iran , " she vowed , adding that it was essential to persuade as many countries as possible to speak with one voice on the issue .
both leaders , however , expressed a desire to follow a diplomatic course in an attempt to come to a solution .
" we spent some time talking about the iranian issue and the desire to solve this issue diplomatically - by working together , " bush said . big job ahead bush opened the press conference by saying it was an honor to have chancellor merkel at the white house and that germany was a " valued ally " of the united states . " we 've got an important job ahead of us to work on key issues , like iran , " bush said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two stressed the common ground they share he thanked germany for the part it has played in the international security assistance force in afghanistan and , although the two countries have had their differences , welcomed germany ’ s support in the quest for democracy and stability in iraq . " it 's a difficult issue in our relationship and i understand that , " he said , but added the two countries shared a desire for the iraqi people to live in freedom . chancellor merkel said the two leaders had had a " very open and candid " discussion which was marked by a " spirit of trust " and opened a new chapter in the german-american relationship . guantanamo one highly anticipated subject was that of guantanamo bay on the island of cuba , where the us has a prison for terrorism suspects which falls outside the purview of us law .
last weekend , merkel had criticized the prison in a magazine interview , saying it should not exist " indefinitely . "
she said she would bring it up with the us president during their meeting . when bush was asked by a reporter about the topic , he said the german leader had indeed broached the subject and that he would like " to see a way forward . "
but he defended the treatment of prisoners there and said as long as there is a terrorist threat , guantanamo would still be needed . about 500 " war on terror " detainees are held at guantanamo , some for up to four years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a detainee inside the united states naval station in guantanamo bay , cuba merkel said that germany and other countries needed to come up with proposals on how to best deal with detainees " who do n't feel bound by any law . "
she said it was important to find how international law could address the issue and added that the un was a good forum in which to do that . " the common ground is that we have shared values even though from time to time we have differences of opinion , " she said . economic ties merkel said that while terrorism was the greatest challenge facing the world in the 21st century , she did not only want to define the two countries ' relationship by that issue alone .
she stressed that economic and trade issues were also crucial , particularly in the era of globalization and the rising economic power of china . she said for the countries to meet the challenges in today 's global world , they needed to be economically strong .
she added that there were some tendencies toward isolationism within the eu , but that countries should not go down that path . good pals ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor schörder and president bush were often at odds when asked if he and chancellor merkel had gotten on better than the president had with her predecessor , gerhard schröder , with whom he shared as relationship that was often icy , bush laughed and skirted the question . the two men were barely on speaking terms by the time schröder left office in november .
bush did say , however , wanted to send his best regards to the former chancellor . regarding to the current german leader , merkel , bush said : " she 's smart , capable , and there 's a spirit to her that is appealing .
she loves freedom . " merkel told reporters after the talks that she will return to the united states in may to attend the annual meeting of the american jewish committee .
she also said she had invited bush to berlin . dw staff -lrb- nda , jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de promising washington more smiles and more help under chancellor merkel , berlin wants to strike a more upbeat tone in its relationship with washington , something analysts say that could be very beneficial to the bush administration .

" we believe the time has now come for the security council to become involved to reinforce the authority of iaea resolutions , " the foreign ministers of britain , france and germany , who have been trying to coax iran into renouncing a nuclear weapons capability , said in berlin . us middle east experts interviewed dismiss the prospects of biting sanctions on iran . ray takeyh , a senior fellow at the council on foreign relations , felt that the europeans would be reluctant to slap tough sanctions against tehran . " but there are other things you may be able to do : diplomatic sanctions , reducing the size of iranian representatives abroad , reducing the size of the embassies , maybe barring some transfers of technology , " he said .

" the assumption is that the world can talk and bluster but at the end of the day it will not threaten -lrb- their -rrb- grip on power .

" we believe the time has now come for the security council to become involved to reinforce the authority of iaea resolutions , " the foreign ministers of britain , france and germany , who have been trying to coax iran into renouncing a nuclear weapons capability , said in berlin . us middle east experts interviewed dismiss the prospects of biting sanctions on iran . ray takeyh , a senior fellow at the council on foreign relations , felt that the europeans would be reluctant to slap tough sanctions against tehran . " but there are other things you may be able to do : diplomatic sanctions , reducing the size of iranian representatives abroad , reducing the size of the embassies , maybe barring some transfers of technology , " he said . " there are things you can do along the margins , which can be not very substantial but do have some symbolic importance at least . " too early to tell un diplomats said it was premature to discuss the various sanctions options given that the ball was still in the iaea court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : picture shows the uranium enrichment complex in the iranian town of isfahan they said the issue was unlikely to come before the 15-member council before next month when the united states takes over the rotating presidency of the powerful body . a european official speaking on the margins of the berlin meeting said the iaea board of governors could be convened " in the coming weeks .

he refused to be more specific . " what we want to do is use the authority and weight of the security council to bring home to iran the importance of abiding the resolution of the iaea , " the official said .
" do n't expect us to move straight to sanctions . " negotiations broke down britain , france and germany have been leading more than two years of delicate negotiations with iran to allay western fears that it is seeking to develop a weapons programme , a charge the islamic republic strongly denies . iran sparked a furious international reaction this week for breaking seals on three nuclear facilities in order to resume nuclear fuel work . " the iranians have significant oil and gas reserves and the excess capacity in the system is quite tight , " jon alterman , middle east program director at the center for strategic and international studies in washington , told afp . " so the iranian bet is that with the current oil energy market there is no way that serious sanctions that will cripple the government are possibly in sight , " he told afp .
" the assumption is that the world can talk and bluster but at the end of the day it will not threaten -lrb- their -rrb- grip on power . " russia and china ? alterman pointed out that neither russia nor china - two veto-wielding permanent members of the security council which have significant economic interests in iran - were likely to back biting sanctions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea 's director general mohamed elbaradei has the key role in the dispute " if push comes to shove , they -lrb- russians and chinese -rrb- do n't want a war with the iranians but they want the iranians to reduce the level of tension that they are creating , " he added .

but rather than solving the problem , the tactic creates new difficulties , says deutsche welle 's peter philipp . the simmering anger in berlin , london and paris in the last few days was an indication that iran 's resumption of research into nuclear fuel - particularly at the highly controversial natan enrichment plant - would not be without a drastic reaction . but the eu troika foreign ministers ' decision to refer iran to the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , and if necessary haul it before the un security council , does n't do justice to the expectations .
instead , it 's akin to making a mountain of a molehill . new , bigger headaches ? the europeans have once again shown they are n't in a position to solve international problems .
in this case , they have not only failed to solve the problem , but perhaps also created the basis for new and bigger ones . should the us get its way and push through the imposition of sanctions on iran in the un security council , people in washington as well as in brussels , as indeed elsewhere in europe , are well aware that such sanctions - no matter how they are formulated - are n't an effective way of getting a country " on the right course . " it did n't work in iraq or in cuba and it has an even slimmer chance of working in iran . sanctions would be counterproductive that 's because iran currently earns well with its oil and gas exports and the iranian people too , despite all the criticism , are firmly backing their government on the nuclear issue . sanctions would just drive the iranians into the arms of their conservative leadership .
they would also be counterproductive for the economic interests of the europeans , who have until now furiously wooed iran on trade issues . besides , it is n't even clear yet whether sanctions will be agreed upon and whether they can then be forced on iran .
china , for instance , probably wo n't be interested in doing so , since it is dependant on iran for oil and gas .
and even russia 's stance is ambiguous , given that moscow is deeply involved in the development of iran 's nuclear plants . possible bitter retaliation but the biggest fallout from forced sanctions could be iran 's decision to get out of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
the country has been complying with the treaty 's guidelines so far , allowing the inspection of its nuclear facilities and cooperating with the vienna-based iaea . but all that could , with one stroke , come to an abrupt halt .
that would in turn increase mistrust on the part of the americans and some of the europeans and would lead to a deadlock , since the use of force would continue to be ruled out - the lessons of iraq were memorable enough . the developments in tehran will be followed calmly , because everyone knows well that sanctions would probably hurt the europeans more than iran .
that is common knowledge in washington and also a source of regret . europe just a paper tiger but what is even more regrettable is the fact that europe has once again shown itself to be a paper tiger and exposed itself to ridicule by the hardliners in tehran . it 's happened before , when the former ayatollah ali khomeini sneered at the exit of european diplomats : " let them go : they 'll come crawling back again .

but rather than solving the problem , the tactic creates new difficulties , says deutsche welle 's peter philipp . the simmering anger in berlin , london and paris in the last few days was an indication that iran 's resumption of research into nuclear fuel - particularly at the highly controversial natan enrichment plant - would not be without a drastic reaction . but the eu troika foreign ministers ' decision to refer iran to the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , and if necessary haul it before the un security council , does n't do justice to the expectations .

in this case , they have not only failed to solve the problem , but perhaps also created the basis for new and bigger ones . should the us get its way and push through the imposition of sanctions on iran in the un security council , people in washington as well as in brussels , as indeed elsewhere in europe , are well aware that such sanctions - no matter how they are formulated - are n't an effective way of getting a country " on the right course . " it did n't work in iraq or in cuba and it has an even slimmer chance of working in iran . sanctions would be counterproductive that 's because iran currently earns well with its oil and gas exports and the iranian people too , despite all the criticism , are firmly backing their government on the nuclear issue . sanctions would just drive the iranians into the arms of their conservative leadership .
they would also be counterproductive for the economic interests of the europeans , who have until now furiously wooed iran on trade issues . besides , it is n't even clear yet whether sanctions will be agreed upon and whether they can then be forced on iran .
china , for instance , probably wo n't be interested in doing so , since it is dependant on iran for oil and gas .
and even russia 's stance is ambiguous , given that moscow is deeply involved in the development of iran 's nuclear plants . possible bitter retaliation but the biggest fallout from forced sanctions could be iran 's decision to get out of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
the country has been complying with the treaty 's guidelines so far , allowing the inspection of its nuclear facilities and cooperating with the vienna-based iaea . but all that could , with one stroke , come to an abrupt halt .
that would in turn increase mistrust on the part of the americans and some of the europeans and would lead to a deadlock , since the use of force would continue to be ruled out - the lessons of iraq were memorable enough . the developments in tehran will be followed calmly , because everyone knows well that sanctions would probably hurt the europeans more than iran .
that is common knowledge in washington and also a source of regret . europe just a paper tiger but what is even more regrettable is the fact that europe has once again shown itself to be a paper tiger and exposed itself to ridicule by the hardliners in tehran . it 's happened before , when the former ayatollah ali khomeini sneered at the exit of european diplomats : " let them go : they 'll come crawling back again .

german intelligence agency expert erich schmidt-eenboom offers his take on the allegations that german secret agents were involved in assessing targets during the us military invasion in iraq . dw-world : both the süddeutsche zeitung and the television channel ard have reported that german agents helped the us pick out bombing targets - including saddam hussein .
what do you think of the accusations ? erich schmidt eenboom : they are partly justified .
the federal intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- surely kept up contact with their partner agency , the defense intelligence agency , despite the political tension between washington and berlin during the iraq war .
they surely also did that with the backing of the chancellor 's office .
as a result , the knowledgeable bnd agents in baghdad probably gathered information on targets to avoid but also , in my opinion , worthwhile targets . what they ca n't be accused of is functioning as real-time scouts , with the information they relayed back being used for us bombing attacks soon after . was it normal that bnd workers continued their work in iraq , even after the german embassy was closed ? the bnd has been baghdad since the early 1980s , and it has a very big and important office there .
the desire and need of the federal government for information , both leading up to the war and during the war , was large and gathering information locally is one of a foreign intelligence agency 's core duties . how far did intelligence cooperation go during the iraq war ?
and how much did the office of chancellor gerhard schröder know ?
the intelligence coordinator in the chancellor 's office , -lrb- current foreign minister frank-walter -rrb- steinmeier , surely knew the extent of the cooperation , and was kept up to date on the information exchange on the working level , which is defined by strict regulations .
the bnd agents most definitely did not have direct radio or fax communication with american agencies .
the contact probably always went through the -lrb- bnd headquarters -rrb- in pullach . the coalition government won a lot of respect in the arab world for their rejection of the iraq war .
will their reputation suffer a setback following these revelations ? partly , because i think that 's what 's behind the publication of these stories .
we 're experiencing a sort of psychological attack on the part of the american intelligence agencies against the old social democratic-green party coalition government , but also against the new government following merkel 's demand that the us close guantanamo bay .
the americans want to make clear - especially in light of their bad image following the cia torture allegations - that germany is n't as pure as assumed , because they were more involved in the iraq war than they said they were . is it possible that germany could become the target of islamic terrorists as a result of these allegations ? i do n't think so .
islamic terrorists , especially those in iraq , have other priorities , namely the american occupiers .
i think the growing militancy in afghanistan is more likely to have an effect in germany , creating a threatening scenario especially ahead and during the soccer world cup . to what extent ? that is hard to predict .
we 're experiencing a radicalization of youth and a professionalization of terrorism in afghanistan , but also in bosnia .
at one point , the terrorists and terrorism will no longer only be directed at german soldiers in those places , but against the motherland , against the country that sent them , namely germany .
it 's hard to say at what point that will happen and with what sort of intensity .
erich schmidt-eenboom is director of the research institute for peace policies and considered one of germany 's top experts on the bnd .
he was unwittingly spied on during his research into the bnd in the 1990s , an act for which the former intelligence agency head has apologized .

german intelligence agency expert erich schmidt-eenboom offers his take on the allegations that german secret agents were involved in assessing targets during the us military invasion in iraq . dw-world : both the süddeutsche zeitung and the television channel ard have reported that german agents helped the us pick out bombing targets - including saddam hussein .
what do you think of the accusations ? erich schmidt eenboom : they are partly justified .
the federal intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- surely kept up contact with their partner agency , the defense intelligence agency , despite the political tension between washington and berlin during the iraq war .
they surely also did that with the backing of the chancellor 's office .
as a result , the knowledgeable bnd agents in baghdad probably gathered information on targets to avoid but also , in my opinion , worthwhile targets . what they ca n't be accused of is functioning as real-time scouts , with the information they relayed back being used for us bombing attacks soon after . was it normal that bnd workers continued their work in iraq , even after the german embassy was closed ? the bnd has been baghdad since the early 1980s , and it has a very big and important office there .
the desire and need of the federal government for information , both leading up to the war and during the war , was large and gathering information locally is one of a foreign intelligence agency 's core duties . how far did intelligence cooperation go during the iraq war ?
and how much did the office of chancellor gerhard schröder know ?
the intelligence coordinator in the chancellor 's office , -lrb- current foreign minister frank-walter -rrb- steinmeier , surely knew the extent of the cooperation , and was kept up to date on the information exchange on the working level , which is defined by strict regulations .
the bnd agents most definitely did not have direct radio or fax communication with american agencies .
the contact probably always went through the -lrb- bnd headquarters -rrb- in pullach . the coalition government won a lot of respect in the arab world for their rejection of the iraq war .
will their reputation suffer a setback following these revelations ? partly , because i think that 's what 's behind the publication of these stories .
we 're experiencing a sort of psychological attack on the part of the american intelligence agencies against the old social democratic-green party coalition government , but also against the new government following merkel 's demand that the us close guantanamo bay .
the americans want to make clear - especially in light of their bad image following the cia torture allegations - that germany is n't as pure as assumed , because they were more involved in the iraq war than they said they were . is it possible that germany could become the target of islamic terrorists as a result of these allegations ? i do n't think so .
islamic terrorists , especially those in iraq , have other priorities , namely the american occupiers .
i think the growing militancy in afghanistan is more likely to have an effect in germany , creating a threatening scenario especially ahead and during the soccer world cup . to what extent ? that is hard to predict .
we 're experiencing a radicalization of youth and a professionalization of terrorism in afghanistan , but also in bosnia .
at one point , the terrorists and terrorism will no longer only be directed at german soldiers in those places , but against the motherland , against the country that sent them , namely germany .
it 's hard to say at what point that will happen and with what sort of intensity .
erich schmidt-eenboom is director of the research institute for peace policies and considered one of germany 's top experts on the bnd .
he was unwittingly spied on during his research into the bnd in the 1990s , an act for which the former intelligence agency head has apologized .

but the trend is down to more than just health scares . as international green week , the yearly food , agriculture and horticulture exhibition , opens in berlin on friday , the organic food industry can feel very pleased with itself .
recent findings show that more people are turning towards bio-products in germany . however , the organic seal of quality comes at a price ; and usually it is a relatively high one compared to non-bio products .
but it seems that money is increasingly less important in german consumers ' quest for safe and healthy food . meat scandals have driven trend , not created it researchers have noted a definite change in german shopping habits of late , with ecologically sound products being the preferred target .
markus rippin from germany 's central market and price monitoring agency -lrb- zmp -rrb- believes that , while recent factors have driven the trend , it 's no flash in the pan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recent meat scandal in germany is only one factor in the turn towards organic produce " this trend is showing longevity , and is not just influenced by events like bse , " he told german broadcaster tageschau .
" numerous investigations by different research institutes have shown this . " according to the zmp 's own research , consumers believe that organic products are fresher and taste better - and price is a secondary condition .
" the attitude towards more expensive foods has changed , " rippin said .
" consumers are more ready to spend more money on better food . " one recent study shows that 35 to 40 percent of the population buys bio-products at least once a month ; possibly half of all germans even more regularly .
while the core demographic is educated shoppers with higher incomes , the trend is showing that more families with young children and pensioners are going ever more frequently to bio-stores . growth rate has been rising since 2000 the growth rate for organic products has been rising steadily since the turn of the century .
in 2000 , the german organic food industry was predicting a year-on-year growth of 10 percent .
by 2004 , products such as vegetable juice had seen a 55 percent rise .
other products experiencing similar growth include milk products and baby food . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organic bread ?
yes , please !
last year , an estimated 4 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.8 billion -rrb- were spent on organically produced food in germany , an increase of 10 to 15 percent in revenue from 2004 .

some believe the real reason is a lack of interest and rising costs . it was going to be the first of its kind and an opening that would have shamed other sporting galas with its proposed pomp , preening and pop stars .
but with just five months to go before the fifa 2006 world cup gets underway , the star-studded spectacular - which would have heralded the long-awaited arrival of soccer 's greatest spectacle on german soil - has been unceremoniously dumped from the agenda . despite promising that the massive stage , which would have creaked like the knees of an aging rock star under the weight of such luminaries as brian eno , peter gabriel and the black eyed peas , would not damage the field at berlin ’ s olympiastadion , fifa cancelled the event apparently for just that reason . however , some in the german press know a cover-up when they smell one and it is likely to be revealed over the weekend that the gala event was actually cancelled because it is floating very few people 's boats .
lack of ticket sales , it is alleged , is the real reason for the cancellation . the berliner zeitung newspaper is expected to go public with revelations that the estimated 25 million euro -lrb- $ 30 million -rrb- costs are rising higher and faster than a david beckham penalty and that tickets are selling slower than those for a lothar matthäus spoken word event . blatter shedding crocodile tears for canceled event ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa president sepp blatter is an advocate of the beautiful game .
fifa are having none of it , however .
president sepp blatter maintained on friday that the gala had been cancelled on strictly sporting grounds . " personally , i still think the idea of holding such a high-profile opening event is a good one , " said blatter .
" fifa has not taken the decision to cancel the event at such a late stage lightly , but as world football 's governing body ; we must put sporting considerations first . " for conspiracy theorists , blatter 's statement arrived with a distinct whiff of fish .
the fifa president , when questioned in the past about the possibility of huge cultural event to launch the world cup , said : " football fans want to see matches .
they do n't want speeches , they want a few songs and they want to see football . "
with such a ringing endorsement , critics believe , the gala was living on borrowed time from the off . first group game would come just six days after gala bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's olympiastadion will host reigning champion brazil 's first game .
the music , dance and performance art extravaganza was due to take place on june 7 , just six days before the first world cup match at the stadium on june 13 between world champions brazil and croatia .
fifa fears that a new pitch laid own to replace the grass trampled in the opening ceremony would not be in satisfactory condition for the match to take place . " it has since become clear that there would be considerable risks involved , not only in dismantling the stages and the event 's technical installations in time but also in laying a new field , which has to be in perfect playing condition by june 12 , " fifa said in a statement . things go from bad to worse for organizing committee bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could der kaiser be making a disguised gesture to his critics here ?
it is the latest embarrassing turn in the gala 's ill-fated story .
fifa had already rescheduled the gala ceremony and the first group match in berlin last year to give an extra 48 hours to lay down new rolls of grass and give the turf time to take hold . and the cancellation comes as another blow to the german organizing committee , which is currently sulking over a report from german consumer protection agency stiftung warentest , which warned that there were serious safety concerns at all 12 world cup venues . the gala 's artistic director , austrian andre heller , was naturally gutted by the news .

some believe the real reason is a lack of interest and rising costs . it was going to be the first of its kind and an opening that would have shamed other sporting galas with its proposed pomp , preening and pop stars .
but with just five months to go before the fifa 2006 world cup gets underway , the star-studded spectacular - which would have heralded the long-awaited arrival of soccer 's greatest spectacle on german soil - has been unceremoniously dumped from the agenda . despite promising that the massive stage , which would have creaked like the knees of an aging rock star under the weight of such luminaries as brian eno , peter gabriel and the black eyed peas , would not damage the field at berlin ’ s olympiastadion , fifa cancelled the event apparently for just that reason . however , some in the german press know a cover-up when they smell one and it is likely to be revealed over the weekend that the gala event was actually cancelled because it is floating very few people 's boats .
lack of ticket sales , it is alleged , is the real reason for the cancellation . the berliner zeitung newspaper is expected to go public with revelations that the estimated 25 million euro -lrb- $ 30 million -rrb- costs are rising higher and faster than a david beckham penalty and that tickets are selling slower than those for a lothar matthäus spoken word event . blatter shedding crocodile tears for canceled event ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa president sepp blatter is an advocate of the beautiful game .
fifa are having none of it , however .
president sepp blatter maintained on friday that the gala had been cancelled on strictly sporting grounds . " personally , i still think the idea of holding such a high-profile opening event is a good one , " said blatter .
" fifa has not taken the decision to cancel the event at such a late stage lightly , but as world football 's governing body ; we must put sporting considerations first . " for conspiracy theorists , blatter 's statement arrived with a distinct whiff of fish .
the fifa president , when questioned in the past about the possibility of huge cultural event to launch the world cup , said : " football fans want to see matches .
they do n't want speeches , they want a few songs and they want to see football . "
with such a ringing endorsement , critics believe , the gala was living on borrowed time from the off . first group game would come just six days after gala bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's olympiastadion will host reigning champion brazil 's first game .
the music , dance and performance art extravaganza was due to take place on june 7 , just six days before the first world cup match at the stadium on june 13 between world champions brazil and croatia .
fifa fears that a new pitch laid own to replace the grass trampled in the opening ceremony would not be in satisfactory condition for the match to take place . " it has since become clear that there would be considerable risks involved , not only in dismantling the stages and the event 's technical installations in time but also in laying a new field , which has to be in perfect playing condition by june 12 , " fifa said in a statement . things go from bad to worse for organizing committee bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could der kaiser be making a disguised gesture to his critics here ?
it is the latest embarrassing turn in the gala 's ill-fated story .
fifa had already rescheduled the gala ceremony and the first group match in berlin last year to give an extra 48 hours to lay down new rolls of grass and give the turf time to take hold . and the cancellation comes as another blow to the german organizing committee , which is currently sulking over a report from german consumer protection agency stiftung warentest , which warned that there were serious safety concerns at all 12 world cup venues . the gala 's artistic director , austrian andre heller , was naturally gutted by the news .
" it is with a great sense of sadness that i leave my exciting work for the fifa world cup gala in berlin , " heller said in a presumably tear-stained statement . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany pulls out all the stops for cultural world cup the 2006 world cup will not only be a soccer spectacle but the run-up to the main event itself will be a cultural extravaganza which , the german organizers say , will give the prestigious event that extra dash of pizzazz .

according to bush , the two spent some 45 minutes along together in the white house oval office . chancellor merkel told the assembled press at the joint press conference after the talks that germany would not be intimidated by iran .
she added that iran 's statements on israel and the holocaust were " totally unacceptable . " western countries " will not be intimidated " by iran 's decision to go ahead with its nuclear program , merkel said friday at a press conference with us president george w. bush .
" it 's essential , we feel , that the eu-3 -lrb- britain , france and germany -rrb- , together with the united states , take a common position here , become active , " merkel said following her first official meeting with bush as german chancellor . " we will not be intimidated by any country such as iran , " she vowed , adding that it was essential to persuade as many countries as possible to speak with one voice on the issue .
both leaders , however , expressed a desire to follow a diplomatic course in an attempt to come to a solution .
" we spent some time talking about the iranian issue and the desire to solve this issue diplomatically - by working together , " bush said . big job ahead bush opened the press conference by saying it was an honor to have chancellor merkel at the white house and that germany was a " valued ally " of the united states .

" it 's a difficult issue in our relationship and i understand that , " he said , but added the two countries shared a desire for the iraqi people to live in freedom . chancellor merkel said the two leaders had had a " very open and candid " discussion which was marked by a " spirit of trust " and opened a new chapter in the german-american relationship . guantanamo one highly anticipated subject was that of guantanamo bay on the island of cuba , where the us has a prison for terrorism suspects which falls outside the purview of us law .
last weekend , merkel had criticized the prison in a magazine interview , saying it should not exist " indefinitely . "
she said she would bring it up with the us president during their meeting . when bush was asked by a reporter about the topic , he said the german leader had indeed broached the subject and that he would like " to see a way forward . "
but he defended the treatment of prisoners there and said as long as there is a terrorist threat , guantanamo would still be needed . about 500 " war on terror " detainees are held at guantanamo , some for up to four years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a detainee inside the united states naval station in guantanamo bay , cuba merkel said that germany and other countries needed to come up with proposals on how to best deal with detainees " who do n't feel bound by any law . "
she said it was important to find how international law could address the issue and added that the un was a good forum in which to do that . " the common ground is that we have shared values even though from time to time we have differences of opinion , " she said . economic ties merkel said that while terrorism was the greatest challenge facing the world in the 21st century , she did not only want to define the two countries ' relationship by that issue alone .
she stressed that economic and trade issues were also crucial , particularly in the era of globalization and the rising economic power of china . she said for the countries to meet the challenges in today 's global world , they needed to be economically strong .
she added that there were some tendencies toward isolationism within the eu , but that countries should not go down that path . good pals ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor schörder and president bush were often at odds when asked if he and chancellor merkel had gotten on better than the president had with her predecessor , gerhard schröder , with whom he shared as relationship that was often icy , bush laughed and skirted the question . the two men were barely on speaking terms by the time schröder left office in november .
bush did say , however , wanted to send his best regards to the former chancellor . regarding to the current german leader , merkel , bush said : " she 's smart , capable , and there 's a spirit to her that is appealing .
she loves freedom . " merkel told reporters after the talks that she will return to the united states in may to attend the annual meeting of the american jewish committee .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.01.2006 iran threatens to halt nuclear cooperation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign ministers from france , germany and britain have decided to move on iran iran threatened on friday to stop cooperating with the un atomic watchdog , including possibly resuming uranium enrichment , if its controversial nuclear program is referred to the un security council . " if the dossier is sent to the security council , the european countries will lose the means which are currently at their disposal , because ... the government will be obliged , in conformity with the law adopted by parliament , to end all its voluntary measures of cooperation , " iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki was quoted as saying by the official irna news agency . iran 's standoff with the international community escalated after tehran on tuesday resumed sensitive nuclear research linked to uranium enrichment , which produces fuel for nuclear power reactors but can also be used to make atomic bombs . europe 's three major powers responded by calling for an emergency meeting of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , while un chief kofi annan said iran was still keen on pursuing nuclear talks with european powers . british foreign secretary jack straw said consensus was growing among the international community , including russia , for action but said the military option was not being considered . " i think in current circumstances it would not be conceivable , it would not be appropriate , " he said .
" iran is not iraq , we 're working with the international community to resolve this in a peaceful and diplomatic manner . " iran in " dangerous defiance " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad is a controversial figure internationally in december iran 's hardline president mahmoud ahmadinejad signed off on legislation that could limit un inspections at iran 's nuclear sites if its case is taken to the security council . the law obliges the government to " stop voluntary and non-legally binding measures and implement its scientific , research and executive programs " if the security council gets involved . ahmadinejad has ordered iran 's atomic energy agency to be prepared to apply the law , the fars news agency reported .
the law does not refer to specific forms of retaliation , but counter-measures could include resumption of uranium enrichment as well as refusing to adhere to the additional protocol of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , which gives increased inspection powers to the iaea . the additional protocol was signed by the previous reformist government but was never ratified by parliamentarians in the conservative-run parliament . compliance with the additional protocol is seen as being crucial to an iaea probe into allegations that iran is using an atomic energy drive as a cover for weapons development . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us remains wary of iran 's nuclear motives in washington , us secretary of state condoleezza rice accused tehran of a " deliberate escalation " of the dispute , and said it was in " dangerous defiance of the entire international community . " while threatening to halt cooperation , iranian officials have nevertheless signaled their willingness for negotiations to be continued , but on their terms . iran still interested in talks after a telephone conversation with iran 's top nuclear negotiator ali larijani , annan said thursday that tehran was still keen on pursuing " serious " nuclear talks with european powers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : kicking off with culture germany pulls out all the stops for cultural world cup germany plans star-studded opening gala for world cup from the pen to the pitch : world literature meets soccer waiting for the world cup tourists world cup 2006 -pipe- 13.01.2006 world cup gala gets the ax großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's hallowed turf gets a stay of execution the star-studded gala which was to open the 2006 world cup in berlin has been cancelled due to concerns over damage to the olympic stadium 's pitch .
some believe the real reason is a lack of interest and rising costs . it was going to be the first of its kind and an opening that would have shamed other sporting galas with its proposed pomp , preening and pop stars .
but with just five months to go before the fifa 2006 world cup gets underway , the star-studded spectacular - which would have heralded the long-awaited arrival of soccer 's greatest spectacle on german soil - has been unceremoniously dumped from the agenda . despite promising that the massive stage , which would have creaked like the knees of an aging rock star under the weight of such luminaries as brian eno , peter gabriel and the black eyed peas , would not damage the field at berlin ’ s olympiastadion , fifa cancelled the event apparently for just that reason . however , some in the german press know a cover-up when they smell one and it is likely to be revealed over the weekend that the gala event was actually cancelled because it is floating very few people 's boats .
lack of ticket sales , it is alleged , is the real reason for the cancellation . the berliner zeitung newspaper is expected to go public with revelations that the estimated 25 million euro -lrb- $ 30 million -rrb- costs are rising higher and faster than a david beckham penalty and that tickets are selling slower than those for a lothar matthäus spoken word event . blatter shedding crocodile tears for canceled event ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa president sepp blatter is an advocate of the beautiful game .
fifa are having none of it , however .
president sepp blatter maintained on friday that the gala had been cancelled on strictly sporting grounds . " personally , i still think the idea of holding such a high-profile opening event is a good one , " said blatter .
" fifa has not taken the decision to cancel the event at such a late stage lightly , but as world football 's governing body ; we must put sporting considerations first . " for conspiracy theorists , blatter 's statement arrived with a distinct whiff of fish .
the fifa president , when questioned in the past about the possibility of huge cultural event to launch the world cup , said : " football fans want to see matches .
they do n't want speeches , they want a few songs and they want to see football . "
with such a ringing endorsement , critics believe , the gala was living on borrowed time from the off . first group game would come just six days after gala bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's olympiastadion will host reigning champion brazil 's first game .
the music , dance and performance art extravaganza was due to take place on june 7 , just six days before the first world cup match at the stadium on june 13 between world champions brazil and croatia .
fifa fears that a new pitch laid own to replace the grass trampled in the opening ceremony would not be in satisfactory condition for the match to take place . " it has since become clear that there would be considerable risks involved , not only in dismantling the stages and the event 's technical installations in time but also in laying a new field , which has to be in perfect playing condition by june 12 , " fifa said in a statement . things go from bad to worse for organizing committee bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could der kaiser be making a disguised gesture to his critics here ?
it is the latest embarrassing turn in the gala 's ill-fated story .
fifa had already rescheduled the gala ceremony and the first group match in berlin last year to give an extra 48 hours to lay down new rolls of grass and give the turf time to take hold . and the cancellation comes as another blow to the german organizing committee , which is currently sulking over a report from german consumer protection agency stiftung warentest , which warned that there were serious safety concerns at all 12 world cup venues . the gala 's artistic director , austrian andre heller , was naturally gutted by the news .
" it is with a great sense of sadness that i leave my exciting work for the fifa world cup gala in berlin , " heller said in a presumably tear-stained statement . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany pulls out all the stops for cultural world cup the 2006 world cup will not only be a soccer spectacle but the run-up to the main event itself will be a cultural extravaganza which , the german organizers say , will give the prestigious event that extra dash of pizzazz .

according to bush , the two spent some 45 minutes along together in the white house oval office . chancellor merkel told the assembled press at the joint press conference after the talks that germany would not be intimidated by iran .
she added that iran 's statements on israel and the holocaust were " totally unacceptable . " western countries " will not be intimidated " by iran 's decision to go ahead with its nuclear program , merkel said friday at a press conference with us president george w. bush .
" it 's essential , we feel , that the eu-3 -lrb- britain , france and germany -rrb- , together with the united states , take a common position here , become active , " merkel said following her first official meeting with bush as german chancellor . " we will not be intimidated by any country such as iran , " she vowed , adding that it was essential to persuade as many countries as possible to speak with one voice on the issue .
both leaders , however , expressed a desire to follow a diplomatic course in an attempt to come to a solution .
" we spent some time talking about the iranian issue and the desire to solve this issue diplomatically - by working together , " bush said . big job ahead bush opened the press conference by saying it was an honor to have chancellor merkel at the white house and that germany was a " valued ally " of the united states . " we 've got an important job ahead of us to work on key issues , like iran , " bush said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two stressed the common ground they share he thanked germany for the part it has played in the international security assistance force in afghanistan and , although the two countries have had their differences , welcomed germany ’ s support in the quest for democracy and stability in iraq . " it 's a difficult issue in our relationship and i understand that , " he said , but added the two countries shared a desire for the iraqi people to live in freedom . chancellor merkel said the two leaders had had a " very open and candid " discussion which was marked by a " spirit of trust " and opened a new chapter in the german-american relationship . guantanamo one highly anticipated subject was that of guantanamo bay on the island of cuba , where the us has a prison for terrorism suspects which falls outside the purview of us law .
last weekend , merkel had criticized the prison in a magazine interview , saying it should not exist " indefinitely . "
she said she would bring it up with the us president during their meeting . when bush was asked by a reporter about the topic , he said the german leader had indeed broached the subject and that he would like " to see a way forward . "
but he defended the treatment of prisoners there and said as long as there is a terrorist threat , guantanamo would still be needed . about 500 " war on terror " detainees are held at guantanamo , some for up to four years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a detainee inside the united states naval station in guantanamo bay , cuba merkel said that germany and other countries needed to come up with proposals on how to best deal with detainees " who do n't feel bound by any law . "
she said it was important to find how international law could address the issue and added that the un was a good forum in which to do that . " the common ground is that we have shared values even though from time to time we have differences of opinion , " she said . economic ties merkel said that while terrorism was the greatest challenge facing the world in the 21st century , she did not only want to define the two countries ' relationship by that issue alone .
she stressed that economic and trade issues were also crucial , particularly in the era of globalization and the rising economic power of china . she said for the countries to meet the challenges in today 's global world , they needed to be economically strong .
she added that there were some tendencies toward isolationism within the eu , but that countries should not go down that path . good pals ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor schörder and president bush were often at odds when asked if he and chancellor merkel had gotten on better than the president had with her predecessor , gerhard schröder , with whom he shared as relationship that was often icy , bush laughed and skirted the question . the two men were barely on speaking terms by the time schröder left office in november .
bush did say , however , wanted to send his best regards to the former chancellor . regarding to the current german leader , merkel , bush said : " she 's smart , capable , and there 's a spirit to her that is appealing .
she loves freedom . " merkel told reporters after the talks that she will return to the united states in may to attend the annual meeting of the american jewish committee .

" if the dossier is sent to the security council , the european countries will lose the means which are currently at their disposal , because ... the government will be obliged , in conformity with the law adopted by parliament , to end all its voluntary measures of cooperation , " iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki was quoted as saying by the official irna news agency . iran 's standoff with the international community escalated after tehran on tuesday resumed sensitive nuclear research linked to uranium enrichment , which produces fuel for nuclear power reactors but can also be used to make atomic bombs . europe 's three major powers responded by calling for an emergency meeting of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , while un chief kofi annan said iran was still keen on pursuing nuclear talks with european powers . british foreign secretary jack straw said consensus was growing among the international community , including russia , for action but said the military option was not being considered . " i think in current circumstances it would not be conceivable , it would not be appropriate , " he said .
" iran is not iraq , we 're working with the international community to resolve this in a peaceful and diplomatic manner . " iran in " dangerous defiance " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad is a controversial figure internationally in december iran 's hardline president mahmoud ahmadinejad signed off on legislation that could limit un inspections at iran 's nuclear sites if its case is taken to the security council . the law obliges the government to " stop voluntary and non-legally binding measures and implement its scientific , research and executive programs " if the security council gets involved . ahmadinejad has ordered iran 's atomic energy agency to be prepared to apply the law , the fars news agency reported .
the law does not refer to specific forms of retaliation , but counter-measures could include resumption of uranium enrichment as well as refusing to adhere to the additional protocol of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , which gives increased inspection powers to the iaea . the additional protocol was signed by the previous reformist government but was never ratified by parliamentarians in the conservative-run parliament . compliance with the additional protocol is seen as being crucial to an iaea probe into allegations that iran is using an atomic energy drive as a cover for weapons development . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us remains wary of iran 's nuclear motives in washington , us secretary of state condoleezza rice accused tehran of a " deliberate escalation " of the dispute , and said it was in " dangerous defiance of the entire international community . " while threatening to halt cooperation , iranian officials have nevertheless signaled their willingness for negotiations to be continued , but on their terms . iran still interested in talks after a telephone conversation with iran 's top nuclear negotiator ali larijani , annan said thursday that tehran was still keen on pursuing " serious " nuclear talks with european powers . " he affirmed to me that they are interested in serious and constructive negotiation , but within a timeframe , " annan said , quoting larijani as saying that the previous round of negotiations " had lasted two and a half years without any results . " the head of iran 's nuclear negotiating team javad vaidi said on state television thursday : " we are still hopeful that the negotiations can make progress . "
however , he warned that " if the europeans want to carry out the threats , it will cause iran 's behavior to change and intensify the present situation . " mottaki urged the europeans to deal with iran 's nuclear activities with " discretion , patience and a rational attitude . " " we advise the europeans to separate the question of research from producing the nuclear fuel and do not propagate around the nuclear research activities which had been unjustly suspended , " he said . " if they want to discuss making nuclear fuel we are ready to follow up with the negotiations with the eu-3 , " he said .
if the negotiations are broken off by the europeans " iran will only be in contact with the iaea to maintain its legitimate and natural rights .

" if the dossier is sent to the security council , the european countries will lose the means which are currently at their disposal , because ... the government will be obliged , in conformity with the law adopted by parliament , to end all its voluntary measures of cooperation , " iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki was quoted as saying by the official irna news agency . iran 's standoff with the international community escalated after tehran on tuesday resumed sensitive nuclear research linked to uranium enrichment , which produces fuel for nuclear power reactors but can also be used to make atomic bombs . europe 's three major powers responded by calling for an emergency meeting of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , while un chief kofi annan said iran was still keen on pursuing nuclear talks with european powers . british foreign secretary jack straw said consensus was growing among the international community , including russia , for action but said the military option was not being considered . " i think in current circumstances it would not be conceivable , it would not be appropriate , " he said .
" iran is not iraq , we 're working with the international community to resolve this in a peaceful and diplomatic manner . " iran in " dangerous defiance " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad is a controversial figure internationally in december iran 's hardline president mahmoud ahmadinejad signed off on legislation that could limit un inspections at iran 's nuclear sites if its case is taken to the security council . the law obliges the government to " stop voluntary and non-legally binding measures and implement its scientific , research and executive programs " if the security council gets involved . ahmadinejad has ordered iran 's atomic energy agency to be prepared to apply the law , the fars news agency reported .
the law does not refer to specific forms of retaliation , but counter-measures could include resumption of uranium enrichment as well as refusing to adhere to the additional protocol of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , which gives increased inspection powers to the iaea . the additional protocol was signed by the previous reformist government but was never ratified by parliamentarians in the conservative-run parliament . compliance with the additional protocol is seen as being crucial to an iaea probe into allegations that iran is using an atomic energy drive as a cover for weapons development . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us remains wary of iran 's nuclear motives in washington , us secretary of state condoleezza rice accused tehran of a " deliberate escalation " of the dispute , and said it was in " dangerous defiance of the entire international community . " while threatening to halt cooperation , iranian officials have nevertheless signaled their willingness for negotiations to be continued , but on their terms . iran still interested in talks after a telephone conversation with iran 's top nuclear negotiator ali larijani , annan said thursday that tehran was still keen on pursuing " serious " nuclear talks with european powers . " he affirmed to me that they are interested in serious and constructive negotiation , but within a timeframe , " annan said , quoting larijani as saying that the previous round of negotiations " had lasted two and a half years without any results . " the head of iran 's nuclear negotiating team javad vaidi said on state television thursday : " we are still hopeful that the negotiations can make progress . "
however , he warned that " if the europeans want to carry out the threats , it will cause iran 's behavior to change and intensify the present situation . " mottaki urged the europeans to deal with iran 's nuclear activities with " discretion , patience and a rational attitude . " " we advise the europeans to separate the question of research from producing the nuclear fuel and do not propagate around the nuclear research activities which had been unjustly suspended , " he said . " if they want to discuss making nuclear fuel we are ready to follow up with the negotiations with the eu-3 , " he said .
if the negotiations are broken off by the europeans " iran will only be in contact with the iaea to maintain its legitimate and natural rights . " tehran has said uranium enrichment on an industrial level is still suspended but it has not made a secret of its desire to resume the activity in a near future . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : sanctions will hurt europe more than iran germany , france and britain may refer iran to the un security council for nuclear breaches .

some believe the real reason is a lack of interest and rising costs . it was going to be the first of its kind and an opening that would have shamed other sporting galas with its proposed pomp , preening and pop stars .
but with just five months to go before the fifa 2006 world cup gets underway , the star-studded spectacular - which would have heralded the long-awaited arrival of soccer 's greatest spectacle on german soil - has been unceremoniously dumped from the agenda . despite promising that the massive stage , which would have creaked like the knees of an aging rock star under the weight of such luminaries as brian eno , peter gabriel and the black eyed peas , would not damage the field at berlin ’ s olympiastadion , fifa cancelled the event apparently for just that reason . however , some in the german press know a cover-up when they smell one and it is likely to be revealed over the weekend that the gala event was actually cancelled because it is floating very few people 's boats .
lack of ticket sales , it is alleged , is the real reason for the cancellation . the berliner zeitung newspaper is expected to go public with revelations that the estimated 25 million euro -lrb- $ 30 million -rrb- costs are rising higher and faster than a david beckham penalty and that tickets are selling slower than those for a lothar matthäus spoken word event . blatter shedding crocodile tears for canceled event ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa president sepp blatter is an advocate of the beautiful game .
fifa are having none of it , however .
president sepp blatter maintained on friday that the gala had been cancelled on strictly sporting grounds . " personally , i still think the idea of holding such a high-profile opening event is a good one , " said blatter .
" fifa has not taken the decision to cancel the event at such a late stage lightly , but as world football 's governing body ; we must put sporting considerations first . " for conspiracy theorists , blatter 's statement arrived with a distinct whiff of fish .
the fifa president , when questioned in the past about the possibility of huge cultural event to launch the world cup , said : " football fans want to see matches .
they do n't want speeches , they want a few songs and they want to see football . "
with such a ringing endorsement , critics believe , the gala was living on borrowed time from the off . first group game would come just six days after gala bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's olympiastadion will host reigning champion brazil 's first game .
the music , dance and performance art extravaganza was due to take place on june 7 , just six days before the first world cup match at the stadium on june 13 between world champions brazil and croatia .
fifa fears that a new pitch laid own to replace the grass trampled in the opening ceremony would not be in satisfactory condition for the match to take place . " it has since become clear that there would be considerable risks involved , not only in dismantling the stages and the event 's technical installations in time but also in laying a new field , which has to be in perfect playing condition by june 12 , " fifa said in a statement . things go from bad to worse for organizing committee bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could der kaiser be making a disguised gesture to his critics here ?
it is the latest embarrassing turn in the gala 's ill-fated story .
fifa had already rescheduled the gala ceremony and the first group match in berlin last year to give an extra 48 hours to lay down new rolls of grass and give the turf time to take hold . and the cancellation comes as another blow to the german organizing committee , which is currently sulking over a report from german consumer protection agency stiftung warentest , which warned that there were serious safety concerns at all 12 world cup venues . the gala 's artistic director , austrian andre heller , was naturally gutted by the news .

some believe the real reason is a lack of interest and rising costs . it was going to be the first of its kind and an opening that would have shamed other sporting galas with its proposed pomp , preening and pop stars .
but with just five months to go before the fifa 2006 world cup gets underway , the star-studded spectacular - which would have heralded the long-awaited arrival of soccer 's greatest spectacle on german soil - has been unceremoniously dumped from the agenda . despite promising that the massive stage , which would have creaked like the knees of an aging rock star under the weight of such luminaries as brian eno , peter gabriel and the black eyed peas , would not damage the field at berlin ’ s olympiastadion , fifa cancelled the event apparently for just that reason . however , some in the german press know a cover-up when they smell one and it is likely to be revealed over the weekend that the gala event was actually cancelled because it is floating very few people 's boats .
lack of ticket sales , it is alleged , is the real reason for the cancellation . the berliner zeitung newspaper is expected to go public with revelations that the estimated 25 million euro -lrb- $ 30 million -rrb- costs are rising higher and faster than a david beckham penalty and that tickets are selling slower than those for a lothar matthäus spoken word event . blatter shedding crocodile tears for canceled event ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa president sepp blatter is an advocate of the beautiful game .
fifa are having none of it , however .
president sepp blatter maintained on friday that the gala had been cancelled on strictly sporting grounds . " personally , i still think the idea of holding such a high-profile opening event is a good one , " said blatter .
" fifa has not taken the decision to cancel the event at such a late stage lightly , but as world football 's governing body ; we must put sporting considerations first . " for conspiracy theorists , blatter 's statement arrived with a distinct whiff of fish .
the fifa president , when questioned in the past about the possibility of huge cultural event to launch the world cup , said : " football fans want to see matches .
they do n't want speeches , they want a few songs and they want to see football . "
with such a ringing endorsement , critics believe , the gala was living on borrowed time from the off . first group game would come just six days after gala bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's olympiastadion will host reigning champion brazil 's first game .

the european union , meanwhile , has promised more than $ 100 million to aid the global fight against the spread of the flu . the world health organization reported the mutation in the h5n1 virus after detecting it in the dna of two turkish patients on friday .
though the mutation allows the virus to adapt more easily to humans than to birds , experts said it was too early for widespread concern . " it 's a single discovery , which appearing isolated in a virus is not of much importance at the moment , " said dr. christian drosten , a virologist at the bernhardt-nocht institute for tropical medicine in hamburg in an interview .
" such single mutations do n't indicate whether a virus has gotten more dangerous . " test developed to detect mutations the report nevertheless raised the caution level .
the flu epidemic of 1918 , which killed tens of millions of people in a span of 18 months , jumped directly from birds to humans , according to researchers at the scripps research institute in california .
scientists and health care officials have watched the avian flu in turkey warily for signs of the same . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the virus has yet to jump from birds to humans in large numbers scripps scientists announced this week that they had developed a test to detect such mutations , warning health officials when the virus might jump ship from birds to humans .
at the moment , the h5n1 strain of the virus still primarily infects birds and only rarely passes to people .
since late 2003 , more than 70 people have been killed by the strain as it spread from asia to europe .
two have died in turkey and 15 have been infected since the beginning of the year , bringing the flu to europe 's doorstep and prompting a host of monitoring measures from european governments in recent days . virus showing no major changes on friday , the eu pledged $ 100 million -lrb- 82.6 million euros -rrb- in aid to go toward stopping the spread of the virus , and turkey stepped up bird inspections .
doctors on friday said they were testing whether the death of a 4-year-old girl in eastern turkey was caused by the virus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : avian flu is on europe 's doorstep drosten , the berlin scientist , said the development of the virus in turkey in the coming weeks will give scientists ideas on how to combat it .
at the moment , the virus is behaving the same way as it did in hong kong three years ago , where only the people who had contact with infected birds were themselves infected . he said mutations are difficult to combat .
" what you can do is to suppress the process by which mutations come about - the replication , " he said .
" in the case of h5n1 , that means eliminating the masses of replicated viruses by killing the infected birds .

according to bush , the two spent some 45 minutes along together in the white house oval office . chancellor merkel told the assembled press at the joint press conference after the talks that germany would not be intimidated by iran .
she added that iran 's statements on israel and the holocaust were " totally unacceptable . " western countries " will not be intimidated " by iran 's decision to go ahead with its nuclear program , merkel said friday at a press conference with us president george w. bush .

according to bush , the two spent some 45 minutes along together in the white house oval office . chancellor merkel told the assembled press at the joint press conference after the talks that germany would not be intimidated by iran .
she added that iran 's statements on israel and the holocaust were " totally unacceptable . " western countries " will not be intimidated " by iran 's decision to go ahead with its nuclear program , merkel said friday at a press conference with us president george w. bush .

" we will not be intimidated by any country such as iran , " she vowed , adding that it was essential to persuade as many countries as possible to speak with one voice on the issue .
both leaders , however , expressed a desire to follow a diplomatic course in an attempt to come to a solution .
" we spent some time talking about the iranian issue and the desire to solve this issue diplomatically - by working together , " bush said . big job ahead bush opened the press conference by saying it was an honor to have chancellor merkel at the white house and that germany was a " valued ally " of the united states .

according to bush , the two spent some 45 minutes along together in the white house oval office . chancellor merkel told the assembled press at the joint press conference after the talks that germany would not be intimidated by iran .
she added that iran 's statements on israel and the holocaust were " totally unacceptable . " western countries " will not be intimidated " by iran 's decision to go ahead with its nuclear program , merkel said friday at a press conference with us president george w. bush .
" it 's essential , we feel , that the eu-3 -lrb- britain , france and germany -rrb- , together with the united states , take a common position here , become active , " merkel said following her first official meeting with bush as german chancellor . " we will not be intimidated by any country such as iran , " she vowed , adding that it was essential to persuade as many countries as possible to speak with one voice on the issue .
both leaders , however , expressed a desire to follow a diplomatic course in an attempt to come to a solution .
" we spent some time talking about the iranian issue and the desire to solve this issue diplomatically - by working together , " bush said . big job ahead bush opened the press conference by saying it was an honor to have chancellor merkel at the white house and that germany was a " valued ally " of the united states . " we 've got an important job ahead of us to work on key issues , like iran , " bush said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two stressed the common ground they share he thanked germany for the part it has played in the international security assistance force in afghanistan and , although the two countries have had their differences , welcomed germany ’ s support in the quest for democracy and stability in iraq . " it 's a difficult issue in our relationship and i understand that , " he said , but added the two countries shared a desire for the iraqi people to live in freedom . chancellor merkel said the two leaders had had a " very open and candid " discussion which was marked by a " spirit of trust " and opened a new chapter in the german-american relationship . guantanamo one highly anticipated subject was that of guantanamo bay on the island of cuba , where the us has a prison for terrorism suspects which falls outside the purview of us law .
last weekend , merkel had criticized the prison in a magazine interview , saying it should not exist " indefinitely . "
she said she would bring it up with the us president during their meeting . when bush was asked by a reporter about the topic , he said the german leader had indeed broached the subject and that he would like " to see a way forward . "
but he defended the treatment of prisoners there and said as long as there is a terrorist threat , guantanamo would still be needed . about 500 " war on terror " detainees are held at guantanamo , some for up to four years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a detainee inside the united states naval station in guantanamo bay , cuba merkel said that germany and other countries needed to come up with proposals on how to best deal with detainees " who do n't feel bound by any law . "
she said it was important to find how international law could address the issue and added that the un was a good forum in which to do that . " the common ground is that we have shared values even though from time to time we have differences of opinion , " she said . economic ties merkel said that while terrorism was the greatest challenge facing the world in the 21st century , she did not only want to define the two countries ' relationship by that issue alone .
she stressed that economic and trade issues were also crucial , particularly in the era of globalization and the rising economic power of china . she said for the countries to meet the challenges in today 's global world , they needed to be economically strong .
she added that there were some tendencies toward isolationism within the eu , but that countries should not go down that path . good pals ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor schörder and president bush were often at odds when asked if he and chancellor merkel had gotten on better than the president had with her predecessor , gerhard schröder , with whom he shared as relationship that was often icy , bush laughed and skirted the question . the two men were barely on speaking terms by the time schröder left office in november .
bush did say , however , wanted to send his best regards to the former chancellor . regarding to the current german leader , merkel , bush said : " she 's smart , capable , and there 's a spirit to her that is appealing .
she loves freedom . " merkel told reporters after the talks that she will return to the united states in may to attend the annual meeting of the american jewish committee .
she also said she had invited bush to berlin . dw staff -lrb- nda , jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de promising washington more smiles and more help under chancellor merkel , berlin wants to strike a more upbeat tone in its relationship with washington , something analysts say that could be very beneficial to the bush administration .

" if the dossier is sent to the security council , the european countries will lose the means which are currently at their disposal , because ... the government will be obliged , in conformity with the law adopted by parliament , to end all its voluntary measures of cooperation , " iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki was quoted as saying by the official irna news agency . iran 's standoff with the international community escalated after tehran on tuesday resumed sensitive nuclear research linked to uranium enrichment , which produces fuel for nuclear power reactors but can also be used to make atomic bombs . europe 's three major powers responded by calling for an emergency meeting of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , while un chief kofi annan said iran was still keen on pursuing nuclear talks with european powers . british foreign secretary jack straw said consensus was growing among the international community , including russia , for action but said the military option was not being considered . " i think in current circumstances it would not be conceivable , it would not be appropriate , " he said .
" iran is not iraq , we 're working with the international community to resolve this in a peaceful and diplomatic manner . " iran in " dangerous defiance " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad is a controversial figure internationally in december iran 's hardline president mahmoud ahmadinejad signed off on legislation that could limit un inspections at iran 's nuclear sites if its case is taken to the security council . the law obliges the government to " stop voluntary and non-legally binding measures and implement its scientific , research and executive programs " if the security council gets involved . ahmadinejad has ordered iran 's atomic energy agency to be prepared to apply the law , the fars news agency reported .
the law does not refer to specific forms of retaliation , but counter-measures could include resumption of uranium enrichment as well as refusing to adhere to the additional protocol of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , which gives increased inspection powers to the iaea . the additional protocol was signed by the previous reformist government but was never ratified by parliamentarians in the conservative-run parliament . compliance with the additional protocol is seen as being crucial to an iaea probe into allegations that iran is using an atomic energy drive as a cover for weapons development . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us remains wary of iran 's nuclear motives in washington , us secretary of state condoleezza rice accused tehran of a " deliberate escalation " of the dispute , and said it was in " dangerous defiance of the entire international community . " while threatening to halt cooperation , iranian officials have nevertheless signaled their willingness for negotiations to be continued , but on their terms . iran still interested in talks after a telephone conversation with iran 's top nuclear negotiator ali larijani , annan said thursday that tehran was still keen on pursuing " serious " nuclear talks with european powers . " he affirmed to me that they are interested in serious and constructive negotiation , but within a timeframe , " annan said , quoting larijani as saying that the previous round of negotiations " had lasted two and a half years without any results . " the head of iran 's nuclear negotiating team javad vaidi said on state television thursday : " we are still hopeful that the negotiations can make progress . "
however , he warned that " if the europeans want to carry out the threats , it will cause iran 's behavior to change and intensify the present situation . " mottaki urged the europeans to deal with iran 's nuclear activities with " discretion , patience and a rational attitude . " " we advise the europeans to separate the question of research from producing the nuclear fuel and do not propagate around the nuclear research activities which had been unjustly suspended , " he said . " if they want to discuss making nuclear fuel we are ready to follow up with the negotiations with the eu-3 , " he said .
if the negotiations are broken off by the europeans " iran will only be in contact with the iaea to maintain its legitimate and natural rights .

the law does not refer to specific forms of retaliation , but counter-measures could include resumption of uranium enrichment as well as refusing to adhere to the additional protocol of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , which gives increased inspection powers to the iaea . the additional protocol was signed by the previous reformist government but was never ratified by parliamentarians in the conservative-run parliament . compliance with the additional protocol is seen as being crucial to an iaea probe into allegations that iran is using an atomic energy drive as a cover for weapons development . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us remains wary of iran 's nuclear motives in washington , us secretary of state condoleezza rice accused tehran of a " deliberate escalation " of the dispute , and said it was in " dangerous defiance of the entire international community .

but the trend is down to more than just health scares . as international green week , the yearly food , agriculture and horticulture exhibition , opens in berlin on friday , the organic food industry can feel very pleased with itself .
recent findings show that more people are turning towards bio-products in germany . however , the organic seal of quality comes at a price ; and usually it is a relatively high one compared to non-bio products .
but it seems that money is increasingly less important in german consumers ' quest for safe and healthy food . meat scandals have driven trend , not created it researchers have noted a definite change in german shopping habits of late , with ecologically sound products being the preferred target .
markus rippin from germany 's central market and price monitoring agency -lrb- zmp -rrb- believes that , while recent factors have driven the trend , it 's no flash in the pan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recent meat scandal in germany is only one factor in the turn towards organic produce " this trend is showing longevity , and is not just influenced by events like bse , " he told german broadcaster tageschau .
" numerous investigations by different research institutes have shown this . " according to the zmp 's own research , consumers believe that organic products are fresher and taste better - and price is a secondary condition .
" the attitude towards more expensive foods has changed , " rippin said .
" consumers are more ready to spend more money on better food . " one recent study shows that 35 to 40 percent of the population buys bio-products at least once a month ; possibly half of all germans even more regularly .
while the core demographic is educated shoppers with higher incomes , the trend is showing that more families with young children and pensioners are going ever more frequently to bio-stores . growth rate has been rising since 2000 the growth rate for organic products has been rising steadily since the turn of the century .
in 2000 , the german organic food industry was predicting a year-on-year growth of 10 percent .

other products experiencing similar growth include milk products and baby food . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organic bread ?

last year , an estimated 4 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.8 billion -rrb- were spent on organically produced food in germany , an increase of 10 to 15 percent in revenue from 2004 .
the revenue produced from bio-food in germany has been steadily on the rise for the past five years with 2001 seeing a massive 30 percent surge in profits . more stores , more diversity extending trend 's lifespan since then , more and more stores , especially supermarkets and drugstores , have been increasing their selections of bio-food to meet consumer demand .
purely organic supermarkets have ridden the wave and boomed in the first half of the decade . those who expected a certain amount of stagnation in the market have been waiting in vain .
on the contrary , ever more organic products are featuring on the shelves of increasingly diverse businesses , from clothing to paint .
the distribution network for bio-products has also improved , meaning the supply is equipped to meet demand . it appears that the organic success story has yet to reach its final page . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de celebrating an ecologically friendly christmas most people want to celebrate the holidays in traditional fashion and have fun doing so .

but the trend is down to more than just health scares . as international green week , the yearly food , agriculture and horticulture exhibition , opens in berlin on friday , the organic food industry can feel very pleased with itself .
recent findings show that more people are turning towards bio-products in germany . however , the organic seal of quality comes at a price ; and usually it is a relatively high one compared to non-bio products .
but it seems that money is increasingly less important in german consumers ' quest for safe and healthy food . meat scandals have driven trend , not created it researchers have noted a definite change in german shopping habits of late , with ecologically sound products being the preferred target .
markus rippin from germany 's central market and price monitoring agency -lrb- zmp -rrb- believes that , while recent factors have driven the trend , it 's no flash in the pan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recent meat scandal in germany is only one factor in the turn towards organic produce " this trend is showing longevity , and is not just influenced by events like bse , " he told german broadcaster tageschau .

german intelligence agency expert erich schmidt-eenboom offers his take on the allegations that german secret agents were involved in assessing targets during the us military invasion in iraq . dw-world : both the süddeutsche zeitung and the television channel ard have reported that german agents helped the us pick out bombing targets - including saddam hussein .
what do you think of the accusations ? erich schmidt eenboom : they are partly justified .
the federal intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- surely kept up contact with their partner agency , the defense intelligence agency , despite the political tension between washington and berlin during the iraq war .
they surely also did that with the backing of the chancellor 's office .
as a result , the knowledgeable bnd agents in baghdad probably gathered information on targets to avoid but also , in my opinion , worthwhile targets . what they ca n't be accused of is functioning as real-time scouts , with the information they relayed back being used for us bombing attacks soon after . was it normal that bnd workers continued their work in iraq , even after the german embassy was closed ? the bnd has been baghdad since the early 1980s , and it has a very big and important office there .
the desire and need of the federal government for information , both leading up to the war and during the war , was large and gathering information locally is one of a foreign intelligence agency 's core duties . how far did intelligence cooperation go during the iraq war ?
and how much did the office of chancellor gerhard schröder know ?
the intelligence coordinator in the chancellor 's office , -lrb- current foreign minister frank-walter -rrb- steinmeier , surely knew the extent of the cooperation , and was kept up to date on the information exchange on the working level , which is defined by strict regulations .
the bnd agents most definitely did not have direct radio or fax communication with american agencies .
the contact probably always went through the -lrb- bnd headquarters -rrb- in pullach . the coalition government won a lot of respect in the arab world for their rejection of the iraq war .
will their reputation suffer a setback following these revelations ? partly , because i think that 's what 's behind the publication of these stories .
we 're experiencing a sort of psychological attack on the part of the american intelligence agencies against the old social democratic-green party coalition government , but also against the new government following merkel 's demand that the us close guantanamo bay .
the americans want to make clear - especially in light of their bad image following the cia torture allegations - that germany is n't as pure as assumed , because they were more involved in the iraq war than they said they were . is it possible that germany could become the target of islamic terrorists as a result of these allegations ? i do n't think so .
islamic terrorists , especially those in iraq , have other priorities , namely the american occupiers .
i think the growing militancy in afghanistan is more likely to have an effect in germany , creating a threatening scenario especially ahead and during the soccer world cup . to what extent ? that is hard to predict .
we 're experiencing a radicalization of youth and a professionalization of terrorism in afghanistan , but also in bosnia .
at one point , the terrorists and terrorism will no longer only be directed at german soldiers in those places , but against the motherland , against the country that sent them , namely germany .
it 's hard to say at what point that will happen and with what sort of intensity .
erich schmidt-eenboom is director of the research institute for peace policies and considered one of germany 's top experts on the bnd .
he was unwittingly spied on during his research into the bnd in the 1990s , an act for which the former intelligence agency head has apologized .

german intelligence agency expert erich schmidt-eenboom offers his take on the allegations that german secret agents were involved in assessing targets during the us military invasion in iraq . dw-world : both the süddeutsche zeitung and the television channel ard have reported that german agents helped the us pick out bombing targets - including saddam hussein .
what do you think of the accusations ? erich schmidt eenboom : they are partly justified .
the federal intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- surely kept up contact with their partner agency , the defense intelligence agency , despite the political tension between washington and berlin during the iraq war .
they surely also did that with the backing of the chancellor 's office .
as a result , the knowledgeable bnd agents in baghdad probably gathered information on targets to avoid but also , in my opinion , worthwhile targets . what they ca n't be accused of is functioning as real-time scouts , with the information they relayed back being used for us bombing attacks soon after . was it normal that bnd workers continued their work in iraq , even after the german embassy was closed ? the bnd has been baghdad since the early 1980s , and it has a very big and important office there .
the desire and need of the federal government for information , both leading up to the war and during the war , was large and gathering information locally is one of a foreign intelligence agency 's core duties . how far did intelligence cooperation go during the iraq war ?
and how much did the office of chancellor gerhard schröder know ?
the intelligence coordinator in the chancellor 's office , -lrb- current foreign minister frank-walter -rrb- steinmeier , surely knew the extent of the cooperation , and was kept up to date on the information exchange on the working level , which is defined by strict regulations .
the bnd agents most definitely did not have direct radio or fax communication with american agencies .
the contact probably always went through the -lrb- bnd headquarters -rrb- in pullach . the coalition government won a lot of respect in the arab world for their rejection of the iraq war .
will their reputation suffer a setback following these revelations ? partly , because i think that 's what 's behind the publication of these stories .
we 're experiencing a sort of psychological attack on the part of the american intelligence agencies against the old social democratic-green party coalition government , but also against the new government following merkel 's demand that the us close guantanamo bay .
the americans want to make clear - especially in light of their bad image following the cia torture allegations - that germany is n't as pure as assumed , because they were more involved in the iraq war than they said they were . is it possible that germany could become the target of islamic terrorists as a result of these allegations ? i do n't think so .
islamic terrorists , especially those in iraq , have other priorities , namely the american occupiers .
i think the growing militancy in afghanistan is more likely to have an effect in germany , creating a threatening scenario especially ahead and during the soccer world cup . to what extent ? that is hard to predict .
we 're experiencing a radicalization of youth and a professionalization of terrorism in afghanistan , but also in bosnia .
at one point , the terrorists and terrorism will no longer only be directed at german soldiers in those places , but against the motherland , against the country that sent them , namely germany .
it 's hard to say at what point that will happen and with what sort of intensity .
erich schmidt-eenboom is director of the research institute for peace policies and considered one of germany 's top experts on the bnd .
he was unwittingly spied on during his research into the bnd in the 1990s , an act for which the former intelligence agency head has apologized .

" it is no wonder we are seeing such a profusion of by-products . " a well-documented genius but even more than the abundance of mozart merchandise flooding the market , the extensive documentation of mozart 's life , including diaries and hundreds of letters he wrote , add another layer to interpretations of his music and virtually guarantee that even strangers to classical music find something about him that catches their interest . " mozart 's music brought an additional dimension to my life , and it 's my opinion that this ' drug ' can be administered to anyone , " said rudolf dörler of the stuttgart mozart society .
" his letters also show a struggling , positive person who continually gives encouragement in a number of ways . " the themes of mozart 's letters cover the same issues as can be found in today 's celebrity gossip pages .

a more gifted child prodigy has yet to be found , according to hewig . mozart 's developed a musical style unlike what audiences of the day were accustomed to , and ultimately resulted in him failing to get a regular job with one of europe 's royal courts .
it also meant he had to make sure the music he wrote sold successfully . " mozart was uncompromising when it came to the quality of his music , " hewig said .
" but he wanted it to be well received , not to compose obscure music for small groups . " to do it , mozart worked hard , composing music in 30 of the 35 years he was alive , creating an oeuvre of about 630 pieces , including 27 piano concertos , over 40 symphonies and such famous operas as " the marriage of figaro , " " the magic flute " and " don giovanni , " which he is rumored to have finished in six weeks .

but rather than solving the problem , the tactic creates new difficulties , says deutsche welle 's peter philipp . the simmering anger in berlin , london and paris in the last few days was an indication that iran 's resumption of research into nuclear fuel - particularly at the highly controversial natan enrichment plant - would not be without a drastic reaction . but the eu troika foreign ministers ' decision to refer iran to the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , and if necessary haul it before the un security council , does n't do justice to the expectations .
instead , it 's akin to making a mountain of a molehill . new , bigger headaches ? the europeans have once again shown they are n't in a position to solve international problems .
in this case , they have not only failed to solve the problem , but perhaps also created the basis for new and bigger ones . should the us get its way and push through the imposition of sanctions on iran in the un security council , people in washington as well as in brussels , as indeed elsewhere in europe , are well aware that such sanctions - no matter how they are formulated - are n't an effective way of getting a country " on the right course . " it did n't work in iraq or in cuba and it has an even slimmer chance of working in iran . sanctions would be counterproductive that 's because iran currently earns well with its oil and gas exports and the iranian people too , despite all the criticism , are firmly backing their government on the nuclear issue . sanctions would just drive the iranians into the arms of their conservative leadership .
they would also be counterproductive for the economic interests of the europeans , who have until now furiously wooed iran on trade issues . besides , it is n't even clear yet whether sanctions will be agreed upon and whether they can then be forced on iran .
china , for instance , probably wo n't be interested in doing so , since it is dependant on iran for oil and gas .
and even russia 's stance is ambiguous , given that moscow is deeply involved in the development of iran 's nuclear plants . possible bitter retaliation but the biggest fallout from forced sanctions could be iran 's decision to get out of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
the country has been complying with the treaty 's guidelines so far , allowing the inspection of its nuclear facilities and cooperating with the vienna-based iaea . but all that could , with one stroke , come to an abrupt halt .
that would in turn increase mistrust on the part of the americans and some of the europeans and would lead to a deadlock , since the use of force would continue to be ruled out - the lessons of iraq were memorable enough . the developments in tehran will be followed calmly , because everyone knows well that sanctions would probably hurt the europeans more than iran .
that is common knowledge in washington and also a source of regret . europe just a paper tiger but what is even more regrettable is the fact that europe has once again shown itself to be a paper tiger and exposed itself to ridicule by the hardliners in tehran . it 's happened before , when the former ayatollah ali khomeini sneered at the exit of european diplomats : " let them go : they 'll come crawling back again .

" mozart would have taken part in television shows and events , " he said .
" he wanted to be heard , and if he was alive today , i could imagine that he would be a pop star of some sort . " though the horse-drawn carriages and cobbled streets of his day are a far cry from the private jets and chauffeur-driven stretch limos today 's celebrities enjoy , mozart toured europe a number of times in his 35 years .
the opener was a four-year event that kicked off when he was just six years old and stormed through some 70 cities and royal courts across the continent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mozart 's father played the role of instructor , tutor and manager while proceeds from the initial tour went mainly to leopold mozart , wolfgang amadeus ' father , the younger mozart would have been happy to have the extra income from television appearances , cd sales and royalties to finance the luxurious apartments , trips to casinos and evenings out he enjoyed , according to hewig . the mozart brand known by name to nearly everyone in the world , regardless of their affection for classical music , mozart 's music is impossible to avoid .
" eine kleine nachtmusik " - whether recognized as " serenade no. 13 for strings in g major " or not - has been used to sell everything from pancakes to cars .
he can be heard piped through the telephone while on hold as well as by passengers waiting for the next train in munich 's subway stations . but it 's not only the music that brings in the money , especially as 2006 has been named mozart year in honor of his 250th birthday on jan .

salzburg 's mozartland , which bills itself as " the ultimate shop for mozart fans , " offers everything from mozart chocolates to sweatpants bearing the composer 's name . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : child composer whose works astonished adults of the period " the ' mozart ' brand is one of the best known in the world , " said arthur oberascher , head of the austrian national tourist office , estimating the brand 's value at about 5.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.5 billion -rrb- .
" it is no wonder we are seeing such a profusion of by-products . " a well-documented genius but even more than the abundance of mozart merchandise flooding the market , the extensive documentation of mozart 's life , including diaries and hundreds of letters he wrote , add another layer to interpretations of his music and virtually guarantee that even strangers to classical music find something about him that catches their interest . " mozart 's music brought an additional dimension to my life , and it 's my opinion that this ' drug ' can be administered to anyone , " said rudolf dörler of the stuttgart mozart society .
" his letters also show a struggling , positive person who continually gives encouragement in a number of ways . " the themes of mozart 's letters cover the same issues as can be found in today 's celebrity gossip pages .
some of the letters ' touch on the erotic , others border on obscene and still more detail his financial concerns , the death of his mother and the anxiety his father caused him . unusual tones for the times bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mozart experienced a variety of financial problems and died in debt under the demanding eye of his father , a successful musician in his own right , johann chrysostom wolfgang amadeus mozart composed his first piece of music at the age of five , wrote the first of 22 operas when he was 12 .
a more gifted child prodigy has yet to be found , according to hewig . mozart 's developed a musical style unlike what audiences of the day were accustomed to , and ultimately resulted in him failing to get a regular job with one of europe 's royal courts .
it also meant he had to make sure the music he wrote sold successfully . " mozart was uncompromising when it came to the quality of his music , " hewig said .
" but he wanted it to be well received , not to compose obscure music for small groups . " to do it , mozart worked hard , composing music in 30 of the 35 years he was alive , creating an oeuvre of about 630 pieces , including 27 piano concertos , over 40 symphonies and such famous operas as " the marriage of figaro , " " the magic flute " and " don giovanni , " which he is rumored to have finished in six weeks . " mozart was supremely confident of his skills , " dörler said .
" from today 's point of view , he had reason to be .

the international community still prefers pursuing negotiations , experts say . responding to iran 's decision to resume sensitive nuclear fuel work , europe 's three major powers on thursday asked for an emergency meeting of the un nuclear watchdog international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- to refer the issue to the un security council , which could slap sanctions . " we believe the time has now come for the security council to become involved to reinforce the authority of iaea resolutions , " the foreign ministers of britain , france and germany , who have been trying to coax iran into renouncing a nuclear weapons capability , said in berlin . us middle east experts interviewed dismiss the prospects of biting sanctions on iran . ray takeyh , a senior fellow at the council on foreign relations , felt that the europeans would be reluctant to slap tough sanctions against tehran . " but there are other things you may be able to do : diplomatic sanctions , reducing the size of iranian representatives abroad , reducing the size of the embassies , maybe barring some transfers of technology , " he said . " there are things you can do along the margins , which can be not very substantial but do have some symbolic importance at least . " too early to tell un diplomats said it was premature to discuss the various sanctions options given that the ball was still in the iaea court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : picture shows the uranium enrichment complex in the iranian town of isfahan they said the issue was unlikely to come before the 15-member council before next month when the united states takes over the rotating presidency of the powerful body . a european official speaking on the margins of the berlin meeting said the iaea board of governors could be convened " in the coming weeks . "
he refused to be more specific . " what we want to do is use the authority and weight of the security council to bring home to iran the importance of abiding the resolution of the iaea , " the official said .
" do n't expect us to move straight to sanctions . " negotiations broke down britain , france and germany have been leading more than two years of delicate negotiations with iran to allay western fears that it is seeking to develop a weapons programme , a charge the islamic republic strongly denies . iran sparked a furious international reaction this week for breaking seals on three nuclear facilities in order to resume nuclear fuel work . " the iranians have significant oil and gas reserves and the excess capacity in the system is quite tight , " jon alterman , middle east program director at the center for strategic and international studies in washington , told afp . " so the iranian bet is that with the current oil energy market there is no way that serious sanctions that will cripple the government are possibly in sight , " he told afp .
" the assumption is that the world can talk and bluster but at the end of the day it will not threaten -lrb- their -rrb- grip on power . " russia and china ? alterman pointed out that neither russia nor china - two veto-wielding permanent members of the security council which have significant economic interests in iran - were likely to back biting sanctions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea 's director general mohamed elbaradei has the key role in the dispute " if push comes to shove , they -lrb- russians and chinese -rrb- do n't want a war with the iranians but they want the iranians to reduce the level of tension that they are creating , " he added .

some believe the real reason is a lack of interest and rising costs . it was going to be the first of its kind and an opening that would have shamed other sporting galas with its proposed pomp , preening and pop stars .
but with just five months to go before the fifa 2006 world cup gets underway , the star-studded spectacular - which would have heralded the long-awaited arrival of soccer 's greatest spectacle on german soil - has been unceremoniously dumped from the agenda . despite promising that the massive stage , which would have creaked like the knees of an aging rock star under the weight of such luminaries as brian eno , peter gabriel and the black eyed peas , would not damage the field at berlin ’ s olympiastadion , fifa cancelled the event apparently for just that reason . however , some in the german press know a cover-up when they smell one and it is likely to be revealed over the weekend that the gala event was actually cancelled because it is floating very few people 's boats .
lack of ticket sales , it is alleged , is the real reason for the cancellation . the berliner zeitung newspaper is expected to go public with revelations that the estimated 25 million euro -lrb- $ 30 million -rrb- costs are rising higher and faster than a david beckham penalty and that tickets are selling slower than those for a lothar matthäus spoken word event . blatter shedding crocodile tears for canceled event ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa president sepp blatter is an advocate of the beautiful game .
fifa are having none of it , however .
president sepp blatter maintained on friday that the gala had been cancelled on strictly sporting grounds . " personally , i still think the idea of holding such a high-profile opening event is a good one , " said blatter .
" fifa has not taken the decision to cancel the event at such a late stage lightly , but as world football 's governing body ; we must put sporting considerations first . " for conspiracy theorists , blatter 's statement arrived with a distinct whiff of fish .
the fifa president , when questioned in the past about the possibility of huge cultural event to launch the world cup , said : " football fans want to see matches .
they do n't want speeches , they want a few songs and they want to see football . "
with such a ringing endorsement , critics believe , the gala was living on borrowed time from the off . first group game would come just six days after gala bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's olympiastadion will host reigning champion brazil 's first game .
the music , dance and performance art extravaganza was due to take place on june 7 , just six days before the first world cup match at the stadium on june 13 between world champions brazil and croatia .
fifa fears that a new pitch laid own to replace the grass trampled in the opening ceremony would not be in satisfactory condition for the match to take place . " it has since become clear that there would be considerable risks involved , not only in dismantling the stages and the event 's technical installations in time but also in laying a new field , which has to be in perfect playing condition by june 12 , " fifa said in a statement . things go from bad to worse for organizing committee bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could der kaiser be making a disguised gesture to his critics here ?
it is the latest embarrassing turn in the gala 's ill-fated story .
fifa had already rescheduled the gala ceremony and the first group match in berlin last year to give an extra 48 hours to lay down new rolls of grass and give the turf time to take hold . and the cancellation comes as another blow to the german organizing committee , which is currently sulking over a report from german consumer protection agency stiftung warentest , which warned that there were serious safety concerns at all 12 world cup venues . the gala 's artistic director , austrian andre heller , was naturally gutted by the news .

some believe the real reason is a lack of interest and rising costs . it was going to be the first of its kind and an opening that would have shamed other sporting galas with its proposed pomp , preening and pop stars .
but with just five months to go before the fifa 2006 world cup gets underway , the star-studded spectacular - which would have heralded the long-awaited arrival of soccer 's greatest spectacle on german soil - has been unceremoniously dumped from the agenda . despite promising that the massive stage , which would have creaked like the knees of an aging rock star under the weight of such luminaries as brian eno , peter gabriel and the black eyed peas , would not damage the field at berlin ’ s olympiastadion , fifa cancelled the event apparently for just that reason . however , some in the german press know a cover-up when they smell one and it is likely to be revealed over the weekend that the gala event was actually cancelled because it is floating very few people 's boats .
lack of ticket sales , it is alleged , is the real reason for the cancellation . the berliner zeitung newspaper is expected to go public with revelations that the estimated 25 million euro -lrb- $ 30 million -rrb- costs are rising higher and faster than a david beckham penalty and that tickets are selling slower than those for a lothar matthäus spoken word event . blatter shedding crocodile tears for canceled event ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa president sepp blatter is an advocate of the beautiful game .
fifa are having none of it , however .
president sepp blatter maintained on friday that the gala had been cancelled on strictly sporting grounds . " personally , i still think the idea of holding such a high-profile opening event is a good one , " said blatter .
" fifa has not taken the decision to cancel the event at such a late stage lightly , but as world football 's governing body ; we must put sporting considerations first . " for conspiracy theorists , blatter 's statement arrived with a distinct whiff of fish .
the fifa president , when questioned in the past about the possibility of huge cultural event to launch the world cup , said : " football fans want to see matches .
they do n't want speeches , they want a few songs and they want to see football . "
with such a ringing endorsement , critics believe , the gala was living on borrowed time from the off . first group game would come just six days after gala bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's olympiastadion will host reigning champion brazil 's first game .
the music , dance and performance art extravaganza was due to take place on june 7 , just six days before the first world cup match at the stadium on june 13 between world champions brazil and croatia .
fifa fears that a new pitch laid own to replace the grass trampled in the opening ceremony would not be in satisfactory condition for the match to take place . " it has since become clear that there would be considerable risks involved , not only in dismantling the stages and the event 's technical installations in time but also in laying a new field , which has to be in perfect playing condition by june 12 , " fifa said in a statement . things go from bad to worse for organizing committee bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could der kaiser be making a disguised gesture to his critics here ?
it is the latest embarrassing turn in the gala 's ill-fated story .
fifa had already rescheduled the gala ceremony and the first group match in berlin last year to give an extra 48 hours to lay down new rolls of grass and give the turf time to take hold . and the cancellation comes as another blow to the german organizing committee , which is currently sulking over a report from german consumer protection agency stiftung warentest , which warned that there were serious safety concerns at all 12 world cup venues . the gala 's artistic director , austrian andre heller , was naturally gutted by the news .

the european union , meanwhile , has promised more than $ 100 million to aid the global fight against the spread of the flu . the world health organization reported the mutation in the h5n1 virus after detecting it in the dna of two turkish patients on friday .
though the mutation allows the virus to adapt more easily to humans than to birds , experts said it was too early for widespread concern . " it 's a single discovery , which appearing isolated in a virus is not of much importance at the moment , " said dr. christian drosten , a virologist at the bernhardt-nocht institute for tropical medicine in hamburg in an interview .
" such single mutations do n't indicate whether a virus has gotten more dangerous . " test developed to detect mutations the report nevertheless raised the caution level .
the flu epidemic of 1918 , which killed tens of millions of people in a span of 18 months , jumped directly from birds to humans , according to researchers at the scripps research institute in california .
scientists and health care officials have watched the avian flu in turkey warily for signs of the same . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the virus has yet to jump from birds to humans in large numbers scripps scientists announced this week that they had developed a test to detect such mutations , warning health officials when the virus might jump ship from birds to humans .

but the trend is down to more than just health scares . as international green week , the yearly food , agriculture and horticulture exhibition , opens in berlin on friday , the organic food industry can feel very pleased with itself .
recent findings show that more people are turning towards bio-products in germany . however , the organic seal of quality comes at a price ; and usually it is a relatively high one compared to non-bio products .
but it seems that money is increasingly less important in german consumers ' quest for safe and healthy food . meat scandals have driven trend , not created it researchers have noted a definite change in german shopping habits of late , with ecologically sound products being the preferred target .
markus rippin from germany 's central market and price monitoring agency -lrb- zmp -rrb- believes that , while recent factors have driven the trend , it 's no flash in the pan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recent meat scandal in germany is only one factor in the turn towards organic produce " this trend is showing longevity , and is not just influenced by events like bse , " he told german broadcaster tageschau .
" numerous investigations by different research institutes have shown this . " according to the zmp 's own research , consumers believe that organic products are fresher and taste better - and price is a secondary condition .
" the attitude towards more expensive foods has changed , " rippin said .
" consumers are more ready to spend more money on better food . " one recent study shows that 35 to 40 percent of the population buys bio-products at least once a month ; possibly half of all germans even more regularly .
while the core demographic is educated shoppers with higher incomes , the trend is showing that more families with young children and pensioners are going ever more frequently to bio-stores . growth rate has been rising since 2000 the growth rate for organic products has been rising steadily since the turn of the century .
in 2000 , the german organic food industry was predicting a year-on-year growth of 10 percent .
by 2004 , products such as vegetable juice had seen a 55 percent rise .
other products experiencing similar growth include milk products and baby food . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organic bread ?
yes , please !
last year , an estimated 4 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.8 billion -rrb- were spent on organically produced food in germany , an increase of 10 to 15 percent in revenue from 2004 .
the revenue produced from bio-food in germany has been steadily on the rise for the past five years with 2001 seeing a massive 30 percent surge in profits . more stores , more diversity extending trend 's lifespan since then , more and more stores , especially supermarkets and drugstores , have been increasing their selections of bio-food to meet consumer demand .

" mozart would have taken part in television shows and events , " he said .
" he wanted to be heard , and if he was alive today , i could imagine that he would be a pop star of some sort . " though the horse-drawn carriages and cobbled streets of his day are a far cry from the private jets and chauffeur-driven stretch limos today 's celebrities enjoy , mozart toured europe a number of times in his 35 years .
the opener was a four-year event that kicked off when he was just six years old and stormed through some 70 cities and royal courts across the continent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mozart 's father played the role of instructor , tutor and manager while proceeds from the initial tour went mainly to leopold mozart , wolfgang amadeus ' father , the younger mozart would have been happy to have the extra income from television appearances , cd sales and royalties to finance the luxurious apartments , trips to casinos and evenings out he enjoyed , according to hewig . the mozart brand known by name to nearly everyone in the world , regardless of their affection for classical music , mozart 's music is impossible to avoid .
" eine kleine nachtmusik " - whether recognized as " serenade no. 13 for strings in g major " or not - has been used to sell everything from pancakes to cars .
he can be heard piped through the telephone while on hold as well as by passengers waiting for the next train in munich 's subway stations . but it 's not only the music that brings in the money , especially as 2006 has been named mozart year in honor of his 250th birthday on jan .

the international community still prefers pursuing negotiations , experts say . responding to iran 's decision to resume sensitive nuclear fuel work , europe 's three major powers on thursday asked for an emergency meeting of the un nuclear watchdog international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- to refer the issue to the un security council , which could slap sanctions . " we believe the time has now come for the security council to become involved to reinforce the authority of iaea resolutions , " the foreign ministers of britain , france and germany , who have been trying to coax iran into renouncing a nuclear weapons capability , said in berlin . us middle east experts interviewed dismiss the prospects of biting sanctions on iran . ray takeyh , a senior fellow at the council on foreign relations , felt that the europeans would be reluctant to slap tough sanctions against tehran . " but there are other things you may be able to do : diplomatic sanctions , reducing the size of iranian representatives abroad , reducing the size of the embassies , maybe barring some transfers of technology , " he said . " there are things you can do along the margins , which can be not very substantial but do have some symbolic importance at least . " too early to tell un diplomats said it was premature to discuss the various sanctions options given that the ball was still in the iaea court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : picture shows the uranium enrichment complex in the iranian town of isfahan they said the issue was unlikely to come before the 15-member council before next month when the united states takes over the rotating presidency of the powerful body . a european official speaking on the margins of the berlin meeting said the iaea board of governors could be convened " in the coming weeks . "
he refused to be more specific . " what we want to do is use the authority and weight of the security council to bring home to iran the importance of abiding the resolution of the iaea , " the official said .
" do n't expect us to move straight to sanctions . " negotiations broke down britain , france and germany have been leading more than two years of delicate negotiations with iran to allay western fears that it is seeking to develop a weapons programme , a charge the islamic republic strongly denies . iran sparked a furious international reaction this week for breaking seals on three nuclear facilities in order to resume nuclear fuel work . " the iranians have significant oil and gas reserves and the excess capacity in the system is quite tight , " jon alterman , middle east program director at the center for strategic and international studies in washington , told afp . " so the iranian bet is that with the current oil energy market there is no way that serious sanctions that will cripple the government are possibly in sight , " he told afp .
" the assumption is that the world can talk and bluster but at the end of the day it will not threaten -lrb- their -rrb- grip on power . " russia and china ? alterman pointed out that neither russia nor china - two veto-wielding permanent members of the security council which have significant economic interests in iran - were likely to back biting sanctions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea 's director general mohamed elbaradei has the key role in the dispute " if push comes to shove , they -lrb- russians and chinese -rrb- do n't want a war with the iranians but they want the iranians to reduce the level of tension that they are creating , " he added .
" and sanctions will not frighten the government of iran . " alterman saw the whole negotiating process as " a time game .

the international community still prefers pursuing negotiations , experts say . responding to iran 's decision to resume sensitive nuclear fuel work , europe 's three major powers on thursday asked for an emergency meeting of the un nuclear watchdog international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- to refer the issue to the un security council , which could slap sanctions . " we believe the time has now come for the security council to become involved to reinforce the authority of iaea resolutions , " the foreign ministers of britain , france and germany , who have been trying to coax iran into renouncing a nuclear weapons capability , said in berlin . us middle east experts interviewed dismiss the prospects of biting sanctions on iran . ray takeyh , a senior fellow at the council on foreign relations , felt that the europeans would be reluctant to slap tough sanctions against tehran . " but there are other things you may be able to do : diplomatic sanctions , reducing the size of iranian representatives abroad , reducing the size of the embassies , maybe barring some transfers of technology , " he said . " there are things you can do along the margins , which can be not very substantial but do have some symbolic importance at least . " too early to tell un diplomats said it was premature to discuss the various sanctions options given that the ball was still in the iaea court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : picture shows the uranium enrichment complex in the iranian town of isfahan they said the issue was unlikely to come before the 15-member council before next month when the united states takes over the rotating presidency of the powerful body . a european official speaking on the margins of the berlin meeting said the iaea board of governors could be convened " in the coming weeks . "
he refused to be more specific . " what we want to do is use the authority and weight of the security council to bring home to iran the importance of abiding the resolution of the iaea , " the official said .
" do n't expect us to move straight to sanctions . " negotiations broke down britain , france and germany have been leading more than two years of delicate negotiations with iran to allay western fears that it is seeking to develop a weapons programme , a charge the islamic republic strongly denies . iran sparked a furious international reaction this week for breaking seals on three nuclear facilities in order to resume nuclear fuel work . " the iranians have significant oil and gas reserves and the excess capacity in the system is quite tight , " jon alterman , middle east program director at the center for strategic and international studies in washington , told afp .

german intelligence agency expert erich schmidt-eenboom offers his take on the allegations that german secret agents were involved in assessing targets during the us military invasion in iraq . dw-world : both the süddeutsche zeitung and the television channel ard have reported that german agents helped the us pick out bombing targets - including saddam hussein .
what do you think of the accusations ? erich schmidt eenboom : they are partly justified .
the federal intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- surely kept up contact with their partner agency , the defense intelligence agency , despite the political tension between washington and berlin during the iraq war .
they surely also did that with the backing of the chancellor 's office .
as a result , the knowledgeable bnd agents in baghdad probably gathered information on targets to avoid but also , in my opinion , worthwhile targets . what they ca n't be accused of is functioning as real-time scouts , with the information they relayed back being used for us bombing attacks soon after . was it normal that bnd workers continued their work in iraq , even after the german embassy was closed ? the bnd has been baghdad since the early 1980s , and it has a very big and important office there .
the desire and need of the federal government for information , both leading up to the war and during the war , was large and gathering information locally is one of a foreign intelligence agency 's core duties . how far did intelligence cooperation go during the iraq war ?
and how much did the office of chancellor gerhard schröder know ?
the intelligence coordinator in the chancellor 's office , -lrb- current foreign minister frank-walter -rrb- steinmeier , surely knew the extent of the cooperation , and was kept up to date on the information exchange on the working level , which is defined by strict regulations .
the bnd agents most definitely did not have direct radio or fax communication with american agencies .
the contact probably always went through the -lrb- bnd headquarters -rrb- in pullach . the coalition government won a lot of respect in the arab world for their rejection of the iraq war .
will their reputation suffer a setback following these revelations ? partly , because i think that 's what 's behind the publication of these stories .
we 're experiencing a sort of psychological attack on the part of the american intelligence agencies against the old social democratic-green party coalition government , but also against the new government following merkel 's demand that the us close guantanamo bay .
the americans want to make clear - especially in light of their bad image following the cia torture allegations - that germany is n't as pure as assumed , because they were more involved in the iraq war than they said they were . is it possible that germany could become the target of islamic terrorists as a result of these allegations ? i do n't think so .
islamic terrorists , especially those in iraq , have other priorities , namely the american occupiers .
i think the growing militancy in afghanistan is more likely to have an effect in germany , creating a threatening scenario especially ahead and during the soccer world cup . to what extent ? that is hard to predict .
we 're experiencing a radicalization of youth and a professionalization of terrorism in afghanistan , but also in bosnia .
at one point , the terrorists and terrorism will no longer only be directed at german soldiers in those places , but against the motherland , against the country that sent them , namely germany .
it 's hard to say at what point that will happen and with what sort of intensity .
erich schmidt-eenboom is director of the research institute for peace policies and considered one of germany 's top experts on the bnd .
he was unwittingly spied on during his research into the bnd in the 1990s , an act for which the former intelligence agency head has apologized .

german intelligence agency expert erich schmidt-eenboom offers his take on the allegations that german secret agents were involved in assessing targets during the us military invasion in iraq . dw-world : both the süddeutsche zeitung and the television channel ard have reported that german agents helped the us pick out bombing targets - including saddam hussein .
what do you think of the accusations ? erich schmidt eenboom : they are partly justified .
the federal intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- surely kept up contact with their partner agency , the defense intelligence agency , despite the political tension between washington and berlin during the iraq war .
they surely also did that with the backing of the chancellor 's office .
as a result , the knowledgeable bnd agents in baghdad probably gathered information on targets to avoid but also , in my opinion , worthwhile targets . what they ca n't be accused of is functioning as real-time scouts , with the information they relayed back being used for us bombing attacks soon after . was it normal that bnd workers continued their work in iraq , even after the german embassy was closed ? the bnd has been baghdad since the early 1980s , and it has a very big and important office there .
the desire and need of the federal government for information , both leading up to the war and during the war , was large and gathering information locally is one of a foreign intelligence agency 's core duties . how far did intelligence cooperation go during the iraq war ?
and how much did the office of chancellor gerhard schröder know ?
the intelligence coordinator in the chancellor 's office , -lrb- current foreign minister frank-walter -rrb- steinmeier , surely knew the extent of the cooperation , and was kept up to date on the information exchange on the working level , which is defined by strict regulations .
the bnd agents most definitely did not have direct radio or fax communication with american agencies .
the contact probably always went through the -lrb- bnd headquarters -rrb- in pullach . the coalition government won a lot of respect in the arab world for their rejection of the iraq war .
will their reputation suffer a setback following these revelations ? partly , because i think that 's what 's behind the publication of these stories .
we 're experiencing a sort of psychological attack on the part of the american intelligence agencies against the old social democratic-green party coalition government , but also against the new government following merkel 's demand that the us close guantanamo bay .
the americans want to make clear - especially in light of their bad image following the cia torture allegations - that germany is n't as pure as assumed , because they were more involved in the iraq war than they said they were . is it possible that germany could become the target of islamic terrorists as a result of these allegations ? i do n't think so .
islamic terrorists , especially those in iraq , have other priorities , namely the american occupiers .
i think the growing militancy in afghanistan is more likely to have an effect in germany , creating a threatening scenario especially ahead and during the soccer world cup . to what extent ? that is hard to predict .
we 're experiencing a radicalization of youth and a professionalization of terrorism in afghanistan , but also in bosnia .
at one point , the terrorists and terrorism will no longer only be directed at german soldiers in those places , but against the motherland , against the country that sent them , namely germany .
it 's hard to say at what point that will happen and with what sort of intensity .
erich schmidt-eenboom is director of the research institute for peace policies and considered one of germany 's top experts on the bnd .
he was unwittingly spied on during his research into the bnd in the 1990s , an act for which the former intelligence agency head has apologized .

but the trend is down to more than just health scares . as international green week , the yearly food , agriculture and horticulture exhibition , opens in berlin on friday , the organic food industry can feel very pleased with itself .
recent findings show that more people are turning towards bio-products in germany . however , the organic seal of quality comes at a price ; and usually it is a relatively high one compared to non-bio products .
but it seems that money is increasingly less important in german consumers ' quest for safe and healthy food . meat scandals have driven trend , not created it researchers have noted a definite change in german shopping habits of late , with ecologically sound products being the preferred target .

" the attitude towards more expensive foods has changed , " rippin said .
" consumers are more ready to spend more money on better food . " one recent study shows that 35 to 40 percent of the population buys bio-products at least once a month ; possibly half of all germans even more regularly .
while the core demographic is educated shoppers with higher incomes , the trend is showing that more families with young children and pensioners are going ever more frequently to bio-stores . growth rate has been rising since 2000 the growth rate for organic products has been rising steadily since the turn of the century .
in 2000 , the german organic food industry was predicting a year-on-year growth of 10 percent .

purely organic supermarkets have ridden the wave and boomed in the first half of the decade . those who expected a certain amount of stagnation in the market have been waiting in vain .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.01.2006 europe pledges bird flu aid as virus mutates großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gathering and killing large numbers of birds is one the few options to fight virus mutation a possibly dangerous genetic mutation in the avian flu virus has doctors in turkey concerned .
the european union , meanwhile , has promised more than $ 100 million to aid the global fight against the spread of the flu . the world health organization reported the mutation in the h5n1 virus after detecting it in the dna of two turkish patients on friday .
though the mutation allows the virus to adapt more easily to humans than to birds , experts said it was too early for widespread concern . " it 's a single discovery , which appearing isolated in a virus is not of much importance at the moment , " said dr. christian drosten , a virologist at the bernhardt-nocht institute for tropical medicine in hamburg in an interview .
" such single mutations do n't indicate whether a virus has gotten more dangerous . " test developed to detect mutations the report nevertheless raised the caution level .
the flu epidemic of 1918 , which killed tens of millions of people in a span of 18 months , jumped directly from birds to humans , according to researchers at the scripps research institute in california .
scientists and health care officials have watched the avian flu in turkey warily for signs of the same . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the virus has yet to jump from birds to humans in large numbers scripps scientists announced this week that they had developed a test to detect such mutations , warning health officials when the virus might jump ship from birds to humans .
at the moment , the h5n1 strain of the virus still primarily infects birds and only rarely passes to people .
since late 2003 , more than 70 people have been killed by the strain as it spread from asia to europe .
two have died in turkey and 15 have been infected since the beginning of the year , bringing the flu to europe 's doorstep and prompting a host of monitoring measures from european governments in recent days . virus showing no major changes on friday , the eu pledged $ 100 million -lrb- 82.6 million euros -rrb- in aid to go toward stopping the spread of the virus , and turkey stepped up bird inspections .
doctors on friday said they were testing whether the death of a 4-year-old girl in eastern turkey was caused by the virus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : avian flu is on europe 's doorstep drosten , the berlin scientist , said the development of the virus in turkey in the coming weeks will give scientists ideas on how to combat it .
at the moment , the virus is behaving the same way as it did in hong kong three years ago , where only the people who had contact with infected birds were themselves infected . he said mutations are difficult to combat .
" what you can do is to suppress the process by which mutations come about - the replication , " he said .
" in the case of h5n1 , that means eliminating the masses of replicated viruses by killing the infected birds .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : kicking off with culture germany pulls out all the stops for cultural world cup germany plans star-studded opening gala for world cup from the pen to the pitch : world literature meets soccer waiting for the world cup tourists world cup 2006 -pipe- 13.01.2006 world cup gala gets the ax großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's hallowed turf gets a stay of execution the star-studded gala which was to open the 2006 world cup in berlin has been cancelled due to concerns over damage to the olympic stadium 's pitch .
some believe the real reason is a lack of interest and rising costs . it was going to be the first of its kind and an opening that would have shamed other sporting galas with its proposed pomp , preening and pop stars .
but with just five months to go before the fifa 2006 world cup gets underway , the star-studded spectacular - which would have heralded the long-awaited arrival of soccer 's greatest spectacle on german soil - has been unceremoniously dumped from the agenda . despite promising that the massive stage , which would have creaked like the knees of an aging rock star under the weight of such luminaries as brian eno , peter gabriel and the black eyed peas , would not damage the field at berlin ’ s olympiastadion , fifa cancelled the event apparently for just that reason . however , some in the german press know a cover-up when they smell one and it is likely to be revealed over the weekend that the gala event was actually cancelled because it is floating very few people 's boats .
lack of ticket sales , it is alleged , is the real reason for the cancellation . the berliner zeitung newspaper is expected to go public with revelations that the estimated 25 million euro -lrb- $ 30 million -rrb- costs are rising higher and faster than a david beckham penalty and that tickets are selling slower than those for a lothar matthäus spoken word event . blatter shedding crocodile tears for canceled event ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa president sepp blatter is an advocate of the beautiful game .
fifa are having none of it , however .
president sepp blatter maintained on friday that the gala had been cancelled on strictly sporting grounds . " personally , i still think the idea of holding such a high-profile opening event is a good one , " said blatter .
" fifa has not taken the decision to cancel the event at such a late stage lightly , but as world football 's governing body ; we must put sporting considerations first . " for conspiracy theorists , blatter 's statement arrived with a distinct whiff of fish .
the fifa president , when questioned in the past about the possibility of huge cultural event to launch the world cup , said : " football fans want to see matches .
they do n't want speeches , they want a few songs and they want to see football . "
with such a ringing endorsement , critics believe , the gala was living on borrowed time from the off . first group game would come just six days after gala bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's olympiastadion will host reigning champion brazil 's first game .
the music , dance and performance art extravaganza was due to take place on june 7 , just six days before the first world cup match at the stadium on june 13 between world champions brazil and croatia .
fifa fears that a new pitch laid own to replace the grass trampled in the opening ceremony would not be in satisfactory condition for the match to take place . " it has since become clear that there would be considerable risks involved , not only in dismantling the stages and the event 's technical installations in time but also in laying a new field , which has to be in perfect playing condition by june 12 , " fifa said in a statement . things go from bad to worse for organizing committee bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could der kaiser be making a disguised gesture to his critics here ?
it is the latest embarrassing turn in the gala 's ill-fated story .
fifa had already rescheduled the gala ceremony and the first group match in berlin last year to give an extra 48 hours to lay down new rolls of grass and give the turf time to take hold . and the cancellation comes as another blow to the german organizing committee , which is currently sulking over a report from german consumer protection agency stiftung warentest , which warned that there were serious safety concerns at all 12 world cup venues . the gala 's artistic director , austrian andre heller , was naturally gutted by the news .
" it is with a great sense of sadness that i leave my exciting work for the fifa world cup gala in berlin , " heller said in a presumably tear-stained statement . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany pulls out all the stops for cultural world cup the 2006 world cup will not only be a soccer spectacle but the run-up to the main event itself will be a cultural extravaganza which , the german organizers say , will give the prestigious event that extra dash of pizzazz .

some believe the real reason is a lack of interest and rising costs . it was going to be the first of its kind and an opening that would have shamed other sporting galas with its proposed pomp , preening and pop stars .
but with just five months to go before the fifa 2006 world cup gets underway , the star-studded spectacular - which would have heralded the long-awaited arrival of soccer 's greatest spectacle on german soil - has been unceremoniously dumped from the agenda . despite promising that the massive stage , which would have creaked like the knees of an aging rock star under the weight of such luminaries as brian eno , peter gabriel and the black eyed peas , would not damage the field at berlin ’ s olympiastadion , fifa cancelled the event apparently for just that reason . however , some in the german press know a cover-up when they smell one and it is likely to be revealed over the weekend that the gala event was actually cancelled because it is floating very few people 's boats .
lack of ticket sales , it is alleged , is the real reason for the cancellation . the berliner zeitung newspaper is expected to go public with revelations that the estimated 25 million euro -lrb- $ 30 million -rrb- costs are rising higher and faster than a david beckham penalty and that tickets are selling slower than those for a lothar matthäus spoken word event . blatter shedding crocodile tears for canceled event ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa president sepp blatter is an advocate of the beautiful game .
fifa are having none of it , however .
president sepp blatter maintained on friday that the gala had been cancelled on strictly sporting grounds . " personally , i still think the idea of holding such a high-profile opening event is a good one , " said blatter .
" fifa has not taken the decision to cancel the event at such a late stage lightly , but as world football 's governing body ; we must put sporting considerations first . " for conspiracy theorists , blatter 's statement arrived with a distinct whiff of fish .
the fifa president , when questioned in the past about the possibility of huge cultural event to launch the world cup , said : " football fans want to see matches .
they do n't want speeches , they want a few songs and they want to see football . "
with such a ringing endorsement , critics believe , the gala was living on borrowed time from the off . first group game would come just six days after gala bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's olympiastadion will host reigning champion brazil 's first game .
the music , dance and performance art extravaganza was due to take place on june 7 , just six days before the first world cup match at the stadium on june 13 between world champions brazil and croatia .
fifa fears that a new pitch laid own to replace the grass trampled in the opening ceremony would not be in satisfactory condition for the match to take place . " it has since become clear that there would be considerable risks involved , not only in dismantling the stages and the event 's technical installations in time but also in laying a new field , which has to be in perfect playing condition by june 12 , " fifa said in a statement . things go from bad to worse for organizing committee bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could der kaiser be making a disguised gesture to his critics here ?
it is the latest embarrassing turn in the gala 's ill-fated story .
fifa had already rescheduled the gala ceremony and the first group match in berlin last year to give an extra 48 hours to lay down new rolls of grass and give the turf time to take hold . and the cancellation comes as another blow to the german organizing committee , which is currently sulking over a report from german consumer protection agency stiftung warentest , which warned that there were serious safety concerns at all 12 world cup venues . the gala 's artistic director , austrian andre heller , was naturally gutted by the news .
" it is with a great sense of sadness that i leave my exciting work for the fifa world cup gala in berlin , " heller said in a presumably tear-stained statement . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany pulls out all the stops for cultural world cup the 2006 world cup will not only be a soccer spectacle but the run-up to the main event itself will be a cultural extravaganza which , the german organizers say , will give the prestigious event that extra dash of pizzazz .

according to bush , the two spent some 45 minutes along together in the white house oval office . chancellor merkel told the assembled press at the joint press conference after the talks that germany would not be intimidated by iran .
she added that iran 's statements on israel and the holocaust were " totally unacceptable . " western countries " will not be intimidated " by iran 's decision to go ahead with its nuclear program , merkel said friday at a press conference with us president george w. bush .
" it 's essential , we feel , that the eu-3 -lrb- britain , france and germany -rrb- , together with the united states , take a common position here , become active , " merkel said following her first official meeting with bush as german chancellor . " we will not be intimidated by any country such as iran , " she vowed , adding that it was essential to persuade as many countries as possible to speak with one voice on the issue .
both leaders , however , expressed a desire to follow a diplomatic course in an attempt to come to a solution .
" we spent some time talking about the iranian issue and the desire to solve this issue diplomatically - by working together , " bush said . big job ahead bush opened the press conference by saying it was an honor to have chancellor merkel at the white house and that germany was a " valued ally " of the united states . " we 've got an important job ahead of us to work on key issues , like iran , " bush said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two stressed the common ground they share he thanked germany for the part it has played in the international security assistance force in afghanistan and , although the two countries have had their differences , welcomed germany ’ s support in the quest for democracy and stability in iraq . " it 's a difficult issue in our relationship and i understand that , " he said , but added the two countries shared a desire for the iraqi people to live in freedom . chancellor merkel said the two leaders had had a " very open and candid " discussion which was marked by a " spirit of trust " and opened a new chapter in the german-american relationship . guantanamo one highly anticipated subject was that of guantanamo bay on the island of cuba , where the us has a prison for terrorism suspects which falls outside the purview of us law .
last weekend , merkel had criticized the prison in a magazine interview , saying it should not exist " indefinitely . "
she said she would bring it up with the us president during their meeting . when bush was asked by a reporter about the topic , he said the german leader had indeed broached the subject and that he would like " to see a way forward . "
but he defended the treatment of prisoners there and said as long as there is a terrorist threat , guantanamo would still be needed . about 500 " war on terror " detainees are held at guantanamo , some for up to four years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a detainee inside the united states naval station in guantanamo bay , cuba merkel said that germany and other countries needed to come up with proposals on how to best deal with detainees " who do n't feel bound by any law . "
she said it was important to find how international law could address the issue and added that the un was a good forum in which to do that . " the common ground is that we have shared values even though from time to time we have differences of opinion , " she said . economic ties merkel said that while terrorism was the greatest challenge facing the world in the 21st century , she did not only want to define the two countries ' relationship by that issue alone .
she stressed that economic and trade issues were also crucial , particularly in the era of globalization and the rising economic power of china . she said for the countries to meet the challenges in today 's global world , they needed to be economically strong .
she added that there were some tendencies toward isolationism within the eu , but that countries should not go down that path . good pals ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor schörder and president bush were often at odds when asked if he and chancellor merkel had gotten on better than the president had with her predecessor , gerhard schröder , with whom he shared as relationship that was often icy , bush laughed and skirted the question . the two men were barely on speaking terms by the time schröder left office in november .

some believe the real reason is a lack of interest and rising costs . it was going to be the first of its kind and an opening that would have shamed other sporting galas with its proposed pomp , preening and pop stars .
but with just five months to go before the fifa 2006 world cup gets underway , the star-studded spectacular - which would have heralded the long-awaited arrival of soccer 's greatest spectacle on german soil - has been unceremoniously dumped from the agenda . despite promising that the massive stage , which would have creaked like the knees of an aging rock star under the weight of such luminaries as brian eno , peter gabriel and the black eyed peas , would not damage the field at berlin ’ s olympiastadion , fifa cancelled the event apparently for just that reason . however , some in the german press know a cover-up when they smell one and it is likely to be revealed over the weekend that the gala event was actually cancelled because it is floating very few people 's boats .
lack of ticket sales , it is alleged , is the real reason for the cancellation . the berliner zeitung newspaper is expected to go public with revelations that the estimated 25 million euro -lrb- $ 30 million -rrb- costs are rising higher and faster than a david beckham penalty and that tickets are selling slower than those for a lothar matthäus spoken word event . blatter shedding crocodile tears for canceled event ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa president sepp blatter is an advocate of the beautiful game .
fifa are having none of it , however .
president sepp blatter maintained on friday that the gala had been cancelled on strictly sporting grounds . " personally , i still think the idea of holding such a high-profile opening event is a good one , " said blatter .
" fifa has not taken the decision to cancel the event at such a late stage lightly , but as world football 's governing body ; we must put sporting considerations first . " for conspiracy theorists , blatter 's statement arrived with a distinct whiff of fish .
the fifa president , when questioned in the past about the possibility of huge cultural event to launch the world cup , said : " football fans want to see matches .
they do n't want speeches , they want a few songs and they want to see football . "
with such a ringing endorsement , critics believe , the gala was living on borrowed time from the off . first group game would come just six days after gala bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's olympiastadion will host reigning champion brazil 's first game .
the music , dance and performance art extravaganza was due to take place on june 7 , just six days before the first world cup match at the stadium on june 13 between world champions brazil and croatia .
fifa fears that a new pitch laid own to replace the grass trampled in the opening ceremony would not be in satisfactory condition for the match to take place . " it has since become clear that there would be considerable risks involved , not only in dismantling the stages and the event 's technical installations in time but also in laying a new field , which has to be in perfect playing condition by june 12 , " fifa said in a statement . things go from bad to worse for organizing committee bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could der kaiser be making a disguised gesture to his critics here ?
it is the latest embarrassing turn in the gala 's ill-fated story .
fifa had already rescheduled the gala ceremony and the first group match in berlin last year to give an extra 48 hours to lay down new rolls of grass and give the turf time to take hold . and the cancellation comes as another blow to the german organizing committee , which is currently sulking over a report from german consumer protection agency stiftung warentest , which warned that there were serious safety concerns at all 12 world cup venues . the gala 's artistic director , austrian andre heller , was naturally gutted by the news .

the international community still prefers pursuing negotiations , experts say . responding to iran 's decision to resume sensitive nuclear fuel work , europe 's three major powers on thursday asked for an emergency meeting of the un nuclear watchdog international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- to refer the issue to the un security council , which could slap sanctions . " we believe the time has now come for the security council to become involved to reinforce the authority of iaea resolutions , " the foreign ministers of britain , france and germany , who have been trying to coax iran into renouncing a nuclear weapons capability , said in berlin . us middle east experts interviewed dismiss the prospects of biting sanctions on iran . ray takeyh , a senior fellow at the council on foreign relations , felt that the europeans would be reluctant to slap tough sanctions against tehran . " but there are other things you may be able to do : diplomatic sanctions , reducing the size of iranian representatives abroad , reducing the size of the embassies , maybe barring some transfers of technology , " he said . " there are things you can do along the margins , which can be not very substantial but do have some symbolic importance at least . " too early to tell un diplomats said it was premature to discuss the various sanctions options given that the ball was still in the iaea court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : picture shows the uranium enrichment complex in the iranian town of isfahan they said the issue was unlikely to come before the 15-member council before next month when the united states takes over the rotating presidency of the powerful body . a european official speaking on the margins of the berlin meeting said the iaea board of governors could be convened " in the coming weeks . "
he refused to be more specific . " what we want to do is use the authority and weight of the security council to bring home to iran the importance of abiding the resolution of the iaea , " the official said .
" do n't expect us to move straight to sanctions . " negotiations broke down britain , france and germany have been leading more than two years of delicate negotiations with iran to allay western fears that it is seeking to develop a weapons programme , a charge the islamic republic strongly denies . iran sparked a furious international reaction this week for breaking seals on three nuclear facilities in order to resume nuclear fuel work . " the iranians have significant oil and gas reserves and the excess capacity in the system is quite tight , " jon alterman , middle east program director at the center for strategic and international studies in washington , told afp . " so the iranian bet is that with the current oil energy market there is no way that serious sanctions that will cripple the government are possibly in sight , " he told afp .
" the assumption is that the world can talk and bluster but at the end of the day it will not threaten -lrb- their -rrb- grip on power . " russia and china ? alterman pointed out that neither russia nor china - two veto-wielding permanent members of the security council which have significant economic interests in iran - were likely to back biting sanctions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea 's director general mohamed elbaradei has the key role in the dispute " if push comes to shove , they -lrb- russians and chinese -rrb- do n't want a war with the iranians but they want the iranians to reduce the level of tension that they are creating , " he added .
" and sanctions will not frighten the government of iran . " alterman saw the whole negotiating process as " a time game . " as to the prospect for us or israeli military action against iranian facilities , he said : " i do n't see the prospect of either one in the near term but i could envisage any number of scenarios in the next five years where that would be an option .

the international community still prefers pursuing negotiations , experts say . responding to iran 's decision to resume sensitive nuclear fuel work , europe 's three major powers on thursday asked for an emergency meeting of the un nuclear watchdog international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- to refer the issue to the un security council , which could slap sanctions . " we believe the time has now come for the security council to become involved to reinforce the authority of iaea resolutions , " the foreign ministers of britain , france and germany , who have been trying to coax iran into renouncing a nuclear weapons capability , said in berlin . us middle east experts interviewed dismiss the prospects of biting sanctions on iran . ray takeyh , a senior fellow at the council on foreign relations , felt that the europeans would be reluctant to slap tough sanctions against tehran . " but there are other things you may be able to do : diplomatic sanctions , reducing the size of iranian representatives abroad , reducing the size of the embassies , maybe barring some transfers of technology , " he said . " there are things you can do along the margins , which can be not very substantial but do have some symbolic importance at least .

but the trend is down to more than just health scares . as international green week , the yearly food , agriculture and horticulture exhibition , opens in berlin on friday , the organic food industry can feel very pleased with itself .
recent findings show that more people are turning towards bio-products in germany . however , the organic seal of quality comes at a price ; and usually it is a relatively high one compared to non-bio products .
but it seems that money is increasingly less important in german consumers ' quest for safe and healthy food . meat scandals have driven trend , not created it researchers have noted a definite change in german shopping habits of late , with ecologically sound products being the preferred target .

" numerous investigations by different research institutes have shown this . " according to the zmp 's own research , consumers believe that organic products are fresher and taste better - and price is a secondary condition .
" the attitude towards more expensive foods has changed , " rippin said .
" consumers are more ready to spend more money on better food . " one recent study shows that 35 to 40 percent of the population buys bio-products at least once a month ; possibly half of all germans even more regularly .
while the core demographic is educated shoppers with higher incomes , the trend is showing that more families with young children and pensioners are going ever more frequently to bio-stores . growth rate has been rising since 2000 the growth rate for organic products has been rising steadily since the turn of the century .
in 2000 , the german organic food industry was predicting a year-on-year growth of 10 percent .

last year , an estimated 4 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.8 billion -rrb- were spent on organically produced food in germany , an increase of 10 to 15 percent in revenue from 2004 .

purely organic supermarkets have ridden the wave and boomed in the first half of the decade . those who expected a certain amount of stagnation in the market have been waiting in vain .
on the contrary , ever more organic products are featuring on the shelves of increasingly diverse businesses , from clothing to paint .

but the trend is down to more than just health scares . as international green week , the yearly food , agriculture and horticulture exhibition , opens in berlin on friday , the organic food industry can feel very pleased with itself .
recent findings show that more people are turning towards bio-products in germany . however , the organic seal of quality comes at a price ; and usually it is a relatively high one compared to non-bio products .
but it seems that money is increasingly less important in german consumers ' quest for safe and healthy food . meat scandals have driven trend , not created it researchers have noted a definite change in german shopping habits of late , with ecologically sound products being the preferred target .
markus rippin from germany 's central market and price monitoring agency -lrb- zmp -rrb- believes that , while recent factors have driven the trend , it 's no flash in the pan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recent meat scandal in germany is only one factor in the turn towards organic produce " this trend is showing longevity , and is not just influenced by events like bse , " he told german broadcaster tageschau .
" numerous investigations by different research institutes have shown this . " according to the zmp 's own research , consumers believe that organic products are fresher and taste better - and price is a secondary condition .
" the attitude towards more expensive foods has changed , " rippin said .
" consumers are more ready to spend more money on better food . " one recent study shows that 35 to 40 percent of the population buys bio-products at least once a month ; possibly half of all germans even more regularly .
while the core demographic is educated shoppers with higher incomes , the trend is showing that more families with young children and pensioners are going ever more frequently to bio-stores . growth rate has been rising since 2000 the growth rate for organic products has been rising steadily since the turn of the century .
in 2000 , the german organic food industry was predicting a year-on-year growth of 10 percent .
by 2004 , products such as vegetable juice had seen a 55 percent rise .
other products experiencing similar growth include milk products and baby food . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organic bread ?
yes , please !
last year , an estimated 4 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.8 billion -rrb- were spent on organically produced food in germany , an increase of 10 to 15 percent in revenue from 2004 .
the revenue produced from bio-food in germany has been steadily on the rise for the past five years with 2001 seeing a massive 30 percent surge in profits . more stores , more diversity extending trend 's lifespan since then , more and more stores , especially supermarkets and drugstores , have been increasing their selections of bio-food to meet consumer demand .
purely organic supermarkets have ridden the wave and boomed in the first half of the decade . those who expected a certain amount of stagnation in the market have been waiting in vain .
on the contrary , ever more organic products are featuring on the shelves of increasingly diverse businesses , from clothing to paint .
the distribution network for bio-products has also improved , meaning the supply is equipped to meet demand . it appears that the organic success story has yet to reach its final page . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de celebrating an ecologically friendly christmas most people want to celebrate the holidays in traditional fashion and have fun doing so .

but rather than solving the problem , the tactic creates new difficulties , says deutsche welle 's peter philipp . the simmering anger in berlin , london and paris in the last few days was an indication that iran 's resumption of research into nuclear fuel - particularly at the highly controversial natan enrichment plant - would not be without a drastic reaction . but the eu troika foreign ministers ' decision to refer iran to the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , and if necessary haul it before the un security council , does n't do justice to the expectations .
instead , it 's akin to making a mountain of a molehill . new , bigger headaches ? the europeans have once again shown they are n't in a position to solve international problems .
in this case , they have not only failed to solve the problem , but perhaps also created the basis for new and bigger ones . should the us get its way and push through the imposition of sanctions on iran in the un security council , people in washington as well as in brussels , as indeed elsewhere in europe , are well aware that such sanctions - no matter how they are formulated - are n't an effective way of getting a country " on the right course . " it did n't work in iraq or in cuba and it has an even slimmer chance of working in iran . sanctions would be counterproductive that 's because iran currently earns well with its oil and gas exports and the iranian people too , despite all the criticism , are firmly backing their government on the nuclear issue . sanctions would just drive the iranians into the arms of their conservative leadership .
they would also be counterproductive for the economic interests of the europeans , who have until now furiously wooed iran on trade issues . besides , it is n't even clear yet whether sanctions will be agreed upon and whether they can then be forced on iran .
china , for instance , probably wo n't be interested in doing so , since it is dependant on iran for oil and gas .
and even russia 's stance is ambiguous , given that moscow is deeply involved in the development of iran 's nuclear plants . possible bitter retaliation but the biggest fallout from forced sanctions could be iran 's decision to get out of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
the country has been complying with the treaty 's guidelines so far , allowing the inspection of its nuclear facilities and cooperating with the vienna-based iaea . but all that could , with one stroke , come to an abrupt halt .
that would in turn increase mistrust on the part of the americans and some of the europeans and would lead to a deadlock , since the use of force would continue to be ruled out - the lessons of iraq were memorable enough . the developments in tehran will be followed calmly , because everyone knows well that sanctions would probably hurt the europeans more than iran .
that is common knowledge in washington and also a source of regret . europe just a paper tiger but what is even more regrettable is the fact that europe has once again shown itself to be a paper tiger and exposed itself to ridicule by the hardliners in tehran . it 's happened before , when the former ayatollah ali khomeini sneered at the exit of european diplomats : " let them go : they 'll come crawling back again .

the international community still prefers pursuing negotiations , experts say . responding to iran 's decision to resume sensitive nuclear fuel work , europe 's three major powers on thursday asked for an emergency meeting of the un nuclear watchdog international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- to refer the issue to the un security council , which could slap sanctions . " we believe the time has now come for the security council to become involved to reinforce the authority of iaea resolutions , " the foreign ministers of britain , france and germany , who have been trying to coax iran into renouncing a nuclear weapons capability , said in berlin . us middle east experts interviewed dismiss the prospects of biting sanctions on iran . ray takeyh , a senior fellow at the council on foreign relations , felt that the europeans would be reluctant to slap tough sanctions against tehran . " but there are other things you may be able to do : diplomatic sanctions , reducing the size of iranian representatives abroad , reducing the size of the embassies , maybe barring some transfers of technology , " he said . " there are things you can do along the margins , which can be not very substantial but do have some symbolic importance at least . " too early to tell un diplomats said it was premature to discuss the various sanctions options given that the ball was still in the iaea court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : picture shows the uranium enrichment complex in the iranian town of isfahan they said the issue was unlikely to come before the 15-member council before next month when the united states takes over the rotating presidency of the powerful body . a european official speaking on the margins of the berlin meeting said the iaea board of governors could be convened " in the coming weeks . "
he refused to be more specific . " what we want to do is use the authority and weight of the security council to bring home to iran the importance of abiding the resolution of the iaea , " the official said .
" do n't expect us to move straight to sanctions . " negotiations broke down britain , france and germany have been leading more than two years of delicate negotiations with iran to allay western fears that it is seeking to develop a weapons programme , a charge the islamic republic strongly denies . iran sparked a furious international reaction this week for breaking seals on three nuclear facilities in order to resume nuclear fuel work . " the iranians have significant oil and gas reserves and the excess capacity in the system is quite tight , " jon alterman , middle east program director at the center for strategic and international studies in washington , told afp . " so the iranian bet is that with the current oil energy market there is no way that serious sanctions that will cripple the government are possibly in sight , " he told afp .
" the assumption is that the world can talk and bluster but at the end of the day it will not threaten -lrb- their -rrb- grip on power . " russia and china ? alterman pointed out that neither russia nor china - two veto-wielding permanent members of the security council which have significant economic interests in iran - were likely to back biting sanctions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea 's director general mohamed elbaradei has the key role in the dispute " if push comes to shove , they -lrb- russians and chinese -rrb- do n't want a war with the iranians but they want the iranians to reduce the level of tension that they are creating , " he added .
" and sanctions will not frighten the government of iran . " alterman saw the whole negotiating process as " a time game . " as to the prospect for us or israeli military action against iranian facilities , he said : " i do n't see the prospect of either one in the near term but i could envisage any number of scenarios in the next five years where that would be an option .

but rather than solving the problem , the tactic creates new difficulties , says deutsche welle 's peter philipp . the simmering anger in berlin , london and paris in the last few days was an indication that iran 's resumption of research into nuclear fuel - particularly at the highly controversial natan enrichment plant - would not be without a drastic reaction . but the eu troika foreign ministers ' decision to refer iran to the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , and if necessary haul it before the un security council , does n't do justice to the expectations .
instead , it 's akin to making a mountain of a molehill . new , bigger headaches ? the europeans have once again shown they are n't in a position to solve international problems .

they would also be counterproductive for the economic interests of the europeans , who have until now furiously wooed iran on trade issues . besides , it is n't even clear yet whether sanctions will be agreed upon and whether they can then be forced on iran .
china , for instance , probably wo n't be interested in doing so , since it is dependant on iran for oil and gas .
and even russia 's stance is ambiguous , given that moscow is deeply involved in the development of iran 's nuclear plants . possible bitter retaliation but the biggest fallout from forced sanctions could be iran 's decision to get out of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
the country has been complying with the treaty 's guidelines so far , allowing the inspection of its nuclear facilities and cooperating with the vienna-based iaea . but all that could , with one stroke , come to an abrupt halt .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.01.2006 opinion : sanctions will hurt europe more than iran großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's vocal opposition in europe to iran 's nuclear dabbling germany , france and britain may refer iran to the un security council for nuclear breaches .
but rather than solving the problem , the tactic creates new difficulties , says deutsche welle 's peter philipp . the simmering anger in berlin , london and paris in the last few days was an indication that iran 's resumption of research into nuclear fuel - particularly at the highly controversial natan enrichment plant - would not be without a drastic reaction . but the eu troika foreign ministers ' decision to refer iran to the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , and if necessary haul it before the un security council , does n't do justice to the expectations .
instead , it 's akin to making a mountain of a molehill . new , bigger headaches ? the europeans have once again shown they are n't in a position to solve international problems .
in this case , they have not only failed to solve the problem , but perhaps also created the basis for new and bigger ones . should the us get its way and push through the imposition of sanctions on iran in the un security council , people in washington as well as in brussels , as indeed elsewhere in europe , are well aware that such sanctions - no matter how they are formulated - are n't an effective way of getting a country " on the right course . " it did n't work in iraq or in cuba and it has an even slimmer chance of working in iran . sanctions would be counterproductive that 's because iran currently earns well with its oil and gas exports and the iranian people too , despite all the criticism , are firmly backing their government on the nuclear issue . sanctions would just drive the iranians into the arms of their conservative leadership .
they would also be counterproductive for the economic interests of the europeans , who have until now furiously wooed iran on trade issues . besides , it is n't even clear yet whether sanctions will be agreed upon and whether they can then be forced on iran .
china , for instance , probably wo n't be interested in doing so , since it is dependant on iran for oil and gas .
and even russia 's stance is ambiguous , given that moscow is deeply involved in the development of iran 's nuclear plants . possible bitter retaliation but the biggest fallout from forced sanctions could be iran 's decision to get out of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
the country has been complying with the treaty 's guidelines so far , allowing the inspection of its nuclear facilities and cooperating with the vienna-based iaea . but all that could , with one stroke , come to an abrupt halt .
that would in turn increase mistrust on the part of the americans and some of the europeans and would lead to a deadlock , since the use of force would continue to be ruled out - the lessons of iraq were memorable enough . the developments in tehran will be followed calmly , because everyone knows well that sanctions would probably hurt the europeans more than iran .
that is common knowledge in washington and also a source of regret . europe just a paper tiger but what is even more regrettable is the fact that europe has once again shown itself to be a paper tiger and exposed itself to ridicule by the hardliners in tehran . it 's happened before , when the former ayatollah ali khomeini sneered at the exit of european diplomats : " let them go : they 'll come crawling back again .

" if the dossier is sent to the security council , the european countries will lose the means which are currently at their disposal , because ... the government will be obliged , in conformity with the law adopted by parliament , to end all its voluntary measures of cooperation , " iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki was quoted as saying by the official irna news agency . iran 's standoff with the international community escalated after tehran on tuesday resumed sensitive nuclear research linked to uranium enrichment , which produces fuel for nuclear power reactors but can also be used to make atomic bombs . europe 's three major powers responded by calling for an emergency meeting of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , while un chief kofi annan said iran was still keen on pursuing nuclear talks with european powers . british foreign secretary jack straw said consensus was growing among the international community , including russia , for action but said the military option was not being considered . " i think in current circumstances it would not be conceivable , it would not be appropriate , " he said .
" iran is not iraq , we 're working with the international community to resolve this in a peaceful and diplomatic manner . " iran in " dangerous defiance " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad is a controversial figure internationally in december iran 's hardline president mahmoud ahmadinejad signed off on legislation that could limit un inspections at iran 's nuclear sites if its case is taken to the security council . the law obliges the government to " stop voluntary and non-legally binding measures and implement its scientific , research and executive programs " if the security council gets involved . ahmadinejad has ordered iran 's atomic energy agency to be prepared to apply the law , the fars news agency reported .
the law does not refer to specific forms of retaliation , but counter-measures could include resumption of uranium enrichment as well as refusing to adhere to the additional protocol of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , which gives increased inspection powers to the iaea . the additional protocol was signed by the previous reformist government but was never ratified by parliamentarians in the conservative-run parliament . compliance with the additional protocol is seen as being crucial to an iaea probe into allegations that iran is using an atomic energy drive as a cover for weapons development . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us remains wary of iran 's nuclear motives in washington , us secretary of state condoleezza rice accused tehran of a " deliberate escalation " of the dispute , and said it was in " dangerous defiance of the entire international community . " while threatening to halt cooperation , iranian officials have nevertheless signaled their willingness for negotiations to be continued , but on their terms . iran still interested in talks after a telephone conversation with iran 's top nuclear negotiator ali larijani , annan said thursday that tehran was still keen on pursuing " serious " nuclear talks with european powers . " he affirmed to me that they are interested in serious and constructive negotiation , but within a timeframe , " annan said , quoting larijani as saying that the previous round of negotiations " had lasted two and a half years without any results . " the head of iran 's nuclear negotiating team javad vaidi said on state television thursday : " we are still hopeful that the negotiations can make progress . "
however , he warned that " if the europeans want to carry out the threats , it will cause iran 's behavior to change and intensify the present situation . " mottaki urged the europeans to deal with iran 's nuclear activities with " discretion , patience and a rational attitude . " " we advise the europeans to separate the question of research from producing the nuclear fuel and do not propagate around the nuclear research activities which had been unjustly suspended , " he said . " if they want to discuss making nuclear fuel we are ready to follow up with the negotiations with the eu-3 , " he said .
if the negotiations are broken off by the europeans " iran will only be in contact with the iaea to maintain its legitimate and natural rights .

german intelligence agency expert erich schmidt-eenboom offers his take on the allegations that german secret agents were involved in assessing targets during the us military invasion in iraq . dw-world : both the süddeutsche zeitung and the television channel ard have reported that german agents helped the us pick out bombing targets - including saddam hussein .
what do you think of the accusations ? erich schmidt eenboom : they are partly justified .
the federal intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- surely kept up contact with their partner agency , the defense intelligence agency , despite the political tension between washington and berlin during the iraq war .
they surely also did that with the backing of the chancellor 's office .
as a result , the knowledgeable bnd agents in baghdad probably gathered information on targets to avoid but also , in my opinion , worthwhile targets . what they ca n't be accused of is functioning as real-time scouts , with the information they relayed back being used for us bombing attacks soon after . was it normal that bnd workers continued their work in iraq , even after the german embassy was closed ? the bnd has been baghdad since the early 1980s , and it has a very big and important office there .
the desire and need of the federal government for information , both leading up to the war and during the war , was large and gathering information locally is one of a foreign intelligence agency 's core duties . how far did intelligence cooperation go during the iraq war ?
and how much did the office of chancellor gerhard schröder know ?
the intelligence coordinator in the chancellor 's office , -lrb- current foreign minister frank-walter -rrb- steinmeier , surely knew the extent of the cooperation , and was kept up to date on the information exchange on the working level , which is defined by strict regulations .
the bnd agents most definitely did not have direct radio or fax communication with american agencies .
the contact probably always went through the -lrb- bnd headquarters -rrb- in pullach . the coalition government won a lot of respect in the arab world for their rejection of the iraq war .
will their reputation suffer a setback following these revelations ? partly , because i think that 's what 's behind the publication of these stories .
we 're experiencing a sort of psychological attack on the part of the american intelligence agencies against the old social democratic-green party coalition government , but also against the new government following merkel 's demand that the us close guantanamo bay .
the americans want to make clear - especially in light of their bad image following the cia torture allegations - that germany is n't as pure as assumed , because they were more involved in the iraq war than they said they were . is it possible that germany could become the target of islamic terrorists as a result of these allegations ? i do n't think so .
islamic terrorists , especially those in iraq , have other priorities , namely the american occupiers .
i think the growing militancy in afghanistan is more likely to have an effect in germany , creating a threatening scenario especially ahead and during the soccer world cup . to what extent ? that is hard to predict .
we 're experiencing a radicalization of youth and a professionalization of terrorism in afghanistan , but also in bosnia .
at one point , the terrorists and terrorism will no longer only be directed at german soldiers in those places , but against the motherland , against the country that sent them , namely germany .
it 's hard to say at what point that will happen and with what sort of intensity .
erich schmidt-eenboom is director of the research institute for peace policies and considered one of germany 's top experts on the bnd .
he was unwittingly spied on during his research into the bnd in the 1990s , an act for which the former intelligence agency head has apologized .

german intelligence agency expert erich schmidt-eenboom offers his take on the allegations that german secret agents were involved in assessing targets during the us military invasion in iraq . dw-world : both the süddeutsche zeitung and the television channel ard have reported that german agents helped the us pick out bombing targets - including saddam hussein .
what do you think of the accusations ? erich schmidt eenboom : they are partly justified .
the federal intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- surely kept up contact with their partner agency , the defense intelligence agency , despite the political tension between washington and berlin during the iraq war .
they surely also did that with the backing of the chancellor 's office .
as a result , the knowledgeable bnd agents in baghdad probably gathered information on targets to avoid but also , in my opinion , worthwhile targets . what they ca n't be accused of is functioning as real-time scouts , with the information they relayed back being used for us bombing attacks soon after . was it normal that bnd workers continued their work in iraq , even after the german embassy was closed ? the bnd has been baghdad since the early 1980s , and it has a very big and important office there .
the desire and need of the federal government for information , both leading up to the war and during the war , was large and gathering information locally is one of a foreign intelligence agency 's core duties . how far did intelligence cooperation go during the iraq war ?
and how much did the office of chancellor gerhard schröder know ?
the intelligence coordinator in the chancellor 's office , -lrb- current foreign minister frank-walter -rrb- steinmeier , surely knew the extent of the cooperation , and was kept up to date on the information exchange on the working level , which is defined by strict regulations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.01.2006 opinion : sanctions will hurt europe more than iran großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's vocal opposition in europe to iran 's nuclear dabbling germany , france and britain may refer iran to the un security council for nuclear breaches .
but rather than solving the problem , the tactic creates new difficulties , says deutsche welle 's peter philipp . the simmering anger in berlin , london and paris in the last few days was an indication that iran 's resumption of research into nuclear fuel - particularly at the highly controversial natan enrichment plant - would not be without a drastic reaction . but the eu troika foreign ministers ' decision to refer iran to the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , and if necessary haul it before the un security council , does n't do justice to the expectations .
instead , it 's akin to making a mountain of a molehill . new , bigger headaches ? the europeans have once again shown they are n't in a position to solve international problems .
in this case , they have not only failed to solve the problem , but perhaps also created the basis for new and bigger ones . should the us get its way and push through the imposition of sanctions on iran in the un security council , people in washington as well as in brussels , as indeed elsewhere in europe , are well aware that such sanctions - no matter how they are formulated - are n't an effective way of getting a country " on the right course . " it did n't work in iraq or in cuba and it has an even slimmer chance of working in iran . sanctions would be counterproductive that 's because iran currently earns well with its oil and gas exports and the iranian people too , despite all the criticism , are firmly backing their government on the nuclear issue . sanctions would just drive the iranians into the arms of their conservative leadership .
they would also be counterproductive for the economic interests of the europeans , who have until now furiously wooed iran on trade issues . besides , it is n't even clear yet whether sanctions will be agreed upon and whether they can then be forced on iran .
china , for instance , probably wo n't be interested in doing so , since it is dependant on iran for oil and gas .
and even russia 's stance is ambiguous , given that moscow is deeply involved in the development of iran 's nuclear plants . possible bitter retaliation but the biggest fallout from forced sanctions could be iran 's decision to get out of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
the country has been complying with the treaty 's guidelines so far , allowing the inspection of its nuclear facilities and cooperating with the vienna-based iaea . but all that could , with one stroke , come to an abrupt halt .
that would in turn increase mistrust on the part of the americans and some of the europeans and would lead to a deadlock , since the use of force would continue to be ruled out - the lessons of iraq were memorable enough . the developments in tehran will be followed calmly , because everyone knows well that sanctions would probably hurt the europeans more than iran .
that is common knowledge in washington and also a source of regret . europe just a paper tiger but what is even more regrettable is the fact that europe has once again shown itself to be a paper tiger and exposed itself to ridicule by the hardliners in tehran . it 's happened before , when the former ayatollah ali khomeini sneered at the exit of european diplomats : " let them go : they 'll come crawling back again .

german intelligence agency expert erich schmidt-eenboom offers his take on the allegations that german secret agents were involved in assessing targets during the us military invasion in iraq . dw-world : both the süddeutsche zeitung and the television channel ard have reported that german agents helped the us pick out bombing targets - including saddam hussein .

the desire and need of the federal government for information , both leading up to the war and during the war , was large and gathering information locally is one of a foreign intelligence agency 's core duties . how far did intelligence cooperation go during the iraq war ?
and how much did the office of chancellor gerhard schröder know ?
the intelligence coordinator in the chancellor 's office , -lrb- current foreign minister frank-walter -rrb- steinmeier , surely knew the extent of the cooperation , and was kept up to date on the information exchange on the working level , which is defined by strict regulations .
the bnd agents most definitely did not have direct radio or fax communication with american agencies .
the contact probably always went through the -lrb- bnd headquarters -rrb- in pullach . the coalition government won a lot of respect in the arab world for their rejection of the iraq war .
will their reputation suffer a setback following these revelations ? partly , because i think that 's what 's behind the publication of these stories .
we 're experiencing a sort of psychological attack on the part of the american intelligence agencies against the old social democratic-green party coalition government , but also against the new government following merkel 's demand that the us close guantanamo bay .
the americans want to make clear - especially in light of their bad image following the cia torture allegations - that germany is n't as pure as assumed , because they were more involved in the iraq war than they said they were . is it possible that germany could become the target of islamic terrorists as a result of these allegations ? i do n't think so .
islamic terrorists , especially those in iraq , have other priorities , namely the american occupiers .
i think the growing militancy in afghanistan is more likely to have an effect in germany , creating a threatening scenario especially ahead and during the soccer world cup . to what extent ? that is hard to predict .
we 're experiencing a radicalization of youth and a professionalization of terrorism in afghanistan , but also in bosnia .
at one point , the terrorists and terrorism will no longer only be directed at german soldiers in those places , but against the motherland , against the country that sent them , namely germany .
it 's hard to say at what point that will happen and with what sort of intensity .
erich schmidt-eenboom is director of the research institute for peace policies and considered one of germany 's top experts on the bnd .

german intelligence agency expert erich schmidt-eenboom offers his take on the allegations that german secret agents were involved in assessing targets during the us military invasion in iraq . dw-world : both the süddeutsche zeitung and the television channel ard have reported that german agents helped the us pick out bombing targets - including saddam hussein .
what do you think of the accusations ? erich schmidt eenboom : they are partly justified .
the federal intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- surely kept up contact with their partner agency , the defense intelligence agency , despite the political tension between washington and berlin during the iraq war .
they surely also did that with the backing of the chancellor 's office .
as a result , the knowledgeable bnd agents in baghdad probably gathered information on targets to avoid but also , in my opinion , worthwhile targets . what they ca n't be accused of is functioning as real-time scouts , with the information they relayed back being used for us bombing attacks soon after . was it normal that bnd workers continued their work in iraq , even after the german embassy was closed ? the bnd has been baghdad since the early 1980s , and it has a very big and important office there .
the desire and need of the federal government for information , both leading up to the war and during the war , was large and gathering information locally is one of a foreign intelligence agency 's core duties . how far did intelligence cooperation go during the iraq war ?
and how much did the office of chancellor gerhard schröder know ?
the intelligence coordinator in the chancellor 's office , -lrb- current foreign minister frank-walter -rrb- steinmeier , surely knew the extent of the cooperation , and was kept up to date on the information exchange on the working level , which is defined by strict regulations .
the bnd agents most definitely did not have direct radio or fax communication with american agencies .
the contact probably always went through the -lrb- bnd headquarters -rrb- in pullach . the coalition government won a lot of respect in the arab world for their rejection of the iraq war .
will their reputation suffer a setback following these revelations ? partly , because i think that 's what 's behind the publication of these stories .
we 're experiencing a sort of psychological attack on the part of the american intelligence agencies against the old social democratic-green party coalition government , but also against the new government following merkel 's demand that the us close guantanamo bay .
the americans want to make clear - especially in light of their bad image following the cia torture allegations - that germany is n't as pure as assumed , because they were more involved in the iraq war than they said they were . is it possible that germany could become the target of islamic terrorists as a result of these allegations ? i do n't think so .
islamic terrorists , especially those in iraq , have other priorities , namely the american occupiers .
i think the growing militancy in afghanistan is more likely to have an effect in germany , creating a threatening scenario especially ahead and during the soccer world cup . to what extent ? that is hard to predict .
we 're experiencing a radicalization of youth and a professionalization of terrorism in afghanistan , but also in bosnia .
at one point , the terrorists and terrorism will no longer only be directed at german soldiers in those places , but against the motherland , against the country that sent them , namely germany .
it 's hard to say at what point that will happen and with what sort of intensity .
erich schmidt-eenboom is director of the research institute for peace policies and considered one of germany 's top experts on the bnd .
he was unwittingly spied on during his research into the bnd in the 1990s , an act for which the former intelligence agency head has apologized .

" if the dossier is sent to the security council , the european countries will lose the means which are currently at their disposal , because ... the government will be obliged , in conformity with the law adopted by parliament , to end all its voluntary measures of cooperation , " iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki was quoted as saying by the official irna news agency . iran 's standoff with the international community escalated after tehran on tuesday resumed sensitive nuclear research linked to uranium enrichment , which produces fuel for nuclear power reactors but can also be used to make atomic bombs . europe 's three major powers responded by calling for an emergency meeting of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , while un chief kofi annan said iran was still keen on pursuing nuclear talks with european powers . british foreign secretary jack straw said consensus was growing among the international community , including russia , for action but said the military option was not being considered . " i think in current circumstances it would not be conceivable , it would not be appropriate , " he said .
" iran is not iraq , we 're working with the international community to resolve this in a peaceful and diplomatic manner . " iran in " dangerous defiance " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad is a controversial figure internationally in december iran 's hardline president mahmoud ahmadinejad signed off on legislation that could limit un inspections at iran 's nuclear sites if its case is taken to the security council . the law obliges the government to " stop voluntary and non-legally binding measures and implement its scientific , research and executive programs " if the security council gets involved . ahmadinejad has ordered iran 's atomic energy agency to be prepared to apply the law , the fars news agency reported .
the law does not refer to specific forms of retaliation , but counter-measures could include resumption of uranium enrichment as well as refusing to adhere to the additional protocol of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , which gives increased inspection powers to the iaea . the additional protocol was signed by the previous reformist government but was never ratified by parliamentarians in the conservative-run parliament . compliance with the additional protocol is seen as being crucial to an iaea probe into allegations that iran is using an atomic energy drive as a cover for weapons development . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us remains wary of iran 's nuclear motives in washington , us secretary of state condoleezza rice accused tehran of a " deliberate escalation " of the dispute , and said it was in " dangerous defiance of the entire international community . " while threatening to halt cooperation , iranian officials have nevertheless signaled their willingness for negotiations to be continued , but on their terms . iran still interested in talks after a telephone conversation with iran 's top nuclear negotiator ali larijani , annan said thursday that tehran was still keen on pursuing " serious " nuclear talks with european powers . " he affirmed to me that they are interested in serious and constructive negotiation , but within a timeframe , " annan said , quoting larijani as saying that the previous round of negotiations " had lasted two and a half years without any results . " the head of iran 's nuclear negotiating team javad vaidi said on state television thursday : " we are still hopeful that the negotiations can make progress . "
however , he warned that " if the europeans want to carry out the threats , it will cause iran 's behavior to change and intensify the present situation . " mottaki urged the europeans to deal with iran 's nuclear activities with " discretion , patience and a rational attitude . " " we advise the europeans to separate the question of research from producing the nuclear fuel and do not propagate around the nuclear research activities which had been unjustly suspended , " he said . " if they want to discuss making nuclear fuel we are ready to follow up with the negotiations with the eu-3 , " he said .
if the negotiations are broken off by the europeans " iran will only be in contact with the iaea to maintain its legitimate and natural rights .

some believe the real reason is a lack of interest and rising costs . it was going to be the first of its kind and an opening that would have shamed other sporting galas with its proposed pomp , preening and pop stars .
but with just five months to go before the fifa 2006 world cup gets underway , the star-studded spectacular - which would have heralded the long-awaited arrival of soccer 's greatest spectacle on german soil - has been unceremoniously dumped from the agenda . despite promising that the massive stage , which would have creaked like the knees of an aging rock star under the weight of such luminaries as brian eno , peter gabriel and the black eyed peas , would not damage the field at berlin ’ s olympiastadion , fifa cancelled the event apparently for just that reason . however , some in the german press know a cover-up when they smell one and it is likely to be revealed over the weekend that the gala event was actually cancelled because it is floating very few people 's boats .
lack of ticket sales , it is alleged , is the real reason for the cancellation . the berliner zeitung newspaper is expected to go public with revelations that the estimated 25 million euro -lrb- $ 30 million -rrb- costs are rising higher and faster than a david beckham penalty and that tickets are selling slower than those for a lothar matthäus spoken word event . blatter shedding crocodile tears for canceled event ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa president sepp blatter is an advocate of the beautiful game .
fifa are having none of it , however .
president sepp blatter maintained on friday that the gala had been cancelled on strictly sporting grounds . " personally , i still think the idea of holding such a high-profile opening event is a good one , " said blatter .
" fifa has not taken the decision to cancel the event at such a late stage lightly , but as world football 's governing body ; we must put sporting considerations first . " for conspiracy theorists , blatter 's statement arrived with a distinct whiff of fish .
the fifa president , when questioned in the past about the possibility of huge cultural event to launch the world cup , said : " football fans want to see matches .
they do n't want speeches , they want a few songs and they want to see football . "
with such a ringing endorsement , critics believe , the gala was living on borrowed time from the off . first group game would come just six days after gala bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's olympiastadion will host reigning champion brazil 's first game .
the music , dance and performance art extravaganza was due to take place on june 7 , just six days before the first world cup match at the stadium on june 13 between world champions brazil and croatia .
fifa fears that a new pitch laid own to replace the grass trampled in the opening ceremony would not be in satisfactory condition for the match to take place . " it has since become clear that there would be considerable risks involved , not only in dismantling the stages and the event 's technical installations in time but also in laying a new field , which has to be in perfect playing condition by june 12 , " fifa said in a statement . things go from bad to worse for organizing committee bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could der kaiser be making a disguised gesture to his critics here ?
it is the latest embarrassing turn in the gala 's ill-fated story .
fifa had already rescheduled the gala ceremony and the first group match in berlin last year to give an extra 48 hours to lay down new rolls of grass and give the turf time to take hold . and the cancellation comes as another blow to the german organizing committee , which is currently sulking over a report from german consumer protection agency stiftung warentest , which warned that there were serious safety concerns at all 12 world cup venues . the gala 's artistic director , austrian andre heller , was naturally gutted by the news .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.01.2006 europe pledges bird flu aid as virus mutates großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gathering and killing large numbers of birds is one the few options to fight virus mutation a possibly dangerous genetic mutation in the avian flu virus has doctors in turkey concerned .
the european union , meanwhile , has promised more than $ 100 million to aid the global fight against the spread of the flu . the world health organization reported the mutation in the h5n1 virus after detecting it in the dna of two turkish patients on friday .
though the mutation allows the virus to adapt more easily to humans than to birds , experts said it was too early for widespread concern . " it 's a single discovery , which appearing isolated in a virus is not of much importance at the moment , " said dr. christian drosten , a virologist at the bernhardt-nocht institute for tropical medicine in hamburg in an interview .
" such single mutations do n't indicate whether a virus has gotten more dangerous . " test developed to detect mutations the report nevertheless raised the caution level .
the flu epidemic of 1918 , which killed tens of millions of people in a span of 18 months , jumped directly from birds to humans , according to researchers at the scripps research institute in california .
scientists and health care officials have watched the avian flu in turkey warily for signs of the same . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the virus has yet to jump from birds to humans in large numbers scripps scientists announced this week that they had developed a test to detect such mutations , warning health officials when the virus might jump ship from birds to humans .
at the moment , the h5n1 strain of the virus still primarily infects birds and only rarely passes to people .
since late 2003 , more than 70 people have been killed by the strain as it spread from asia to europe .
two have died in turkey and 15 have been infected since the beginning of the year , bringing the flu to europe 's doorstep and prompting a host of monitoring measures from european governments in recent days . virus showing no major changes on friday , the eu pledged $ 100 million -lrb- 82.6 million euros -rrb- in aid to go toward stopping the spread of the virus , and turkey stepped up bird inspections .
doctors on friday said they were testing whether the death of a 4-year-old girl in eastern turkey was caused by the virus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : avian flu is on europe 's doorstep drosten , the berlin scientist , said the development of the virus in turkey in the coming weeks will give scientists ideas on how to combat it .
at the moment , the virus is behaving the same way as it did in hong kong three years ago , where only the people who had contact with infected birds were themselves infected . he said mutations are difficult to combat .
" what you can do is to suppress the process by which mutations come about - the replication , " he said .
" in the case of h5n1 , that means eliminating the masses of replicated viruses by killing the infected birds .

the european union , meanwhile , has promised more than $ 100 million to aid the global fight against the spread of the flu . the world health organization reported the mutation in the h5n1 virus after detecting it in the dna of two turkish patients on friday .
though the mutation allows the virus to adapt more easily to humans than to birds , experts said it was too early for widespread concern . " it 's a single discovery , which appearing isolated in a virus is not of much importance at the moment , " said dr. christian drosten , a virologist at the bernhardt-nocht institute for tropical medicine in hamburg in an interview .
" such single mutations do n't indicate whether a virus has gotten more dangerous . " test developed to detect mutations the report nevertheless raised the caution level .
the flu epidemic of 1918 , which killed tens of millions of people in a span of 18 months , jumped directly from birds to humans , according to researchers at the scripps research institute in california .
scientists and health care officials have watched the avian flu in turkey warily for signs of the same . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the virus has yet to jump from birds to humans in large numbers scripps scientists announced this week that they had developed a test to detect such mutations , warning health officials when the virus might jump ship from birds to humans .
at the moment , the h5n1 strain of the virus still primarily infects birds and only rarely passes to people .
since late 2003 , more than 70 people have been killed by the strain as it spread from asia to europe .
two have died in turkey and 15 have been infected since the beginning of the year , bringing the flu to europe 's doorstep and prompting a host of monitoring measures from european governments in recent days . virus showing no major changes on friday , the eu pledged $ 100 million -lrb- 82.6 million euros -rrb- in aid to go toward stopping the spread of the virus , and turkey stepped up bird inspections .
doctors on friday said they were testing whether the death of a 4-year-old girl in eastern turkey was caused by the virus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : avian flu is on europe 's doorstep drosten , the berlin scientist , said the development of the virus in turkey in the coming weeks will give scientists ideas on how to combat it .
at the moment , the virus is behaving the same way as it did in hong kong three years ago , where only the people who had contact with infected birds were themselves infected . he said mutations are difficult to combat .
" what you can do is to suppress the process by which mutations come about - the replication , " he said .
" in the case of h5n1 , that means eliminating the masses of replicated viruses by killing the infected birds .

" we spent some time talking about the iranian issue and the desire to solve this issue diplomatically - by working together , " bush said . big job ahead bush opened the press conference by saying it was an honor to have chancellor merkel at the white house and that germany was a " valued ally " of the united states . " we 've got an important job ahead of us to work on key issues , like iran , " bush said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two stressed the common ground they share he thanked germany for the part it has played in the international security assistance force in afghanistan and , although the two countries have had their differences , welcomed germany ’ s support in the quest for democracy and stability in iraq . " it 's a difficult issue in our relationship and i understand that , " he said , but added the two countries shared a desire for the iraqi people to live in freedom . chancellor merkel said the two leaders had had a " very open and candid " discussion which was marked by a " spirit of trust " and opened a new chapter in the german-american relationship . guantanamo one highly anticipated subject was that of guantanamo bay on the island of cuba , where the us has a prison for terrorism suspects which falls outside the purview of us law .
last weekend , merkel had criticized the prison in a magazine interview , saying it should not exist " indefinitely . "
she said she would bring it up with the us president during their meeting . when bush was asked by a reporter about the topic , he said the german leader had indeed broached the subject and that he would like " to see a way forward . "
but he defended the treatment of prisoners there and said as long as there is a terrorist threat , guantanamo would still be needed . about 500 " war on terror " detainees are held at guantanamo , some for up to four years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a detainee inside the united states naval station in guantanamo bay , cuba merkel said that germany and other countries needed to come up with proposals on how to best deal with detainees " who do n't feel bound by any law . "
she said it was important to find how international law could address the issue and added that the un was a good forum in which to do that . " the common ground is that we have shared values even though from time to time we have differences of opinion , " she said . economic ties merkel said that while terrorism was the greatest challenge facing the world in the 21st century , she did not only want to define the two countries ' relationship by that issue alone .
she stressed that economic and trade issues were also crucial , particularly in the era of globalization and the rising economic power of china . she said for the countries to meet the challenges in today 's global world , they needed to be economically strong .
she added that there were some tendencies toward isolationism within the eu , but that countries should not go down that path . good pals ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor schörder and president bush were often at odds when asked if he and chancellor merkel had gotten on better than the president had with her predecessor , gerhard schröder , with whom he shared as relationship that was often icy , bush laughed and skirted the question . the two men were barely on speaking terms by the time schröder left office in november .
bush did say , however , wanted to send his best regards to the former chancellor . regarding to the current german leader , merkel , bush said : " she 's smart , capable , and there 's a spirit to her that is appealing .
she loves freedom . " merkel told reporters after the talks that she will return to the united states in may to attend the annual meeting of the american jewish committee .
she also said she had invited bush to berlin . dw staff -lrb- nda , jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de promising washington more smiles and more help under chancellor merkel , berlin wants to strike a more upbeat tone in its relationship with washington , something analysts say that could be very beneficial to the bush administration .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : kicking off with culture germany pulls out all the stops for cultural world cup germany plans star-studded opening gala for world cup from the pen to the pitch : world literature meets soccer waiting for the world cup tourists world cup 2006 -pipe- 13.01.2006 world cup gala gets the ax großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's hallowed turf gets a stay of execution the star-studded gala which was to open the 2006 world cup in berlin has been cancelled due to concerns over damage to the olympic stadium 's pitch .
some believe the real reason is a lack of interest and rising costs . it was going to be the first of its kind and an opening that would have shamed other sporting galas with its proposed pomp , preening and pop stars .
but with just five months to go before the fifa 2006 world cup gets underway , the star-studded spectacular - which would have heralded the long-awaited arrival of soccer 's greatest spectacle on german soil - has been unceremoniously dumped from the agenda . despite promising that the massive stage , which would have creaked like the knees of an aging rock star under the weight of such luminaries as brian eno , peter gabriel and the black eyed peas , would not damage the field at berlin ’ s olympiastadion , fifa cancelled the event apparently for just that reason . however , some in the german press know a cover-up when they smell one and it is likely to be revealed over the weekend that the gala event was actually cancelled because it is floating very few people 's boats .
lack of ticket sales , it is alleged , is the real reason for the cancellation . the berliner zeitung newspaper is expected to go public with revelations that the estimated 25 million euro -lrb- $ 30 million -rrb- costs are rising higher and faster than a david beckham penalty and that tickets are selling slower than those for a lothar matthäus spoken word event . blatter shedding crocodile tears for canceled event ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa president sepp blatter is an advocate of the beautiful game .
fifa are having none of it , however .
president sepp blatter maintained on friday that the gala had been cancelled on strictly sporting grounds . " personally , i still think the idea of holding such a high-profile opening event is a good one , " said blatter .
" fifa has not taken the decision to cancel the event at such a late stage lightly , but as world football 's governing body ; we must put sporting considerations first . " for conspiracy theorists , blatter 's statement arrived with a distinct whiff of fish .
the fifa president , when questioned in the past about the possibility of huge cultural event to launch the world cup , said : " football fans want to see matches .
they do n't want speeches , they want a few songs and they want to see football . "
with such a ringing endorsement , critics believe , the gala was living on borrowed time from the off . first group game would come just six days after gala bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's olympiastadion will host reigning champion brazil 's first game .
the music , dance and performance art extravaganza was due to take place on june 7 , just six days before the first world cup match at the stadium on june 13 between world champions brazil and croatia .
fifa fears that a new pitch laid own to replace the grass trampled in the opening ceremony would not be in satisfactory condition for the match to take place . " it has since become clear that there would be considerable risks involved , not only in dismantling the stages and the event 's technical installations in time but also in laying a new field , which has to be in perfect playing condition by june 12 , " fifa said in a statement . things go from bad to worse for organizing committee bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could der kaiser be making a disguised gesture to his critics here ?
it is the latest embarrassing turn in the gala 's ill-fated story .
fifa had already rescheduled the gala ceremony and the first group match in berlin last year to give an extra 48 hours to lay down new rolls of grass and give the turf time to take hold . and the cancellation comes as another blow to the german organizing committee , which is currently sulking over a report from german consumer protection agency stiftung warentest , which warned that there were serious safety concerns at all 12 world cup venues . the gala 's artistic director , austrian andre heller , was naturally gutted by the news .
" it is with a great sense of sadness that i leave my exciting work for the fifa world cup gala in berlin , " heller said in a presumably tear-stained statement . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany pulls out all the stops for cultural world cup the 2006 world cup will not only be a soccer spectacle but the run-up to the main event itself will be a cultural extravaganza which , the german organizers say , will give the prestigious event that extra dash of pizzazz .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : mozart year 2006 - the 250th birthday of a musical genius celebrating a quarter-millennium of mozart mozart and modern art mark the new year american director creates new space for mozart on the trail of mozart : augsburg culture & lifestyle -pipe- 13.01.2006 mozart : a pop icon with staying power großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a number of factors have helped mozart stay in the forefront for over 250 years from his beginnings as a child prodigy under the thumb of a demanding father to later year-long tours and an extravagant lifestyle , mozart set the pop star bar high , even for today 's standards . although pop stars are a contemporary invention created by the mass media , even two centuries ago , wolfgang amadeus mozart would have understood how to use the media 's influence to become successful , according to dirk hewig , president of the german mozart society . " mozart would have taken part in television shows and events , " he said .
" he wanted to be heard , and if he was alive today , i could imagine that he would be a pop star of some sort . " though the horse-drawn carriages and cobbled streets of his day are a far cry from the private jets and chauffeur-driven stretch limos today 's celebrities enjoy , mozart toured europe a number of times in his 35 years .
the opener was a four-year event that kicked off when he was just six years old and stormed through some 70 cities and royal courts across the continent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mozart 's father played the role of instructor , tutor and manager while proceeds from the initial tour went mainly to leopold mozart , wolfgang amadeus ' father , the younger mozart would have been happy to have the extra income from television appearances , cd sales and royalties to finance the luxurious apartments , trips to casinos and evenings out he enjoyed , according to hewig . the mozart brand known by name to nearly everyone in the world , regardless of their affection for classical music , mozart 's music is impossible to avoid .
" eine kleine nachtmusik " - whether recognized as " serenade no. 13 for strings in g major " or not - has been used to sell everything from pancakes to cars .
he can be heard piped through the telephone while on hold as well as by passengers waiting for the next train in munich 's subway stations . but it 's not only the music that brings in the money , especially as 2006 has been named mozart year in honor of his 250th birthday on jan .
27 .
salzburg 's mozartland , which bills itself as " the ultimate shop for mozart fans , " offers everything from mozart chocolates to sweatpants bearing the composer 's name . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : child composer whose works astonished adults of the period " the ' mozart ' brand is one of the best known in the world , " said arthur oberascher , head of the austrian national tourist office , estimating the brand 's value at about 5.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.5 billion -rrb- .
" it is no wonder we are seeing such a profusion of by-products . " a well-documented genius but even more than the abundance of mozart merchandise flooding the market , the extensive documentation of mozart 's life , including diaries and hundreds of letters he wrote , add another layer to interpretations of his music and virtually guarantee that even strangers to classical music find something about him that catches their interest . " mozart 's music brought an additional dimension to my life , and it 's my opinion that this ' drug ' can be administered to anyone , " said rudolf dörler of the stuttgart mozart society .
" his letters also show a struggling , positive person who continually gives encouragement in a number of ways . " the themes of mozart 's letters cover the same issues as can be found in today 's celebrity gossip pages .
some of the letters ' touch on the erotic , others border on obscene and still more detail his financial concerns , the death of his mother and the anxiety his father caused him . unusual tones for the times bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mozart experienced a variety of financial problems and died in debt under the demanding eye of his father , a successful musician in his own right , johann chrysostom wolfgang amadeus mozart composed his first piece of music at the age of five , wrote the first of 22 operas when he was 12 .
a more gifted child prodigy has yet to be found , according to hewig . mozart 's developed a musical style unlike what audiences of the day were accustomed to , and ultimately resulted in him failing to get a regular job with one of europe 's royal courts .
it also meant he had to make sure the music he wrote sold successfully . " mozart was uncompromising when it came to the quality of his music , " hewig said .
" but he wanted it to be well received , not to compose obscure music for small groups . " to do it , mozart worked hard , composing music in 30 of the 35 years he was alive , creating an oeuvre of about 630 pieces , including 27 piano concertos , over 40 symphonies and such famous operas as " the marriage of figaro , " " the magic flute " and " don giovanni , " which he is rumored to have finished in six weeks . " mozart was supremely confident of his skills , " dörler said .
" from today 's point of view , he had reason to be .

according to bush , the two spent some 45 minutes along together in the white house oval office . chancellor merkel told the assembled press at the joint press conference after the talks that germany would not be intimidated by iran .
she added that iran 's statements on israel and the holocaust were " totally unacceptable . " western countries " will not be intimidated " by iran 's decision to go ahead with its nuclear program , merkel said friday at a press conference with us president george w. bush .
" it 's essential , we feel , that the eu-3 -lrb- britain , france and germany -rrb- , together with the united states , take a common position here , become active , " merkel said following her first official meeting with bush as german chancellor . " we will not be intimidated by any country such as iran , " she vowed , adding that it was essential to persuade as many countries as possible to speak with one voice on the issue .
both leaders , however , expressed a desire to follow a diplomatic course in an attempt to come to a solution .
" we spent some time talking about the iranian issue and the desire to solve this issue diplomatically - by working together , " bush said . big job ahead bush opened the press conference by saying it was an honor to have chancellor merkel at the white house and that germany was a " valued ally " of the united states .

she said she would bring it up with the us president during their meeting . when bush was asked by a reporter about the topic , he said the german leader had indeed broached the subject and that he would like " to see a way forward . "

she stressed that economic and trade issues were also crucial , particularly in the era of globalization and the rising economic power of china . she said for the countries to meet the challenges in today 's global world , they needed to be economically strong .

according to bush , the two spent some 45 minutes along together in the white house oval office . chancellor merkel told the assembled press at the joint press conference after the talks that germany would not be intimidated by iran .
she added that iran 's statements on israel and the holocaust were " totally unacceptable . " western countries " will not be intimidated " by iran 's decision to go ahead with its nuclear program , merkel said friday at a press conference with us president george w. bush .
" it 's essential , we feel , that the eu-3 -lrb- britain , france and germany -rrb- , together with the united states , take a common position here , become active , " merkel said following her first official meeting with bush as german chancellor . " we will not be intimidated by any country such as iran , " she vowed , adding that it was essential to persuade as many countries as possible to speak with one voice on the issue .
both leaders , however , expressed a desire to follow a diplomatic course in an attempt to come to a solution .
" we spent some time talking about the iranian issue and the desire to solve this issue diplomatically - by working together , " bush said . big job ahead bush opened the press conference by saying it was an honor to have chancellor merkel at the white house and that germany was a " valued ally " of the united states . " we 've got an important job ahead of us to work on key issues , like iran , " bush said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two stressed the common ground they share he thanked germany for the part it has played in the international security assistance force in afghanistan and , although the two countries have had their differences , welcomed germany ’ s support in the quest for democracy and stability in iraq . " it 's a difficult issue in our relationship and i understand that , " he said , but added the two countries shared a desire for the iraqi people to live in freedom . chancellor merkel said the two leaders had had a " very open and candid " discussion which was marked by a " spirit of trust " and opened a new chapter in the german-american relationship . guantanamo one highly anticipated subject was that of guantanamo bay on the island of cuba , where the us has a prison for terrorism suspects which falls outside the purview of us law .
last weekend , merkel had criticized the prison in a magazine interview , saying it should not exist " indefinitely . "
she said she would bring it up with the us president during their meeting . when bush was asked by a reporter about the topic , he said the german leader had indeed broached the subject and that he would like " to see a way forward . "
but he defended the treatment of prisoners there and said as long as there is a terrorist threat , guantanamo would still be needed . about 500 " war on terror " detainees are held at guantanamo , some for up to four years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a detainee inside the united states naval station in guantanamo bay , cuba merkel said that germany and other countries needed to come up with proposals on how to best deal with detainees " who do n't feel bound by any law . "
she said it was important to find how international law could address the issue and added that the un was a good forum in which to do that . " the common ground is that we have shared values even though from time to time we have differences of opinion , " she said . economic ties merkel said that while terrorism was the greatest challenge facing the world in the 21st century , she did not only want to define the two countries ' relationship by that issue alone .
she stressed that economic and trade issues were also crucial , particularly in the era of globalization and the rising economic power of china . she said for the countries to meet the challenges in today 's global world , they needed to be economically strong .
she added that there were some tendencies toward isolationism within the eu , but that countries should not go down that path . good pals ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor schörder and president bush were often at odds when asked if he and chancellor merkel had gotten on better than the president had with her predecessor , gerhard schröder , with whom he shared as relationship that was often icy , bush laughed and skirted the question . the two men were barely on speaking terms by the time schröder left office in november .
bush did say , however , wanted to send his best regards to the former chancellor . regarding to the current german leader , merkel , bush said : " she 's smart , capable , and there 's a spirit to her that is appealing .
she loves freedom . " merkel told reporters after the talks that she will return to the united states in may to attend the annual meeting of the american jewish committee .

the european union , meanwhile , has promised more than $ 100 million to aid the global fight against the spread of the flu . the world health organization reported the mutation in the h5n1 virus after detecting it in the dna of two turkish patients on friday .
though the mutation allows the virus to adapt more easily to humans than to birds , experts said it was too early for widespread concern . " it 's a single discovery , which appearing isolated in a virus is not of much importance at the moment , " said dr. christian drosten , a virologist at the bernhardt-nocht institute for tropical medicine in hamburg in an interview .
" such single mutations do n't indicate whether a virus has gotten more dangerous . " test developed to detect mutations the report nevertheless raised the caution level .
the flu epidemic of 1918 , which killed tens of millions of people in a span of 18 months , jumped directly from birds to humans , according to researchers at the scripps research institute in california .
scientists and health care officials have watched the avian flu in turkey warily for signs of the same . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the virus has yet to jump from birds to humans in large numbers scripps scientists announced this week that they had developed a test to detect such mutations , warning health officials when the virus might jump ship from birds to humans .
at the moment , the h5n1 strain of the virus still primarily infects birds and only rarely passes to people .
since late 2003 , more than 70 people have been killed by the strain as it spread from asia to europe .
two have died in turkey and 15 have been infected since the beginning of the year , bringing the flu to europe 's doorstep and prompting a host of monitoring measures from european governments in recent days . virus showing no major changes on friday , the eu pledged $ 100 million -lrb- 82.6 million euros -rrb- in aid to go toward stopping the spread of the virus , and turkey stepped up bird inspections .
doctors on friday said they were testing whether the death of a 4-year-old girl in eastern turkey was caused by the virus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : avian flu is on europe 's doorstep drosten , the berlin scientist , said the development of the virus in turkey in the coming weeks will give scientists ideas on how to combat it .
at the moment , the virus is behaving the same way as it did in hong kong three years ago , where only the people who had contact with infected birds were themselves infected . he said mutations are difficult to combat .
" what you can do is to suppress the process by which mutations come about - the replication , " he said .
" in the case of h5n1 , that means eliminating the masses of replicated viruses by killing the infected birds .

" mozart would have taken part in television shows and events , " he said .
" he wanted to be heard , and if he was alive today , i could imagine that he would be a pop star of some sort . " though the horse-drawn carriages and cobbled streets of his day are a far cry from the private jets and chauffeur-driven stretch limos today 's celebrities enjoy , mozart toured europe a number of times in his 35 years .
the opener was a four-year event that kicked off when he was just six years old and stormed through some 70 cities and royal courts across the continent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mozart 's father played the role of instructor , tutor and manager while proceeds from the initial tour went mainly to leopold mozart , wolfgang amadeus ' father , the younger mozart would have been happy to have the extra income from television appearances , cd sales and royalties to finance the luxurious apartments , trips to casinos and evenings out he enjoyed , according to hewig . the mozart brand known by name to nearly everyone in the world , regardless of their affection for classical music , mozart 's music is impossible to avoid .
" eine kleine nachtmusik " - whether recognized as " serenade no. 13 for strings in g major " or not - has been used to sell everything from pancakes to cars .
he can be heard piped through the telephone while on hold as well as by passengers waiting for the next train in munich 's subway stations . but it 's not only the music that brings in the money , especially as 2006 has been named mozart year in honor of his 250th birthday on jan .
27 .
salzburg 's mozartland , which bills itself as " the ultimate shop for mozart fans , " offers everything from mozart chocolates to sweatpants bearing the composer 's name . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : child composer whose works astonished adults of the period " the ' mozart ' brand is one of the best known in the world , " said arthur oberascher , head of the austrian national tourist office , estimating the brand 's value at about 5.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.5 billion -rrb- .
" it is no wonder we are seeing such a profusion of by-products . " a well-documented genius but even more than the abundance of mozart merchandise flooding the market , the extensive documentation of mozart 's life , including diaries and hundreds of letters he wrote , add another layer to interpretations of his music and virtually guarantee that even strangers to classical music find something about him that catches their interest . " mozart 's music brought an additional dimension to my life , and it 's my opinion that this ' drug ' can be administered to anyone , " said rudolf dörler of the stuttgart mozart society .
" his letters also show a struggling , positive person who continually gives encouragement in a number of ways . " the themes of mozart 's letters cover the same issues as can be found in today 's celebrity gossip pages .
some of the letters ' touch on the erotic , others border on obscene and still more detail his financial concerns , the death of his mother and the anxiety his father caused him . unusual tones for the times bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mozart experienced a variety of financial problems and died in debt under the demanding eye of his father , a successful musician in his own right , johann chrysostom wolfgang amadeus mozart composed his first piece of music at the age of five , wrote the first of 22 operas when he was 12 .
a more gifted child prodigy has yet to be found , according to hewig . mozart 's developed a musical style unlike what audiences of the day were accustomed to , and ultimately resulted in him failing to get a regular job with one of europe 's royal courts .
it also meant he had to make sure the music he wrote sold successfully . " mozart was uncompromising when it came to the quality of his music , " hewig said .
" but he wanted it to be well received , not to compose obscure music for small groups . " to do it , mozart worked hard , composing music in 30 of the 35 years he was alive , creating an oeuvre of about 630 pieces , including 27 piano concertos , over 40 symphonies and such famous operas as " the marriage of figaro , " " the magic flute " and " don giovanni , " which he is rumored to have finished in six weeks . " mozart was supremely confident of his skills , " dörler said .
" from today 's point of view , he had reason to be .

the international community still prefers pursuing negotiations , experts say . responding to iran 's decision to resume sensitive nuclear fuel work , europe 's three major powers on thursday asked for an emergency meeting of the un nuclear watchdog international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- to refer the issue to the un security council , which could slap sanctions . " we believe the time has now come for the security council to become involved to reinforce the authority of iaea resolutions , " the foreign ministers of britain , france and germany , who have been trying to coax iran into renouncing a nuclear weapons capability , said in berlin . us middle east experts interviewed dismiss the prospects of biting sanctions on iran . ray takeyh , a senior fellow at the council on foreign relations , felt that the europeans would be reluctant to slap tough sanctions against tehran . " but there are other things you may be able to do : diplomatic sanctions , reducing the size of iranian representatives abroad , reducing the size of the embassies , maybe barring some transfers of technology , " he said . " there are things you can do along the margins , which can be not very substantial but do have some symbolic importance at least . " too early to tell un diplomats said it was premature to discuss the various sanctions options given that the ball was still in the iaea court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : picture shows the uranium enrichment complex in the iranian town of isfahan they said the issue was unlikely to come before the 15-member council before next month when the united states takes over the rotating presidency of the powerful body . a european official speaking on the margins of the berlin meeting said the iaea board of governors could be convened " in the coming weeks . "
he refused to be more specific . " what we want to do is use the authority and weight of the security council to bring home to iran the importance of abiding the resolution of the iaea , " the official said .
" do n't expect us to move straight to sanctions . " negotiations broke down britain , france and germany have been leading more than two years of delicate negotiations with iran to allay western fears that it is seeking to develop a weapons programme , a charge the islamic republic strongly denies . iran sparked a furious international reaction this week for breaking seals on three nuclear facilities in order to resume nuclear fuel work . " the iranians have significant oil and gas reserves and the excess capacity in the system is quite tight , " jon alterman , middle east program director at the center for strategic and international studies in washington , told afp . " so the iranian bet is that with the current oil energy market there is no way that serious sanctions that will cripple the government are possibly in sight , " he told afp .
" the assumption is that the world can talk and bluster but at the end of the day it will not threaten -lrb- their -rrb- grip on power . " russia and china ? alterman pointed out that neither russia nor china - two veto-wielding permanent members of the security council which have significant economic interests in iran - were likely to back biting sanctions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea 's director general mohamed elbaradei has the key role in the dispute " if push comes to shove , they -lrb- russians and chinese -rrb- do n't want a war with the iranians but they want the iranians to reduce the level of tension that they are creating , " he added .
" and sanctions will not frighten the government of iran . " alterman saw the whole negotiating process as " a time game . " as to the prospect for us or israeli military action against iranian facilities , he said : " i do n't see the prospect of either one in the near term but i could envisage any number of scenarios in the next five years where that would be an option .

the international community still prefers pursuing negotiations , experts say . responding to iran 's decision to resume sensitive nuclear fuel work , europe 's three major powers on thursday asked for an emergency meeting of the un nuclear watchdog international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- to refer the issue to the un security council , which could slap sanctions . " we believe the time has now come for the security council to become involved to reinforce the authority of iaea resolutions , " the foreign ministers of britain , france and germany , who have been trying to coax iran into renouncing a nuclear weapons capability , said in berlin . us middle east experts interviewed dismiss the prospects of biting sanctions on iran . ray takeyh , a senior fellow at the council on foreign relations , felt that the europeans would be reluctant to slap tough sanctions against tehran . " but there are other things you may be able to do : diplomatic sanctions , reducing the size of iranian representatives abroad , reducing the size of the embassies , maybe barring some transfers of technology , " he said . " there are things you can do along the margins , which can be not very substantial but do have some symbolic importance at least . " too early to tell un diplomats said it was premature to discuss the various sanctions options given that the ball was still in the iaea court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : picture shows the uranium enrichment complex in the iranian town of isfahan they said the issue was unlikely to come before the 15-member council before next month when the united states takes over the rotating presidency of the powerful body . a european official speaking on the margins of the berlin meeting said the iaea board of governors could be convened " in the coming weeks . "
he refused to be more specific . " what we want to do is use the authority and weight of the security council to bring home to iran the importance of abiding the resolution of the iaea , " the official said .
" do n't expect us to move straight to sanctions . " negotiations broke down britain , france and germany have been leading more than two years of delicate negotiations with iran to allay western fears that it is seeking to develop a weapons programme , a charge the islamic republic strongly denies . iran sparked a furious international reaction this week for breaking seals on three nuclear facilities in order to resume nuclear fuel work . " the iranians have significant oil and gas reserves and the excess capacity in the system is quite tight , " jon alterman , middle east program director at the center for strategic and international studies in washington , told afp . " so the iranian bet is that with the current oil energy market there is no way that serious sanctions that will cripple the government are possibly in sight , " he told afp .
" the assumption is that the world can talk and bluster but at the end of the day it will not threaten -lrb- their -rrb- grip on power . " russia and china ? alterman pointed out that neither russia nor china - two veto-wielding permanent members of the security council which have significant economic interests in iran - were likely to back biting sanctions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea 's director general mohamed elbaradei has the key role in the dispute " if push comes to shove , they -lrb- russians and chinese -rrb- do n't want a war with the iranians but they want the iranians to reduce the level of tension that they are creating , " he added .
" and sanctions will not frighten the government of iran . " alterman saw the whole negotiating process as " a time game . " as to the prospect for us or israeli military action against iranian facilities , he said : " i do n't see the prospect of either one in the near term but i could envisage any number of scenarios in the next five years where that would be an option .

but rather than solving the problem , the tactic creates new difficulties , says deutsche welle 's peter philipp . the simmering anger in berlin , london and paris in the last few days was an indication that iran 's resumption of research into nuclear fuel - particularly at the highly controversial natan enrichment plant - would not be without a drastic reaction . but the eu troika foreign ministers ' decision to refer iran to the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , and if necessary haul it before the un security council , does n't do justice to the expectations .
instead , it 's akin to making a mountain of a molehill . new , bigger headaches ? the europeans have once again shown they are n't in a position to solve international problems .
in this case , they have not only failed to solve the problem , but perhaps also created the basis for new and bigger ones . should the us get its way and push through the imposition of sanctions on iran in the un security council , people in washington as well as in brussels , as indeed elsewhere in europe , are well aware that such sanctions - no matter how they are formulated - are n't an effective way of getting a country " on the right course .

they would also be counterproductive for the economic interests of the europeans , who have until now furiously wooed iran on trade issues . besides , it is n't even clear yet whether sanctions will be agreed upon and whether they can then be forced on iran .
china , for instance , probably wo n't be interested in doing so , since it is dependant on iran for oil and gas .
and even russia 's stance is ambiguous , given that moscow is deeply involved in the development of iran 's nuclear plants . possible bitter retaliation but the biggest fallout from forced sanctions could be iran 's decision to get out of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
the country has been complying with the treaty 's guidelines so far , allowing the inspection of its nuclear facilities and cooperating with the vienna-based iaea . but all that could , with one stroke , come to an abrupt halt .

but rather than solving the problem , the tactic creates new difficulties , says deutsche welle 's peter philipp . the simmering anger in berlin , london and paris in the last few days was an indication that iran 's resumption of research into nuclear fuel - particularly at the highly controversial natan enrichment plant - would not be without a drastic reaction . but the eu troika foreign ministers ' decision to refer iran to the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , and if necessary haul it before the un security council , does n't do justice to the expectations .
instead , it 's akin to making a mountain of a molehill . new , bigger headaches ? the europeans have once again shown they are n't in a position to solve international problems .
in this case , they have not only failed to solve the problem , but perhaps also created the basis for new and bigger ones . should the us get its way and push through the imposition of sanctions on iran in the un security council , people in washington as well as in brussels , as indeed elsewhere in europe , are well aware that such sanctions - no matter how they are formulated - are n't an effective way of getting a country " on the right course . " it did n't work in iraq or in cuba and it has an even slimmer chance of working in iran . sanctions would be counterproductive that 's because iran currently earns well with its oil and gas exports and the iranian people too , despite all the criticism , are firmly backing their government on the nuclear issue . sanctions would just drive the iranians into the arms of their conservative leadership .
they would also be counterproductive for the economic interests of the europeans , who have until now furiously wooed iran on trade issues . besides , it is n't even clear yet whether sanctions will be agreed upon and whether they can then be forced on iran .
china , for instance , probably wo n't be interested in doing so , since it is dependant on iran for oil and gas .
and even russia 's stance is ambiguous , given that moscow is deeply involved in the development of iran 's nuclear plants . possible bitter retaliation but the biggest fallout from forced sanctions could be iran 's decision to get out of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
the country has been complying with the treaty 's guidelines so far , allowing the inspection of its nuclear facilities and cooperating with the vienna-based iaea . but all that could , with one stroke , come to an abrupt halt .
that would in turn increase mistrust on the part of the americans and some of the europeans and would lead to a deadlock , since the use of force would continue to be ruled out - the lessons of iraq were memorable enough . the developments in tehran will be followed calmly , because everyone knows well that sanctions would probably hurt the europeans more than iran .
that is common knowledge in washington and also a source of regret . europe just a paper tiger but what is even more regrettable is the fact that europe has once again shown itself to be a paper tiger and exposed itself to ridicule by the hardliners in tehran . it 's happened before , when the former ayatollah ali khomeini sneered at the exit of european diplomats : " let them go : they 'll come crawling back again .

german intelligence agency expert erich schmidt-eenboom offers his take on the allegations that german secret agents were involved in assessing targets during the us military invasion in iraq . dw-world : both the süddeutsche zeitung and the television channel ard have reported that german agents helped the us pick out bombing targets - including saddam hussein .
what do you think of the accusations ? erich schmidt eenboom : they are partly justified .
the federal intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- surely kept up contact with their partner agency , the defense intelligence agency , despite the political tension between washington and berlin during the iraq war .
they surely also did that with the backing of the chancellor 's office .
as a result , the knowledgeable bnd agents in baghdad probably gathered information on targets to avoid but also , in my opinion , worthwhile targets . what they ca n't be accused of is functioning as real-time scouts , with the information they relayed back being used for us bombing attacks soon after . was it normal that bnd workers continued their work in iraq , even after the german embassy was closed ? the bnd has been baghdad since the early 1980s , and it has a very big and important office there .
the desire and need of the federal government for information , both leading up to the war and during the war , was large and gathering information locally is one of a foreign intelligence agency 's core duties . how far did intelligence cooperation go during the iraq war ?
and how much did the office of chancellor gerhard schröder know ?
the intelligence coordinator in the chancellor 's office , -lrb- current foreign minister frank-walter -rrb- steinmeier , surely knew the extent of the cooperation , and was kept up to date on the information exchange on the working level , which is defined by strict regulations .
the bnd agents most definitely did not have direct radio or fax communication with american agencies .
the contact probably always went through the -lrb- bnd headquarters -rrb- in pullach . the coalition government won a lot of respect in the arab world for their rejection of the iraq war .
will their reputation suffer a setback following these revelations ? partly , because i think that 's what 's behind the publication of these stories .
we 're experiencing a sort of psychological attack on the part of the american intelligence agencies against the old social democratic-green party coalition government , but also against the new government following merkel 's demand that the us close guantanamo bay .
the americans want to make clear - especially in light of their bad image following the cia torture allegations - that germany is n't as pure as assumed , because they were more involved in the iraq war than they said they were . is it possible that germany could become the target of islamic terrorists as a result of these allegations ? i do n't think so .
islamic terrorists , especially those in iraq , have other priorities , namely the american occupiers .
i think the growing militancy in afghanistan is more likely to have an effect in germany , creating a threatening scenario especially ahead and during the soccer world cup . to what extent ? that is hard to predict .
we 're experiencing a radicalization of youth and a professionalization of terrorism in afghanistan , but also in bosnia .
at one point , the terrorists and terrorism will no longer only be directed at german soldiers in those places , but against the motherland , against the country that sent them , namely germany .
it 's hard to say at what point that will happen and with what sort of intensity .
erich schmidt-eenboom is director of the research institute for peace policies and considered one of germany 's top experts on the bnd .
he was unwittingly spied on during his research into the bnd in the 1990s , an act for which the former intelligence agency head has apologized .

german intelligence agency expert erich schmidt-eenboom offers his take on the allegations that german secret agents were involved in assessing targets during the us military invasion in iraq . dw-world : both the süddeutsche zeitung and the television channel ard have reported that german agents helped the us pick out bombing targets - including saddam hussein .
what do you think of the accusations ? erich schmidt eenboom : they are partly justified .
the federal intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- surely kept up contact with their partner agency , the defense intelligence agency , despite the political tension between washington and berlin during the iraq war .
they surely also did that with the backing of the chancellor 's office .
as a result , the knowledgeable bnd agents in baghdad probably gathered information on targets to avoid but also , in my opinion , worthwhile targets . what they ca n't be accused of is functioning as real-time scouts , with the information they relayed back being used for us bombing attacks soon after . was it normal that bnd workers continued their work in iraq , even after the german embassy was closed ? the bnd has been baghdad since the early 1980s , and it has a very big and important office there .
the desire and need of the federal government for information , both leading up to the war and during the war , was large and gathering information locally is one of a foreign intelligence agency 's core duties . how far did intelligence cooperation go during the iraq war ?
and how much did the office of chancellor gerhard schröder know ?
the intelligence coordinator in the chancellor 's office , -lrb- current foreign minister frank-walter -rrb- steinmeier , surely knew the extent of the cooperation , and was kept up to date on the information exchange on the working level , which is defined by strict regulations .
the bnd agents most definitely did not have direct radio or fax communication with american agencies .
the contact probably always went through the -lrb- bnd headquarters -rrb- in pullach . the coalition government won a lot of respect in the arab world for their rejection of the iraq war .
will their reputation suffer a setback following these revelations ? partly , because i think that 's what 's behind the publication of these stories .
we 're experiencing a sort of psychological attack on the part of the american intelligence agencies against the old social democratic-green party coalition government , but also against the new government following merkel 's demand that the us close guantanamo bay .
the americans want to make clear - especially in light of their bad image following the cia torture allegations - that germany is n't as pure as assumed , because they were more involved in the iraq war than they said they were . is it possible that germany could become the target of islamic terrorists as a result of these allegations ? i do n't think so .
islamic terrorists , especially those in iraq , have other priorities , namely the american occupiers .
i think the growing militancy in afghanistan is more likely to have an effect in germany , creating a threatening scenario especially ahead and during the soccer world cup . to what extent ? that is hard to predict .
we 're experiencing a radicalization of youth and a professionalization of terrorism in afghanistan , but also in bosnia .
at one point , the terrorists and terrorism will no longer only be directed at german soldiers in those places , but against the motherland , against the country that sent them , namely germany .
it 's hard to say at what point that will happen and with what sort of intensity .
erich schmidt-eenboom is director of the research institute for peace policies and considered one of germany 's top experts on the bnd .
he was unwittingly spied on during his research into the bnd in the 1990s , an act for which the former intelligence agency head has apologized .

the law does not refer to specific forms of retaliation , but counter-measures could include resumption of uranium enrichment as well as refusing to adhere to the additional protocol of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , which gives increased inspection powers to the iaea . the additional protocol was signed by the previous reformist government but was never ratified by parliamentarians in the conservative-run parliament . compliance with the additional protocol is seen as being crucial to an iaea probe into allegations that iran is using an atomic energy drive as a cover for weapons development . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us remains wary of iran 's nuclear motives in washington , us secretary of state condoleezza rice accused tehran of a " deliberate escalation " of the dispute , and said it was in " dangerous defiance of the entire international community .

" if the dossier is sent to the security council , the european countries will lose the means which are currently at their disposal , because ... the government will be obliged , in conformity with the law adopted by parliament , to end all its voluntary measures of cooperation , " iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki was quoted as saying by the official irna news agency . iran 's standoff with the international community escalated after tehran on tuesday resumed sensitive nuclear research linked to uranium enrichment , which produces fuel for nuclear power reactors but can also be used to make atomic bombs . europe 's three major powers responded by calling for an emergency meeting of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , while un chief kofi annan said iran was still keen on pursuing nuclear talks with european powers . british foreign secretary jack straw said consensus was growing among the international community , including russia , for action but said the military option was not being considered . " i think in current circumstances it would not be conceivable , it would not be appropriate , " he said .
" iran is not iraq , we 're working with the international community to resolve this in a peaceful and diplomatic manner . " iran in " dangerous defiance " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad is a controversial figure internationally in december iran 's hardline president mahmoud ahmadinejad signed off on legislation that could limit un inspections at iran 's nuclear sites if its case is taken to the security council . the law obliges the government to " stop voluntary and non-legally binding measures and implement its scientific , research and executive programs " if the security council gets involved . ahmadinejad has ordered iran 's atomic energy agency to be prepared to apply the law , the fars news agency reported .
the law does not refer to specific forms of retaliation , but counter-measures could include resumption of uranium enrichment as well as refusing to adhere to the additional protocol of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , which gives increased inspection powers to the iaea . the additional protocol was signed by the previous reformist government but was never ratified by parliamentarians in the conservative-run parliament . compliance with the additional protocol is seen as being crucial to an iaea probe into allegations that iran is using an atomic energy drive as a cover for weapons development . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us remains wary of iran 's nuclear motives in washington , us secretary of state condoleezza rice accused tehran of a " deliberate escalation " of the dispute , and said it was in " dangerous defiance of the entire international community . " while threatening to halt cooperation , iranian officials have nevertheless signaled their willingness for negotiations to be continued , but on their terms . iran still interested in talks after a telephone conversation with iran 's top nuclear negotiator ali larijani , annan said thursday that tehran was still keen on pursuing " serious " nuclear talks with european powers . " he affirmed to me that they are interested in serious and constructive negotiation , but within a timeframe , " annan said , quoting larijani as saying that the previous round of negotiations " had lasted two and a half years without any results . " the head of iran 's nuclear negotiating team javad vaidi said on state television thursday : " we are still hopeful that the negotiations can make progress . "
however , he warned that " if the europeans want to carry out the threats , it will cause iran 's behavior to change and intensify the present situation . " mottaki urged the europeans to deal with iran 's nuclear activities with " discretion , patience and a rational attitude . " " we advise the europeans to separate the question of research from producing the nuclear fuel and do not propagate around the nuclear research activities which had been unjustly suspended , " he said . " if they want to discuss making nuclear fuel we are ready to follow up with the negotiations with the eu-3 , " he said .
if the negotiations are broken off by the europeans " iran will only be in contact with the iaea to maintain its legitimate and natural rights . " tehran has said uranium enrichment on an industrial level is still suspended but it has not made a secret of its desire to resume the activity in a near future . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : sanctions will hurt europe more than iran germany , france and britain may refer iran to the un security council for nuclear breaches .

some believe the real reason is a lack of interest and rising costs . it was going to be the first of its kind and an opening that would have shamed other sporting galas with its proposed pomp , preening and pop stars .
but with just five months to go before the fifa 2006 world cup gets underway , the star-studded spectacular - which would have heralded the long-awaited arrival of soccer 's greatest spectacle on german soil - has been unceremoniously dumped from the agenda . despite promising that the massive stage , which would have creaked like the knees of an aging rock star under the weight of such luminaries as brian eno , peter gabriel and the black eyed peas , would not damage the field at berlin ’ s olympiastadion , fifa cancelled the event apparently for just that reason . however , some in the german press know a cover-up when they smell one and it is likely to be revealed over the weekend that the gala event was actually cancelled because it is floating very few people 's boats .
lack of ticket sales , it is alleged , is the real reason for the cancellation . the berliner zeitung newspaper is expected to go public with revelations that the estimated 25 million euro -lrb- $ 30 million -rrb- costs are rising higher and faster than a david beckham penalty and that tickets are selling slower than those for a lothar matthäus spoken word event . blatter shedding crocodile tears for canceled event ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa president sepp blatter is an advocate of the beautiful game .
fifa are having none of it , however .
president sepp blatter maintained on friday that the gala had been cancelled on strictly sporting grounds . " personally , i still think the idea of holding such a high-profile opening event is a good one , " said blatter .
" fifa has not taken the decision to cancel the event at such a late stage lightly , but as world football 's governing body ; we must put sporting considerations first . " for conspiracy theorists , blatter 's statement arrived with a distinct whiff of fish .
the fifa president , when questioned in the past about the possibility of huge cultural event to launch the world cup , said : " football fans want to see matches .
they do n't want speeches , they want a few songs and they want to see football . "
with such a ringing endorsement , critics believe , the gala was living on borrowed time from the off . first group game would come just six days after gala bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's olympiastadion will host reigning champion brazil 's first game .
the music , dance and performance art extravaganza was due to take place on june 7 , just six days before the first world cup match at the stadium on june 13 between world champions brazil and croatia .
fifa fears that a new pitch laid own to replace the grass trampled in the opening ceremony would not be in satisfactory condition for the match to take place . " it has since become clear that there would be considerable risks involved , not only in dismantling the stages and the event 's technical installations in time but also in laying a new field , which has to be in perfect playing condition by june 12 , " fifa said in a statement . things go from bad to worse for organizing committee bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could der kaiser be making a disguised gesture to his critics here ?
it is the latest embarrassing turn in the gala 's ill-fated story .
fifa had already rescheduled the gala ceremony and the first group match in berlin last year to give an extra 48 hours to lay down new rolls of grass and give the turf time to take hold . and the cancellation comes as another blow to the german organizing committee , which is currently sulking over a report from german consumer protection agency stiftung warentest , which warned that there were serious safety concerns at all 12 world cup venues . the gala 's artistic director , austrian andre heller , was naturally gutted by the news .

fifa fears that a new pitch laid own to replace the grass trampled in the opening ceremony would not be in satisfactory condition for the match to take place . " it has since become clear that there would be considerable risks involved , not only in dismantling the stages and the event 's technical installations in time but also in laying a new field , which has to be in perfect playing condition by june 12 , " fifa said in a statement . things go from bad to worse for organizing committee bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could der kaiser be making a disguised gesture to his critics here ?
it is the latest embarrassing turn in the gala 's ill-fated story .
fifa had already rescheduled the gala ceremony and the first group match in berlin last year to give an extra 48 hours to lay down new rolls of grass and give the turf time to take hold . and the cancellation comes as another blow to the german organizing committee , which is currently sulking over a report from german consumer protection agency stiftung warentest , which warned that there were serious safety concerns at all 12 world cup venues . the gala 's artistic director , austrian andre heller , was naturally gutted by the news .
" it is with a great sense of sadness that i leave my exciting work for the fifa world cup gala in berlin , " heller said in a presumably tear-stained statement . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany pulls out all the stops for cultural world cup the 2006 world cup will not only be a soccer spectacle but the run-up to the main event itself will be a cultural extravaganza which , the german organizers say , will give the prestigious event that extra dash of pizzazz .

but the trend is down to more than just health scares . as international green week , the yearly food , agriculture and horticulture exhibition , opens in berlin on friday , the organic food industry can feel very pleased with itself .
recent findings show that more people are turning towards bio-products in germany . however , the organic seal of quality comes at a price ; and usually it is a relatively high one compared to non-bio products .

" the attitude towards more expensive foods has changed , " rippin said .
" consumers are more ready to spend more money on better food . " one recent study shows that 35 to 40 percent of the population buys bio-products at least once a month ; possibly half of all germans even more regularly .
while the core demographic is educated shoppers with higher incomes , the trend is showing that more families with young children and pensioners are going ever more frequently to bio-stores . growth rate has been rising since 2000 the growth rate for organic products has been rising steadily since the turn of the century .

purely organic supermarkets have ridden the wave and boomed in the first half of the decade . those who expected a certain amount of stagnation in the market have been waiting in vain .

the scheme converting diesel-powered cars to vegetable oil was launched by the west wales eco centre in december .
the pembrokeshire company said there had been a " very keen " response to the project , but added that some grants were still available .
the initiative is backed by the welsh assembly government .
the grant halves the £ 1,200 cost of converting a vehicle .
the scheme is supported by veg oil motoring organisation , also based in pembrokeshire .
daniel blackburn , of veg oil motoring , said : " the response to the project has exceeded expectations and with so many drivers wanting to access the scheme it is likely that the subtle smell of fried food will become more common on the roads of west wales .
rebate " the interest shows how keen many motorists are in using this alternative to fossil fuels .
" the reasons for this are numerous - drivers see the importance of reducing carbon dioxide emissions and the benefits of using a fuel than can be grown in pembrokeshire . "
mr blackburn added that motorists could expect to cut their carbon dioxide emissions by about three tons a year .
the conversion can also help cut running costs , as fuel duty on cooking oil - at 27.1p per litre - is almost half the duty on petrol or diesel .
but in recent months , some companies producing the environmentally friendly fuel have been told by hm revenue and customs -lrb- hmrc -rrb- they are no longer eligible for the 20p-a-litre tax rebate .
' carbon neutral ' in november , hmrc also demanded plymouth bio-fuels in devon pay £ 16,000 in back duty .
but daniel blackburn , from west wales eco centre , said cutting costs was not the main advantage of the fuel .
he told the bbc news website : " when you fill up with used cooking oil , you 're taking something that has been used for a purpose and you 're driving a vehicle on that - so it 's as near to carbon neutral as you could get . "
an information evening about the scheme will be held on 25 january at the cleddau bridge hotel in pembroke dock at 1900 gmt .

mr blackburn added that motorists could expect to cut their carbon dioxide emissions by about three tons a year .
the conversion can also help cut running costs , as fuel duty on cooking oil - at 27.1p per litre - is almost half the duty on petrol or diesel .
but in recent months , some companies producing the environmentally friendly fuel have been told by hm revenue and customs -lrb- hmrc -rrb- they are no longer eligible for the 20p-a-litre tax rebate .
' carbon neutral ' in november , hmrc also demanded plymouth bio-fuels in devon pay £ 16,000 in back duty .
but daniel blackburn , from west wales eco centre , said cutting costs was not the main advantage of the fuel .
he told the bbc news website : " when you fill up with used cooking oil , you 're taking something that has been used for a purpose and you 're driving a vehicle on that - so it 's as near to carbon neutral as you could get . "
an information evening about the scheme will be held on 25 january at the cleddau bridge hotel in pembroke dock at 1900 gmt .

the scheme converting diesel-powered cars to vegetable oil was launched by the west wales eco centre in december .

the scheme is supported by veg oil motoring organisation , also based in pembrokeshire .
daniel blackburn , of veg oil motoring , said : " the response to the project has exceeded expectations and with so many drivers wanting to access the scheme it is likely that the subtle smell of fried food will become more common on the roads of west wales .

holyrood voted by 65 to 56 to pass an amendment noting the " record levels " of finance provided to councils by the scottish executive .
it also highlighted the executive 's commitment to consider " some further additional resources " .
this would be subject to councils delivering on efficiency targets .
rowdy debate the scottish national party had called on ministers to allow local authorities to keep all of their efficiency savings so council tax levels could be held down .
in a rowdy debate in holyrood , the snp accused the scottish executive of heaping more duties on local councils but starving them of resources .
councils backed the call for them to be allowed to keep £ 58.5m in savings .
however , the executive said council funding was at record levels .
the snp said scottish taxpayers have had to face an increase of 55 % since 1997 .
regardless of where that funding comes from , we expect councils to deliver best value for the taxpayer and their communities george lyon deputy finance minister scottish councils have warned that householders face big council tax hikes , despite the fact that local government had made more than £ 120m in savings .
nationalists also believe local authorities should receive £ 34.7m in additional money made available by the treasury .
finance spokesman john swinney raised concerns that on the same day that the £ 120m figure came out , cosla claimed a £ 400m black hole in local authority budgets .
he referred to a committee report which expressed concerns that to meet the 2.5 % council tax target , the executive 's spending target left a shortfall of £ 84.9m over and above the £ 58.5m efficiency savings target .
" unless parliament takes action to press the government to close this gap , local authorities will face the familiar choice between cutting local authority services or once again increasing council tax levels beyond inflation , " he said .
cosla meetings deputy finance minister george lyon said the level of funding this year going to local government accounted for more than one third of the executive 's budget .
mr lyon said core funding in particular had risen since devolution by almost £ 2.6bn , increasing by 55 % by 2007-08 .
however , the minister said the executive would continue to provide local government with the resources it needed to provide services .
he added that the executive had additionally provided £ 30.8bn in support over three years .
i ca n't get the minister to tell us why it is if there 's been a 55 % increase in funding for local government that has had to be matched with a 55 % increase in council tax david davidson tory finance spokesman " regardless of where that funding comes from , we expect councils to deliver best value for the taxpayer and their communities , " he said .
mr lyon said it would be premature to anticipate the outcome of meetings between finance minister tom mccabe and council umbrella group cosla .
but he repeated the finance minister 's comments that local authorities may receive additional funding if they show significant progress towards meeting efficiency targets .
tory finance spokesman david davidson said : " obviously councils differ in their style , in their management and so on but they are broadly agreed about the difficulties that they face .
" what 's more frustrating is that i ca n't get the minister to tell us why it is if there 's been a 55 % increase in funding for local government that has had to be matched with a 55 % increase in council tax . "
mark ballard warned of cuts in local services the greens ' finance spokesman mark ballard said : " what will happen is we will see cuts in council services together with above inflationary increases in the council tax . "
socialist msp tommy sheridan claimed councils faced a " double whammy " from an executive cutting council funds while demanding town halls remove more " waste " to help fund local services .
" we 're not just talking here about a double whammy for local authorities , we 're talking about a double whammy for scottish citizens , " he said .
labour msp bristow muldoon said : " it is unreasonable for any large organisation in the world to say they can not re-examine the way they deliver services . "
john swinburne , of the scottish senior citizens unity party , hit out at the current council tax system , and said : " it would take some kind of twisted genius to devise a method of taxation worse than council . "
he said council tax rises had hit the elderly hard as many had a fixed income from pensions .

i ca n't get the minister to tell us why it is if there 's been a 55 % increase in funding for local government that has had to be matched with a 55 % increase in council tax david davidson tory finance spokesman " regardless of where that funding comes from , we expect councils to deliver best value for the taxpayer and their communities , " he said .
mr lyon said it would be premature to anticipate the outcome of meetings between finance minister tom mccabe and council umbrella group cosla .
but he repeated the finance minister 's comments that local authorities may receive additional funding if they show significant progress towards meeting efficiency targets .
tory finance spokesman david davidson said : " obviously councils differ in their style , in their management and so on but they are broadly agreed about the difficulties that they face .
" what 's more frustrating is that i ca n't get the minister to tell us why it is if there 's been a 55 % increase in funding for local government that has had to be matched with a 55 % increase in council tax . "
mark ballard warned of cuts in local services the greens ' finance spokesman mark ballard said : " what will happen is we will see cuts in council services together with above inflationary increases in the council tax . "
socialist msp tommy sheridan claimed councils faced a " double whammy " from an executive cutting council funds while demanding town halls remove more " waste " to help fund local services .
" we 're not just talking here about a double whammy for local authorities , we 're talking about a double whammy for scottish citizens , " he said .
labour msp bristow muldoon said : " it is unreasonable for any large organisation in the world to say they can not re-examine the way they deliver services . "
john swinburne , of the scottish senior citizens unity party , hit out at the current council tax system , and said : " it would take some kind of twisted genius to devise a method of taxation worse than council . "
he said council tax rises had hit the elderly hard as many had a fixed income from pensions .

the engine house at the former mining site at wheal kitty , near st agnes , has been turned into business units .
the businesses on the site range from surf board design and website development , to engineering research and personal training .
more than £ 1m has been invested in transforming the listed engine house .

north east ambulance service trust -lrb- neas -rrb- staff were offered a rise of up to £ 1,800 to be on call during breaks .
but the offer was rejected and paramedics are planning to take action on 27 and 28 january when they will refuse to do overtime .
neas chief executive , simon featherstone , said he was " astonished " by the move .
unison 's north east branch secretary , joel byers , said the offer was rejected because members learned that ambulance workers elsewhere were offered a better deal .
that deal involved a shorter working week with meal breaks , but no pay rise .
' highly trained ' in november , the ambulance trust introduced a £ 20 payment as an interim measure for crews who volunteered to answer 999 calls during their meal breaks .
but mr byers said staff should be paid time and a half if they were called out during breaks or be allowed to be off duty .
he said : " why are they asking paramedics and technicians , who are highly trained , being asked be a voluntary force for two hours a day ?
we are a professional service , not volunteers . "
but mr featherstone said : " i am surprised and astonished at this action .
we have made significant efforts to resolve the meal break issue locally , yet all our offers have been rejected .
" this £ 20 payment is voluntary and was introduced in response to staff claims that they wanted to be aware of calls during their breaks .
" so we find it hard to understand why in is now being opposed .
we remain available to discuss a solution to this issue . "

the rail union aslef said there had been a " serious breakdown in industrial relations and trust " with management .
aslef said that any walkouts would be co-ordinated with the rmt union which has already staged two strikes in a row over new rotas and safety .
lu said it was consulting unions on new employment procedures and was committed to a culture of fairness and trust .
aslef accuses lu of ignoring agreements , imposing change without negotiation and inflicting " draconian " punishments .
we can not allow this position to continue aslef 's national organiser andy reed the union 's national organiser andy reed said industrial relations varied from hostility to anarchy .
he said : " -lsb- mayor of london -rsb- ken livingstone wrote to the union in november 2002 promising a review of london underground limited 's harassment procedure .
in over two years , lul has failed to progress this .
" discipline appeals appear to be pointless exercises rather than serious re-considerations .
" representatives are not allowed time off for union duties .
transfer agreements are regularly ignored .
we can not allow this position to continue . "
the strike by the rmt closed 40 stations he said the union would be recommending a series of 24 hour strikes when the ballot papers go out next week to its 2,200 tube train drivers .
the result will be declared on 13 february .
an lu spokesman said : " london underground is in the process of updating its employment procedures .
we have submitted some procedures to our trade unions for consultation and comment .
" we are committed to working with aslef and all our trade unions to resolve the kind of issues they are raising through consultation and negotiation . "
talks to resolve the dispute with the rmt resumed on thursday .
the dispute centres on new rotas , due to come in on 5 february , which the rmt says will displace hundreds of station staff and leave some stations understaffed and unsafe - something denied by tube bosses .
it has already prompted two strikes , on new year 's eve and last monday .
lu described the impact as " minimal " .
but the union said the situation was " chaotic " and claimed staff were working in positions for which they were not fully trained .
it has threatened to ballot its members for additional industrial action short of a strike over claims safety was compromised during the first strike although this is denied by lu .
lu said it will not compromise safety and the 35-hour working week deal , to which the new rotas are linked , was agreed by the rmt and other unions last year .

a thousand people gathered for a candlelit vigil on an icy night in central seoul - a show of solidarity with the cloning scientist that they still call the " pride of korea " .
dr hwang woo-suk had been exposed as a fraud by his colleagues at seoul national university .
his two landmark papers on cloned embryonic stem cells were found to have been fabricated .
but dr hwang can still count on a hard-core of supporters and many more who are reluctant to accept the downfall of a national icon .
" faking the research paper was not so important , " said lee young-sil , who came home from japan to show her faith in the scientist .
scandal timeline feb 2004 hwang woo-suk 's team declare they have created 30 cloned human embryos and extracted stem cells may 2005 team says it has made stem cell lines from skin cells of 11 people nov 2005 hwang apologises for using eggs from his own researchers 15 dec 2005 a colleague claims stem cell research was faked 23 dec 2005 academic panel finds results of may 2005 research were fabricated 10 jan 2006 panel finds 2004 work was also faked fall of scientific ' rock star ' profile : hwang woo-suk " the important thing is that he made important progress in his research .
bringing down a scholar like this is not helping the country . "
dr hwang 's cult-like following was fuelled by nationalism , and has proved remarkably resilient despite evidence that he fabricated research and then lied about it .
the government also played a key role in the scientist 's rise to glory - seeing political advantage in promoting him as the face of the future .
he was held up as a harbinger of a high-tech future for a country nervous about competition from china in traditional manufacturing .
" government policies to support and finance hwang 's work merged with nationalism and patriotism to create a quasi-fascist environment that suppressed criticism , " said political scientist choi jang-jip .
hwang woo-suk is still fighting to redeem his reputation with a once adoring public .
after weeks in seclusion , he apologised for the fabrications in his papers but claimed he had been duped by fellow researchers .
he continues to insist he does have the core technology to clone human embryos and he appealed to patriotic sentiment to be given a second chance to prove it .
but even as he spoke , his status as national champion and scientific superstar was rapidly deflating .
the only thing that i could see was the hope south korea could stand high at the top of the world hwang woo-suk the government stripped him of his unique title of supreme scientist ; stamps featuring the celebrated cloner were quietly withdrawn ; and school text books extolling his virtues are being revised .
biographies of the 53-year-old veterinarian were also disappearing from seoul bookshops - there were 16 at last count , including children 's comics and hagiographies portraying the scientist as a role model for korean children .
national pride hwang woo-suk 's motives have baffled colleagues and scientists around the world .
he was an acknowledged leader in his field of animal cloning .
the afghan hound " snuppy " has been verified as the world 's first cloned dog .
in his public statements , dr hwang says he was driven by ambition and national pride .
" we became crazy for our work and were blind to everything else .
the only thing that i could see was the hope south korea could stand high at the top of the world , " he said in his latest encounter with the media .
the truth remains obscured by conflicting claims and allegations .
junior researchers say they were ordered to fabricate results .
dr hwang insists they deceived him and he has called on prosecutors to investigate his allegation that stem cell lines were switched .
dr hwang is still credited with producing the world 's first cloned dog increasingly , the government 's role in the scandal is coming under the spotlight .
the government identified the biotechnical field as an industry of the future and poured in investment and support , said lee jae-myung of the liberal pressure group people 's solidarity for participatory democracy .
" the government bragged about dr hwang 's results as if they were its own , but they failed to check the validity of any of the supposed achievements .
the government has to take responsibility for this . "
ministries offered their full support to dr hwang 's team at seoul national university when allegations of wrongdoing first surfaced .
a wave of nationalist emotion initially helped to silence those raising questions .
now , even in top government circles , some are still prepared to speak out for the disgraced scientist .
" dr hwang asked for forgiveness , so people should be more generous and give him an opportunity to rise again , " said chung dong-young , a recent cabinet member and now a leading presidential contender from the ruling party .
dr hwang 's fall from grace has stunned scientists around the world , who thought he had made a revolutionary breakthrough .
the shock and bafflement in his own country is even more acute ; but even now some koreans are reluctant to accept their hero was a fraud .

a thousand people gathered for a candlelit vigil on an icy night in central seoul - a show of solidarity with the cloning scientist that they still call the " pride of korea " .
dr hwang woo-suk had been exposed as a fraud by his colleagues at seoul national university .
his two landmark papers on cloned embryonic stem cells were found to have been fabricated .
but dr hwang can still count on a hard-core of supporters and many more who are reluctant to accept the downfall of a national icon .
" faking the research paper was not so important , " said lee young-sil , who came home from japan to show her faith in the scientist .
scandal timeline feb 2004 hwang woo-suk 's team declare they have created 30 cloned human embryos and extracted stem cells may 2005 team says it has made stem cell lines from skin cells of 11 people nov 2005 hwang apologises for using eggs from his own researchers 15 dec 2005 a colleague claims stem cell research was faked 23 dec 2005 academic panel finds results of may 2005 research were fabricated 10 jan 2006 panel finds 2004 work was also faked fall of scientific ' rock star ' profile : hwang woo-suk " the important thing is that he made important progress in his research .
bringing down a scholar like this is not helping the country . "
dr hwang 's cult-like following was fuelled by nationalism , and has proved remarkably resilient despite evidence that he fabricated research and then lied about it .
the government also played a key role in the scientist 's rise to glory - seeing political advantage in promoting him as the face of the future .
he was held up as a harbinger of a high-tech future for a country nervous about competition from china in traditional manufacturing .
" government policies to support and finance hwang 's work merged with nationalism and patriotism to create a quasi-fascist environment that suppressed criticism , " said political scientist choi jang-jip .
hwang woo-suk is still fighting to redeem his reputation with a once adoring public .
after weeks in seclusion , he apologised for the fabrications in his papers but claimed he had been duped by fellow researchers .
he continues to insist he does have the core technology to clone human embryos and he appealed to patriotic sentiment to be given a second chance to prove it .
but even as he spoke , his status as national champion and scientific superstar was rapidly deflating . "
the only thing that i could see was the hope south korea could stand high at the top of the world " hwang woo-suk the government stripped him of his unique title of supreme scientist ; stamps featuring the celebrated cloner were quietly withdrawn ; and school text books extolling his virtues are being revised .
biographies of the 53-year-old veterinarian were also disappearing from seoul bookshops - there were 16 at last count , including children 's comics and hagiographies portraying the scientist as a role model for korean children .
national pride hwang woo-suk 's motives have baffled colleagues and scientists around the world .
he was an acknowledged leader in his field of animal cloning .
the afghan hound " snuppy " has been verified as the world 's first cloned dog .
in his public statements , dr hwang says he was driven by ambition and national pride .
" we became crazy for our work and were blind to everything else .
the only thing that i could see was the hope south korea could stand high at the top of the world , " he said in his latest encounter with the media .
the truth remains obscured by conflicting claims and allegations .
junior researchers say they were ordered to fabricate results .
dr hwang insists they deceived him and he has called on prosecutors to investigate his allegation that stem cell lines were switched .
increasingly , the government 's role in the scandal is coming under the spotlight .
the government identified the biotechnical field as an industry of the future and poured in investment and support , said lee jae-myung of the liberal pressure group people 's solidarity for participatory democracy .
" the government bragged about dr hwang 's results as if they were its own , but they failed to check the validity of any of the supposed achievements .
the government has to take responsibility for this . "
ministries offered their full support to dr hwang 's team at seoul national university when allegations of wrongdoing first surfaced .
a wave of nationalist emotion initially helped to silence those raising questions .
now , even in top government circles , some are still prepared to speak out for the disgraced scientist .
" dr hwang asked for forgiveness , so people should be more generous and give him an opportunity to rise again , " said chung dong-young , a recent cabinet member and now a leading presidential contender from the ruling party .
dr hwang 's fall from grace has stunned scientists around the world , who thought he had made a revolutionary breakthrough .
the shock and bafflement in his own country is even more acute ; but even now some koreans are reluctant to accept their hero was a fraud .

a court heard how miss horton , 21 , from cardiff , was beaten with a parasol pole and later dragged out to sea off koh samui where she drowned .
wichai somkhaoyai , 24 and bualoi posit , 23 , admitted rape and conspiracy to kill at the court in surat thani .
the case has been adjourned until next wednesday when the men face sentencing .
the fishermen will return to court where the judge will decide whether to pass the maximum sentence of death .
the one-day trial on friday was told that the men had been watching pornographic films on their boat on the evening of 1 january .
they then swam ashore using plastic petrol cans as buoyancy and attacked miss horton on the beach as she talked to her mother on her mobile phone .
the men hit her about the head and shoulders with a parasol pole and took turns to rape her while the other held her down , the trial heard .
after that they dragged her out to sea to a boat and used that to tow her further out , where the reading university student drowned .
the court heard that a british tourist , christopher burrows , who later found miss horton 's mobile phone on the beach , heard a faint voice calling out in english : " i 'm sinking , i 'm sinking . "
the discovery of the mobile phone on the beach led police to investigate fishing boats moored offshore , the trial was told .
thai officers boarded the boats posing as fish traders , before telling those on board dna tests would be carried out .
the court was told it was at this point the two men on trial admitted they carried out the murder .
the attack took place at 2100 local time on new year 's day , close to where miss horton was staying on lamai beach , on the island of koh samui .
her body was washed up the next morning on a remote beach a few kilometres away where it was found by a water biker .
the trial on friday heard from eight witnesses , including police officers , forensic doctors and fishermen .
the fishermen did not address the court directly , but confirmed their earlier statements admitting guilt .
memorial blessing thailand 's prime minister thaksin shinawatra has declared that the men should face the maximum penalty because of damage done to the country 's image .
the provisional court of surat thani is around 330 miles -lrb- 520 kilometres -rrb- south west of the capital bangkok .
miss horton had travelled to thailand with a university friend for a two-week holiday .
she had been on lamai beach with a group of friends on 1 january , close to the bungalows they had rented , when she is said to have wandered away to speak to her mother on her mobile phone .
her body was discovered some 12 hours later .
miss horton 's funeral will take place on tuesday at st isan 's church , in llanishen , cardiff , followed by private cremation .
meanwhile , a service of prayer for miss horton took place on thursday at reading university where she was a psychology undergraduate .
a buddhist memorial blessing in miss horton 's memory was held on thursday on lamai beach by the people of koh samui .

new work done at manchester business school shows clubs often concentrate on the physical aspects of a player without examining the cultural and sociological side .
that , says professor susan cartwright , professor of organisational psychology at the school , can lead to problems for players in integrating into a new country - which in turn may force clubs to offload foreign stars at a financial loss . "
like certain types of flower , they do n't necessarily blossom in another climate " professor susan cartwright , manchester business school " knowledge of factors preventing footballers achieving their potential could prove invaluable in a multi-million pound industry where return of investment is directly linked to players ' performance , " she says .
" a significant proportion of these newcomers perform poorly , prematurely end their contracts , and move away to another country or return to their home countries . "
overseas invasion along with colleague isobel donaldson , the professor looked at the ability of a players to adjust to a new culture at work and in social situations .
they looked at professional football clubs across the north-west of england , from the manchester giants to macclesfield , but their findings will be of interest to all major uk sides .
the english leagues have one of the highest proportions of foreign players in europe , and the influx has been a fixture in english football since the bosman ruling scrapped overseas " quotas " a decade ago .
for clubs , it may appear to be good business if they can get an experienced player , perhaps an internationalist , for a smaller sum in transfer fees and wages than if they bought a home based player .
however , last season arsenal came in for great criticism for picking an entirely non-english squad for their game against crystal palace , with claims the foreign invasion may be stifling homegrown talent .
and , for every eric cantona - who settled at united with great success - there has been a david bellion , who is on his way home to france and nice after mediocre spells at old trafford , sunderland and west ham .
' technically good ' from her work with other careers groups , as well as footballers , professor cartwright believes that a certain type of person with aptitude to work abroad can be discovered , and then helped to settle overseas .
" previous research i did was with engineers , retailers , and managers who had gone overseas - all from large businesses which regularly send people to other countries .
" in any business , including football , people move overseas because they are technically very good .
" but like certain types of flower , they do n't necessarily blossom in another climate . "
she has identified a very high rate of failure in people moving to work abroad , with a higher-than-expected turnover of staff .
" it is in the interest of football clubs , and other businesses , to assess in advance how well players will adjust to a new environment .
" people , including players , who are ' culturally intelligent ' will do well overseas .
by that i mean those that are aware of their own culture and how it might differ from others .
" players also have to realise that doing things in a different way overseas is not odd or wrong , and they will pick up on things very quickly . "
' positive ' motivation the professor believes there are two types of players who move to england ; those who have always wanted to turn out for a club here , and those who come because their agents tell them it would be a good financial deal .
" not surprisingly , the ones who come because their agents told them to are less settled than the ones who positively want to play here , " she says .
" however , when clubs are looking to buy overseas players they often seem to ignore these criteria .
" this is strange - because a player who does not settle , or a high turnover of foreign purchases , could be expensive for the club . "
" it is like buying anything of quality - you do n't spend a lot of money on something and then neglect it " xavier rivoire , french football writer she also said having a wife or girlfriend helped players settle , particularly if the partner also found an occupation in the uk .
for the clubs , the settling-in process can be hugely eased if they prepare a dossier of information for players , such as when banks open and what type of shops there are .
at bolton , which has at least 16 nationalities on the books , there are two player liaison officers to help new purchases adjust to uk life .
they can advise on anything from food to finding a good garage , to helping with family visits from overseas .
the club also tries to buy players who are experienced professionals , perhaps with prior overseas cultural experience , and also who are looking for a new challenge - who " positively " want to come to england .
boys from brazil xavier rivoire is a french journalist based in the uk who has written a book about the influx of french players to england in the wake of eric cantona 's move in 1992 .
he has noticed that a number of high-priced french signings have failed to settle in england , and says clubs have to do more than " just finding a house for them or paying lots of money in wages " .
" it is like buying anything of quality - you do n't spend a lot of money on something and then neglect it , " he warns .
he cites ex-newcastle united player laurent robert , now on his way to benfica via portsmouth , as an example of a french player - actually from the island of reunion - who was continually unsettled at his english clubs .
in contrast , he said , french club lyon is well-known for its efforts to make brazilian imports feel at home .
" they have a translator , who also attends to details such as making sure the temperature in the players ' houses is similar to what they are used to and that they get the sort of food they want , " he says .
" as a result there has only been perhaps one brazilian player out of about 10 who has not succeeded . "

new work done at manchester business school shows clubs often concentrate on the physical aspects of a player without examining the cultural and sociological side .
that , says professor susan cartwright , professor of organisational psychology at the school , can lead to problems for players in integrating into a new country - which in turn may force clubs to offload foreign stars at a financial loss .
like certain types of flower , they do n't necessarily blossom in another climate professor susan cartwright , manchester business school " knowledge of factors preventing footballers achieving their potential could prove invaluable in a multi-million pound industry where return of investment is directly linked to players ' performance , " she says .
" a significant proportion of these newcomers perform poorly , prematurely end their contracts , and move away to another country or return to their home countries . "
overseas invasion along with colleague isobel donaldson , the professor looked at the ability of a players to adjust to a new culture at work and in social situations .
they looked at professional football clubs across the north-west of england , from the manchester giants to macclesfield , but their findings will be of interest to all major uk sides .
french star eric cantona adapted well to the british way of life the english leagues have one of the highest proportions of foreign players in europe , and the influx has been a fixture in english football since the bosman ruling scrapped overseas " quotas " a decade ago .
for clubs , it may appear to be good business if they can get an experienced player , perhaps an internationalist , for a smaller sum in transfer fees and wages than if they bought a home based player .
however , last season arsenal came in for great criticism for picking an entirely non-english squad for their game against crystal palace , with claims the foreign invasion may be stifling homegrown talent .
and , for every eric cantona - who settled at united with great success - there has been a david bellion , who is on his way home to france and nice after mediocre spells at old trafford , sunderland and west ham .
' technically good ' from her work with other careers groups , as well as footballers , professor cartwright believes that a certain type of person with aptitude to work abroad can be discovered , and then helped to settle overseas .
" previous research i did was with engineers , retailers , and managers who had gone overseas - all from large businesses which regularly send people to other countries .
" in any business , including football , people move overseas because they are technically very good .
david bellion failed to settle after being at three english clubs " but like certain types of flower , they do n't necessarily blossom in another climate . "
she has identified a very high rate of failure in people moving to work abroad , with a higher-than-expected turnover of staff .
" it is in the interest of football clubs , and other businesses , to assess in advance how well players will adjust to a new environment .
" people , including players , who are ' culturally intelligent ' will do well overseas .
by that i mean those that are aware of their own culture and how it might differ from others .
" players also have to realise that doing things in a different way overseas is not odd or wrong , and they will pick up on things very quickly . "
' positive ' motivation the professor believes there are two types of players who move to england ; those who have always wanted to turn out for a club here , and those who come because their agents tell them it would be a good financial deal .
" not surprisingly , the ones who come because their agents told them to are less settled than the ones who positively want to play here , " she says .
" however , when clubs are looking to buy overseas players they often seem to ignore these criteria .
" this is strange - because a player who does not settle , or a high turnover of foreign purchases , could be expensive for the club . "
it is like buying anything of quality - you do n't spend a lot of money on something and then neglect it xavier rivoire , french football writer she also said having a wife or girlfriend helped players settle , particularly if the partner also found an occupation in the uk .
for the clubs , the settling-in process can be hugely eased if they prepare a dossier of information for players , such as when banks open and what type of shops there are .
at bolton , which has at least 16 nationalities on the books , there are two player liaison officers to help new purchases adjust to uk life .
they can advise on anything from food to finding a good garage , to helping with family visits from overseas .
the club also tries to buy players who are experienced professionals , perhaps with prior overseas cultural experience , and also who are looking for a new challenge - who " positively " want to come to england .

the company has had problems with the weight of the aircraft , something analysts put down to the fact it had to meet too many operational criteria .
should the spyplane program have reached full production it could have been worth as much as $ 8bn .
lockheed said it made four proposals to overcome the difficulties , but none were accepted by the army .
" after carefully evaluating lockheed 's proposals , we decided that the prudent course of action at this time was to terminate the contract , " said claude bolton , the army 's chief weapons buyer .
' very different needs ' analysts said that the main problem facing the company was that despite a number of redesigns , the plane was just too small and heavy to meet its operational requirements .
observers said that lockheed was faced with a complicated brief that may have led to problems from the start .
it would have produced a flying albatross loren thompson , defence analyst at lexington institute check lockheed 's shares " the government should never have tried to develop one system to meet the very different needs of the army and navy , " said loren thompson , a defence analyst with the lexington institute .
ms thompson explained that while the navy wanted a plane to intercept communications , the army wanted one to perform more specific missions such as locating radio transmissions on a battlefield .
" it would have produced a flying albatross , " she said .
lockheed , which won the contract over rival northrop grumman in 2004 , had originally proposed using a plane built by brazil 's empresa brasileira de aeronautica .
when the problems emerged , it was reported that the company had considered switching to a larger jet made by canada 's bombardier .
the army said it will continue to use other aircraft and radar planes in the meantime .

whether i thought about the dark and gloomy hades , i 'm not sure " venetia phair venetia phair is n't a name that immediately springs to mind when you mention astronomy .
but the retired teacher from epsom in surrey has left an indelible signature on our map of the solar system .
now 87 years of age , venetia phair -lrb- née burney -rrb- is the only person in the world who can claim to have named a planet .
in 1930 , at just 11 years of age , mrs phair suggested the title pluto for the newly discovered ninth planet .
on 17 january , the us space agency -lrb- nasa -rrb- will launch the first ever space mission to this distant world from cape canaveral in florida .
pluto , the roman god of the underworld , turned out to be a particularly apt title for the enigmatic object , which resides in the outer reaches of the solar system .
mythological name the name proposed by the then oxford schoolgirl was seized upon at the lowell observatory in flagstaff , arizona , where the planet was discovered by young american astronomer clyde tombaugh .
" i was quite interested in greek and roman myths and legends at the time , " mrs phair told the bbc news website .
" at school , we used to play games in the university park , putting - i think they were lumps of clay - at the right distance from each other to represent the distances of the planets from the sun .
" some of the distances i can still more or less remember , so it was probably a good lesson to have had . "
on the morning of 14 march 1930 , the young venetia burney was sitting down to breakfast in the dining room of the house in north oxford where she lived with her grandfather falconer madan .
mr madan , who was retired as librarian at the bodleian library , was with her reading the times newspaper .
when he got to an article on page 14 about the new planet 's discovery , he remarked on it to venetia .
excellent suggestion " i can still visualise the table and the room , but i can remember very little about the conversation , " mrs phair said .
the article mentioned that the planet had not yet been named , prompting venetia burney to suggest her own .
mr madan was so impressed with the name pluto , he went straight to his friend herbert hall turner , professor of astronomy at the university of oxford , and one of the leaders in the worldwide effort to produce an astrographic chart .
" it was incredibly lucky in a number of ways , " mrs phair explains .
" firstly , i was lucky in having a grandfather who pursued the matter and knew professor turner .
" and it is extremely lucky that the name was there .
there were practically no names left from classical mythology .
whether i thought about the dark and gloomy hades , i 'm not sure . "
interestingly , her great uncle henry madan had suggested the names phobos and deimos for the moons of mars .
though retired , falconer madan continued to visit the bodleian library to pursue his interest in lewis carroll and see former colleagues .
" he walked down to the bodleian as usual and on the way he diverged sufficiently to drop a note in at professor turner 's house , " says mrs phair .
five pound reward ironically , the professor was out at a meeting of the royal astronomical society in london where there was much speculation about the naming of the new ninth planet .
" none of them came up with pluto .
that was another stroke of luck , " says mrs phair .
when mr madan eventually caught up with herbert hall turner , the astronomer agreed pluto was an excellent choice .
professor turner promised to send a telegram , forwarding the suggestion , to the lowell observatory .
mrs phair then heard nothing more on the matter for more than a month .
on 1 may 1930 , the name pluto was formally adopted .
when the news went public , mr madan rewarded his granddaughter with a five pound note .
" this was unheard of then .
as a grandfather , he liked to have an excuse for generosity , " says mrs phair .
mrs phair is keen to scotch one rumour that grew up in the years after pluto 's discovery ; namely that she had named the planet after disney 's cartoon dog , which also debuted in 1930 .
" people were repeatedly saying : ' ah , she named it after pluto the dog ' .
it has now been satisfactorily proven that the dog was named after the planet , rather than the other way round .
so , one is vindicated . "
predicted discovery the name was apparently adopted for the ninth planet not only because it was one of the few noteworthy names from classical mythology not already taken , but also because the first two letters were the initials of percival lowell , the astronomer who gave his name to the observatory where clyde tombaugh worked .
with fellow astronomer william pickering , lowell had predicted the existence of a trans-neptunian planet .
clyde tombaugh had found pluto during a systematic search for such an object .
venetia still has the press cuttings collected by her grandfather on the adoption of the name pluto , and a kind of fame has followed her ever since .
" the professor who built the planetarium at the leicester space centre was very kind and had spent quite a long time trying to trace us .
when we went to visit , we were treated more or less like royalty , " she says .
over the years she has tried to follow developments on the planet she named , which is now the subject of calls from some astronomers for a demotion in status .
since its discovery in 1930 , astronomers have discovered an entire region of distant icy bodies much like pluto called the kuiper belt .
as such , some scientists now put pluto amongst these kuiper belt objects rather than among the planets .
mrs phair has been sent an invitation by nasa to watch the new horizons launch from cape canaveral , but she says she will probably have to decline the offer due to her age .
" it 's interesting is n't it , that as they come to demote pluto , so the interest in it seems to have grown , " she says .
" at my age , i 've been largely indifferent to -lsb- the debate -rsb- ; though i suppose i would prefer it to remain a planet . "
