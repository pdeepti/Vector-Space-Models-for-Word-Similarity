" although the indicator has fallen for the third time in a row , it would be too early to interpret this as a sign of an imminent downturn in the economy , " the gfk said , adding that while consumers are becoming more skeptical about the economy , they do not see the economic situation as weakening . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german automakers and suppliers still in the driver 's seat although its high hourly wage structure has led automakers to outsource production in eastern europe and china , germany has still maintained its international competitiveness in premium markets .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 30.08.2006 opinion : iran lacking in diplomacy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad again voiced defiance as the un security council deadline for iran to halt its nuclear program nears .
and he again did so without tact or diplomacy , says dw 's peter philipp . mahmoud ahmadinejad did n't really surprise anyone with what he had to say during a lengthy press conference on tuesday .
two days before the deadline set by the un security council , he strengthened tehran 's resolve not to bow to international pressure and freeze uranium enrichment .
what 's now being regarded in washington and other western capitals as a new affront on tehran 's part is actually the continuation of iran 's previous policy . iran - and not just ahmadinejad - is convinced of its right to conduct nuclear research and use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes .
such a right - including the enrichment of uranium - was committed to by the signatories of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
in iran , it 's seen as impermissible arrogance on the part of the united states that iran should , as the only country in the region , be forbidden from doing what other countries who did n't sign the treaty are doing - countries such as israel , india and pakistan . ahmadi n ejad 's world view ahmadinejad has developed a very particular world view out of the situation - the us and britain are abusing their privileges to make the world bend to their will , and the security council is also run by them .
the iranian president is demanding a radical change of this status quo .
and he is single-mindedly turning himself into the spokesperson for all those in the world who similarly feel themselves to be at the mercy of america 's despotic rule - especially in the islamic world . ahmadinejad is deluding them into thinking that help will come from tehran .
he rather dramatically challenged us president george w. bush to a televised debate about world politics , in which he would explain to the american people where the mistakes of their government lie . this is not just posturing on the part of the iranian president to improve his image in the islamic world .
at home , he is also trying to draw attention away from the fact that he has not made good on many of his election promises . the iranian president seems to be longing for the days of the revolution , when iran believed it could get by without the rest of the world .
in tehran , the realization has long since sunk in that this does n't work .
that does n't mean that the country has to give up its rights ; it just means that it should n't forgo things like tact , diplomacy and manners - things that ahmadinejad always seems to lack . middle east expert peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspo n de n t . -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ahmadinejad claims holocaust invented to embarrass germany iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has told german chancellor angela merkel that the holocaust may have been invented by the victorious allied powers in world war ii to embarrass germany .

and he again did so without tact or diplomacy , says dw 's peter philipp . mahmoud ahmadinejad did n't really surprise anyone with what he had to say during a lengthy press conference on tuesday .
two days before the deadline set by the un security council , he strengthened tehran 's resolve not to bow to international pressure and freeze uranium enrichment .
what 's now being regarded in washington and other western capitals as a new affront on tehran 's part is actually the continuation of iran 's previous policy . iran - and not just ahmadinejad - is convinced of its right to conduct nuclear research and use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes .
such a right - including the enrichment of uranium - was committed to by the signatories of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .

the iranian president is demanding a radical change of this status quo .
and he is single-mindedly turning himself into the spokesperson for all those in the world who similarly feel themselves to be at the mercy of america 's despotic rule - especially in the islamic world . ahmadinejad is deluding them into thinking that help will come from tehran .

at düsseldorf 's airport , help is at hand for those afraid to fly . for aviophobes out there , and there are a lot of them , getting on an airplane is no picnic .
the thought of being enclosed in a confined space breathing recycled air and hurtling through the air thousands of miles from the ground is too much for many people . and in today 's jet-set world , being afraid of flying can be a big impediment to a career in business , not to mention reaching your preferred vacation destination . in western germany , the world 's first outpatient center for those afraid to fly has opened where they need it most , the airport . the center , run by the german center for fear of flying , offers shaky passengers a free 15-minute instant " last-minute " counseling session , with tips on how to reduce anxiety and information about flying itself , the airline or the country of destination .
those whose fear is of the white-knuckle variety can avail themselves of a 45-minute personal counseling session for 25 euros -lrb- $ 32 -rrb- . " the advantage to having an outpatients ' department at the airport is that passengers can be treated shortly before travel , allowing less time for feelings of panic or fear to rise up again , " psychologist marc-roman trautmann , who heads the center , told the ddp news agency . sometimes pilots even come by to talk to people about what flying involves , and if there 's time , passengers can take a look around the cabin before the flight boards . some 30 people have used the service - more men then women , so far , trautmann said . " many just need a mental kick in the behind , " he added .
" the last-minute treatment ca n't cure their fear , but it can help them deal with it .

the un security council said tuesday that no action would be taken against iran until later in september if the islamic republic fails to comply with the un resolution .
german deputy foreign minister gernot erler stated that it was germany 's hope that sanctions could be avoided through negotiations between the aug .
31 deadline and the end of september . " i believe that the application for sanctions will not get the approval of russia and china , " erler said in an interview with the fi n a n cial times deutschla n d .
" the united states wants to speed up the sanctions process in the security council but we know what a constraint the refusal of russia and china would be . " erler urged iran to engage in " substantial dialogue " even if the deadline passes without a solution . despite erler 's assertions , many countries have expressed fears that the iranians are not prepared to move from the position voiced defiantly by ahmadinejad on tuesday and that sanctions are unavoidable . a confident ahmadinejad said that sanctions against his country were " unlikely " in a speech which also criticized the united states and britain for using the un security council for their own ends and reiterated the iranian president 's call for israel to be " removed . " iran was presented with a package of trade , technology and security incentives in exchange for a freeze of its uranium enrichment activities in june , but the iranian president effectively rejected the offer , saying that iran had made " exceptional " offers of its own which had been rejected .

" we 've made it very clear that unless we get an unequivocal acceptance of that condition in the security council resolution , that sanctions would follow , " us ambassador to the un john bolton said on tuesday evening . britain 's un ambassador emyr jones parry told reporters that he expected the un security council members plus germany -lrb- p5 + 1 -rrb- would only respond to iran after what he called a " further period of discussion among capitals .

" that would be a victory for the iranians .

his statements increased the likelihood of sanctions being imposed , but the decision to do so is still very much a matter of intense discussion at the un . cou n cil members split over sa n ctio n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council is divided over its response the prospect of sanctions , and possible military action , against iran has led to cracks appearing in the security council members over how to progress in the crisis . russia and china , both major trading partners with iran , have been unwilling to impose sanctions and could frustrate such a move in the security council , while the united states are the most vocal in advocating such measures , along with a less certain britain . " we 've made it very clear that unless we get an unequivocal acceptance of that condition in the security council resolution , that sanctions would follow , " us ambassador to the un john bolton said on tuesday evening . britain 's un ambassador emyr jones parry told reporters that he expected the un security council members plus germany -lrb- p5 + 1 -rrb- would only respond to iran after what he called a " further period of discussion among capitals . " the russian defense minister sergei ivanov only last week said talk of introducing sanctions against iran was " premature . "
there was no response from the russians to ahmadinejad 's speech on tuesday . co n cer n ed europea n s keep dialogue ope n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the europeans fear us military action against iran meanwhile the europeans , including permanent council member france and germany , are fearful that an escalation could lead to us military action against iran 's hard-line regime and have sought to leave the door open to dialogue while urging tehran to comply with the un demands . french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy warned in an interview tuesday that divisions within the international community over iran 's nuclear program would hand a victory to tehran . the international community must not become divided , to cut itself in two , " he said .
" that would be a victory for the iranians . " in his speech tuesday , ahmadinejad also called for a live televised debate with us president george w. bush in which he hoped the two leaders could debate world problems . us rejects preside n tial debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush likes to talk but not to iranians the white house rejected outright the offer of a televised debate . " talk of a debate is just a diversion from the legitimate concerns that the international community , not just the us , has about iran 's behavior , from support to terrorism to pursuit of a nuclear weapons capability , " a senior administration official said , speaking privately .
" the iranian regime knows what it has to do to engage constructively with the international community .
we said we are willing to talk to iran in the context of a positive response to the p5 + 1 package .

" i have never had such bewildered reactions from survivors , " said knigge , who called the remarks " a scandal " and suggested that the government no longer takes its responsibility for germany 's nazi legacy seriously . herz , a frenchman who was imprisoned at buchenwald at the age of 14 , called the speech " nationalistic " and an insult to victims of nazi atrocities . parliamentary deputy speaker katrin göring-eckardt of the green party demanded an explanation from the government " to avoid further damage here and abroad . " " no i n te n tio n of relativizi n g victims " amid calls for his resignation tuesday , schäfer apologized for any offense he caused . " i did not know there were concentration camp victims sitting in the front rows , " he told public broadcaster 3sat , referring to the audience at the ceremony .
" i am sorry and apologize for that .
i should have included them more in the speech and was probably obliged to . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the camp was liberated on april 11 , 1945 , by the us army he said he had not included specific references to the nazis ' slaughter of six million jews because he had been asked to speak on the government 's policy on historical remembrance in general .
schäfer added that he had no intention of weighing the suffering of one group of victims against the other . schäfer 's boss , culture minister bernd neumann , expressed his regret in a statement issued tuesday for any offense caused by the speech , but said it was " completely absurd " to assume from it that germany no longer saw the holocaust as an unparalleled crime . " i extremely regret any political misunderstandings and adverse effects to the event caused by my department director 's speech , " he said .
" the nazi dictatorship and the holocaust it caused are unique in their cynically barbarous dimensions . " fax mistake n ly se n t to co n ce n tratio n camps neumann 's office was forced to apologize again tuesday when it was revealed that all former nazi concentration camps received a fax calling on them to hoist the german flag on " home day , " sept .

now nine months after taking office , merkel aims to go on the offensive . following a meeting of her cabinet of conservatives and social democrats in berlin on tuesday , merkel admitted that germans were increasingly skeptical of their government . the chancellor said that " tough " decisions , such as raising the retirement age to 67 , a planned hike in value-added tax and the abolishment of tax benefits , were responsible for lowered confidence among citizens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel will have to work hard to continue enjoying this level of admiration from germans speaking at a press conference together with deputy chancellor franz müntefering , merkel defended her government 's decisions , saying it had cleaned up its finances and boosted economic prospects .
those political achievements were not yet being fully reflected in people 's opinions , she added . improving economy boosts reform drive merkel also said her government was determined to push ahead with reforms , given that germany 's economy had brightened over the past few months . " the good economic figures should n't make us all complacent now , because much remains to be done in germany , " merkel said .
" but i do believe that a growing economy will help resolve our problems in a less painful manner than would be the case without an expanding economy . " bolstered by a buoyant economy that is expected to grow by two percent this year , merkel 's government wants to tackle a series of thorny issues .
among them is a corporate tax reform aimed at strengthening medium and small-sized businesses . merkel said the government would push controversial plans for a reform of public healthcare funding through parliament in spite of howls of criticism from lobby groups .
a government working group is due to present proposals for the introduction of minimum wage levels in germany , and public investment in high-technology sectors of the economy is to be substantially increased . eager to put behind differences merkel and müntefering also indicated they would try to settle their differences over a welfare reform that has led to steeply rising payments for the jobless rather than lower ones originally intended . the two leaders also agreed on the speedy introduction of a nationwide database containing information about suspected terrorists and vowed to foster the integration of foreigners in german society .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering and merkel have a few differences to overcome in foreign policy , merkel reaffirmed her government 's determination to play a substantial role in peacekeeping efforts in lebanon and said that humanitarian aid would be increased . müntefering said that contrary to public perception the coalition government was working smoothly . " the government has a leadership role in this country , which is a huge responsibility .
all government members , regardless of their party affiliation , are aware of that , and although there may be some quarrels erupting at times everyone is aiming for the best possible results . " nevertheless , angela merkel appears to be eager to prevent a further erosion of the government 's poll ratings which have dropped markedly by more than 10 points since she took office last november .
the tightly packed government program for the rest of the year is clearly intended to show the public that the reins of power are still firmly in merkel 's hands . uwe hessler -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german health care reform : mission impossible ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 30.08.2006 opinion : iran lacking in diplomacy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad again voiced defiance as the un security council deadline for iran to halt its nuclear program nears .
and he again did so without tact or diplomacy , says dw 's peter philipp . mahmoud ahmadinejad did n't really surprise anyone with what he had to say during a lengthy press conference on tuesday .
two days before the deadline set by the un security council , he strengthened tehran 's resolve not to bow to international pressure and freeze uranium enrichment .
what 's now being regarded in washington and other western capitals as a new affront on tehran 's part is actually the continuation of iran 's previous policy . iran - and not just ahmadinejad - is convinced of its right to conduct nuclear research and use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes .
such a right - including the enrichment of uranium - was committed to by the signatories of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
in iran , it 's seen as impermissible arrogance on the part of the united states that iran should , as the only country in the region , be forbidden from doing what other countries who did n't sign the treaty are doing - countries such as israel , india and pakistan . ahmadi n ejad 's world view ahmadinejad has developed a very particular world view out of the situation - the us and britain are abusing their privileges to make the world bend to their will , and the security council is also run by them .
the iranian president is demanding a radical change of this status quo .
and he is single-mindedly turning himself into the spokesperson for all those in the world who similarly feel themselves to be at the mercy of america 's despotic rule - especially in the islamic world . ahmadinejad is deluding them into thinking that help will come from tehran .
he rather dramatically challenged us president george w. bush to a televised debate about world politics , in which he would explain to the american people where the mistakes of their government lie . this is not just posturing on the part of the iranian president to improve his image in the islamic world .
at home , he is also trying to draw attention away from the fact that he has not made good on many of his election promises . the iranian president seems to be longing for the days of the revolution , when iran believed it could get by without the rest of the world .
in tehran , the realization has long since sunk in that this does n't work .
that does n't mean that the country has to give up its rights ; it just means that it should n't forgo things like tact , diplomacy and manners - things that ahmadinejad always seems to lack . middle east expert peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspo n de n t . -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ahmadinejad claims holocaust invented to embarrass germany iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has told german chancellor angela merkel that the holocaust may have been invented by the victorious allied powers in world war ii to embarrass germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 30.08.2006 germany hopes for an alternative to sanctions in iran stand-off großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with un sanctions looming , ahmadinejad was in belligerent mood tuesday iran 's confident dismissal of the un threat of action caused widespread concern in the international community wednesday , while germany maintained that sanctions were far from definite . a day after iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad shrugged off the threat of sanctions ahead of a looming un deadline for iran to halt sensitive atomic work , the international community voiced its concerns that iran 's hard-line stance could escalate the already volatile stand-off . however , while sanctions remain a distinct possibility , germany still believes an alternative solution can be found .
the un security council said tuesday that no action would be taken against iran until later in september if the islamic republic fails to comply with the un resolution .
german deputy foreign minister gernot erler stated that it was germany 's hope that sanctions could be avoided through negotiations between the aug .
31 deadline and the end of september . " i believe that the application for sanctions will not get the approval of russia and china , " erler said in an interview with the fi n a n cial times deutschla n d .
" the united states wants to speed up the sanctions process in the security council but we know what a constraint the refusal of russia and china would be . " erler urged iran to engage in " substantial dialogue " even if the deadline passes without a solution . despite erler 's assertions , many countries have expressed fears that the iranians are not prepared to move from the position voiced defiantly by ahmadinejad on tuesday and that sanctions are unavoidable . a confident ahmadinejad said that sanctions against his country were " unlikely " in a speech which also criticized the united states and britain for using the un security council for their own ends and reiterated the iranian president 's call for israel to be " removed . " iran was presented with a package of trade , technology and security incentives in exchange for a freeze of its uranium enrichment activities in june , but the iranian president effectively rejected the offer , saying that iran had made " exceptional " offers of its own which had been rejected .
his statements increased the likelihood of sanctions being imposed , but the decision to do so is still very much a matter of intense discussion at the un . cou n cil members split over sa n ctio n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council is divided over its response the prospect of sanctions , and possible military action , against iran has led to cracks appearing in the security council members over how to progress in the crisis . russia and china , both major trading partners with iran , have been unwilling to impose sanctions and could frustrate such a move in the security council , while the united states are the most vocal in advocating such measures , along with a less certain britain . " we 've made it very clear that unless we get an unequivocal acceptance of that condition in the security council resolution , that sanctions would follow , " us ambassador to the un john bolton said on tuesday evening . britain 's un ambassador emyr jones parry told reporters that he expected the un security council members plus germany -lrb- p5 + 1 -rrb- would only respond to iran after what he called a " further period of discussion among capitals . " the russian defense minister sergei ivanov only last week said talk of introducing sanctions against iran was " premature . "
there was no response from the russians to ahmadinejad 's speech on tuesday . co n cer n ed europea n s keep dialogue ope n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the europeans fear us military action against iran meanwhile the europeans , including permanent council member france and germany , are fearful that an escalation could lead to us military action against iran 's hard-line regime and have sought to leave the door open to dialogue while urging tehran to comply with the un demands . french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy warned in an interview tuesday that divisions within the international community over iran 's nuclear program would hand a victory to tehran . the international community must not become divided , to cut itself in two , " he said .
" that would be a victory for the iranians . " in his speech tuesday , ahmadinejad also called for a live televised debate with us president george w. bush in which he hoped the two leaders could debate world problems . us rejects preside n tial debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush likes to talk but not to iranians the white house rejected outright the offer of a televised debate . " talk of a debate is just a diversion from the legitimate concerns that the international community , not just the us , has about iran 's behavior , from support to terrorism to pursuit of a nuclear weapons capability , " a senior administration official said , speaking privately .
" the iranian regime knows what it has to do to engage constructively with the international community .
we said we are willing to talk to iran in the context of a positive response to the p5 + 1 package .

the un security council said tuesday that no action would be taken against iran until later in september if the islamic republic fails to comply with the un resolution .
german deputy foreign minister gernot erler stated that it was germany 's hope that sanctions could be avoided through negotiations between the aug .
31 deadline and the end of september . " i believe that the application for sanctions will not get the approval of russia and china , " erler said in an interview with the fi n a n cial times deutschla n d .
" the united states wants to speed up the sanctions process in the security council but we know what a constraint the refusal of russia and china would be . " erler urged iran to engage in " substantial dialogue " even if the deadline passes without a solution . despite erler 's assertions , many countries have expressed fears that the iranians are not prepared to move from the position voiced defiantly by ahmadinejad on tuesday and that sanctions are unavoidable . a confident ahmadinejad said that sanctions against his country were " unlikely " in a speech which also criticized the united states and britain for using the un security council for their own ends and reiterated the iranian president 's call for israel to be " removed . " iran was presented with a package of trade , technology and security incentives in exchange for a freeze of its uranium enrichment activities in june , but the iranian president effectively rejected the offer , saying that iran had made " exceptional " offers of its own which had been rejected .
his statements increased the likelihood of sanctions being imposed , but the decision to do so is still very much a matter of intense discussion at the un . cou n cil members split over sa n ctio n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council is divided over its response the prospect of sanctions , and possible military action , against iran has led to cracks appearing in the security council members over how to progress in the crisis . russia and china , both major trading partners with iran , have been unwilling to impose sanctions and could frustrate such a move in the security council , while the united states are the most vocal in advocating such measures , along with a less certain britain . " we 've made it very clear that unless we get an unequivocal acceptance of that condition in the security council resolution , that sanctions would follow , " us ambassador to the un john bolton said on tuesday evening . britain 's un ambassador emyr jones parry told reporters that he expected the un security council members plus germany -lrb- p5 + 1 -rrb- would only respond to iran after what he called a " further period of discussion among capitals . " the russian defense minister sergei ivanov only last week said talk of introducing sanctions against iran was " premature . "
there was no response from the russians to ahmadinejad 's speech on tuesday . co n cer n ed europea n s keep dialogue ope n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the europeans fear us military action against iran meanwhile the europeans , including permanent council member france and germany , are fearful that an escalation could lead to us military action against iran 's hard-line regime and have sought to leave the door open to dialogue while urging tehran to comply with the un demands . french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy warned in an interview tuesday that divisions within the international community over iran 's nuclear program would hand a victory to tehran . the international community must not become divided , to cut itself in two , " he said .
" that would be a victory for the iranians . " in his speech tuesday , ahmadinejad also called for a live televised debate with us president george w. bush in which he hoped the two leaders could debate world problems . us rejects preside n tial debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush likes to talk but not to iranians the white house rejected outright the offer of a televised debate . " talk of a debate is just a diversion from the legitimate concerns that the international community , not just the us , has about iran 's behavior , from support to terrorism to pursuit of a nuclear weapons capability , " a senior administration official said , speaking privately .
" the iranian regime knows what it has to do to engage constructively with the international community .
we said we are willing to talk to iran in the context of a positive response to the p5 + 1 package .

those whose fear is of the white-knuckle variety can avail themselves of a 45-minute personal counseling session for 25 euros -lrb- $ 32 -rrb- .

" many just need a mental kick in the behind , " he added .

now nine months after taking office , merkel aims to go on the offensive . following a meeting of her cabinet of conservatives and social democrats in berlin on tuesday , merkel admitted that germans were increasingly skeptical of their government . the chancellor said that " tough " decisions , such as raising the retirement age to 67 , a planned hike in value-added tax and the abolishment of tax benefits , were responsible for lowered confidence among citizens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel will have to work hard to continue enjoying this level of admiration from germans speaking at a press conference together with deputy chancellor franz müntefering , merkel defended her government 's decisions , saying it had cleaned up its finances and boosted economic prospects .
those political achievements were not yet being fully reflected in people 's opinions , she added . improving economy boosts reform drive merkel also said her government was determined to push ahead with reforms , given that germany 's economy had brightened over the past few months . " the good economic figures should n't make us all complacent now , because much remains to be done in germany , " merkel said .

" bolstered by a buoyant economy that is expected to grow by two percent this year , merkel 's government wants to tackle a series of thorny issues .
among them is a corporate tax reform aimed at strengthening medium and small-sized businesses . merkel said the government would push controversial plans for a reform of public healthcare funding through parliament in spite of howls of criticism from lobby groups .
a government working group is due to present proposals for the introduction of minimum wage levels in germany , and public investment in high-technology sectors of the economy is to be substantially increased . eager to put behind differences merkel and müntefering also indicated they would try to settle their differences over a welfare reform that has led to steeply rising payments for the jobless rather than lower ones originally intended . the two leaders also agreed on the speedy introduction of a nationwide database containing information about suspected terrorists and vowed to foster the integration of foreigners in german society .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering and merkel have a few differences to overcome in foreign policy , merkel reaffirmed her government 's determination to play a substantial role in peacekeeping efforts in lebanon and said that humanitarian aid would be increased . müntefering said that contrary to public perception the coalition government was working smoothly . " the government has a leadership role in this country , which is a huge responsibility .
all government members , regardless of their party affiliation , are aware of that , and although there may be some quarrels erupting at times everyone is aiming for the best possible results . " nevertheless , angela merkel appears to be eager to prevent a further erosion of the government 's poll ratings which have dropped markedly by more than 10 points since she took office last november .

now nine months after taking office , merkel aims to go on the offensive . following a meeting of her cabinet of conservatives and social democrats in berlin on tuesday , merkel admitted that germans were increasingly skeptical of their government . the chancellor said that " tough " decisions , such as raising the retirement age to 67 , a planned hike in value-added tax and the abolishment of tax benefits , were responsible for lowered confidence among citizens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel will have to work hard to continue enjoying this level of admiration from germans speaking at a press conference together with deputy chancellor franz müntefering , merkel defended her government 's decisions , saying it had cleaned up its finances and boosted economic prospects .
those political achievements were not yet being fully reflected in people 's opinions , she added . improving economy boosts reform drive merkel also said her government was determined to push ahead with reforms , given that germany 's economy had brightened over the past few months . " the good economic figures should n't make us all complacent now , because much remains to be done in germany , " merkel said .
" but i do believe that a growing economy will help resolve our problems in a less painful manner than would be the case without an expanding economy . " bolstered by a buoyant economy that is expected to grow by two percent this year , merkel 's government wants to tackle a series of thorny issues .
among them is a corporate tax reform aimed at strengthening medium and small-sized businesses . merkel said the government would push controversial plans for a reform of public healthcare funding through parliament in spite of howls of criticism from lobby groups .
a government working group is due to present proposals for the introduction of minimum wage levels in germany , and public investment in high-technology sectors of the economy is to be substantially increased . eager to put behind differences merkel and müntefering also indicated they would try to settle their differences over a welfare reform that has led to steeply rising payments for the jobless rather than lower ones originally intended . the two leaders also agreed on the speedy introduction of a nationwide database containing information about suspected terrorists and vowed to foster the integration of foreigners in german society .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering and merkel have a few differences to overcome in foreign policy , merkel reaffirmed her government 's determination to play a substantial role in peacekeeping efforts in lebanon and said that humanitarian aid would be increased . müntefering said that contrary to public perception the coalition government was working smoothly . " the government has a leadership role in this country , which is a huge responsibility .
all government members , regardless of their party affiliation , are aware of that , and although there may be some quarrels erupting at times everyone is aiming for the best possible results . " nevertheless , angela merkel appears to be eager to prevent a further erosion of the government 's poll ratings which have dropped markedly by more than 10 points since she took office last november .

and he again did so without tact or diplomacy , says dw 's peter philipp . mahmoud ahmadinejad did n't really surprise anyone with what he had to say during a lengthy press conference on tuesday .
two days before the deadline set by the un security council , he strengthened tehran 's resolve not to bow to international pressure and freeze uranium enrichment .
what 's now being regarded in washington and other western capitals as a new affront on tehran 's part is actually the continuation of iran 's previous policy . iran - and not just ahmadinejad - is convinced of its right to conduct nuclear research and use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes .
such a right - including the enrichment of uranium - was committed to by the signatories of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
in iran , it 's seen as impermissible arrogance on the part of the united states that iran should , as the only country in the region , be forbidden from doing what other countries who did n't sign the treaty are doing - countries such as israel , india and pakistan . ahmadi n ejad 's world view ahmadinejad has developed a very particular world view out of the situation - the us and britain are abusing their privileges to make the world bend to their will , and the security council is also run by them .
the iranian president is demanding a radical change of this status quo .
and he is single-mindedly turning himself into the spokesperson for all those in the world who similarly feel themselves to be at the mercy of america 's despotic rule - especially in the islamic world . ahmadinejad is deluding them into thinking that help will come from tehran .
he rather dramatically challenged us president george w. bush to a televised debate about world politics , in which he would explain to the american people where the mistakes of their government lie . this is not just posturing on the part of the iranian president to improve his image in the islamic world .
at home , he is also trying to draw attention away from the fact that he has not made good on many of his election promises . the iranian president seems to be longing for the days of the revolution , when iran believed it could get by without the rest of the world .
in tehran , the realization has long since sunk in that this does n't work .
that does n't mean that the country has to give up its rights ; it just means that it should n't forgo things like tact , diplomacy and manners - things that ahmadinejad always seems to lack . middle east expert peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspo n de n t . -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ahmadinejad claims holocaust invented to embarrass germany iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has told german chancellor angela merkel that the holocaust may have been invented by the victorious allied powers in world war ii to embarrass germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 30.08.2006 opinion : iran lacking in diplomacy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad again voiced defiance as the un security council deadline for iran to halt its nuclear program nears .
and he again did so without tact or diplomacy , says dw 's peter philipp . mahmoud ahmadinejad did n't really surprise anyone with what he had to say during a lengthy press conference on tuesday .
two days before the deadline set by the un security council , he strengthened tehran 's resolve not to bow to international pressure and freeze uranium enrichment .
what 's now being regarded in washington and other western capitals as a new affront on tehran 's part is actually the continuation of iran 's previous policy . iran - and not just ahmadinejad - is convinced of its right to conduct nuclear research and use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes .
such a right - including the enrichment of uranium - was committed to by the signatories of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
in iran , it 's seen as impermissible arrogance on the part of the united states that iran should , as the only country in the region , be forbidden from doing what other countries who did n't sign the treaty are doing - countries such as israel , india and pakistan . ahmadi n ejad 's world view ahmadinejad has developed a very particular world view out of the situation - the us and britain are abusing their privileges to make the world bend to their will , and the security council is also run by them .
the iranian president is demanding a radical change of this status quo .
and he is single-mindedly turning himself into the spokesperson for all those in the world who similarly feel themselves to be at the mercy of america 's despotic rule - especially in the islamic world . ahmadinejad is deluding them into thinking that help will come from tehran .
he rather dramatically challenged us president george w. bush to a televised debate about world politics , in which he would explain to the american people where the mistakes of their government lie . this is not just posturing on the part of the iranian president to improve his image in the islamic world .
at home , he is also trying to draw attention away from the fact that he has not made good on many of his election promises . the iranian president seems to be longing for the days of the revolution , when iran believed it could get by without the rest of the world .
in tehran , the realization has long since sunk in that this does n't work .
that does n't mean that the country has to give up its rights ; it just means that it should n't forgo things like tact , diplomacy and manners - things that ahmadinejad always seems to lack . middle east expert peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspo n de n t . -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ahmadinejad claims holocaust invented to embarrass germany iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has told german chancellor angela merkel that the holocaust may have been invented by the victorious allied powers in world war ii to embarrass germany .

" the advantage to having an outpatients ' department at the airport is that passengers can be treated shortly before travel , allowing less time for feelings of panic or fear to rise up again , " psychologist marc-roman trautmann , who heads the center , told the ddp news agency . sometimes pilots even come by to talk to people about what flying involves , and if there 's time , passengers can take a look around the cabin before the flight boards . some 30 people have used the service - more men then women , so far , trautmann said . " many just need a mental kick in the behind , " he added .

" i have never had such bewildered reactions from survivors , " said knigge , who called the remarks " a scandal " and suggested that the government no longer takes its responsibility for germany 's nazi legacy seriously . herz , a frenchman who was imprisoned at buchenwald at the age of 14 , called the speech " nationalistic " and an insult to victims of nazi atrocities . parliamentary deputy speaker katrin göring-eckardt of the green party demanded an explanation from the government " to avoid further damage here and abroad . " " no i n te n tio n of relativizi n g victims " amid calls for his resignation tuesday , schäfer apologized for any offense he caused . " i did not know there were concentration camp victims sitting in the front rows , " he told public broadcaster 3sat , referring to the audience at the ceremony .
" i am sorry and apologize for that .
i should have included them more in the speech and was probably obliged to . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the camp was liberated on april 11 , 1945 , by the us army he said he had not included specific references to the nazis ' slaughter of six million jews because he had been asked to speak on the government 's policy on historical remembrance in general .
schäfer added that he had no intention of weighing the suffering of one group of victims against the other . schäfer 's boss , culture minister bernd neumann , expressed his regret in a statement issued tuesday for any offense caused by the speech , but said it was " completely absurd " to assume from it that germany no longer saw the holocaust as an unparalleled crime .

the un security council said tuesday that no action would be taken against iran until later in september if the islamic republic fails to comply with the un resolution .
german deputy foreign minister gernot erler stated that it was germany 's hope that sanctions could be avoided through negotiations between the aug .
31 deadline and the end of september . " i believe that the application for sanctions will not get the approval of russia and china , " erler said in an interview with the fi n a n cial times deutschla n d .
" the united states wants to speed up the sanctions process in the security council but we know what a constraint the refusal of russia and china would be . " erler urged iran to engage in " substantial dialogue " even if the deadline passes without a solution . despite erler 's assertions , many countries have expressed fears that the iranians are not prepared to move from the position voiced defiantly by ahmadinejad on tuesday and that sanctions are unavoidable . a confident ahmadinejad said that sanctions against his country were " unlikely " in a speech which also criticized the united states and britain for using the un security council for their own ends and reiterated the iranian president 's call for israel to be " removed . " iran was presented with a package of trade , technology and security incentives in exchange for a freeze of its uranium enrichment activities in june , but the iranian president effectively rejected the offer , saying that iran had made " exceptional " offers of its own which had been rejected .
his statements increased the likelihood of sanctions being imposed , but the decision to do so is still very much a matter of intense discussion at the un . cou n cil members split over sa n ctio n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council is divided over its response the prospect of sanctions , and possible military action , against iran has led to cracks appearing in the security council members over how to progress in the crisis . russia and china , both major trading partners with iran , have been unwilling to impose sanctions and could frustrate such a move in the security council , while the united states are the most vocal in advocating such measures , along with a less certain britain . " we 've made it very clear that unless we get an unequivocal acceptance of that condition in the security council resolution , that sanctions would follow , " us ambassador to the un john bolton said on tuesday evening . britain 's un ambassador emyr jones parry told reporters that he expected the un security council members plus germany -lrb- p5 + 1 -rrb- would only respond to iran after what he called a " further period of discussion among capitals . " the russian defense minister sergei ivanov only last week said talk of introducing sanctions against iran was " premature . "
there was no response from the russians to ahmadinejad 's speech on tuesday . co n cer n ed europea n s keep dialogue ope n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the europeans fear us military action against iran meanwhile the europeans , including permanent council member france and germany , are fearful that an escalation could lead to us military action against iran 's hard-line regime and have sought to leave the door open to dialogue while urging tehran to comply with the un demands . french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy warned in an interview tuesday that divisions within the international community over iran 's nuclear program would hand a victory to tehran . the international community must not become divided , to cut itself in two , " he said .
" that would be a victory for the iranians . " in his speech tuesday , ahmadinejad also called for a live televised debate with us president george w. bush in which he hoped the two leaders could debate world problems . us rejects preside n tial debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush likes to talk but not to iranians the white house rejected outright the offer of a televised debate . " talk of a debate is just a diversion from the legitimate concerns that the international community , not just the us , has about iran 's behavior , from support to terrorism to pursuit of a nuclear weapons capability , " a senior administration official said , speaking privately .
" the iranian regime knows what it has to do to engage constructively with the international community .

now nine months after taking office , merkel aims to go on the offensive . following a meeting of her cabinet of conservatives and social democrats in berlin on tuesday , merkel admitted that germans were increasingly skeptical of their government . the chancellor said that " tough " decisions , such as raising the retirement age to 67 , a planned hike in value-added tax and the abolishment of tax benefits , were responsible for lowered confidence among citizens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel will have to work hard to continue enjoying this level of admiration from germans speaking at a press conference together with deputy chancellor franz müntefering , merkel defended her government 's decisions , saying it had cleaned up its finances and boosted economic prospects .
those political achievements were not yet being fully reflected in people 's opinions , she added . improving economy boosts reform drive merkel also said her government was determined to push ahead with reforms , given that germany 's economy had brightened over the past few months . " the good economic figures should n't make us all complacent now , because much remains to be done in germany , " merkel said .
" but i do believe that a growing economy will help resolve our problems in a less painful manner than would be the case without an expanding economy . " bolstered by a buoyant economy that is expected to grow by two percent this year , merkel 's government wants to tackle a series of thorny issues .
among them is a corporate tax reform aimed at strengthening medium and small-sized businesses . merkel said the government would push controversial plans for a reform of public healthcare funding through parliament in spite of howls of criticism from lobby groups .
a government working group is due to present proposals for the introduction of minimum wage levels in germany , and public investment in high-technology sectors of the economy is to be substantially increased . eager to put behind differences merkel and müntefering also indicated they would try to settle their differences over a welfare reform that has led to steeply rising payments for the jobless rather than lower ones originally intended . the two leaders also agreed on the speedy introduction of a nationwide database containing information about suspected terrorists and vowed to foster the integration of foreigners in german society .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering and merkel have a few differences to overcome in foreign policy , merkel reaffirmed her government 's determination to play a substantial role in peacekeeping efforts in lebanon and said that humanitarian aid would be increased . müntefering said that contrary to public perception the coalition government was working smoothly . " the government has a leadership role in this country , which is a huge responsibility .
all government members , regardless of their party affiliation , are aware of that , and although there may be some quarrels erupting at times everyone is aiming for the best possible results . " nevertheless , angela merkel appears to be eager to prevent a further erosion of the government 's poll ratings which have dropped markedly by more than 10 points since she took office last november .
the tightly packed government program for the rest of the year is clearly intended to show the public that the reins of power are still firmly in merkel 's hands . uwe hessler -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german health care reform : mission impossible ?

the thought of being enclosed in a confined space breathing recycled air and hurtling through the air thousands of miles from the ground is too much for many people . and in today 's jet-set world , being afraid of flying can be a big impediment to a career in business , not to mention reaching your preferred vacation destination . in western germany , the world 's first outpatient center for those afraid to fly has opened where they need it most , the airport . the center , run by the german center for fear of flying , offers shaky passengers a free 15-minute instant " last-minute " counseling session , with tips on how to reduce anxiety and information about flying itself , the airline or the country of destination .
those whose fear is of the white-knuckle variety can avail themselves of a 45-minute personal counseling session for 25 euros -lrb- $ 32 -rrb- . " the advantage to having an outpatients ' department at the airport is that passengers can be treated shortly before travel , allowing less time for feelings of panic or fear to rise up again , " psychologist marc-roman trautmann , who heads the center , told the ddp news agency . sometimes pilots even come by to talk to people about what flying involves , and if there 's time , passengers can take a look around the cabin before the flight boards . some 30 people have used the service - more men then women , so far , trautmann said . " many just need a mental kick in the behind , " he added .
" the last-minute treatment ca n't cure their fear , but it can help them deal with it .

" i have never had such bewildered reactions from survivors , " said knigge , who called the remarks " a scandal " and suggested that the government no longer takes its responsibility for germany 's nazi legacy seriously . herz , a frenchman who was imprisoned at buchenwald at the age of 14 , called the speech " nationalistic " and an insult to victims of nazi atrocities . parliamentary deputy speaker katrin göring-eckardt of the green party demanded an explanation from the government " to avoid further damage here and abroad .

schäfer added that he had no intention of weighing the suffering of one group of victims against the other . schäfer 's boss , culture minister bernd neumann , expressed his regret in a statement issued tuesday for any offense caused by the speech , but said it was " completely absurd " to assume from it that germany no longer saw the holocaust as an unparalleled crime .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 30.08.2006 battling plummeting popularity , merkel vows reform drive großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has her work cut out when it comes to mollifying skeptical germans german chancellor angela merkel plans to reverse her coalition government 's sinking popularity ratings with a renewed stab at controversial reforms . the popularity of germany 's grand coalition government has plunged to post-election lows as a result of government infighting and political decisions that have been widely criticized as half-hearted compromises .
now nine months after taking office , merkel aims to go on the offensive . following a meeting of her cabinet of conservatives and social democrats in berlin on tuesday , merkel admitted that germans were increasingly skeptical of their government . the chancellor said that " tough " decisions , such as raising the retirement age to 67 , a planned hike in value-added tax and the abolishment of tax benefits , were responsible for lowered confidence among citizens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel will have to work hard to continue enjoying this level of admiration from germans speaking at a press conference together with deputy chancellor franz müntefering , merkel defended her government 's decisions , saying it had cleaned up its finances and boosted economic prospects .
those political achievements were not yet being fully reflected in people 's opinions , she added . improving economy boosts reform drive merkel also said her government was determined to push ahead with reforms , given that germany 's economy had brightened over the past few months . " the good economic figures should n't make us all complacent now , because much remains to be done in germany , " merkel said .
" but i do believe that a growing economy will help resolve our problems in a less painful manner than would be the case without an expanding economy . " bolstered by a buoyant economy that is expected to grow by two percent this year , merkel 's government wants to tackle a series of thorny issues .
among them is a corporate tax reform aimed at strengthening medium and small-sized businesses . merkel said the government would push controversial plans for a reform of public healthcare funding through parliament in spite of howls of criticism from lobby groups .
a government working group is due to present proposals for the introduction of minimum wage levels in germany , and public investment in high-technology sectors of the economy is to be substantially increased . eager to put behind differences merkel and müntefering also indicated they would try to settle their differences over a welfare reform that has led to steeply rising payments for the jobless rather than lower ones originally intended . the two leaders also agreed on the speedy introduction of a nationwide database containing information about suspected terrorists and vowed to foster the integration of foreigners in german society .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering and merkel have a few differences to overcome in foreign policy , merkel reaffirmed her government 's determination to play a substantial role in peacekeeping efforts in lebanon and said that humanitarian aid would be increased . müntefering said that contrary to public perception the coalition government was working smoothly . " the government has a leadership role in this country , which is a huge responsibility .
all government members , regardless of their party affiliation , are aware of that , and although there may be some quarrels erupting at times everyone is aiming for the best possible results . " nevertheless , angela merkel appears to be eager to prevent a further erosion of the government 's poll ratings which have dropped markedly by more than 10 points since she took office last november .
the tightly packed government program for the rest of the year is clearly intended to show the public that the reins of power are still firmly in merkel 's hands . uwe hessler -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german health care reform : mission impossible ?

now nine months after taking office , merkel aims to go on the offensive . following a meeting of her cabinet of conservatives and social democrats in berlin on tuesday , merkel admitted that germans were increasingly skeptical of their government . the chancellor said that " tough " decisions , such as raising the retirement age to 67 , a planned hike in value-added tax and the abolishment of tax benefits , were responsible for lowered confidence among citizens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel will have to work hard to continue enjoying this level of admiration from germans speaking at a press conference together with deputy chancellor franz müntefering , merkel defended her government 's decisions , saying it had cleaned up its finances and boosted economic prospects .
those political achievements were not yet being fully reflected in people 's opinions , she added . improving economy boosts reform drive merkel also said her government was determined to push ahead with reforms , given that germany 's economy had brightened over the past few months . " the good economic figures should n't make us all complacent now , because much remains to be done in germany , " merkel said .
" but i do believe that a growing economy will help resolve our problems in a less painful manner than would be the case without an expanding economy . " bolstered by a buoyant economy that is expected to grow by two percent this year , merkel 's government wants to tackle a series of thorny issues .
among them is a corporate tax reform aimed at strengthening medium and small-sized businesses . merkel said the government would push controversial plans for a reform of public healthcare funding through parliament in spite of howls of criticism from lobby groups .
a government working group is due to present proposals for the introduction of minimum wage levels in germany , and public investment in high-technology sectors of the economy is to be substantially increased . eager to put behind differences merkel and müntefering also indicated they would try to settle their differences over a welfare reform that has led to steeply rising payments for the jobless rather than lower ones originally intended . the two leaders also agreed on the speedy introduction of a nationwide database containing information about suspected terrorists and vowed to foster the integration of foreigners in german society .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering and merkel have a few differences to overcome in foreign policy , merkel reaffirmed her government 's determination to play a substantial role in peacekeeping efforts in lebanon and said that humanitarian aid would be increased . müntefering said that contrary to public perception the coalition government was working smoothly . " the government has a leadership role in this country , which is a huge responsibility .
all government members , regardless of their party affiliation , are aware of that , and although there may be some quarrels erupting at times everyone is aiming for the best possible results . " nevertheless , angela merkel appears to be eager to prevent a further erosion of the government 's poll ratings which have dropped markedly by more than 10 points since she took office last november .
the tightly packed government program for the rest of the year is clearly intended to show the public that the reins of power are still firmly in merkel 's hands . uwe hessler -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german health care reform : mission impossible ?

and he again did so without tact or diplomacy , says dw 's peter philipp . mahmoud ahmadinejad did n't really surprise anyone with what he had to say during a lengthy press conference on tuesday .
two days before the deadline set by the un security council , he strengthened tehran 's resolve not to bow to international pressure and freeze uranium enrichment .
what 's now being regarded in washington and other western capitals as a new affront on tehran 's part is actually the continuation of iran 's previous policy . iran - and not just ahmadinejad - is convinced of its right to conduct nuclear research and use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes .
such a right - including the enrichment of uranium - was committed to by the signatories of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .

the iranian president is demanding a radical change of this status quo .
and he is single-mindedly turning himself into the spokesperson for all those in the world who similarly feel themselves to be at the mercy of america 's despotic rule - especially in the islamic world . ahmadinejad is deluding them into thinking that help will come from tehran .
he rather dramatically challenged us president george w. bush to a televised debate about world politics , in which he would explain to the american people where the mistakes of their government lie . this is not just posturing on the part of the iranian president to improve his image in the islamic world .
at home , he is also trying to draw attention away from the fact that he has not made good on many of his election promises . the iranian president seems to be longing for the days of the revolution , when iran believed it could get by without the rest of the world .
in tehran , the realization has long since sunk in that this does n't work .
that does n't mean that the country has to give up its rights ; it just means that it should n't forgo things like tact , diplomacy and manners - things that ahmadinejad always seems to lack . middle east expert peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspo n de n t . -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ahmadinejad claims holocaust invented to embarrass germany iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has told german chancellor angela merkel that the holocaust may have been invented by the victorious allied powers in world war ii to embarrass germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 30.08.2006 opinion : iran lacking in diplomacy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad again voiced defiance as the un security council deadline for iran to halt its nuclear program nears .
and he again did so without tact or diplomacy , says dw 's peter philipp . mahmoud ahmadinejad did n't really surprise anyone with what he had to say during a lengthy press conference on tuesday .
two days before the deadline set by the un security council , he strengthened tehran 's resolve not to bow to international pressure and freeze uranium enrichment .
what 's now being regarded in washington and other western capitals as a new affront on tehran 's part is actually the continuation of iran 's previous policy . iran - and not just ahmadinejad - is convinced of its right to conduct nuclear research and use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes .
such a right - including the enrichment of uranium - was committed to by the signatories of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
in iran , it 's seen as impermissible arrogance on the part of the united states that iran should , as the only country in the region , be forbidden from doing what other countries who did n't sign the treaty are doing - countries such as israel , india and pakistan . ahmadi n ejad 's world view ahmadinejad has developed a very particular world view out of the situation - the us and britain are abusing their privileges to make the world bend to their will , and the security council is also run by them .
the iranian president is demanding a radical change of this status quo .
and he is single-mindedly turning himself into the spokesperson for all those in the world who similarly feel themselves to be at the mercy of america 's despotic rule - especially in the islamic world . ahmadinejad is deluding them into thinking that help will come from tehran .
he rather dramatically challenged us president george w. bush to a televised debate about world politics , in which he would explain to the american people where the mistakes of their government lie . this is not just posturing on the part of the iranian president to improve his image in the islamic world .
at home , he is also trying to draw attention away from the fact that he has not made good on many of his election promises . the iranian president seems to be longing for the days of the revolution , when iran believed it could get by without the rest of the world .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 30.08.2006 opinion : iran lacking in diplomacy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad again voiced defiance as the un security council deadline for iran to halt its nuclear program nears .
and he again did so without tact or diplomacy , says dw 's peter philipp . mahmoud ahmadinejad did n't really surprise anyone with what he had to say during a lengthy press conference on tuesday .
two days before the deadline set by the un security council , he strengthened tehran 's resolve not to bow to international pressure and freeze uranium enrichment .
what 's now being regarded in washington and other western capitals as a new affront on tehran 's part is actually the continuation of iran 's previous policy . iran - and not just ahmadinejad - is convinced of its right to conduct nuclear research and use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes .
such a right - including the enrichment of uranium - was committed to by the signatories of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
in iran , it 's seen as impermissible arrogance on the part of the united states that iran should , as the only country in the region , be forbidden from doing what other countries who did n't sign the treaty are doing - countries such as israel , india and pakistan . ahmadi n ejad 's world view ahmadinejad has developed a very particular world view out of the situation - the us and britain are abusing their privileges to make the world bend to their will , and the security council is also run by them .
the iranian president is demanding a radical change of this status quo .
and he is single-mindedly turning himself into the spokesperson for all those in the world who similarly feel themselves to be at the mercy of america 's despotic rule - especially in the islamic world . ahmadinejad is deluding them into thinking that help will come from tehran .
he rather dramatically challenged us president george w. bush to a televised debate about world politics , in which he would explain to the american people where the mistakes of their government lie . this is not just posturing on the part of the iranian president to improve his image in the islamic world .
at home , he is also trying to draw attention away from the fact that he has not made good on many of his election promises . the iranian president seems to be longing for the days of the revolution , when iran believed it could get by without the rest of the world .
in tehran , the realization has long since sunk in that this does n't work .
that does n't mean that the country has to give up its rights ; it just means that it should n't forgo things like tact , diplomacy and manners - things that ahmadinejad always seems to lack . middle east expert peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspo n de n t . -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ahmadinejad claims holocaust invented to embarrass germany iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has told german chancellor angela merkel that the holocaust may have been invented by the victorious allied powers in world war ii to embarrass germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 30.08.2006 germany hopes for an alternative to sanctions in iran stand-off großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with un sanctions looming , ahmadinejad was in belligerent mood tuesday iran 's confident dismissal of the un threat of action caused widespread concern in the international community wednesday , while germany maintained that sanctions were far from definite . a day after iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad shrugged off the threat of sanctions ahead of a looming un deadline for iran to halt sensitive atomic work , the international community voiced its concerns that iran 's hard-line stance could escalate the already volatile stand-off . however , while sanctions remain a distinct possibility , germany still believes an alternative solution can be found .
the un security council said tuesday that no action would be taken against iran until later in september if the islamic republic fails to comply with the un resolution .
german deputy foreign minister gernot erler stated that it was germany 's hope that sanctions could be avoided through negotiations between the aug .
31 deadline and the end of september . " i believe that the application for sanctions will not get the approval of russia and china , " erler said in an interview with the fi n a n cial times deutschla n d .
" the united states wants to speed up the sanctions process in the security council but we know what a constraint the refusal of russia and china would be . " erler urged iran to engage in " substantial dialogue " even if the deadline passes without a solution . despite erler 's assertions , many countries have expressed fears that the iranians are not prepared to move from the position voiced defiantly by ahmadinejad on tuesday and that sanctions are unavoidable . a confident ahmadinejad said that sanctions against his country were " unlikely " in a speech which also criticized the united states and britain for using the un security council for their own ends and reiterated the iranian president 's call for israel to be " removed . " iran was presented with a package of trade , technology and security incentives in exchange for a freeze of its uranium enrichment activities in june , but the iranian president effectively rejected the offer , saying that iran had made " exceptional " offers of its own which had been rejected .
his statements increased the likelihood of sanctions being imposed , but the decision to do so is still very much a matter of intense discussion at the un . cou n cil members split over sa n ctio n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council is divided over its response the prospect of sanctions , and possible military action , against iran has led to cracks appearing in the security council members over how to progress in the crisis . russia and china , both major trading partners with iran , have been unwilling to impose sanctions and could frustrate such a move in the security council , while the united states are the most vocal in advocating such measures , along with a less certain britain .

the un security council said tuesday that no action would be taken against iran until later in september if the islamic republic fails to comply with the un resolution .
german deputy foreign minister gernot erler stated that it was germany 's hope that sanctions could be avoided through negotiations between the aug .
31 deadline and the end of september . " i believe that the application for sanctions will not get the approval of russia and china , " erler said in an interview with the fi n a n cial times deutschla n d .
" the united states wants to speed up the sanctions process in the security council but we know what a constraint the refusal of russia and china would be . " erler urged iran to engage in " substantial dialogue " even if the deadline passes without a solution . despite erler 's assertions , many countries have expressed fears that the iranians are not prepared to move from the position voiced defiantly by ahmadinejad on tuesday and that sanctions are unavoidable . a confident ahmadinejad said that sanctions against his country were " unlikely " in a speech which also criticized the united states and britain for using the un security council for their own ends and reiterated the iranian president 's call for israel to be " removed . " iran was presented with a package of trade , technology and security incentives in exchange for a freeze of its uranium enrichment activities in june , but the iranian president effectively rejected the offer , saying that iran had made " exceptional " offers of its own which had been rejected .
his statements increased the likelihood of sanctions being imposed , but the decision to do so is still very much a matter of intense discussion at the un . cou n cil members split over sa n ctio n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council is divided over its response the prospect of sanctions , and possible military action , against iran has led to cracks appearing in the security council members over how to progress in the crisis . russia and china , both major trading partners with iran , have been unwilling to impose sanctions and could frustrate such a move in the security council , while the united states are the most vocal in advocating such measures , along with a less certain britain . " we 've made it very clear that unless we get an unequivocal acceptance of that condition in the security council resolution , that sanctions would follow , " us ambassador to the un john bolton said on tuesday evening . britain 's un ambassador emyr jones parry told reporters that he expected the un security council members plus germany -lrb- p5 + 1 -rrb- would only respond to iran after what he called a " further period of discussion among capitals .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 30.08.2006 opinion : iran lacking in diplomacy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad again voiced defiance as the un security council deadline for iran to halt its nuclear program nears .
and he again did so without tact or diplomacy , says dw 's peter philipp . mahmoud ahmadinejad did n't really surprise anyone with what he had to say during a lengthy press conference on tuesday .
two days before the deadline set by the un security council , he strengthened tehran 's resolve not to bow to international pressure and freeze uranium enrichment .
what 's now being regarded in washington and other western capitals as a new affront on tehran 's part is actually the continuation of iran 's previous policy . iran - and not just ahmadinejad - is convinced of its right to conduct nuclear research and use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes .
such a right - including the enrichment of uranium - was committed to by the signatories of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
in iran , it 's seen as impermissible arrogance on the part of the united states that iran should , as the only country in the region , be forbidden from doing what other countries who did n't sign the treaty are doing - countries such as israel , india and pakistan . ahmadi n ejad 's world view ahmadinejad has developed a very particular world view out of the situation - the us and britain are abusing their privileges to make the world bend to their will , and the security council is also run by them .
the iranian president is demanding a radical change of this status quo .
and he is single-mindedly turning himself into the spokesperson for all those in the world who similarly feel themselves to be at the mercy of america 's despotic rule - especially in the islamic world . ahmadinejad is deluding them into thinking that help will come from tehran .
he rather dramatically challenged us president george w. bush to a televised debate about world politics , in which he would explain to the american people where the mistakes of their government lie . this is not just posturing on the part of the iranian president to improve his image in the islamic world .
at home , he is also trying to draw attention away from the fact that he has not made good on many of his election promises . the iranian president seems to be longing for the days of the revolution , when iran believed it could get by without the rest of the world .
in tehran , the realization has long since sunk in that this does n't work .
that does n't mean that the country has to give up its rights ; it just means that it should n't forgo things like tact , diplomacy and manners - things that ahmadinejad always seems to lack . middle east expert peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspo n de n t . -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ahmadinejad claims holocaust invented to embarrass germany iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has told german chancellor angela merkel that the holocaust may have been invented by the victorious allied powers in world war ii to embarrass germany .

29 , 2006 -rrb- iran defiant over enrichment , israel as deadline draws near iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad said tuesday it was " unlikely " the un security council would act against iran , with the deadline for tehran to halt its uranium enrichment just two days away .

" i have never had such bewildered reactions from survivors , " said knigge , who called the remarks " a scandal " and suggested that the government no longer takes its responsibility for germany 's nazi legacy seriously . herz , a frenchman who was imprisoned at buchenwald at the age of 14 , called the speech " nationalistic " and an insult to victims of nazi atrocities . parliamentary deputy speaker katrin göring-eckardt of the green party demanded an explanation from the government " to avoid further damage here and abroad . " " no i n te n tio n of relativizi n g victims " amid calls for his resignation tuesday , schäfer apologized for any offense he caused . " i did not know there were concentration camp victims sitting in the front rows , " he told public broadcaster 3sat , referring to the audience at the ceremony .

schäfer added that he had no intention of weighing the suffering of one group of victims against the other . schäfer 's boss , culture minister bernd neumann , expressed his regret in a statement issued tuesday for any offense caused by the speech , but said it was " completely absurd " to assume from it that germany no longer saw the holocaust as an unparalleled crime . " i extremely regret any political misunderstandings and adverse effects to the event caused by my department director 's speech , " he said .
" the nazi dictatorship and the holocaust it caused are unique in their cynically barbarous dimensions . " fax mistake n ly se n t to co n ce n tratio n camps neumann 's office was forced to apologize again tuesday when it was revealed that all former nazi concentration camps received a fax calling on them to hoist the german flag on " home day , " sept .

now nine months after taking office , merkel aims to go on the offensive . following a meeting of her cabinet of conservatives and social democrats in berlin on tuesday , merkel admitted that germans were increasingly skeptical of their government . the chancellor said that " tough " decisions , such as raising the retirement age to 67 , a planned hike in value-added tax and the abolishment of tax benefits , were responsible for lowered confidence among citizens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel will have to work hard to continue enjoying this level of admiration from germans speaking at a press conference together with deputy chancellor franz müntefering , merkel defended her government 's decisions , saying it had cleaned up its finances and boosted economic prospects .
those political achievements were not yet being fully reflected in people 's opinions , she added . improving economy boosts reform drive merkel also said her government was determined to push ahead with reforms , given that germany 's economy had brightened over the past few months . " the good economic figures should n't make us all complacent now , because much remains to be done in germany , " merkel said .
" but i do believe that a growing economy will help resolve our problems in a less painful manner than would be the case without an expanding economy . " bolstered by a buoyant economy that is expected to grow by two percent this year , merkel 's government wants to tackle a series of thorny issues .
among them is a corporate tax reform aimed at strengthening medium and small-sized businesses . merkel said the government would push controversial plans for a reform of public healthcare funding through parliament in spite of howls of criticism from lobby groups .
a government working group is due to present proposals for the introduction of minimum wage levels in germany , and public investment in high-technology sectors of the economy is to be substantially increased . eager to put behind differences merkel and müntefering also indicated they would try to settle their differences over a welfare reform that has led to steeply rising payments for the jobless rather than lower ones originally intended . the two leaders also agreed on the speedy introduction of a nationwide database containing information about suspected terrorists and vowed to foster the integration of foreigners in german society .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering and merkel have a few differences to overcome in foreign policy , merkel reaffirmed her government 's determination to play a substantial role in peacekeeping efforts in lebanon and said that humanitarian aid would be increased . müntefering said that contrary to public perception the coalition government was working smoothly . " the government has a leadership role in this country , which is a huge responsibility .
all government members , regardless of their party affiliation , are aware of that , and although there may be some quarrels erupting at times everyone is aiming for the best possible results . " nevertheless , angela merkel appears to be eager to prevent a further erosion of the government 's poll ratings which have dropped markedly by more than 10 points since she took office last november .
the tightly packed government program for the rest of the year is clearly intended to show the public that the reins of power are still firmly in merkel 's hands . uwe hessler -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german health care reform : mission impossible ?

" although the indicator has fallen for the third time in a row , it would be too early to interpret this as a sign of an imminent downturn in the economy , " the gfk said , adding that while consumers are becoming more skeptical about the economy , they do not see the economic situation as weakening . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german automakers and suppliers still in the driver 's seat although its high hourly wage structure has led automakers to outsource production in eastern europe and china , germany has still maintained its international competitiveness in premium markets .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 30.08.2006 battling plummeting popularity , merkel vows reform drive großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has her work cut out when it comes to mollifying skeptical germans german chancellor angela merkel plans to reverse her coalition government 's sinking popularity ratings with a renewed stab at controversial reforms . the popularity of germany 's grand coalition government has plunged to post-election lows as a result of government infighting and political decisions that have been widely criticized as half-hearted compromises .
now nine months after taking office , merkel aims to go on the offensive . following a meeting of her cabinet of conservatives and social democrats in berlin on tuesday , merkel admitted that germans were increasingly skeptical of their government . the chancellor said that " tough " decisions , such as raising the retirement age to 67 , a planned hike in value-added tax and the abolishment of tax benefits , were responsible for lowered confidence among citizens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel will have to work hard to continue enjoying this level of admiration from germans speaking at a press conference together with deputy chancellor franz müntefering , merkel defended her government 's decisions , saying it had cleaned up its finances and boosted economic prospects .
those political achievements were not yet being fully reflected in people 's opinions , she added . improving economy boosts reform drive merkel also said her government was determined to push ahead with reforms , given that germany 's economy had brightened over the past few months . " the good economic figures should n't make us all complacent now , because much remains to be done in germany , " merkel said .
" but i do believe that a growing economy will help resolve our problems in a less painful manner than would be the case without an expanding economy . " bolstered by a buoyant economy that is expected to grow by two percent this year , merkel 's government wants to tackle a series of thorny issues .
among them is a corporate tax reform aimed at strengthening medium and small-sized businesses . merkel said the government would push controversial plans for a reform of public healthcare funding through parliament in spite of howls of criticism from lobby groups .
a government working group is due to present proposals for the introduction of minimum wage levels in germany , and public investment in high-technology sectors of the economy is to be substantially increased . eager to put behind differences merkel and müntefering also indicated they would try to settle their differences over a welfare reform that has led to steeply rising payments for the jobless rather than lower ones originally intended . the two leaders also agreed on the speedy introduction of a nationwide database containing information about suspected terrorists and vowed to foster the integration of foreigners in german society .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering and merkel have a few differences to overcome in foreign policy , merkel reaffirmed her government 's determination to play a substantial role in peacekeeping efforts in lebanon and said that humanitarian aid would be increased . müntefering said that contrary to public perception the coalition government was working smoothly . " the government has a leadership role in this country , which is a huge responsibility .
all government members , regardless of their party affiliation , are aware of that , and although there may be some quarrels erupting at times everyone is aiming for the best possible results . " nevertheless , angela merkel appears to be eager to prevent a further erosion of the government 's poll ratings which have dropped markedly by more than 10 points since she took office last november .
the tightly packed government program for the rest of the year is clearly intended to show the public that the reins of power are still firmly in merkel 's hands . uwe hessler -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german health care reform : mission impossible ?

break out in sweat at the departure gate ?
have panic attacks in the passenger terminal ?
at düsseldorf 's airport , help is at hand for those afraid to fly . for aviophobes out there , and there are a lot of them , getting on an airplane is no picnic .
the thought of being enclosed in a confined space breathing recycled air and hurtling through the air thousands of miles from the ground is too much for many people . and in today 's jet-set world , being afraid of flying can be a big impediment to a career in business , not to mention reaching your preferred vacation destination . in western germany , the world 's first outpatient center for those afraid to fly has opened where they need it most , the airport . the center , run by the german center for fear of flying , offers shaky passengers a free 15-minute instant " last-minute " counseling session , with tips on how to reduce anxiety and information about flying itself , the airline or the country of destination .
those whose fear is of the white-knuckle variety can avail themselves of a 45-minute personal counseling session for 25 euros -lrb- $ 32 -rrb- . " the advantage to having an outpatients ' department at the airport is that passengers can be treated shortly before travel , allowing less time for feelings of panic or fear to rise up again , " psychologist marc-roman trautmann , who heads the center , told the ddp news agency . sometimes pilots even come by to talk to people about what flying involves , and if there 's time , passengers can take a look around the cabin before the flight boards . some 30 people have used the service - more men then women , so far , trautmann said . " many just need a mental kick in the behind , " he added .
" the last-minute treatment ca n't cure their fear , but it can help them deal with it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 30.08.2006 opinion : iran lacking in diplomacy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad again voiced defiance as the un security council deadline for iran to halt its nuclear program nears .
and he again did so without tact or diplomacy , says dw 's peter philipp . mahmoud ahmadinejad did n't really surprise anyone with what he had to say during a lengthy press conference on tuesday .
two days before the deadline set by the un security council , he strengthened tehran 's resolve not to bow to international pressure and freeze uranium enrichment .
what 's now being regarded in washington and other western capitals as a new affront on tehran 's part is actually the continuation of iran 's previous policy . iran - and not just ahmadinejad - is convinced of its right to conduct nuclear research and use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes .
such a right - including the enrichment of uranium - was committed to by the signatories of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
in iran , it 's seen as impermissible arrogance on the part of the united states that iran should , as the only country in the region , be forbidden from doing what other countries who did n't sign the treaty are doing - countries such as israel , india and pakistan . ahmadi n ejad 's world view ahmadinejad has developed a very particular world view out of the situation - the us and britain are abusing their privileges to make the world bend to their will , and the security council is also run by them .
the iranian president is demanding a radical change of this status quo .
and he is single-mindedly turning himself into the spokesperson for all those in the world who similarly feel themselves to be at the mercy of america 's despotic rule - especially in the islamic world . ahmadinejad is deluding them into thinking that help will come from tehran .
he rather dramatically challenged us president george w. bush to a televised debate about world politics , in which he would explain to the american people where the mistakes of their government lie . this is not just posturing on the part of the iranian president to improve his image in the islamic world .
at home , he is also trying to draw attention away from the fact that he has not made good on many of his election promises . the iranian president seems to be longing for the days of the revolution , when iran believed it could get by without the rest of the world .
in tehran , the realization has long since sunk in that this does n't work .
that does n't mean that the country has to give up its rights ; it just means that it should n't forgo things like tact , diplomacy and manners - things that ahmadinejad always seems to lack . middle east expert peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspo n de n t . -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ahmadinejad claims holocaust invented to embarrass germany iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has told german chancellor angela merkel that the holocaust may have been invented by the victorious allied powers in world war ii to embarrass germany .

now nine months after taking office , merkel aims to go on the offensive . following a meeting of her cabinet of conservatives and social democrats in berlin on tuesday , merkel admitted that germans were increasingly skeptical of their government . the chancellor said that " tough " decisions , such as raising the retirement age to 67 , a planned hike in value-added tax and the abolishment of tax benefits , were responsible for lowered confidence among citizens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel will have to work hard to continue enjoying this level of admiration from germans speaking at a press conference together with deputy chancellor franz müntefering , merkel defended her government 's decisions , saying it had cleaned up its finances and boosted economic prospects .
those political achievements were not yet being fully reflected in people 's opinions , she added . improving economy boosts reform drive merkel also said her government was determined to push ahead with reforms , given that germany 's economy had brightened over the past few months . " the good economic figures should n't make us all complacent now , because much remains to be done in germany , " merkel said .
" but i do believe that a growing economy will help resolve our problems in a less painful manner than would be the case without an expanding economy . " bolstered by a buoyant economy that is expected to grow by two percent this year , merkel 's government wants to tackle a series of thorny issues .
among them is a corporate tax reform aimed at strengthening medium and small-sized businesses . merkel said the government would push controversial plans for a reform of public healthcare funding through parliament in spite of howls of criticism from lobby groups .
a government working group is due to present proposals for the introduction of minimum wage levels in germany , and public investment in high-technology sectors of the economy is to be substantially increased . eager to put behind differences merkel and müntefering also indicated they would try to settle their differences over a welfare reform that has led to steeply rising payments for the jobless rather than lower ones originally intended . the two leaders also agreed on the speedy introduction of a nationwide database containing information about suspected terrorists and vowed to foster the integration of foreigners in german society .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering and merkel have a few differences to overcome in foreign policy , merkel reaffirmed her government 's determination to play a substantial role in peacekeeping efforts in lebanon and said that humanitarian aid would be increased . müntefering said that contrary to public perception the coalition government was working smoothly . " the government has a leadership role in this country , which is a huge responsibility .
all government members , regardless of their party affiliation , are aware of that , and although there may be some quarrels erupting at times everyone is aiming for the best possible results . " nevertheless , angela merkel appears to be eager to prevent a further erosion of the government 's poll ratings which have dropped markedly by more than 10 points since she took office last november .
the tightly packed government program for the rest of the year is clearly intended to show the public that the reins of power are still firmly in merkel 's hands . uwe hessler -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german health care reform : mission impossible ?

now nine months after taking office , merkel aims to go on the offensive . following a meeting of her cabinet of conservatives and social democrats in berlin on tuesday , merkel admitted that germans were increasingly skeptical of their government . the chancellor said that " tough " decisions , such as raising the retirement age to 67 , a planned hike in value-added tax and the abolishment of tax benefits , were responsible for lowered confidence among citizens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel will have to work hard to continue enjoying this level of admiration from germans speaking at a press conference together with deputy chancellor franz müntefering , merkel defended her government 's decisions , saying it had cleaned up its finances and boosted economic prospects .
those political achievements were not yet being fully reflected in people 's opinions , she added . improving economy boosts reform drive merkel also said her government was determined to push ahead with reforms , given that germany 's economy had brightened over the past few months . " the good economic figures should n't make us all complacent now , because much remains to be done in germany , " merkel said .

" bolstered by a buoyant economy that is expected to grow by two percent this year , merkel 's government wants to tackle a series of thorny issues .
among them is a corporate tax reform aimed at strengthening medium and small-sized businesses . merkel said the government would push controversial plans for a reform of public healthcare funding through parliament in spite of howls of criticism from lobby groups .
a government working group is due to present proposals for the introduction of minimum wage levels in germany , and public investment in high-technology sectors of the economy is to be substantially increased . eager to put behind differences merkel and müntefering also indicated they would try to settle their differences over a welfare reform that has led to steeply rising payments for the jobless rather than lower ones originally intended . the two leaders also agreed on the speedy introduction of a nationwide database containing information about suspected terrorists and vowed to foster the integration of foreigners in german society .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering and merkel have a few differences to overcome in foreign policy , merkel reaffirmed her government 's determination to play a substantial role in peacekeeping efforts in lebanon and said that humanitarian aid would be increased . müntefering said that contrary to public perception the coalition government was working smoothly . " the government has a leadership role in this country , which is a huge responsibility .
all government members , regardless of their party affiliation , are aware of that , and although there may be some quarrels erupting at times everyone is aiming for the best possible results . " nevertheless , angela merkel appears to be eager to prevent a further erosion of the government 's poll ratings which have dropped markedly by more than 10 points since she took office last november .

and he again did so without tact or diplomacy , says dw 's peter philipp . mahmoud ahmadinejad did n't really surprise anyone with what he had to say during a lengthy press conference on tuesday .
two days before the deadline set by the un security council , he strengthened tehran 's resolve not to bow to international pressure and freeze uranium enrichment .
what 's now being regarded in washington and other western capitals as a new affront on tehran 's part is actually the continuation of iran 's previous policy . iran - and not just ahmadinejad - is convinced of its right to conduct nuclear research and use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes .
such a right - including the enrichment of uranium - was committed to by the signatories of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
in iran , it 's seen as impermissible arrogance on the part of the united states that iran should , as the only country in the region , be forbidden from doing what other countries who did n't sign the treaty are doing - countries such as israel , india and pakistan . ahmadi n ejad 's world view ahmadinejad has developed a very particular world view out of the situation - the us and britain are abusing their privileges to make the world bend to their will , and the security council is also run by them .
the iranian president is demanding a radical change of this status quo .
and he is single-mindedly turning himself into the spokesperson for all those in the world who similarly feel themselves to be at the mercy of america 's despotic rule - especially in the islamic world . ahmadinejad is deluding them into thinking that help will come from tehran .
he rather dramatically challenged us president george w. bush to a televised debate about world politics , in which he would explain to the american people where the mistakes of their government lie . this is not just posturing on the part of the iranian president to improve his image in the islamic world .
at home , he is also trying to draw attention away from the fact that he has not made good on many of his election promises . the iranian president seems to be longing for the days of the revolution , when iran believed it could get by without the rest of the world .
in tehran , the realization has long since sunk in that this does n't work .
that does n't mean that the country has to give up its rights ; it just means that it should n't forgo things like tact , diplomacy and manners - things that ahmadinejad always seems to lack . middle east expert peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspo n de n t . -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ahmadinejad claims holocaust invented to embarrass germany iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has told german chancellor angela merkel that the holocaust may have been invented by the victorious allied powers in world war ii to embarrass germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 30.08.2006 opinion : iran lacking in diplomacy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad again voiced defiance as the un security council deadline for iran to halt its nuclear program nears .
and he again did so without tact or diplomacy , says dw 's peter philipp . mahmoud ahmadinejad did n't really surprise anyone with what he had to say during a lengthy press conference on tuesday .
two days before the deadline set by the un security council , he strengthened tehran 's resolve not to bow to international pressure and freeze uranium enrichment .
what 's now being regarded in washington and other western capitals as a new affront on tehran 's part is actually the continuation of iran 's previous policy . iran - and not just ahmadinejad - is convinced of its right to conduct nuclear research and use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes .
such a right - including the enrichment of uranium - was committed to by the signatories of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
in iran , it 's seen as impermissible arrogance on the part of the united states that iran should , as the only country in the region , be forbidden from doing what other countries who did n't sign the treaty are doing - countries such as israel , india and pakistan . ahmadi n ejad 's world view ahmadinejad has developed a very particular world view out of the situation - the us and britain are abusing their privileges to make the world bend to their will , and the security council is also run by them .
the iranian president is demanding a radical change of this status quo .
and he is single-mindedly turning himself into the spokesperson for all those in the world who similarly feel themselves to be at the mercy of america 's despotic rule - especially in the islamic world . ahmadinejad is deluding them into thinking that help will come from tehran .
he rather dramatically challenged us president george w. bush to a televised debate about world politics , in which he would explain to the american people where the mistakes of their government lie . this is not just posturing on the part of the iranian president to improve his image in the islamic world .
at home , he is also trying to draw attention away from the fact that he has not made good on many of his election promises . the iranian president seems to be longing for the days of the revolution , when iran believed it could get by without the rest of the world .
in tehran , the realization has long since sunk in that this does n't work .
that does n't mean that the country has to give up its rights ; it just means that it should n't forgo things like tact , diplomacy and manners - things that ahmadinejad always seems to lack . middle east expert peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspo n de n t . -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ahmadinejad claims holocaust invented to embarrass germany iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has told german chancellor angela merkel that the holocaust may have been invented by the victorious allied powers in world war ii to embarrass germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 30.08.2006 opinion : iran lacking in diplomacy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad again voiced defiance as the un security council deadline for iran to halt its nuclear program nears .
and he again did so without tact or diplomacy , says dw 's peter philipp . mahmoud ahmadinejad did n't really surprise anyone with what he had to say during a lengthy press conference on tuesday .
two days before the deadline set by the un security council , he strengthened tehran 's resolve not to bow to international pressure and freeze uranium enrichment .
what 's now being regarded in washington and other western capitals as a new affront on tehran 's part is actually the continuation of iran 's previous policy . iran - and not just ahmadinejad - is convinced of its right to conduct nuclear research and use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes .
such a right - including the enrichment of uranium - was committed to by the signatories of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
in iran , it 's seen as impermissible arrogance on the part of the united states that iran should , as the only country in the region , be forbidden from doing what other countries who did n't sign the treaty are doing - countries such as israel , india and pakistan . ahmadi n ejad 's world view ahmadinejad has developed a very particular world view out of the situation - the us and britain are abusing their privileges to make the world bend to their will , and the security council is also run by them .
the iranian president is demanding a radical change of this status quo .
and he is single-mindedly turning himself into the spokesperson for all those in the world who similarly feel themselves to be at the mercy of america 's despotic rule - especially in the islamic world . ahmadinejad is deluding them into thinking that help will come from tehran .
he rather dramatically challenged us president george w. bush to a televised debate about world politics , in which he would explain to the american people where the mistakes of their government lie . this is not just posturing on the part of the iranian president to improve his image in the islamic world .
at home , he is also trying to draw attention away from the fact that he has not made good on many of his election promises . the iranian president seems to be longing for the days of the revolution , when iran believed it could get by without the rest of the world .
in tehran , the realization has long since sunk in that this does n't work .
that does n't mean that the country has to give up its rights ; it just means that it should n't forgo things like tact , diplomacy and manners - things that ahmadinejad always seems to lack . middle east expert peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspo n de n t . -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ahmadinejad claims holocaust invented to embarrass germany iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has told german chancellor angela merkel that the holocaust may have been invented by the victorious allied powers in world war ii to embarrass germany .

29 , 2006 -rrb- iran defiant over enrichment , israel as deadline draws near iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad said tuesday it was " unlikely " the un security council would act against iran , with the deadline for tehran to halt its uranium enrichment just two days away .

" i have never had such bewildered reactions from survivors , " said knigge , who called the remarks " a scandal " and suggested that the government no longer takes its responsibility for germany 's nazi legacy seriously . herz , a frenchman who was imprisoned at buchenwald at the age of 14 , called the speech " nationalistic " and an insult to victims of nazi atrocities . parliamentary deputy speaker katrin göring-eckardt of the green party demanded an explanation from the government " to avoid further damage here and abroad . " " no i n te n tio n of relativizi n g victims " amid calls for his resignation tuesday , schäfer apologized for any offense he caused . " i did not know there were concentration camp victims sitting in the front rows , " he told public broadcaster 3sat , referring to the audience at the ceremony .
" i am sorry and apologize for that .
i should have included them more in the speech and was probably obliged to . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the camp was liberated on april 11 , 1945 , by the us army he said he had not included specific references to the nazis ' slaughter of six million jews because he had been asked to speak on the government 's policy on historical remembrance in general .
schäfer added that he had no intention of weighing the suffering of one group of victims against the other . schäfer 's boss , culture minister bernd neumann , expressed his regret in a statement issued tuesday for any offense caused by the speech , but said it was " completely absurd " to assume from it that germany no longer saw the holocaust as an unparalleled crime . " i extremely regret any political misunderstandings and adverse effects to the event caused by my department director 's speech , " he said .
" the nazi dictatorship and the holocaust it caused are unique in their cynically barbarous dimensions .

" i have never had such bewildered reactions from survivors , " said knigge , who called the remarks " a scandal " and suggested that the government no longer takes its responsibility for germany 's nazi legacy seriously . herz , a frenchman who was imprisoned at buchenwald at the age of 14 , called the speech " nationalistic " and an insult to victims of nazi atrocities . parliamentary deputy speaker katrin göring-eckardt of the green party demanded an explanation from the government " to avoid further damage here and abroad . " " no i n te n tio n of relativizi n g victims " amid calls for his resignation tuesday , schäfer apologized for any offense he caused . " i did not know there were concentration camp victims sitting in the front rows , " he told public broadcaster 3sat , referring to the audience at the ceremony .
" i am sorry and apologize for that .
i should have included them more in the speech and was probably obliged to . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the camp was liberated on april 11 , 1945 , by the us army he said he had not included specific references to the nazis ' slaughter of six million jews because he had been asked to speak on the government 's policy on historical remembrance in general .
schäfer added that he had no intention of weighing the suffering of one group of victims against the other . schäfer 's boss , culture minister bernd neumann , expressed his regret in a statement issued tuesday for any offense caused by the speech , but said it was " completely absurd " to assume from it that germany no longer saw the holocaust as an unparalleled crime . " i extremely regret any political misunderstandings and adverse effects to the event caused by my department director 's speech , " he said .
" the nazi dictatorship and the holocaust it caused are unique in their cynically barbarous dimensions . " fax mistake n ly se n t to co n ce n tratio n camps neumann 's office was forced to apologize again tuesday when it was revealed that all former nazi concentration camps received a fax calling on them to hoist the german flag on " home day , " sept .

" erler urged iran to engage in " substantial dialogue " even if the deadline passes without a solution . despite erler 's assertions , many countries have expressed fears that the iranians are not prepared to move from the position voiced defiantly by ahmadinejad on tuesday and that sanctions are unavoidable . a confident ahmadinejad said that sanctions against his country were " unlikely " in a speech which also criticized the united states and britain for using the un security council for their own ends and reiterated the iranian president 's call for israel to be " removed . " iran was presented with a package of trade , technology and security incentives in exchange for a freeze of its uranium enrichment activities in june , but the iranian president effectively rejected the offer , saying that iran had made " exceptional " offers of its own which had been rejected .
his statements increased the likelihood of sanctions being imposed , but the decision to do so is still very much a matter of intense discussion at the un . cou n cil members split over sa n ctio n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council is divided over its response the prospect of sanctions , and possible military action , against iran has led to cracks appearing in the security council members over how to progress in the crisis . russia and china , both major trading partners with iran , have been unwilling to impose sanctions and could frustrate such a move in the security council , while the united states are the most vocal in advocating such measures , along with a less certain britain . " we 've made it very clear that unless we get an unequivocal acceptance of that condition in the security council resolution , that sanctions would follow , " us ambassador to the un john bolton said on tuesday evening . britain 's un ambassador emyr jones parry told reporters that he expected the un security council members plus germany -lrb- p5 + 1 -rrb- would only respond to iran after what he called a " further period of discussion among capitals . " the russian defense minister sergei ivanov only last week said talk of introducing sanctions against iran was " premature . "
there was no response from the russians to ahmadinejad 's speech on tuesday . co n cer n ed europea n s keep dialogue ope n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the europeans fear us military action against iran meanwhile the europeans , including permanent council member france and germany , are fearful that an escalation could lead to us military action against iran 's hard-line regime and have sought to leave the door open to dialogue while urging tehran to comply with the un demands . french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy warned in an interview tuesday that divisions within the international community over iran 's nuclear program would hand a victory to tehran . the international community must not become divided , to cut itself in two , " he said .
" that would be a victory for the iranians . " in his speech tuesday , ahmadinejad also called for a live televised debate with us president george w. bush in which he hoped the two leaders could debate world problems . us rejects preside n tial debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush likes to talk but not to iranians the white house rejected outright the offer of a televised debate . " talk of a debate is just a diversion from the legitimate concerns that the international community , not just the us , has about iran 's behavior , from support to terrorism to pursuit of a nuclear weapons capability , " a senior administration official said , speaking privately .
" the iranian regime knows what it has to do to engage constructively with the international community .
we said we are willing to talk to iran in the context of a positive response to the p5 + 1 package .

all of the systems that are necessary for the astronauts ’ survival in space require electricity . without it , oxygen and clean water supplies would quickly run out , and it would be impossible to keep air pressure and temperature stable inside the station .
less vital but also important are the scientific instruments on board , which require a steady stream of electricity .
the only energy source easily available to the iss is the light from our sun .
that ’ s why the space station carries huge solar arrays for turning sunlight into electricity .
the eight us-made solar panels alone have a surface area of more than two and a half thousand square meters .
at a later date , the russian parts of the station are also due to receive solar arrays .
when the energy system is complete , it will pump out 110 kilowatts .
in everyday terms , that ’ s enough to power 1,100 refrigerators simultaneously .
around half of that available energy will be consumed by the research experiments taking place on board .
as it orbits the earth , however , the iss is not continually in sunlight .
it completes a circuit of the planet every 92 minutes , and 36 of those are spent in its shadow .
to keep the energy supply constant , the space station is also equipped with a set of rechargeable nickel-hydrogen batteries that are able to store energy collected while the panels are exposed to sunlight .
as the iss crosses the night-time side of the planet , the batteries release their stored energy as electricity to keep all of the systems and experiments running smoothly .
the batteries have to be changed every 5 to 6 years .
the station has been engineered to make the replacement easy , because there are no maintenance technicians in space – the astronauts have to do the work themselves .
for that reason among others , 36 battery cells have been packed into a single array in what ’ s called an ‘ orbital replacement unit ’ . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic journey to space more info on thomas reiter 's journey to space the control center the experiments six months in space reiters mission astronaut biography questions for thomas reiter further links construction in space not a great place for a walk never forget your suit unwanted side effects an energy supply in space more power for the iss oil emulsion experiment in space astrolab – the experiments space as a laboratory human body in space supplies for the iss the automated transfer vehicle -lrb- atv -rrb- shuttle : the next generation video : portrait thomas reiter © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 30.08.2006 germany hopes for an alternative to sanctions in iran stand-off großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with un sanctions looming , ahmadinejad was in belligerent mood tuesday iran 's confident dismissal of the un threat of action caused widespread concern in the international community wednesday , while germany maintained that sanctions were far from definite . a day after iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad shrugged off the threat of sanctions ahead of a looming un deadline for iran to halt sensitive atomic work , the international community voiced its concerns that iran 's hard-line stance could escalate the already volatile stand-off . however , while sanctions remain a distinct possibility , germany still believes an alternative solution can be found .
the un security council said tuesday that no action would be taken against iran until later in september if the islamic republic fails to comply with the un resolution .
german deputy foreign minister gernot erler stated that it was germany 's hope that sanctions could be avoided through negotiations between the aug .
31 deadline and the end of september . " i believe that the application for sanctions will not get the approval of russia and china , " erler said in an interview with the fi n a n cial times deutschla n d .
" the united states wants to speed up the sanctions process in the security council but we know what a constraint the refusal of russia and china would be . " erler urged iran to engage in " substantial dialogue " even if the deadline passes without a solution . despite erler 's assertions , many countries have expressed fears that the iranians are not prepared to move from the position voiced defiantly by ahmadinejad on tuesday and that sanctions are unavoidable . a confident ahmadinejad said that sanctions against his country were " unlikely " in a speech which also criticized the united states and britain for using the un security council for their own ends and reiterated the iranian president 's call for israel to be " removed . " iran was presented with a package of trade , technology and security incentives in exchange for a freeze of its uranium enrichment activities in june , but the iranian president effectively rejected the offer , saying that iran had made " exceptional " offers of its own which had been rejected .
his statements increased the likelihood of sanctions being imposed , but the decision to do so is still very much a matter of intense discussion at the un . cou n cil members split over sa n ctio n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council is divided over its response the prospect of sanctions , and possible military action , against iran has led to cracks appearing in the security council members over how to progress in the crisis . russia and china , both major trading partners with iran , have been unwilling to impose sanctions and could frustrate such a move in the security council , while the united states are the most vocal in advocating such measures , along with a less certain britain . " we 've made it very clear that unless we get an unequivocal acceptance of that condition in the security council resolution , that sanctions would follow , " us ambassador to the un john bolton said on tuesday evening . britain 's un ambassador emyr jones parry told reporters that he expected the un security council members plus germany -lrb- p5 + 1 -rrb- would only respond to iran after what he called a " further period of discussion among capitals . " the russian defense minister sergei ivanov only last week said talk of introducing sanctions against iran was " premature . "
there was no response from the russians to ahmadinejad 's speech on tuesday . co n cer n ed europea n s keep dialogue ope n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the europeans fear us military action against iran meanwhile the europeans , including permanent council member france and germany , are fearful that an escalation could lead to us military action against iran 's hard-line regime and have sought to leave the door open to dialogue while urging tehran to comply with the un demands . french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy warned in an interview tuesday that divisions within the international community over iran 's nuclear program would hand a victory to tehran . the international community must not become divided , to cut itself in two , " he said .
" that would be a victory for the iranians . " in his speech tuesday , ahmadinejad also called for a live televised debate with us president george w. bush in which he hoped the two leaders could debate world problems . us rejects preside n tial debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush likes to talk but not to iranians the white house rejected outright the offer of a televised debate . " talk of a debate is just a diversion from the legitimate concerns that the international community , not just the us , has about iran 's behavior , from support to terrorism to pursuit of a nuclear weapons capability , " a senior administration official said , speaking privately .
" the iranian regime knows what it has to do to engage constructively with the international community .
we said we are willing to talk to iran in the context of a positive response to the p5 + 1 package .

all of the systems that are necessary for the astronauts ’ survival in space require electricity . without it , oxygen and clean water supplies would quickly run out , and it would be impossible to keep air pressure and temperature stable inside the station .
less vital but also important are the scientific instruments on board , which require a steady stream of electricity .
the only energy source easily available to the iss is the light from our sun .
that ’ s why the space station carries huge solar arrays for turning sunlight into electricity .
the eight us-made solar panels alone have a surface area of more than two and a half thousand square meters .
at a later date , the russian parts of the station are also due to receive solar arrays .
when the energy system is complete , it will pump out 110 kilowatts .
in everyday terms , that ’ s enough to power 1,100 refrigerators simultaneously .
around half of that available energy will be consumed by the research experiments taking place on board .
as it orbits the earth , however , the iss is not continually in sunlight .
it completes a circuit of the planet every 92 minutes , and 36 of those are spent in its shadow .
to keep the energy supply constant , the space station is also equipped with a set of rechargeable nickel-hydrogen batteries that are able to store energy collected while the panels are exposed to sunlight .
as the iss crosses the night-time side of the planet , the batteries release their stored energy as electricity to keep all of the systems and experiments running smoothly .
the batteries have to be changed every 5 to 6 years .
the station has been engineered to make the replacement easy , because there are no maintenance technicians in space – the astronauts have to do the work themselves .
for that reason among others , 36 battery cells have been packed into a single array in what ’ s called an ‘ orbital replacement unit ’ . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic journey to space more info on thomas reiter 's journey to space the control center the experiments six months in space reiters mission astronaut biography questions for thomas reiter further links construction in space not a great place for a walk never forget your suit unwanted side effects an energy supply in space more power for the iss oil emulsion experiment in space astrolab – the experiments space as a laboratory human body in space supplies for the iss the automated transfer vehicle -lrb- atv -rrb- shuttle : the next generation video : portrait thomas reiter © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

the firm 's book search tool will let people print classics such as dante 's inferno or aesop 's fables , as well as other books no longer under copyright .
until now , the service has only let people read such books on-screen .
google 's book search service stems from a wider project to put books online in a searchable format , which it is undertaking with major universities .
working with google on the books library project are oxford university , harvard , stanford , the university of michigan and the university of california , as well as the new york public library . "
" how many users will find , and then buy , books they never could have discovered any other way ? "
eric schmidt , google q & a : free books and music online volunteers working for a project known as gutenberg have for some years copied out-of-copyright books as text files , which can then be used for printing , reading or piping into a programme for editing .
in contrast , google is offering the books in a " print-ready " format , as have several other - albeit much smaller and less well-known - firms .
online shopping site amazon has offered limited online access to the contents of its huge bookstore .
more services google 's book searching device does not access books still under copyright , for which only bibliographies are available along with limited extracts .
the news comes as the search engine is expanding its empire to offer a wider spectrum of services .
earlier this week , google announced plans to target the software market for companies .
the firm said it would offer companies the chance to run their email , calendar and other services on their own domains , to expand on the service it offers to individuals .
this service puts google , whose focus has been searching and advertising , in direct competition with software giant microsoft .

the british fertility society is recommending women with a body mass index of 36 and over should not be allowed access to fertility treatment .
underweight women and those classed just as obese -lrb- bmi over 29 -rrb- should be forced to address their weight before starting treatment , the society said .
nhs guidelines say overweight women should be warned of the health risks , but do not impose any ban on treatment .
obese women are less likely to get pregnant and more likely to encounter health problems richard kennedy , of the british fertility society q & a : infertility treatment ' too fat for ivf ' being overweight can put both the health of the mother and child at risk through problems such as gestational diabetes and high blood pressure .
in reality , many primary care trusts do not fund women who are obese .
the bfs has published its recommendations in a bid to end the ivf " postcode lottery " .
it wants to standardise treatment so that clinics use the same criteria in relation to age and family status as well as weight .
dietary advice richard kennedy , of the bfs , said : " the nhs is already stopping women who are obese from having fertility treatment .
what would change under the bfs proposals ?
all clinics would operate under the same rules very obese women would not be able to get ivf women over 40 should not be treated couples who have not had children together would be eligible having had private ivf would not stop couples having ivf treatment same sex couples and single women should be treated in the same way as heterosexual couples smokers should not be barred from having ivf ' too fat for ivf ' calculate your bmi " what we are saying is that they should be less stringent and more consistent with how they apply this .
" obese women are less likely to get pregnant and more likely to encounter health problems .
it makes sense to address obesity before seeking fertility treatment . "
the bfs , which represents health fertility professionals , also recommended single women and same sex couples be given the same priority as heterosexual couples .
nhs guidelines say women aged 23 to 39 should be entitled to three cycles of ivf , although the government gave the health service a deadline of april last year to provide one cycle with a view to working towards three .
the society made its recommendations after surveying 64 fertility clinics in england and wales .
it received responses from 37 , showing one in 10 was not providing ivf treatment free on the nhs because they were not being given funding by the local pcts .
none of the clinics was providing three cycles , the poll , which will be published in the human fertility journal in september , said .
clinical factors the poll also showed many of the pcts which did provide ivf treatment were restricting access by taking social factors into account .
have your say the nhs should not fund ivf at all rob berrisford , pontefract send us your comments calculate your bmi these included barring people from treatment if one of the partners already had a child from a previous relationship or because the couple had paid for private treatment before going to the nhs .
and it also revealed a quarter of clinics were also restricting treatment according to age , with most only allowing women in their late 30s to have ivf .
dr gillian lockwood , who chairs the bfs 's ethics committee , told the bbc that " unfairness " was the aspect of the nhs provision which people objected to most .
trying to get rid of the postcode lottery is something that 's influenced treatments for multiple sclerosis and cancer dr gillian lockwood but dr lockwood said there were clinical factors which affected the success of ivf and , as well as weight concerns being over the age of 40 meant that " even very high-tech treatments like ivf are really very unsuccessful " .
she added : " for £ 2,500 , you have at least a 50 % chance of producing a much wanted , beautiful healthy baby - the same cost as stripping varicose veins .
" i think the fourth richest country on earth should be able to afford effective fertility care for its citizens . "
clare brown , chief executive of infertility network uk said : " from our own surveys and from the many , many calls we receive from patients , we know only too well that there are still unacceptable inequalities in the funding of treatment around the country and couples face huge difficulties in accessing services . "
but josephine quintavalle , of the organisation comment on reproductive ethics , told bbc five live limited nhs budgets needed to be focused on treatment for groups which would benefit the most .
" if it 's a proven fact that it 's very difficult to get pregnant when you 're overweight , then the logical cure for that kind of infertility is to encourage the patient to lose weight . "
' in line ' jo webber , deputy director of policy at the nhs confederation which represents over 90 % of nhs organisations , said : " we recognise the distressing circumstances that couples with infertility problems find themselves in .
" however , primary care trusts receive a fixed allocation of money to deliver all the services for their local community and have to take difficult decisions on competing priorities . "
the department of health said that , while it did not support bans being imposed , the current nhs guidelines were broadly in line with the recommendations on obesity .
a spokeswoman added : " primary responsibility for implementing nice guidelines , including the rate of implementation , rests with the nhs at local level and we have made it clear that we expect these guidelines to be followed . "
she said the government was working with patient group infertility network uk to ensure pcts listened to the views of patients .

it received responses from 37 , showing one in 10 was not providing ivf treatment free on the nhs because they were not being given funding by the local pcts .
none of the clinics was providing three cycles , the poll , which will be published in the human fertility journal in september , said .

the department of health said that , while it did not support bans being imposed , the current nhs guidelines were broadly in line with the recommendations on obesity .

business leaders warn that criminals are finding new ways to compromise sensitive information , using malicious software .
unlike the home office in england and wales , the scottish executive does not hold specific figures for online crime .
this has prompting the call for more resources to be urgently diverted into tackling the lucrative activity .

he died in hospital on 30 august after injuring himself in a fall in july .
naguib mahfouz was arguably the greatest arab novelist of the 20th century .
he had something of the status of a national treasure in egypt , where many of his characters became household names .
he was well known too throughout the arab world , partly because so many of his works were turned into films or television dramas .
international acclaim internationally , mahfouz was best known for winning the nobel prize , after which many of his novels were translated into english and other languages .
mahfouz facts 1911 : born in cairo 1934 : graduated in philosophy from cairo university 1959 : al-azhar , one of the most important islamic institutions in the world , bans novel because it includes characters representing god and the prophets 1988 : first and only arab to win nobel prize for literature 1994 : mahfouz stabbed in the neck by islamist militant angered by his work he remains the only arab to have won the prize , and although it brought him great acclaim he never moved out of his modest flat beside the nile in cairo , or stopped his regular trips to cafes for literary discussions .
" to tell you the truth , i 've never lost touch with the new generation of young writers , " mahfouz said .
" so , for example , in my most recent favourite haunt - the qasr al-nil cafe - among the artists , writers and thinkers that used to come to talk to me there , there was n't a single person who was my age or from my generation , even .
they 're young but they 're all bright . "
most of mahfouz 's novels focused on the lives of ordinary egyptians in cairo - his realistic style reaching a peak with the publication in the late 1950s of an immense family saga .
islamist anger after that mahfouz experimented with a more mystical style , sometimes arousing the anger of religious conservatives .
his novel known in english as children of gebelawi was banned in egypt , and he was accused of blasphemy .
in 1994 , mahfouz was attacked outside his home by muslim extremists said to have been incensed by his treatment of religious themes in the book .
he was stabbed in the neck but survived .
the nobel foundation described mahfouz as indefatigable , and , beside his literary achievements , that is how many egyptians will remember him .
what is your reaction to the death of naguib mahfouz ?
your comments : i first heard of mr. naguib mahfouz in 1988 in the news announcing the 1988 nobel prize in literature .
subsequently i searched for his books and purchased every book i ever came across and read with great interest as i was addicted to his books .
i cried after reading many of his books as he so vividly portrayed human sufferings .
he became my best friend in university years and continued to keep me enlightened .
i found an ocean of wisdom in him .
nahid khan , new york , usa i read mr. mahfouz 's works which are translated into english .
they are simply tremendous .
africa lost one of its greatest leaders in the field of literature .
but the undying flames of his works will continue to brighten the path of both african and arabian literature .
hizbawi menghisteab , asmara , eritrea i am very saddened by naguib mahfouz 's death .
it feels like i 've lost a family elder whom i took it for granted to always be there .
i met him a couple of times and have been doing a postgraduate degree on translation and culture issues using his works as an illustration .
i have read his novels and short stories several times .
he will always remain egypt 's most magnificent novelist towering over all others .
may he rest in peace .
youssef taha , london , uk -lrb- originally alexandria , egypt -rrb- for the attentive reader , or even the half-attentive reader , his work illustrates what is common , what is shared , among the peoples of the world , and the essential falsity of the islam-versus-everyone notion currently in vogue .
he was briefly noticed in the west when he won the nobel prize in 1988 , but then our literary media returned to its usual focus on in-crowd booker prize tripe .
but before we forget naguib mahfouz , it should be said that he was a brave , honest and diamond-clear writer , worthy to be ranked with solzhenitsyn , garcia marquez , mishima , gunther grass - make your own list - anyway , the greatest literary names of our age .
he opened the door to a world i did n't know and was thrilled to discover , and he greatly enriched my life .
i wo n't forget him. angus waycott , tokyo , japan it is a tragic and great loss not only to egypt but to literature in general .
through him a whole generation came to love literature .
my condolences go to all his lovers and readers all over the world .
nagui abdalla , cairo - egypt mahfuz was probaly one of the last people believing in liberal humanism even after comprehending its disillusionment in the past century .
aninda rahman , dhaka 1000 , bangladesh i have only known about the work of naguib mahfouz for 2 years .
when i began to study arabic i read palace walk .
earlier this year whilst staying in cairo i saw a very distinguished elderly frail gentleman in a cafe .
i knew he was someone special & later on returning home after viewing photograhs realised it was indeed naguib mahfouz .
i wish i had spoken with him but feel very honoured to have seen him .
what wonderful treasures he has given to us .
christina farrlley , manchester uk naguib mahfouz was an incredible character and a beautiful writer .
his books could transport you effortlessly to another time and place .
a real loss , but i for one will always enjoy reading and re-reading his books !
julie , reading , uk i have never met the man in my life , but i read some of his great works , and they stuck with me and in a way that defined how my generation looks at older generations in egypt .
he portrayed everything in egypt from the 1930s till the 1960s from a common mans ' perspective .
he stood firm in an era of much turmoil and change , and his talent was unmatched in egypt for 70 years .
in a way i feel that his death is a personal loss .
antoine atef , alexandria , egypt i am and deeply saddened by the passing of a great african writer , who happens to be an arab .
he was a truely wise man , who reflected on the human condition in his novels .
like his characters he will live for ever , i am grateful , to have read with relish , the cairo trilogy , the harafish , the journey of ibn fattouma , midaq alley and many more .
these books tell us that we have lost a great man of wisdom .
rest in peace naguib , who fought a great fight daniel osei-kissi , london- -lrb- uk , ghana -rrb- not always did every one of his compatriots agree with his politics , but mahfouz , who in a sense is a father and grandfather of a nation , summed up , in his own life , the struggles of a wider region , and the complex and heart-rending interplay of aspirations and traditions .
undoubtedly , as anyone can attest who has ever read him , he was a master of the written word , or the transcribed voice .
it is difficult to imagine a peer in any language .
it is a sad , sad loss , but is also a moment of renewal for the arab world .
the paths he opened in his books were wide .
let others now follow and fire the arrow even further .
ian douglas , cairo , egypt a great loss - unique in his world , mahfouz ' writings opened up for us the completely unknown world of egyptian family and political life in the early 20th century .
of course i never met him , but if i had ! how many things i would have liked to discuss with him !
catherine hackney , islandmagee , northern ireland to respond to alan 's question , i think that no arabic writers have won the prize after naguib because most writers have been subconsciously silenced by their fears of violence that may be ignited against their work ..
omar houssainy , riyadh , saudi arabia almost alone , he humanised modern egypt .
after reading " sugar street " , the stereotypes go straight out the window and humanity flies in .
my sympathy goes to the readers of egypt .
nic smith , windsor , uk i first read translations of mahfouz 's books while i was travelling through egypt as a student in the spring of 1998 .
besides appreciating his tremendous humanism and compassion for the plight of all creatures on this earth , his words were also a great inspiration to me as a young writer - in another language and culture - proving once more that great art transcends not just time and space , but boundaries of the soul too .
may the universe bless mr naguib in his new life .
zaheer nooruddin , bombay , india indeed , mahfouz was one of the greatest writers of africa .
it is very saddening he is being denoted as an arab novelist for the mere reason that he was writing in arabic .
i consider him an african and became an internationally acclaimed writer for his novels and other works written about africans .
i received the news of his death with great sorrow and sadness .
y. eteffa , addis ababa , ethiopia a calm , wise , secluded , original and creative talent who has lived in his own world , untouched by the chaos egypt has - and still is - going through .
he will be much missed by a nation that is being brainwashed by centuries of invasions , colonialism , and thievery .
mahfouz will live forever , just like a 21st century pyramid of egypt .
tamim abaza , dubai , uae a great man has left us .
it got me wondering - how come more arabic writers have not won the nobel prize for literature ?
alan houston , belfast , northern ireland i had the great pleasure of meeting naguib mahfouz a few years ago , a man of great humility and a talent that should not be underestimated .
he will be sadly missed john wreford , damascus very saddened by the news of his passing .
he was and will remain a giant of enlightenment and free thinking .
god bless .
lubna hadid , london , uk i met mr. neguib mahfouz in cairo during 1984 and was immensely impressed by his meticulous behaviour .
though he was a little hard of hearing he listened to my question with patience and replied in a very firm and authoritative voice .
he told me that he has not travelled abroad because when he wanted to go , circumstances prevented him and now when he can go , his health could not permit him .
he was a marvellous writer but equally great human being .

he died in hospital on 30 august after injuring himself in a fall in july .
naguib mahfouz was arguably the greatest arab novelist of the 20th century .
he had something of the status of a national treasure in egypt , where many of his characters became household names .
he was well known too throughout the arab world , partly because so many of his works were turned into films or television dramas .
international acclaim internationally , mahfouz was best known for winning the nobel prize , after which many of his novels were translated into english and other languages .
mahfouz facts 1911 : born in cairo 1934 : graduated in philosophy from cairo university 1959 : al-azhar , one of the most important islamic institutions in the world , bans novel because it includes characters representing god and the prophets 1988 : first and only arab to win nobel prize for literature 1994 : mahfouz stabbed in the neck by islamist militant angered by his work he remains the only arab to have won the prize , and although it brought him great acclaim he never moved out of his modest flat beside the nile in cairo , or stopped his regular trips to cafes for literary discussions .
" to tell you the truth , i 've never lost touch with the new generation of young writers , " mahfouz said .
" so , for example , in my most recent favourite haunt - the qasr al-nil cafe - among the artists , writers and thinkers that used to come to talk to me there , there was n't a single person who was my age or from my generation , even .
they 're young but they 're all bright . "
most of mahfouz 's novels focused on the lives of ordinary egyptians in cairo - his realistic style reaching a peak with the publication in the late 1950s of an immense family saga .
islamist anger after that mahfouz experimented with a more mystical style , sometimes arousing the anger of religious conservatives .
his novel known in english as children of gebelawi was banned in egypt , and he was accused of blasphemy .
in 1994 , mahfouz was attacked outside his home by muslim extremists said to have been incensed by his treatment of religious themes in the book .
he was stabbed in the neck but survived .
the nobel foundation described mahfouz as indefatigable , and , beside his literary achievements , that is how many egyptians will remember him .

he died in hospital on 30 august after injuring himself in a fall in july .
naguib mahfouz was arguably the greatest arab novelist of the 20th century .
he had something of the status of a national treasure in egypt , where many of his characters became household names .
he was well known too throughout the arab world , partly because so many of his works were turned into films or television dramas .
international acclaim internationally , mahfouz was best known for winning the nobel prize , after which many of his novels were translated into english and other languages .
mahfouz facts 1911 : born in cairo 1934 : graduated in philosophy from cairo university 1959 : al-azhar , one of the most important islamic institutions in the world , bans novel because it includes characters representing god and the prophets 1988 : first and only arab to win nobel prize for literature 1994 : mahfouz stabbed in the neck by islamist militant angered by his work he remains the only arab to have won the prize , and although it brought him great acclaim he never moved out of his modest flat beside the nile in cairo , or stopped his regular trips to cafes for literary discussions .
" to tell you the truth , i 've never lost touch with the new generation of young writers , " mahfouz said .
" so , for example , in my most recent favourite haunt - the qasr al-nil cafe - among the artists , writers and thinkers that used to come to talk to me there , there was n't a single person who was my age or from my generation , even .
they 're young but they 're all bright . "
most of mahfouz 's novels focused on the lives of ordinary egyptians in cairo - his realistic style reaching a peak with the publication in the late 1950s of an immense family saga .
islamist anger after that mahfouz experimented with a more mystical style , sometimes arousing the anger of religious conservatives .
his novel known in english as children of gebelawi was banned in egypt , and he was accused of blasphemy .
in 1994 , mahfouz was attacked outside his home by muslim extremists said to have been incensed by his treatment of religious themes in the book .
he was stabbed in the neck but survived .
the nobel foundation described mahfouz as indefatigable , and , beside his literary achievements , that is how many egyptians will remember him .
what is your reaction to the death of naguib mahfouz ?
your comments : i first heard of mr. naguib mahfouz in 1988 in the news announcing the 1988 nobel prize in literature .
subsequently i searched for his books and purchased every book i ever came across and read with great interest as i was addicted to his books .
i cried after reading many of his books as he so vividly portrayed human sufferings .
he became my best friend in university years and continued to keep me enlightened .
i found an ocean of wisdom in him .
nahid khan , new york , usa i read mr. mahfouz 's works which are translated into english .
they are simply tremendous .
africa lost one of its greatest leaders in the field of literature .
but the undying flames of his works will continue to brighten the path of both african and arabian literature .
hizbawi menghisteab , asmara , eritrea i am very saddened by naguib mahfouz 's death .
it feels like i 've lost a family elder whom i took it for granted to always be there .
i met him a couple of times and have been doing a postgraduate degree on translation and culture issues using his works as an illustration .
i have read his novels and short stories several times .
he will always remain egypt 's most magnificent novelist towering over all others .
may he rest in peace .
youssef taha , london , uk -lrb- originally alexandria , egypt -rrb- for the attentive reader , or even the half-attentive reader , his work illustrates what is common , what is shared , among the peoples of the world , and the essential falsity of the islam-versus-everyone notion currently in vogue .
he was briefly noticed in the west when he won the nobel prize in 1988 , but then our literary media returned to its usual focus on in-crowd booker prize tripe .
but before we forget naguib mahfouz , it should be said that he was a brave , honest and diamond-clear writer , worthy to be ranked with solzhenitsyn , garcia marquez , mishima , gunther grass - make your own list - anyway , the greatest literary names of our age .
he opened the door to a world i did n't know and was thrilled to discover , and he greatly enriched my life .

julie , reading , uk i have never met the man in my life , but i read some of his great works , and they stuck with me and in a way that defined how my generation looks at older generations in egypt .
he portrayed everything in egypt from the 1930s till the 1960s from a common mans ' perspective .

in a way i feel that his death is a personal loss .

rest in peace naguib , who fought a great fight daniel osei-kissi , london- -lrb- uk , ghana -rrb- not always did every one of his compatriots agree with his politics , but mahfouz , who in a sense is a father and grandfather of a nation , summed up , in his own life , the struggles of a wider region , and the complex and heart-rending interplay of aspirations and traditions .
undoubtedly , as anyone can attest who has ever read him , he was a master of the written word , or the transcribed voice .
it is difficult to imagine a peer in any language .

the paths he opened in his books were wide .

the calculation is based on comparing a person 's weight with their body height .
it applies equally to men and women .
you can quickly see the bmi assessment for your body on the chart above .
alternatively , you can calculate your own bmi .
divide your weight in kilograms by the square of your height in metres , or divide your weight in pounds by the square of your height in inches , then multiply by 703 .
you can also use the " what 's your bmi ? " link on the right to have the calculation performed for you .
a bmi of 25 to 29.9 is considered overweight and one of 30 or above is considered obese .
people with bmis between 19 and 22 live longest .
death rates are noticeably higher for people with indexes 25 and above .
the bmi is not infallible .
for instance , it is possible for a healthy , muscular athlete with very low body fat to be classified obese using the bmi formula .
if you are a trained athlete , your weight based on your measured percent body fat would be a better indicator of what you should weigh .

the calculation is based on comparing a person 's weight with their body height .
it applies equally to men and women .
you can quickly see the bmi assessment for your body on the chart above .
alternatively , you can calculate your own bmi .
divide your weight in kilograms by the square of your height in metres , or divide your weight in pounds by the square of your height in inches , then multiply by 703 .
you can also use the " what 's your bmi ? " link on the right to have the calculation performed for you .
a bmi of 25 to 29.9 is considered overweight and one of 30 or above is considered obese .
people with bmis between 19 and 22 live longest .
death rates are noticeably higher for people with indexes 25 and above .
the bmi is not infallible .
for instance , it is possible for a healthy , muscular athlete with very low body fat to be classified obese using the bmi formula .
if you are a trained athlete , your weight based on your measured percent body fat would be a better indicator of what you should weigh .
