that was an obvious attempt at eroding freedom of the press , says dw 's heinz dylong . the role of the german federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- is defined by law : its goal is to collect and process information about foreign countries .
the collected information is then placed at the disposal of the german government .
so far , so good . a certain grey zone emerges in the area of so-called " self-protection " of the bnd .
that 's where the bnd can also be active inside the country .
and it is far into this grey zone that the bnd pushed itself .
in order to find out the source of leaks to the press , the intelligence agency not only spied on journalists , but also used the services of the journalists who investigated their own colleagues and even kept tabs on their private lives . one could play down the whole thing and say that grey zones are simply places in which borders are crossed rather quickly .
but the procedures in this case can not be played down .
the relationship between the press and intelligence agencies in a constitutional state is too sensitive , even conflicting .
while intelligence agencies work secretly , placing the collected information only at the disposal of the government , journalistic research has as its goal to obtain information and offer it for public scrutiny . a prete n ce of self-protectio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : was the bnd purposefully interfering with freedom of the press ?
the issue got even more controversial when the bnd - under the pretense of self-protection - obtained information about the journalistic research which concerned the agency itself , its work or its possible shortcomings .
this is no longer " merely " a border violation .
this is obviously an erosion of press freedom . berlin has now decided to draw initial consequences .
the secret report about the bnd activities should be made public .
additionally , the chancellery now formally stipulated what was actually always obvious : in order to detect leaks within its ranks , the bnd will not be allowed to spy on journalists in the future . until now , operative measures which involved journalists had to be approved by top bnd officials .
this , in turn , created the impression of a certain uneasiness in those cases , which , however , was eventually ignored .
the consequences are now at hand : clarification is necessary about what was approved by which top officials in which cases and for what reason . the government spokesman justified the new directive from the chancellery by saying that freedom of the press is such a supreme good , that the interests of the bnd 's self-protection must be subordinated to it .

now known as the champions league and unrecognisible from the knock-out format of old , the prestige of the competition remains and both barcelona and arsenal traveled to paris with their eyes on the most coveted club prize in european soccer and the legacy that belongs to it .
the winners would be awarded not only the trophy known as " old big ears " but the accolade of being the best team on the continent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who got in expected a spectacle it would be a title justifiably awarded to both teams .
barcelona - with their flair and flow , led by the incredible talents of the brazilian ronaldinho - and arsenal - the aristocrats of english soccer , fronted by one of the most devastating attackers in the history of the game , thierry henry .
two teams capable of rapid attacking soccer and prodigious skill , filled with quality from back to front .
the match was sold as ronaldinho versus henry but neither team are a one-man show .
eto 'o , deco , marquez , cole , ljungberg , pires ...
both sides started the game bursting with stars .
henry presented with two chances to open account but unsurprisingly it was henry who made the first - and second - chance , initially spinning away from rafael marquez in the area after being slipped in by alex hleb only to be thwarted by valdes .
from the corner , henry whipped a vicious low shot at the keeper from distance which valdes palmed away .
the game was barely three minutes old .
the young arsenal team had set their stall out early and were dictating the pace , obviously not in awe of the team they were facing .
barca seemed stunned but only momentarily .
ludo guily was soon testing jens lehmann after ashley cole has slipped on the left .
germany 's numer one comfortably held the rising shot from the frenchman .
it was no shock that arsenal coach arsene wenger had picked out ronaldinho as barca 's main creative threat .
each time the brazilian received the ball he found two gunners stifling his progress .
due to arsenal 's crowding tactics , ronaldinho 's first effort on goal had to come from a free kick in the 15th minute but the distance was too much even for him and the shot flew well wide of lehmann 's goal .
lehmann sees red bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : early bath : lehmann gets his marching orders just when the final looked to be settling down , drama struck in paris .
a ronaldinho slide rule pass put samuel eto 'o through on goal ; lehmann raced off his line and hauled the barca attacker down on the edge of the area .
as the last man , the referee had no choice and the german keeper saw red .
arsenal substituted robert pires for manuel almunia and the new keeper 's first job was to watch ronaldinho 's free kick fly just wide .
in the following minutes , the game looked like it could boil over , swinging from beauty to ugliness in a flash of studs .
eboue scythed down van bronkhurst in a red mist and moments later kolo toure was mugged by edmilson in a revenge attack . bodies started to litter the field and the tempo suffered .
when the game recovered , barca began to dominate .
eto 'o was tormenting eboue at will on the right while guily continued to test cole on the left but despite their dominance , barca could not find a way though arsenal 's famously stingy back line .
defender campbell draws first blood and it was a stalwart from that defensive wall which remarkably broke the deadlock and made the spanish giants pay .
after eboue had been body-checked by carlos puyol on the edge of the barca area , thierry henry floated an inch perfect free kick into the six-yard box where sol campbell rose above the static catalan defense to power a towering header past valdes to put ten-men arsenal in the lead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sol campbell heads the gunners in front barcelona responded in marauding style .
wave after wave of attacks flowed as the clock ticked down to half-time and the catalans almost achieved parity in style when eto 'o spun away from the arsenal defense on the edge of the penalty area .
his shot looked destined for the top corner but almunia got a finger to the ball and tipped it on to the post .
ronaldinho swung a leg at the rebound but the volley had no direction .
the second-half started with barcelona showing more purpose .
two minutes after the restart , deco , a champions league winner with porto in 2004 , rifled a low shot straight at almunia after good work by van bommel on the right .
minutes later , barca substitute andres iniesta rode a flurry of tackles to bear down on the arsenal goal but again almunia was equal to the shot when it came .
barca camped in arsenal half in frantic search for equalizer frustration was beginning to creep into the barca players .
even a centrally located ronaldinho free-kick on the edge of the box was charged down by the arsenal defense .
seconds later , the brazilian tricked his way into the box only for his deft flick to be punched away by almunia .
arsenal were playing a dangerous game ; protecting a one-goal lead against a team full of attacking panache and hoping to hit the catalans on the break .
barca increased their attacking chances by taking off midfielder van bommel and bringing on henrik larsson with half an hour to play .
but the londoners almost got their reward for the risks they were taking .
fabregas robbed guily on the left as barca swarmed forwardand played in henry .
his square ball across the penalty area was hit firmly by hleb but the rushed shot flew wide .
five minutes later , fredi ljungberg should have sealed the match , breaking down the left and into the box before firing his shot high .
valdes touched the ball over but the resulting corner was wasted .
henry then had a great chance to get the goal he so desired when he broke free but his shot was too close to valdes .
seconds later at the other end , ronaldinho also fluffed a great chance , dragging a shot wide of the post from ten meters .
barcelona champions after two goals in three minutes fifteen minutes to go and samuel eto 'o made no such mistake .
a great ball from midfield evaded arsenal 's defense and a clever step-over by larsson allowed the ball to run to the cameroon striker who swept his shot past almunia from close range .
two minutes later and arsenal 's dream to a severe blow .
larsson again was the provider as the swede slipped a delicate reverse ball into the path of second substitute juliano belletti who cracked a shot between almunia 's legs and into the net .
arsenal were spent and had nothing in reserve as time ran out , leaving barca to run the clock down .
it was a cruel end to a brave performance from the londoners but barcelona made the extra man and , in the end , extra class pay .
the final whistle brought ecstatic scenes from the barcelona players and fans leaving the arsenal players crushed .
barcelona were european champions and deservedly so , not just from the performance on the night but for a season during which their beautiful game had lit up the global game .

d 'alema , 57 , will also hold one of two deputy prime ministerial positions along with francesco rutelli , who doubles as culture minister . prodi was formally sworn in as prime minister by president giorgio napolitano ahead of his 25-member cabinet , ushering in a new era in italian politics after his victory in last month 's general elections , which is still being contested by the ousted center-right . the appointment of the 65-year-old technocrat padoa-schioppa as economics minister is likely to be seen by the markets and international financial bodies as a promise of measures to reduce public debt , which mushroomed under the outgoing conservative government of silvio berlusconi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : padoa-schioppa 's presence in the cabinet may reassure the business-minded prodi , a former european commission president , was only able to complete his list after haggling within his nine-party coalition over key posts , which went on until the early hours of wednesday .
the bickering underlines the problems prodi is likely to face in government as he defends a razor-thin parliamentary majority after the closest italian election in living memory . " there is a great desire for a new start combined with a desire for cohesion and unity , " prodi said after announcing his cabinet .
" the first commitment will be to rebuild a spirit of solidarity and a consensus on the goals needed for the country to move forward , and that means lowering the level of tension and litigiousness , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi eventually made way for democrats union for europe -lrb- udeur -rrb- leader mastella his ministerial list featured a surprise choice of clemente mastella , leader of the small catholic udeur party , as justice minister .
mastella , whose party holds three senate seats , had threatened to pull out of the government if he was not handed a key ministry . the government is dominated by the two biggest center-left parties , the democrats of the left and the centrist margherita , while prodi is one of five independents .
it includes one communist , paolo ferrero of the refoundation communist party , who will have responsibility for welfare , and six women - four more than the outgoing center-right government .
alessandro bianchi , who is an independent but is closely associated with the smaller italian communist party , will take charge of transport .
more left-leaning than expected the corriere della sera newspaper said in a front page editorial the new government was more left-leaning than had been anticipated . " a government is born that is weighted to the left , even more than expected by the majority of those who elected it and the natural orientation of the coalition , " it said . the surprise choice of mastella for the justice ministry was an early blow to leftists in the disparate coalition who have pledged wide-ranging social reform , not least the state recognition of same-sex couples - fiercely opposed by pope benedict xvi .

the young arsenal team had set their stall out early and were dictating the pace , obviously not in awe of the team they were facing .
barca seemed stunned but only momentarily .
ludo guily was soon testing jens lehmann after ashley cole has slipped on the left .
germany 's numer one comfortably held the rising shot from the frenchman .
it was no shock that arsenal coach arsene wenger had picked out ronaldinho as barca 's main creative threat .
each time the brazilian received the ball he found two gunners stifling his progress .
due to arsenal 's crowding tactics , ronaldinho 's first effort on goal had to come from a free kick in the 15th minute but the distance was too much even for him and the shot flew well wide of lehmann 's goal .
lehmann sees red bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : early bath : lehmann gets his marching orders just when the final looked to be settling down , drama struck in paris .
a ronaldinho slide rule pass put samuel eto 'o through on goal ; lehmann raced off his line and hauled the barca attacker down on the edge of the area .
as the last man , the referee had no choice and the german keeper saw red .
arsenal substituted robert pires for manuel almunia and the new keeper 's first job was to watch ronaldinho 's free kick fly just wide .
in the following minutes , the game looked like it could boil over , swinging from beauty to ugliness in a flash of studs .
eboue scythed down van bronkhurst in a red mist and moments later kolo toure was mugged by edmilson in a revenge attack . bodies started to litter the field and the tempo suffered .
when the game recovered , barca began to dominate .
eto 'o was tormenting eboue at will on the right while guily continued to test cole on the left but despite their dominance , barca could not find a way though arsenal 's famously stingy back line .
defender campbell draws first blood and it was a stalwart from that defensive wall which remarkably broke the deadlock and made the spanish giants pay .
after eboue had been body-checked by carlos puyol on the edge of the barca area , thierry henry floated an inch perfect free kick into the six-yard box where sol campbell rose above the static catalan defense to power a towering header past valdes to put ten-men arsenal in the lead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sol campbell heads the gunners in front barcelona responded in marauding style .
wave after wave of attacks flowed as the clock ticked down to half-time and the catalans almost achieved parity in style when eto 'o spun away from the arsenal defense on the edge of the penalty area .
his shot looked destined for the top corner but almunia got a finger to the ball and tipped it on to the post .
ronaldinho swung a leg at the rebound but the volley had no direction .
the second-half started with barcelona showing more purpose .
two minutes after the restart , deco , a champions league winner with porto in 2004 , rifled a low shot straight at almunia after good work by van bommel on the right .
minutes later , barca substitute andres iniesta rode a flurry of tackles to bear down on the arsenal goal but again almunia was equal to the shot when it came .
barca camped in arsenal half in frantic search for equalizer frustration was beginning to creep into the barca players .
even a centrally located ronaldinho free-kick on the edge of the box was charged down by the arsenal defense .
seconds later , the brazilian tricked his way into the box only for his deft flick to be punched away by almunia .
arsenal were playing a dangerous game ; protecting a one-goal lead against a team full of attacking panache and hoping to hit the catalans on the break .
barca increased their attacking chances by taking off midfielder van bommel and bringing on henrik larsson with half an hour to play .
but the londoners almost got their reward for the risks they were taking .
fabregas robbed guily on the left as barca swarmed forwardand played in henry .
his square ball across the penalty area was hit firmly by hleb but the rushed shot flew wide .
five minutes later , fredi ljungberg should have sealed the match , breaking down the left and into the box before firing his shot high .
valdes touched the ball over but the resulting corner was wasted .
henry then had a great chance to get the goal he so desired when he broke free but his shot was too close to valdes .
seconds later at the other end , ronaldinho also fluffed a great chance , dragging a shot wide of the post from ten meters .
barcelona champions after two goals in three minutes fifteen minutes to go and samuel eto 'o made no such mistake .
a great ball from midfield evaded arsenal 's defense and a clever step-over by larsson allowed the ball to run to the cameroon striker who swept his shot past almunia from close range .
two minutes later and arsenal 's dream to a severe blow .
larsson again was the provider as the swede slipped a delicate reverse ball into the path of second substitute juliano belletti who cracked a shot between almunia 's legs and into the net .
arsenal were spent and had nothing in reserve as time ran out , leaving barca to run the clock down .
it was a cruel end to a brave performance from the londoners but barcelona made the extra man and , in the end , extra class pay .
the final whistle brought ecstatic scenes from the barcelona players and fans leaving the arsenal players crushed .
barcelona were european champions and deservedly so , not just from the performance on the night but for a season during which their beautiful game had lit up the global game .

the catalans hit two goals in the last 10 minutes to turn a game which was slipping away . fans from london and barcelona had been flooding into the french capital for most of wednesday , many without tickets , for what was billed as the most exciting european cup final in years .
now known as the champions league and unrecognisible from the knock-out format of old , the prestige of the competition remains and both barcelona and arsenal traveled to paris with their eyes on the most coveted club prize in european soccer and the legacy that belongs to it .
the winners would be awarded not only the trophy known as " old big ears " but the accolade of being the best team on the continent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who got in expected a spectacle it would be a title justifiably awarded to both teams .
barcelona - with their flair and flow , led by the incredible talents of the brazilian ronaldinho - and arsenal - the aristocrats of english soccer , fronted by one of the most devastating attackers in the history of the game , thierry henry .
two teams capable of rapid attacking soccer and prodigious skill , filled with quality from back to front .
the match was sold as ronaldinho versus henry but neither team are a one-man show .
eto 'o , deco , marquez , cole , ljungberg , pires ...
both sides started the game bursting with stars .
henry presented with two chances to open account but unsurprisingly it was henry who made the first - and second - chance , initially spinning away from rafael marquez in the area after being slipped in by alex hleb only to be thwarted by valdes .
from the corner , henry whipped a vicious low shot at the keeper from distance which valdes palmed away .
the game was barely three minutes old .
the young arsenal team had set their stall out early and were dictating the pace , obviously not in awe of the team they were facing .

" we 're playing football a la rijkaard , " said the two-time world footballer of the year .
" it 's a game based on open , attacking football .
we 're not copying anyone .
you ca n't really compare us to any other team . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barca 's style is a dream for ronaldinho " it 's a style of football that you dream about playing as a footballer , because we are given complete freedom to attack . " joan laporta , barcelona 's president , was even more effusive .
" the secret of our success is rijkaard , " laporta said .
" he is the ronaldinho of the bench . " insiders expect a flowing , open display barcelona 's former arsenal fullback giovanni van bronckhorst said the similar mentality of the two sides could make for an open contest . " both teams have played really well in the champions league this year and the philosophy of the two sides is the same , as we want to play attractive football and i think both teams have done that , " said van bronckhorst . " so this final will be something of a one-off because normally you have teams that play a bit defensively , but now you will see two teams that like to attack and so it should be a very attractive final . " " a final , though , is only a good one if you win it and we know that we are playing difficult opponents .
they now have the record for clean sheets in the champions league so that is proof of how well they defend . " " we will have to play well to beat them but we will maintain our philosophy no matter what happens . " french connection looking for élan in paris bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arsenal 's run has been a revelation arsenal 's run to their first champions league final has been down to a pragmatic streak that saw wenger opt for an unfamiliar 4-1-4-1 formation . a solid defense and a five-man midfield , with the likes of cesc fabregas , alexander hleb and robert pires streaming through in support of henry , helped account for real madrid , juventus and villarreal in the knockout rounds . wenger believes that his team will be more relaxed now that they have secured their place in europe 's top competition next year , and is certain the gunners can unlock the barcelona back four if they play their natural game . " if we do that , if we have a real go , i am convinced we can win , " said wenger , who nevertheless sounded a note of caution for the millions of fans anticipating a ' champagne ' final . many previous finals had been stifled by the fear of failure , he warned . " it 's difficult to predict .
like many finals , as long as nobody scores it stays quite locked , " wenger said .
" but because of the importance of the competition , once one team scores it will certainly be an open and crazy game . " expectations high as world 's best do battle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barca 's number 10 is up for an attacking game despite wenger 's measured assessment , ronaldinho said he doubted that the arsenal manager would send arsenal into battle with the game plan of trying to frustrate the spaniards . " i like the way wenger 's teams play because it 's attack , " ronaldinho said .
" a strong defense with players in front of them who are technically very strong , and very quick - players who know how to make a difference . " " it 's a final where you can expect to see goals .

d 'alema , 57 , will also hold one of two deputy prime ministerial positions along with francesco rutelli , who doubles as culture minister . prodi was formally sworn in as prime minister by president giorgio napolitano ahead of his 25-member cabinet , ushering in a new era in italian politics after his victory in last month 's general elections , which is still being contested by the ousted center-right . the appointment of the 65-year-old technocrat padoa-schioppa as economics minister is likely to be seen by the markets and international financial bodies as a promise of measures to reduce public debt , which mushroomed under the outgoing conservative government of silvio berlusconi .

the bickering underlines the problems prodi is likely to face in government as he defends a razor-thin parliamentary majority after the closest italian election in living memory . " there is a great desire for a new start combined with a desire for cohesion and unity , " prodi said after announcing his cabinet .

mastella , whose party holds three senate seats , had threatened to pull out of the government if he was not handed a key ministry . the government is dominated by the two biggest center-left parties , the democrats of the left and the centrist margherita , while prodi is one of five independents .
it includes one communist , paolo ferrero of the refoundation communist party , who will have responsibility for welfare , and six women - four more than the outgoing center-right government .
alessandro bianchi , who is an independent but is closely associated with the smaller italian communist party , will take charge of transport .
more left-leaning than expected the corriere della sera newspaper said in a front page editorial the new government was more left-leaning than had been anticipated . " a government is born that is weighted to the left , even more than expected by the majority of those who elected it and the natural orientation of the coalition , " it said . the surprise choice of mastella for the justice ministry was an early blow to leftists in the disparate coalition who have pledged wide-ranging social reform , not least the state recognition of same-sex couples - fiercely opposed by pope benedict xvi .

the catalans hit two goals in the last 10 minutes to turn a game which was slipping away . fans from london and barcelona had been flooding into the french capital for most of wednesday , many without tickets , for what was billed as the most exciting european cup final in years .
now known as the champions league and unrecognisible from the knock-out format of old , the prestige of the competition remains and both barcelona and arsenal traveled to paris with their eyes on the most coveted club prize in european soccer and the legacy that belongs to it .
the winners would be awarded not only the trophy known as " old big ears " but the accolade of being the best team on the continent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who got in expected a spectacle it would be a title justifiably awarded to both teams .
barcelona - with their flair and flow , led by the incredible talents of the brazilian ronaldinho - and arsenal - the aristocrats of english soccer , fronted by one of the most devastating attackers in the history of the game , thierry henry .
two teams capable of rapid attacking soccer and prodigious skill , filled with quality from back to front .
the match was sold as ronaldinho versus henry but neither team are a one-man show .
eto 'o , deco , marquez , cole , ljungberg , pires ...
both sides started the game bursting with stars .
henry presented with two chances to open account but unsurprisingly it was henry who made the first - and second - chance , initially spinning away from rafael marquez in the area after being slipped in by alex hleb only to be thwarted by valdes .
from the corner , henry whipped a vicious low shot at the keeper from distance which valdes palmed away .
the game was barely three minutes old .
the young arsenal team had set their stall out early and were dictating the pace , obviously not in awe of the team they were facing .
barca seemed stunned but only momentarily .
ludo guily was soon testing jens lehmann after ashley cole has slipped on the left .
germany 's numer one comfortably held the rising shot from the frenchman .
it was no shock that arsenal coach arsene wenger had picked out ronaldinho as barca 's main creative threat .
each time the brazilian received the ball he found two gunners stifling his progress .
due to arsenal 's crowding tactics , ronaldinho 's first effort on goal had to come from a free kick in the 15th minute but the distance was too much even for him and the shot flew well wide of lehmann 's goal .
lehmann sees red bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : early bath : lehmann gets his marching orders just when the final looked to be settling down , drama struck in paris .
a ronaldinho slide rule pass put samuel eto 'o through on goal ; lehmann raced off his line and hauled the barca attacker down on the edge of the area .
as the last man , the referee had no choice and the german keeper saw red .
arsenal substituted robert pires for manuel almunia and the new keeper 's first job was to watch ronaldinho 's free kick fly just wide .
in the following minutes , the game looked like it could boil over , swinging from beauty to ugliness in a flash of studs .
eboue scythed down van bronkhurst in a red mist and moments later kolo toure was mugged by edmilson in a revenge attack . bodies started to litter the field and the tempo suffered .
when the game recovered , barca began to dominate .
eto 'o was tormenting eboue at will on the right while guily continued to test cole on the left but despite their dominance , barca could not find a way though arsenal 's famously stingy back line .
defender campbell draws first blood and it was a stalwart from that defensive wall which remarkably broke the deadlock and made the spanish giants pay .
after eboue had been body-checked by carlos puyol on the edge of the barca area , thierry henry floated an inch perfect free kick into the six-yard box where sol campbell rose above the static catalan defense to power a towering header past valdes to put ten-men arsenal in the lead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sol campbell heads the gunners in front barcelona responded in marauding style .
wave after wave of attacks flowed as the clock ticked down to half-time and the catalans almost achieved parity in style when eto 'o spun away from the arsenal defense on the edge of the penalty area .
his shot looked destined for the top corner but almunia got a finger to the ball and tipped it on to the post .
ronaldinho swung a leg at the rebound but the volley had no direction .
the second-half started with barcelona showing more purpose .
two minutes after the restart , deco , a champions league winner with porto in 2004 , rifled a low shot straight at almunia after good work by van bommel on the right .
minutes later , barca substitute andres iniesta rode a flurry of tackles to bear down on the arsenal goal but again almunia was equal to the shot when it came .
barca camped in arsenal half in frantic search for equalizer frustration was beginning to creep into the barca players .
even a centrally located ronaldinho free-kick on the edge of the box was charged down by the arsenal defense .
seconds later , the brazilian tricked his way into the box only for his deft flick to be punched away by almunia .
arsenal were playing a dangerous game ; protecting a one-goal lead against a team full of attacking panache and hoping to hit the catalans on the break .
barca increased their attacking chances by taking off midfielder van bommel and bringing on henrik larsson with half an hour to play .
but the londoners almost got their reward for the risks they were taking .
fabregas robbed guily on the left as barca swarmed forwardand played in henry .
his square ball across the penalty area was hit firmly by hleb but the rushed shot flew wide .
five minutes later , fredi ljungberg should have sealed the match , breaking down the left and into the box before firing his shot high .
valdes touched the ball over but the resulting corner was wasted .
henry then had a great chance to get the goal he so desired when he broke free but his shot was too close to valdes .
seconds later at the other end , ronaldinho also fluffed a great chance , dragging a shot wide of the post from ten meters .
barcelona champions after two goals in three minutes fifteen minutes to go and samuel eto 'o made no such mistake .
a great ball from midfield evaded arsenal 's defense and a clever step-over by larsson allowed the ball to run to the cameroon striker who swept his shot past almunia from close range .
two minutes later and arsenal 's dream to a severe blow .
larsson again was the provider as the swede slipped a delicate reverse ball into the path of second substitute juliano belletti who cracked a shot between almunia 's legs and into the net .
arsenal were spent and had nothing in reserve as time ran out , leaving barca to run the clock down .
it was a cruel end to a brave performance from the londoners but barcelona made the extra man and , in the end , extra class pay .
the final whistle brought ecstatic scenes from the barcelona players and fans leaving the arsenal players crushed .
barcelona were european champions and deservedly so , not just from the performance on the night but for a season during which their beautiful game had lit up the global game .

" we 're playing football a la rijkaard , " said the two-time world footballer of the year .
" it 's a game based on open , attacking football .
we 're not copying anyone .
you ca n't really compare us to any other team . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barca 's style is a dream for ronaldinho " it 's a style of football that you dream about playing as a footballer , because we are given complete freedom to attack . " joan laporta , barcelona 's president , was even more effusive .
" the secret of our success is rijkaard , " laporta said .
" he is the ronaldinho of the bench . " insiders expect a flowing , open display barcelona 's former arsenal fullback giovanni van bronckhorst said the similar mentality of the two sides could make for an open contest . " both teams have played really well in the champions league this year and the philosophy of the two sides is the same , as we want to play attractive football and i think both teams have done that , " said van bronckhorst . " so this final will be something of a one-off because normally you have teams that play a bit defensively , but now you will see two teams that like to attack and so it should be a very attractive final . " " a final , though , is only a good one if you win it and we know that we are playing difficult opponents .
they now have the record for clean sheets in the champions league so that is proof of how well they defend . " " we will have to play well to beat them but we will maintain our philosophy no matter what happens . " french connection looking for élan in paris bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arsenal 's run has been a revelation arsenal 's run to their first champions league final has been down to a pragmatic streak that saw wenger opt for an unfamiliar 4-1-4-1 formation . a solid defense and a five-man midfield , with the likes of cesc fabregas , alexander hleb and robert pires streaming through in support of henry , helped account for real madrid , juventus and villarreal in the knockout rounds . wenger believes that his team will be more relaxed now that they have secured their place in europe 's top competition next year , and is certain the gunners can unlock the barcelona back four if they play their natural game . " if we do that , if we have a real go , i am convinced we can win , " said wenger , who nevertheless sounded a note of caution for the millions of fans anticipating a ' champagne ' final . many previous finals had been stifled by the fear of failure , he warned . " it 's difficult to predict .
like many finals , as long as nobody scores it stays quite locked , " wenger said .
" but because of the importance of the competition , once one team scores it will certainly be an open and crazy game . " expectations high as world 's best do battle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barca 's number 10 is up for an attacking game despite wenger 's measured assessment , ronaldinho said he doubted that the arsenal manager would send arsenal into battle with the game plan of trying to frustrate the spaniards . " i like the way wenger 's teams play because it 's attack , " ronaldinho said .
" a strong defense with players in front of them who are technically very strong , and very quick - players who know how to make a difference . " " it 's a final where you can expect to see goals .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.05.2006 prodi overcomes infighting to name new italian government großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi heads up italy 's 61st postwar government italy 's newly elected prime minister , romano prodi , unveiled his center-left government wednesday , ending weeks of political stalemate and pledging to rebuild solidarity and consensus after bitterly divisive elections . as expected , it features former prime minister massimo d 'alema as foreign minister and former european central bank board member tomasso padoa-schioppa as economics minister .
d 'alema , 57 , will also hold one of two deputy prime ministerial positions along with francesco rutelli , who doubles as culture minister . prodi was formally sworn in as prime minister by president giorgio napolitano ahead of his 25-member cabinet , ushering in a new era in italian politics after his victory in last month 's general elections , which is still being contested by the ousted center-right . the appointment of the 65-year-old technocrat padoa-schioppa as economics minister is likely to be seen by the markets and international financial bodies as a promise of measures to reduce public debt , which mushroomed under the outgoing conservative government of silvio berlusconi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : padoa-schioppa 's presence in the cabinet may reassure the business-minded prodi , a former european commission president , was only able to complete his list after haggling within his nine-party coalition over key posts , which went on until the early hours of wednesday .
the bickering underlines the problems prodi is likely to face in government as he defends a razor-thin parliamentary majority after the closest italian election in living memory . " there is a great desire for a new start combined with a desire for cohesion and unity , " prodi said after announcing his cabinet .
" the first commitment will be to rebuild a spirit of solidarity and a consensus on the goals needed for the country to move forward , and that means lowering the level of tension and litigiousness , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi eventually made way for democrats union for europe -lrb- udeur -rrb- leader mastella his ministerial list featured a surprise choice of clemente mastella , leader of the small catholic udeur party , as justice minister .
mastella , whose party holds three senate seats , had threatened to pull out of the government if he was not handed a key ministry . the government is dominated by the two biggest center-left parties , the democrats of the left and the centrist margherita , while prodi is one of five independents .
it includes one communist , paolo ferrero of the refoundation communist party , who will have responsibility for welfare , and six women - four more than the outgoing center-right government .
alessandro bianchi , who is an independent but is closely associated with the smaller italian communist party , will take charge of transport .
more left-leaning than expected the corriere della sera newspaper said in a front page editorial the new government was more left-leaning than had been anticipated . " a government is born that is weighted to the left , even more than expected by the majority of those who elected it and the natural orientation of the coalition , " it said . the surprise choice of mastella for the justice ministry was an early blow to leftists in the disparate coalition who have pledged wide-ranging social reform , not least the state recognition of same-sex couples - fiercely opposed by pope benedict xvi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amato will take charge of the interior ministry former anti-corruption judge antonio di pietro , who led the " clean hands " investigation into the links between big business and politics a decade ago , has been handed the infrastructure portfolio .
giuliano amato , former vice chairman of the european convention , which wrote the european union 's stalled constitution , will be interior minister in the new government . prodi said he would go before the senate with a confidence motion on thursday .
a vote in senate , where he holds a two-seat majority , is likely on friday .

experts are meeting in vienna this week to tackle the issue .
but is the european response to the challenge of floods sufficient ? disastrous flooding is hitting europe on a regular basis .
this spring once again , swelling rivers in central europe displaced thousands of people . " catastrophic floods endanger lives and are likely to cause human tragedy , as well as heavy economic losses , " stavros dimas , the european commissioner for the environment , said in a statement . experts are meeting in vienna this week for the european conference on flood risk management , which kicks off on wednesday .
they will be discussing various flood strategies and outlining suitable risk management based on experiences of recent floods . according to the european commission , europe suffered over 100 major damaging floods between 1998 and 2004 , including the catastrophic floods along the danube and elbe rivers in the summer of 2002 .
since 1998 , floods in europe have caused some 700 deaths and about half a million people have been forced to leave their homes .
the bill ?
at least 25 billion euros -lrb- $ 32 billion -rrb- in insured economic losses , the commission said . shari n g the burde n across europe a major problem in flood management , though , is that most of europe 's river basins , such as the elbe and danube , are shared by more than one country . " in the case of international river basins , steps must be coordinated between the member states concerned to prevent problems being passed from one area to another , " said sergey moroz from the conservation organization wwf 's european policy office in brussels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden 's famous zwinger palace was severely damaged in the 2002 floods officials at the german environmental protection non-governmental organization bund said too many countries and regions were just looking out for their own interests . " international coordination is very important , " said christian schweer from bund 's water policy unit .
" the sectionalism in europe has to stop . " cross-border cooperation is a major element of the european commission 's flood action program to improve damage prevention and reduction across member states . " this new directive will help member states choose the right tools with which to reduce the likelihood of floods and limit their impacts , " environment commissioner dimas said .
" in particular , it aims to ensure that member states cooperate in shared river basins and coastal areas to improve flood protection all over europe . " e n viro n me n tal factors must be part of floodi n g solutio n s the commission said europe is likely to see a higher flood risk and greater economic damage in the future .
climate change is expected to increase the scale and frequency of floods , it said . " floods have always existed , but in recent years , they became disasters because of human mismanagement of rivers , floodplains and catchments and inadequate land use , " moroz said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : urban development has come too close to rivers according to schweer , 80 percent of the original floodplains along the elbe and rhine rivers , for example , have been lost due to urban development and agricultural use .
" flood protection can not exclude environmental concerns , " schweer said . although the commission program does not explicitly name ecological flood control measures , the european parliament 's environment committee has put clear environmental objectives in its proposal for the directive . " it is important that rivers be given more room , " schweer said . member states will assess a n d ma n age floods the new directive proposed earlier this year builds on the eu water framework directive -lrb- wfd -rrb- , the cornerstone of the eu water protection policy . it will require member states to carry out preliminary assessments of their river basins and associated coastal areas at risk of flooding .
where flood damage risks exist , member states will develop flood risk maps . finally , flood risk management plans must be drawn up for these zones .
these are to include measures to reduce the probability of flooding and its potential consequences , such as prevention , protection , early warning , emergency response and recovery . " the current proposal is a step in the right direction , " moroz said .
" it coordinates flood management with ecological water management as required under the wfd and has the potential to mark the beginning of a new and transparent flood management approach . " bildunterschrift : even sand bags could n't hold up the water but he said a further challenge will be striking the right balance with respect to the eu solidarity funds , an instrument set up after the catastrophic floods in europe in the summer of 2002 .
it covers reconstruction after flooding events , plus other major catastrophes . " eu financial support has to ensure long-term solutions to resolve the inadequate land use and water management policies that have contributed to these catastrophic flood events , " moroz said .
rebuilding existing dikes or making them higher would only worsen the situation , he said . " hence , we call on the european commission to make sure its money does not contribute to aggravating existing problems , " moroz said . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de swelling rivers force hundreds to flee in central europe rising floodwaters this spring forced thousands in central europe to leave their homes .

the mission 's mandate is expected to start on june 30 , currently foreseen as voting day , and to be limited to four months . " we have an interest in congo endorsing peaceful , democratic development , " defense minister franz josef jung said after announcing the decision wednesday morning . the bundestag will begin debating the controversial deployment on friday and is expected to vote on it on june 1 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agreed on deployment : foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier -lrb- l . -rrb- and defense minister jung jung 's announcement was followed by sharp criticism from opposition party politician wolfgang gerhardt of the free-market liberal free democratic party , who called it one of the worst prepared missions he had ever experienced . " we ca n't just engage everywhere like with a small fire department , " he told german public broadcaster ard .
for once , a mission should be planned that resulted in a political solution , he added . the left party 's parliamentary group has already made clear it would oppose the deployment .
the green party has called for the mission 's mandate to be expanded . critics say that too little information is available to decide to deploy a mission and that is unclear why germany should be involved at all . germa n y to lead germany will assume the overall command of the roughly 1,500-strong mission , which will be made up mostly of german and french troops with smaller contingents from 16 other countries .
the soldiers will be sent to support the 17,000 united nations peacekeepers deployed mainly in the country 's east to ensure calm during and after the election .

alternatives to gas are rare and biodiesel from rapeseed , for example , has n't caught on .
but there 's hope .
a saxon firm has found a way to make fuel out of biomass . fuel is simply chemically converted solar energy .
through the photosynthesis in plants , sunlight can be converted into fossil energy , such as coal and oil . it 's a principle which a resourceful tinkerer in saxony thought must be easy to copy .
in 1990 , it was still a vision .
today , the company choren in the saxon town of freiberg actually produces synthetic fuel from biomass , or plants of all kind . " the biomass goes into a multiple-stage gasification process , which undergoes the various chemical processes until it is a high-purity synthesized gas , " said managing director carlhans uhle .
" this gas in turn is converted into diesel through several processes . " choren calls its product sundiesel .
the technical term is biomass to liquids , or btl .
four kilograms of biomass , for example wood , become one liter of diesel .
but while fossil fuels developed over a period of some 400 million years , this process only takes 400 minutes in freiberg . " if you also consider the time it takes the plants to grow , then it 's around 400 days , " uhle said . a closed e n ergy cycle choren obtains the raw material for production from local farmers , saxon 's state forestry and sawmills .
since it does n't just use the plant fruit , but rather the entire plant , the output per hectare of cultivable land in btl in comparison to normal biodiesel is three to four times higher . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this " sundiesel-beetle " runs on choren 's fuel " we can take any biomass we want to , " uhle said .
" nothing negative is left over , except for a bit of slag , which can be used to tar floors .
we are a closed energy cycle . "
in view of the ongoing climate debate , this aspect was particularly important . when this fuel is burned , it releases only as much carbon dioxide previously absorbed by the plants produced for this purpose .
the fuel also contains no sooty particles and can be filled into any diesel engine without re-fitting . biomass fuel ca n be competitive sundiesel is still in the testing phase .
only a few hundred liters are produced daily .
but large automobile producers , such as daimlerchrysler and volkswagen , and the energy giant shell are already on board .
together with choren , they are building a commercial facility , which will take up operations in the coming year and produce 250 million liters -lrb- 66 million gallons -rrb- annually .
four further facilities are planned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plant-based biodiesel has n't caught on " our technicians ' forecasts say that we are at a stage with the large scale plant to be competitive , " uhle said .
" of course , it always depends on the oil price and the dollar . " with the current high oil prices , the fuel will definitely be competitive with the construction of the third facility in 2012 or 2013 - and that without further subsidies . a liter of sundiesel still costs double that of diesel from petroleum .
the production costs are high and each new plant requires 400 million euros -lrb- $ 515.8 million -rrb- in investments .
still , btl is sparking interest worldwide ; choren has had inquiries from all over europe , the united states and china . sabine kinkartz -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german drivers angry over easter gas price hike drivers in germany are becoming increasingly angry about rising prices for gasoline which have seen a new record for this year - just in time for the easter holidays .

alternatives to gas are rare and biodiesel from rapeseed , for example , has n't caught on .
but there 's hope .
a saxon firm has found a way to make fuel out of biomass . fuel is simply chemically converted solar energy .
through the photosynthesis in plants , sunlight can be converted into fossil energy , such as coal and oil . it 's a principle which a resourceful tinkerer in saxony thought must be easy to copy .
in 1990 , it was still a vision .
today , the company choren in the saxon town of freiberg actually produces synthetic fuel from biomass , or plants of all kind . " the biomass goes into a multiple-stage gasification process , which undergoes the various chemical processes until it is a high-purity synthesized gas , " said managing director carlhans uhle .
" this gas in turn is converted into diesel through several processes . " choren calls its product sundiesel .
the technical term is biomass to liquids , or btl .
four kilograms of biomass , for example wood , become one liter of diesel .
but while fossil fuels developed over a period of some 400 million years , this process only takes 400 minutes in freiberg . " if you also consider the time it takes the plants to grow , then it 's around 400 days , " uhle said . a closed e n ergy cycle choren obtains the raw material for production from local farmers , saxon 's state forestry and sawmills .
since it does n't just use the plant fruit , but rather the entire plant , the output per hectare of cultivable land in btl in comparison to normal biodiesel is three to four times higher . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this " sundiesel-beetle " runs on choren 's fuel " we can take any biomass we want to , " uhle said .
" nothing negative is left over , except for a bit of slag , which can be used to tar floors .
we are a closed energy cycle . "
in view of the ongoing climate debate , this aspect was particularly important . when this fuel is burned , it releases only as much carbon dioxide previously absorbed by the plants produced for this purpose .
the fuel also contains no sooty particles and can be filled into any diesel engine without re-fitting . biomass fuel ca n be competitive sundiesel is still in the testing phase .
only a few hundred liters are produced daily .
but large automobile producers , such as daimlerchrysler and volkswagen , and the energy giant shell are already on board .
together with choren , they are building a commercial facility , which will take up operations in the coming year and produce 250 million liters -lrb- 66 million gallons -rrb- annually .
four further facilities are planned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plant-based biodiesel has n't caught on " our technicians ' forecasts say that we are at a stage with the large scale plant to be competitive , " uhle said .

that was an obvious attempt at eroding freedom of the press , says dw 's heinz dylong . the role of the german federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- is defined by law : its goal is to collect and process information about foreign countries .
the collected information is then placed at the disposal of the german government .
so far , so good . a certain grey zone emerges in the area of so-called " self-protection " of the bnd .
that 's where the bnd can also be active inside the country .
and it is far into this grey zone that the bnd pushed itself .
in order to find out the source of leaks to the press , the intelligence agency not only spied on journalists , but also used the services of the journalists who investigated their own colleagues and even kept tabs on their private lives . one could play down the whole thing and say that grey zones are simply places in which borders are crossed rather quickly .
but the procedures in this case can not be played down .
the relationship between the press and intelligence agencies in a constitutional state is too sensitive , even conflicting .

the issue got even more controversial when the bnd - under the pretense of self-protection - obtained information about the journalistic research which concerned the agency itself , its work or its possible shortcomings .
this is no longer " merely " a border violation .
this is obviously an erosion of press freedom . berlin has now decided to draw initial consequences .
the secret report about the bnd activities should be made public .
additionally , the chancellery now formally stipulated what was actually always obvious : in order to detect leaks within its ranks , the bnd will not be allowed to spy on journalists in the future . until now , operative measures which involved journalists had to be approved by top bnd officials .

experts are meeting in vienna this week to tackle the issue .
but is the european response to the challenge of floods sufficient ? disastrous flooding is hitting europe on a regular basis .
this spring once again , swelling rivers in central europe displaced thousands of people . " catastrophic floods endanger lives and are likely to cause human tragedy , as well as heavy economic losses , " stavros dimas , the european commissioner for the environment , said in a statement . experts are meeting in vienna this week for the european conference on flood risk management , which kicks off on wednesday .
they will be discussing various flood strategies and outlining suitable risk management based on experiences of recent floods . according to the european commission , europe suffered over 100 major damaging floods between 1998 and 2004 , including the catastrophic floods along the danube and elbe rivers in the summer of 2002 .
since 1998 , floods in europe have caused some 700 deaths and about half a million people have been forced to leave their homes .

" in the case of international river basins , steps must be coordinated between the member states concerned to prevent problems being passed from one area to another , " said sergey moroz from the conservation organization wwf 's european policy office in brussels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden 's famous zwinger palace was severely damaged in the 2002 floods officials at the german environmental protection non-governmental organization bund said too many countries and regions were just looking out for their own interests . " international coordination is very important , " said christian schweer from bund 's water policy unit .
" the sectionalism in europe has to stop . " cross-border cooperation is a major element of the european commission 's flood action program to improve damage prevention and reduction across member states . " this new directive will help member states choose the right tools with which to reduce the likelihood of floods and limit their impacts , " environment commissioner dimas said .
" in particular , it aims to ensure that member states cooperate in shared river basins and coastal areas to improve flood protection all over europe . " e n viro n me n tal factors must be part of floodi n g solutio n s the commission said europe is likely to see a higher flood risk and greater economic damage in the future .
climate change is expected to increase the scale and frequency of floods , it said . " floods have always existed , but in recent years , they became disasters because of human mismanagement of rivers , floodplains and catchments and inadequate land use , " moroz said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : urban development has come too close to rivers according to schweer , 80 percent of the original floodplains along the elbe and rhine rivers , for example , have been lost due to urban development and agricultural use .
" flood protection can not exclude environmental concerns , " schweer said . although the commission program does not explicitly name ecological flood control measures , the european parliament 's environment committee has put clear environmental objectives in its proposal for the directive . " it is important that rivers be given more room , " schweer said . member states will assess a n d ma n age floods the new directive proposed earlier this year builds on the eu water framework directive -lrb- wfd -rrb- , the cornerstone of the eu water protection policy . it will require member states to carry out preliminary assessments of their river basins and associated coastal areas at risk of flooding .
where flood damage risks exist , member states will develop flood risk maps . finally , flood risk management plans must be drawn up for these zones .
these are to include measures to reduce the probability of flooding and its potential consequences , such as prevention , protection , early warning , emergency response and recovery . " the current proposal is a step in the right direction , " moroz said .
" it coordinates flood management with ecological water management as required under the wfd and has the potential to mark the beginning of a new and transparent flood management approach . " bildunterschrift : even sand bags could n't hold up the water but he said a further challenge will be striking the right balance with respect to the eu solidarity funds , an instrument set up after the catastrophic floods in europe in the summer of 2002 .
it covers reconstruction after flooding events , plus other major catastrophes . " eu financial support has to ensure long-term solutions to resolve the inadequate land use and water management policies that have contributed to these catastrophic flood events , " moroz said .
rebuilding existing dikes or making them higher would only worsen the situation , he said . " hence , we call on the european commission to make sure its money does not contribute to aggravating existing problems , " moroz said . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de swelling rivers force hundreds to flee in central europe rising floodwaters this spring forced thousands in central europe to leave their homes .

alternatives to gas are rare and biodiesel from rapeseed , for example , has n't caught on .
but there 's hope .
a saxon firm has found a way to make fuel out of biomass . fuel is simply chemically converted solar energy .
through the photosynthesis in plants , sunlight can be converted into fossil energy , such as coal and oil . it 's a principle which a resourceful tinkerer in saxony thought must be easy to copy .
in 1990 , it was still a vision .
today , the company choren in the saxon town of freiberg actually produces synthetic fuel from biomass , or plants of all kind . " the biomass goes into a multiple-stage gasification process , which undergoes the various chemical processes until it is a high-purity synthesized gas , " said managing director carlhans uhle .
" this gas in turn is converted into diesel through several processes . " choren calls its product sundiesel .
the technical term is biomass to liquids , or btl .
four kilograms of biomass , for example wood , become one liter of diesel .
but while fossil fuels developed over a period of some 400 million years , this process only takes 400 minutes in freiberg . " if you also consider the time it takes the plants to grow , then it 's around 400 days , " uhle said . a closed e n ergy cycle choren obtains the raw material for production from local farmers , saxon 's state forestry and sawmills .
since it does n't just use the plant fruit , but rather the entire plant , the output per hectare of cultivable land in btl in comparison to normal biodiesel is three to four times higher . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this " sundiesel-beetle " runs on choren 's fuel " we can take any biomass we want to , " uhle said .
" nothing negative is left over , except for a bit of slag , which can be used to tar floors .
we are a closed energy cycle . "
in view of the ongoing climate debate , this aspect was particularly important . when this fuel is burned , it releases only as much carbon dioxide previously absorbed by the plants produced for this purpose .
the fuel also contains no sooty particles and can be filled into any diesel engine without re-fitting . biomass fuel ca n be competitive sundiesel is still in the testing phase .
only a few hundred liters are produced daily .
but large automobile producers , such as daimlerchrysler and volkswagen , and the energy giant shell are already on board .
together with choren , they are building a commercial facility , which will take up operations in the coming year and produce 250 million liters -lrb- 66 million gallons -rrb- annually .
four further facilities are planned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plant-based biodiesel has n't caught on " our technicians ' forecasts say that we are at a stage with the large scale plant to be competitive , " uhle said .
" of course , it always depends on the oil price and the dollar . " with the current high oil prices , the fuel will definitely be competitive with the construction of the third facility in 2012 or 2013 - and that without further subsidies . a liter of sundiesel still costs double that of diesel from petroleum .
the production costs are high and each new plant requires 400 million euros -lrb- $ 515.8 million -rrb- in investments .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.05.2006 barca capture europe 's greatest soccer prize in paris thriller großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barcelona 's carles puyol lifts the trophy after his team beat arsenal barcelona beat arsenal 2-1 to win the 2006 champions league final in a classic in the stade de france on wednesday night .
the catalans hit two goals in the last 10 minutes to turn a game which was slipping away . fans from london and barcelona had been flooding into the french capital for most of wednesday , many without tickets , for what was billed as the most exciting european cup final in years .
now known as the champions league and unrecognisible from the knock-out format of old , the prestige of the competition remains and both barcelona and arsenal traveled to paris with their eyes on the most coveted club prize in european soccer and the legacy that belongs to it .
the winners would be awarded not only the trophy known as " old big ears " but the accolade of being the best team on the continent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who got in expected a spectacle it would be a title justifiably awarded to both teams .
barcelona - with their flair and flow , led by the incredible talents of the brazilian ronaldinho - and arsenal - the aristocrats of english soccer , fronted by one of the most devastating attackers in the history of the game , thierry henry .
two teams capable of rapid attacking soccer and prodigious skill , filled with quality from back to front .
the match was sold as ronaldinho versus henry but neither team are a one-man show .
eto 'o , deco , marquez , cole , ljungberg , pires ...
both sides started the game bursting with stars .
henry presented with two chances to open account but unsurprisingly it was henry who made the first - and second - chance , initially spinning away from rafael marquez in the area after being slipped in by alex hleb only to be thwarted by valdes .
from the corner , henry whipped a vicious low shot at the keeper from distance which valdes palmed away .
the game was barely three minutes old .
the young arsenal team had set their stall out early and were dictating the pace , obviously not in awe of the team they were facing .
barca seemed stunned but only momentarily .
ludo guily was soon testing jens lehmann after ashley cole has slipped on the left .
germany 's numer one comfortably held the rising shot from the frenchman .
it was no shock that arsenal coach arsene wenger had picked out ronaldinho as barca 's main creative threat .
each time the brazilian received the ball he found two gunners stifling his progress .
due to arsenal 's crowding tactics , ronaldinho 's first effort on goal had to come from a free kick in the 15th minute but the distance was too much even for him and the shot flew well wide of lehmann 's goal .
lehmann sees red bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : early bath : lehmann gets his marching orders just when the final looked to be settling down , drama struck in paris .
a ronaldinho slide rule pass put samuel eto 'o through on goal ; lehmann raced off his line and hauled the barca attacker down on the edge of the area .
as the last man , the referee had no choice and the german keeper saw red .
arsenal substituted robert pires for manuel almunia and the new keeper 's first job was to watch ronaldinho 's free kick fly just wide .
in the following minutes , the game looked like it could boil over , swinging from beauty to ugliness in a flash of studs .
eboue scythed down van bronkhurst in a red mist and moments later kolo toure was mugged by edmilson in a revenge attack . bodies started to litter the field and the tempo suffered .
when the game recovered , barca began to dominate .
eto 'o was tormenting eboue at will on the right while guily continued to test cole on the left but despite their dominance , barca could not find a way though arsenal 's famously stingy back line .
defender campbell draws first blood and it was a stalwart from that defensive wall which remarkably broke the deadlock and made the spanish giants pay .
after eboue had been body-checked by carlos puyol on the edge of the barca area , thierry henry floated an inch perfect free kick into the six-yard box where sol campbell rose above the static catalan defense to power a towering header past valdes to put ten-men arsenal in the lead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sol campbell heads the gunners in front barcelona responded in marauding style .
wave after wave of attacks flowed as the clock ticked down to half-time and the catalans almost achieved parity in style when eto 'o spun away from the arsenal defense on the edge of the penalty area .
his shot looked destined for the top corner but almunia got a finger to the ball and tipped it on to the post .
ronaldinho swung a leg at the rebound but the volley had no direction .
the second-half started with barcelona showing more purpose .
two minutes after the restart , deco , a champions league winner with porto in 2004 , rifled a low shot straight at almunia after good work by van bommel on the right .
minutes later , barca substitute andres iniesta rode a flurry of tackles to bear down on the arsenal goal but again almunia was equal to the shot when it came .
barca camped in arsenal half in frantic search for equalizer frustration was beginning to creep into the barca players .
even a centrally located ronaldinho free-kick on the edge of the box was charged down by the arsenal defense .
seconds later , the brazilian tricked his way into the box only for his deft flick to be punched away by almunia .
arsenal were playing a dangerous game ; protecting a one-goal lead against a team full of attacking panache and hoping to hit the catalans on the break .
barca increased their attacking chances by taking off midfielder van bommel and bringing on henrik larsson with half an hour to play .
but the londoners almost got their reward for the risks they were taking .
fabregas robbed guily on the left as barca swarmed forwardand played in henry .
his square ball across the penalty area was hit firmly by hleb but the rushed shot flew wide .
five minutes later , fredi ljungberg should have sealed the match , breaking down the left and into the box before firing his shot high .
valdes touched the ball over but the resulting corner was wasted .
henry then had a great chance to get the goal he so desired when he broke free but his shot was too close to valdes .
seconds later at the other end , ronaldinho also fluffed a great chance , dragging a shot wide of the post from ten meters .
barcelona champions after two goals in three minutes fifteen minutes to go and samuel eto 'o made no such mistake .
a great ball from midfield evaded arsenal 's defense and a clever step-over by larsson allowed the ball to run to the cameroon striker who swept his shot past almunia from close range .
two minutes later and arsenal 's dream to a severe blow .
larsson again was the provider as the swede slipped a delicate reverse ball into the path of second substitute juliano belletti who cracked a shot between almunia 's legs and into the net .
arsenal were spent and had nothing in reserve as time ran out , leaving barca to run the clock down .
it was a cruel end to a brave performance from the londoners but barcelona made the extra man and , in the end , extra class pay .
the final whistle brought ecstatic scenes from the barcelona players and fans leaving the arsenal players crushed .

the catalans hit two goals in the last 10 minutes to turn a game which was slipping away . fans from london and barcelona had been flooding into the french capital for most of wednesday , many without tickets , for what was billed as the most exciting european cup final in years .
now known as the champions league and unrecognisible from the knock-out format of old , the prestige of the competition remains and both barcelona and arsenal traveled to paris with their eyes on the most coveted club prize in european soccer and the legacy that belongs to it .
the winners would be awarded not only the trophy known as " old big ears " but the accolade of being the best team on the continent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who got in expected a spectacle it would be a title justifiably awarded to both teams .
barcelona - with their flair and flow , led by the incredible talents of the brazilian ronaldinho - and arsenal - the aristocrats of english soccer , fronted by one of the most devastating attackers in the history of the game , thierry henry .
two teams capable of rapid attacking soccer and prodigious skill , filled with quality from back to front .
the match was sold as ronaldinho versus henry but neither team are a one-man show .
eto 'o , deco , marquez , cole , ljungberg , pires ...
both sides started the game bursting with stars .
henry presented with two chances to open account but unsurprisingly it was henry who made the first - and second - chance , initially spinning away from rafael marquez in the area after being slipped in by alex hleb only to be thwarted by valdes .
from the corner , henry whipped a vicious low shot at the keeper from distance which valdes palmed away .
the game was barely three minutes old .
the young arsenal team had set their stall out early and were dictating the pace , obviously not in awe of the team they were facing .
barca seemed stunned but only momentarily .
ludo guily was soon testing jens lehmann after ashley cole has slipped on the left .
germany 's numer one comfortably held the rising shot from the frenchman .
it was no shock that arsenal coach arsene wenger had picked out ronaldinho as barca 's main creative threat .
each time the brazilian received the ball he found two gunners stifling his progress .
due to arsenal 's crowding tactics , ronaldinho 's first effort on goal had to come from a free kick in the 15th minute but the distance was too much even for him and the shot flew well wide of lehmann 's goal .
lehmann sees red bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : early bath : lehmann gets his marching orders just when the final looked to be settling down , drama struck in paris .
a ronaldinho slide rule pass put samuel eto 'o through on goal ; lehmann raced off his line and hauled the barca attacker down on the edge of the area .
as the last man , the referee had no choice and the german keeper saw red .
arsenal substituted robert pires for manuel almunia and the new keeper 's first job was to watch ronaldinho 's free kick fly just wide .
in the following minutes , the game looked like it could boil over , swinging from beauty to ugliness in a flash of studs .
eboue scythed down van bronkhurst in a red mist and moments later kolo toure was mugged by edmilson in a revenge attack . bodies started to litter the field and the tempo suffered .
when the game recovered , barca began to dominate .
eto 'o was tormenting eboue at will on the right while guily continued to test cole on the left but despite their dominance , barca could not find a way though arsenal 's famously stingy back line .
defender campbell draws first blood and it was a stalwart from that defensive wall which remarkably broke the deadlock and made the spanish giants pay .
after eboue had been body-checked by carlos puyol on the edge of the barca area , thierry henry floated an inch perfect free kick into the six-yard box where sol campbell rose above the static catalan defense to power a towering header past valdes to put ten-men arsenal in the lead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sol campbell heads the gunners in front barcelona responded in marauding style .
wave after wave of attacks flowed as the clock ticked down to half-time and the catalans almost achieved parity in style when eto 'o spun away from the arsenal defense on the edge of the penalty area .
his shot looked destined for the top corner but almunia got a finger to the ball and tipped it on to the post .
ronaldinho swung a leg at the rebound but the volley had no direction .
the second-half started with barcelona showing more purpose .
two minutes after the restart , deco , a champions league winner with porto in 2004 , rifled a low shot straight at almunia after good work by van bommel on the right .
minutes later , barca substitute andres iniesta rode a flurry of tackles to bear down on the arsenal goal but again almunia was equal to the shot when it came .
barca camped in arsenal half in frantic search for equalizer frustration was beginning to creep into the barca players .
even a centrally located ronaldinho free-kick on the edge of the box was charged down by the arsenal defense .
seconds later , the brazilian tricked his way into the box only for his deft flick to be punched away by almunia .
arsenal were playing a dangerous game ; protecting a one-goal lead against a team full of attacking panache and hoping to hit the catalans on the break .
barca increased their attacking chances by taking off midfielder van bommel and bringing on henrik larsson with half an hour to play .
but the londoners almost got their reward for the risks they were taking .
fabregas robbed guily on the left as barca swarmed forwardand played in henry .
his square ball across the penalty area was hit firmly by hleb but the rushed shot flew wide .
five minutes later , fredi ljungberg should have sealed the match , breaking down the left and into the box before firing his shot high .
valdes touched the ball over but the resulting corner was wasted .
henry then had a great chance to get the goal he so desired when he broke free but his shot was too close to valdes .
seconds later at the other end , ronaldinho also fluffed a great chance , dragging a shot wide of the post from ten meters .
barcelona champions after two goals in three minutes fifteen minutes to go and samuel eto 'o made no such mistake .
a great ball from midfield evaded arsenal 's defense and a clever step-over by larsson allowed the ball to run to the cameroon striker who swept his shot past almunia from close range .
two minutes later and arsenal 's dream to a severe blow .
larsson again was the provider as the swede slipped a delicate reverse ball into the path of second substitute juliano belletti who cracked a shot between almunia 's legs and into the net .
arsenal were spent and had nothing in reserve as time ran out , leaving barca to run the clock down .
it was a cruel end to a brave performance from the londoners but barcelona made the extra man and , in the end , extra class pay .
the final whistle brought ecstatic scenes from the barcelona players and fans leaving the arsenal players crushed .
barcelona were european champions and deservedly so , not just from the performance on the night but for a season during which their beautiful game had lit up the global game .

the catalans hit two goals in the last 10 minutes to turn a game which was slipping away . fans from london and barcelona had been flooding into the french capital for most of wednesday , many without tickets , for what was billed as the most exciting european cup final in years .
now known as the champions league and unrecognisible from the knock-out format of old , the prestige of the competition remains and both barcelona and arsenal traveled to paris with their eyes on the most coveted club prize in european soccer and the legacy that belongs to it .
the winners would be awarded not only the trophy known as " old big ears " but the accolade of being the best team on the continent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who got in expected a spectacle it would be a title justifiably awarded to both teams .
barcelona - with their flair and flow , led by the incredible talents of the brazilian ronaldinho - and arsenal - the aristocrats of english soccer , fronted by one of the most devastating attackers in the history of the game , thierry henry .
two teams capable of rapid attacking soccer and prodigious skill , filled with quality from back to front .
the match was sold as ronaldinho versus henry but neither team are a one-man show .
eto 'o , deco , marquez , cole , ljungberg , pires ...
both sides started the game bursting with stars .
henry presented with two chances to open account but unsurprisingly it was henry who made the first - and second - chance , initially spinning away from rafael marquez in the area after being slipped in by alex hleb only to be thwarted by valdes .
from the corner , henry whipped a vicious low shot at the keeper from distance which valdes palmed away .
the game was barely three minutes old .
the young arsenal team had set their stall out early and were dictating the pace , obviously not in awe of the team they were facing .
barca seemed stunned but only momentarily .
ludo guily was soon testing jens lehmann after ashley cole has slipped on the left .
germany 's numer one comfortably held the rising shot from the frenchman .
it was no shock that arsenal coach arsene wenger had picked out ronaldinho as barca 's main creative threat .
each time the brazilian received the ball he found two gunners stifling his progress .
due to arsenal 's crowding tactics , ronaldinho 's first effort on goal had to come from a free kick in the 15th minute but the distance was too much even for him and the shot flew well wide of lehmann 's goal .
lehmann sees red bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : early bath : lehmann gets his marching orders just when the final looked to be settling down , drama struck in paris .
a ronaldinho slide rule pass put samuel eto 'o through on goal ; lehmann raced off his line and hauled the barca attacker down on the edge of the area .
as the last man , the referee had no choice and the german keeper saw red .
arsenal substituted robert pires for manuel almunia and the new keeper 's first job was to watch ronaldinho 's free kick fly just wide .
in the following minutes , the game looked like it could boil over , swinging from beauty to ugliness in a flash of studs .
eboue scythed down van bronkhurst in a red mist and moments later kolo toure was mugged by edmilson in a revenge attack . bodies started to litter the field and the tempo suffered .
when the game recovered , barca began to dominate .
eto 'o was tormenting eboue at will on the right while guily continued to test cole on the left but despite their dominance , barca could not find a way though arsenal 's famously stingy back line .
defender campbell draws first blood and it was a stalwart from that defensive wall which remarkably broke the deadlock and made the spanish giants pay .
after eboue had been body-checked by carlos puyol on the edge of the barca area , thierry henry floated an inch perfect free kick into the six-yard box where sol campbell rose above the static catalan defense to power a towering header past valdes to put ten-men arsenal in the lead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sol campbell heads the gunners in front barcelona responded in marauding style .
wave after wave of attacks flowed as the clock ticked down to half-time and the catalans almost achieved parity in style when eto 'o spun away from the arsenal defense on the edge of the penalty area .
his shot looked destined for the top corner but almunia got a finger to the ball and tipped it on to the post .
ronaldinho swung a leg at the rebound but the volley had no direction .
the second-half started with barcelona showing more purpose .
two minutes after the restart , deco , a champions league winner with porto in 2004 , rifled a low shot straight at almunia after good work by van bommel on the right .
minutes later , barca substitute andres iniesta rode a flurry of tackles to bear down on the arsenal goal but again almunia was equal to the shot when it came .
barca camped in arsenal half in frantic search for equalizer frustration was beginning to creep into the barca players .
even a centrally located ronaldinho free-kick on the edge of the box was charged down by the arsenal defense .
seconds later , the brazilian tricked his way into the box only for his deft flick to be punched away by almunia .
arsenal were playing a dangerous game ; protecting a one-goal lead against a team full of attacking panache and hoping to hit the catalans on the break .
barca increased their attacking chances by taking off midfielder van bommel and bringing on henrik larsson with half an hour to play .
but the londoners almost got their reward for the risks they were taking .
fabregas robbed guily on the left as barca swarmed forwardand played in henry .
his square ball across the penalty area was hit firmly by hleb but the rushed shot flew wide .
five minutes later , fredi ljungberg should have sealed the match , breaking down the left and into the box before firing his shot high .
valdes touched the ball over but the resulting corner was wasted .
henry then had a great chance to get the goal he so desired when he broke free but his shot was too close to valdes .
seconds later at the other end , ronaldinho also fluffed a great chance , dragging a shot wide of the post from ten meters .
barcelona champions after two goals in three minutes fifteen minutes to go and samuel eto 'o made no such mistake .
a great ball from midfield evaded arsenal 's defense and a clever step-over by larsson allowed the ball to run to the cameroon striker who swept his shot past almunia from close range .
two minutes later and arsenal 's dream to a severe blow .
larsson again was the provider as the swede slipped a delicate reverse ball into the path of second substitute juliano belletti who cracked a shot between almunia 's legs and into the net .
arsenal were spent and had nothing in reserve as time ran out , leaving barca to run the clock down .
it was a cruel end to a brave performance from the londoners but barcelona made the extra man and , in the end , extra class pay .
the final whistle brought ecstatic scenes from the barcelona players and fans leaving the arsenal players crushed .
barcelona were european champions and deservedly so , not just from the performance on the night but for a season during which their beautiful game had lit up the global game .

" we 're playing football a la rijkaard , " said the two-time world footballer of the year .
" it 's a game based on open , attacking football .
we 're not copying anyone .
you ca n't really compare us to any other team . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barca 's style is a dream for ronaldinho " it 's a style of football that you dream about playing as a footballer , because we are given complete freedom to attack . " joan laporta , barcelona 's president , was even more effusive .
" the secret of our success is rijkaard , " laporta said .
" he is the ronaldinho of the bench . " insiders expect a flowing , open display barcelona 's former arsenal fullback giovanni van bronckhorst said the similar mentality of the two sides could make for an open contest . " both teams have played really well in the champions league this year and the philosophy of the two sides is the same , as we want to play attractive football and i think both teams have done that , " said van bronckhorst . " so this final will be something of a one-off because normally you have teams that play a bit defensively , but now you will see two teams that like to attack and so it should be a very attractive final . " " a final , though , is only a good one if you win it and we know that we are playing difficult opponents .
they now have the record for clean sheets in the champions league so that is proof of how well they defend . " " we will have to play well to beat them but we will maintain our philosophy no matter what happens . " french connection looking for élan in paris bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arsenal 's run has been a revelation arsenal 's run to their first champions league final has been down to a pragmatic streak that saw wenger opt for an unfamiliar 4-1-4-1 formation . a solid defense and a five-man midfield , with the likes of cesc fabregas , alexander hleb and robert pires streaming through in support of henry , helped account for real madrid , juventus and villarreal in the knockout rounds . wenger believes that his team will be more relaxed now that they have secured their place in europe 's top competition next year , and is certain the gunners can unlock the barcelona back four if they play their natural game . " if we do that , if we have a real go , i am convinced we can win , " said wenger , who nevertheless sounded a note of caution for the millions of fans anticipating a ' champagne ' final . many previous finals had been stifled by the fear of failure , he warned . " it 's difficult to predict .
like many finals , as long as nobody scores it stays quite locked , " wenger said .
" but because of the importance of the competition , once one team scores it will certainly be an open and crazy game .

d 'alema , 57 , will also hold one of two deputy prime ministerial positions along with francesco rutelli , who doubles as culture minister . prodi was formally sworn in as prime minister by president giorgio napolitano ahead of his 25-member cabinet , ushering in a new era in italian politics after his victory in last month 's general elections , which is still being contested by the ousted center-right . the appointment of the 65-year-old technocrat padoa-schioppa as economics minister is likely to be seen by the markets and international financial bodies as a promise of measures to reduce public debt , which mushroomed under the outgoing conservative government of silvio berlusconi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : padoa-schioppa 's presence in the cabinet may reassure the business-minded prodi , a former european commission president , was only able to complete his list after haggling within his nine-party coalition over key posts , which went on until the early hours of wednesday .
the bickering underlines the problems prodi is likely to face in government as he defends a razor-thin parliamentary majority after the closest italian election in living memory . " there is a great desire for a new start combined with a desire for cohesion and unity , " prodi said after announcing his cabinet .
" the first commitment will be to rebuild a spirit of solidarity and a consensus on the goals needed for the country to move forward , and that means lowering the level of tension and litigiousness , " he added .

mastella , whose party holds three senate seats , had threatened to pull out of the government if he was not handed a key ministry . the government is dominated by the two biggest center-left parties , the democrats of the left and the centrist margherita , while prodi is one of five independents .
it includes one communist , paolo ferrero of the refoundation communist party , who will have responsibility for welfare , and six women - four more than the outgoing center-right government .
alessandro bianchi , who is an independent but is closely associated with the smaller italian communist party , will take charge of transport .
more left-leaning than expected the corriere della sera newspaper said in a front page editorial the new government was more left-leaning than had been anticipated . " a government is born that is weighted to the left , even more than expected by the majority of those who elected it and the natural orientation of the coalition , " it said . the surprise choice of mastella for the justice ministry was an early blow to leftists in the disparate coalition who have pledged wide-ranging social reform , not least the state recognition of same-sex couples - fiercely opposed by pope benedict xvi .

d 'alema , 57 , will also hold one of two deputy prime ministerial positions along with francesco rutelli , who doubles as culture minister . prodi was formally sworn in as prime minister by president giorgio napolitano ahead of his 25-member cabinet , ushering in a new era in italian politics after his victory in last month 's general elections , which is still being contested by the ousted center-right . the appointment of the 65-year-old technocrat padoa-schioppa as economics minister is likely to be seen by the markets and international financial bodies as a promise of measures to reduce public debt , which mushroomed under the outgoing conservative government of silvio berlusconi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : padoa-schioppa 's presence in the cabinet may reassure the business-minded prodi , a former european commission president , was only able to complete his list after haggling within his nine-party coalition over key posts , which went on until the early hours of wednesday .
the bickering underlines the problems prodi is likely to face in government as he defends a razor-thin parliamentary majority after the closest italian election in living memory . " there is a great desire for a new start combined with a desire for cohesion and unity , " prodi said after announcing his cabinet .
" the first commitment will be to rebuild a spirit of solidarity and a consensus on the goals needed for the country to move forward , and that means lowering the level of tension and litigiousness , " he added .

mastella , whose party holds three senate seats , had threatened to pull out of the government if he was not handed a key ministry . the government is dominated by the two biggest center-left parties , the democrats of the left and the centrist margherita , while prodi is one of five independents .
it includes one communist , paolo ferrero of the refoundation communist party , who will have responsibility for welfare , and six women - four more than the outgoing center-right government .
alessandro bianchi , who is an independent but is closely associated with the smaller italian communist party , will take charge of transport .
more left-leaning than expected the corriere della sera newspaper said in a front page editorial the new government was more left-leaning than had been anticipated . " a government is born that is weighted to the left , even more than expected by the majority of those who elected it and the natural orientation of the coalition , " it said . the surprise choice of mastella for the justice ministry was an early blow to leftists in the disparate coalition who have pledged wide-ranging social reform , not least the state recognition of same-sex couples - fiercely opposed by pope benedict xvi .

her citizenship is to be revoked after she lied on her asylum claim .
but officials may back down on their decision . the dutch parliament demanded on wednesday that immigration minister rita verdonk reconsider her decision to revoke a somali-born lawmaker 's citizenship for lying on her asylum application 14 years ago . ayaan hirsi ali had announced at an emotional news conference on tuesday that she was resigning after verdonk , a member of her own vvd liberal party , told her she would lose her dutch passport because of the false information .
hirsi ali publicly admitted in 2002 that she deliberately changed her name and birth date to escape a forced marriage . verdonk 's decision sparked a storm of criticism even from within the vvd and parliament called an emergency debate on the matter which lasted until the early morning hours wednesday . majority of dutch public support verdo n k 's decisio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigration minister verdonk is dubbed " iron rita " for her tough policies dutch journalist rütger van santan from radio netherlands said no one understood why the decision was taken now , over three years after the fact . " a lot of parliamentarians say it must have something to do with the fact that verdonk is being engaged in a fight within her own party about the party leadership and that is what is being criticized most , " van santan told dw-radio . van santan said that recent polls indicated around 70 percent of the dutch public agreed with verdonk 's decision . va n gogh 's murderer threate n ed hirsi ali immigration has been a hot topic in the netherlands since a muslim extremist murdered filmmaker theo van gogh in november 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : filmmaker van gogh was murdered by a muslim militant hirsi ali wrote the screenplay for the islam-critical film " submission .

van gogh 's murderer pinned a note on his body threatening hirsi ali .

however , president mahmoud ahmadinejad said wednesday iran would reject the european union deal . " they say that they want to give us incentives , " ahmadinejad told a rally in the town of arak that was carried live on state-run television .
" they think that they can take away our gold and give us some nuts and chocolate in exchange .
there is no need to give us incentives . " a light-water research reactor is considered less of a proliferation risk than a heavy-water reactor , which can produce large amounts of plutonium .
iran is currently building a heavy-water reactor . diplomacy will take place i n private bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany hosted a meeting on the iran conflict earlier this year state department spokesman sean mccormack said the united states was working very closely with the so-called eu-3 -lrb- britain , germany and france -rrb- in developing a package to offer iran .

" we present them with a crossroads .
so they can choose to continue down the pathway of intransigence , of non-cooperation , of obfuscation , which will lead to the increased isolation of the iranian people , or they can choose a pathway of cooperation .

" i 'm going to let the diplomacy take place in private , " mccormack said . us " pleased " about eu efforts a western diplomat told afp news service the united states could accept the idea of an international consortium providing advanced , proliferation-resistant light-water reactor assistance to iran .

but this meeting will likely be postponed until next week . " the package has not been approved , " nicholas burns , the us under secretary of state for political affairs , said late tuesday in washington .
" it is under development . " burns said the meeting would " probably " take place next week in london .

this could open the door to sanctions , and even military action , if iran continues to enrich uranium . however , russia and china oppose such a resolution , saying they fear an escalation of the crisis .
this leaves the eu powers now trying to find a negotiation package acceptable to russia and china . " the package involves iran giving up industrial-scale enrichment and agreeing to have it done in russia , " a diplomat close to the vienna-based un nuclear watchdog international atomic energy agency said . the europeans , backed by the united states , had offered benefits including help in obtaining a light-water reactor last august , but iran rejected this offer . iran would then get trade benefits - the europeans have already promised to help tehran get into the world trade organization . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu ready to help iran develop civilian nuclear power top eu officials said monday that the bloc is willing to back a " proliferation-proof " civilian nuclear program for iran and could offer " the most sophisticated " technology to help with the country 's power needs .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : press freedom : basic rights at stake poland cracks down on liberal media german supreme court rules magazine raid unconstitutional court acquits satirical french mag over mohammed cartoons eu " appalled " by killing of armenian-turkish journalist germany -pipe- 17.05.2006 opinion : eroding press freedom großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government considers press freedom to be of utmost importance the german federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- has been spying on journalists and recruiting them as informers for years .
that was an obvious attempt at eroding freedom of the press , says dw 's heinz dylong . the role of the german federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- is defined by law : its goal is to collect and process information about foreign countries .
the collected information is then placed at the disposal of the german government .
so far , so good . a certain grey zone emerges in the area of so-called " self-protection " of the bnd .
that 's where the bnd can also be active inside the country .
and it is far into this grey zone that the bnd pushed itself .
in order to find out the source of leaks to the press , the intelligence agency not only spied on journalists , but also used the services of the journalists who investigated their own colleagues and even kept tabs on their private lives . one could play down the whole thing and say that grey zones are simply places in which borders are crossed rather quickly .
but the procedures in this case can not be played down .
the relationship between the press and intelligence agencies in a constitutional state is too sensitive , even conflicting .
while intelligence agencies work secretly , placing the collected information only at the disposal of the government , journalistic research has as its goal to obtain information and offer it for public scrutiny . a prete n ce of self-protectio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : was the bnd purposefully interfering with freedom of the press ?
the issue got even more controversial when the bnd - under the pretense of self-protection - obtained information about the journalistic research which concerned the agency itself , its work or its possible shortcomings .
this is no longer " merely " a border violation .
this is obviously an erosion of press freedom . berlin has now decided to draw initial consequences .
the secret report about the bnd activities should be made public .
additionally , the chancellery now formally stipulated what was actually always obvious : in order to detect leaks within its ranks , the bnd will not be allowed to spy on journalists in the future . until now , operative measures which involved journalists had to be approved by top bnd officials .
this , in turn , created the impression of a certain uneasiness in those cases , which , however , was eventually ignored .
the consequences are now at hand : clarification is necessary about what was approved by which top officials in which cases and for what reason . the government spokesman justified the new directive from the chancellery by saying that freedom of the press is such a supreme good , that the interests of the bnd 's self-protection must be subordinated to it .
one could n't agree more . heinz dylong -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german mps vote to release secret report in spying scandal a parliamentary committee has decided to make public a top secret report on the role of the federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- in spying on journalists and recruiting them as informants in an effort to plug leaks .

this , in turn , created the impression of a certain uneasiness in those cases , which , however , was eventually ignored .
the consequences are now at hand : clarification is necessary about what was approved by which top officials in which cases and for what reason . the government spokesman justified the new directive from the chancellery by saying that freedom of the press is such a supreme good , that the interests of the bnd 's self-protection must be subordinated to it .

alternatives to gas are rare and biodiesel from rapeseed , for example , has n't caught on .
but there 's hope .
a saxon firm has found a way to make fuel out of biomass . fuel is simply chemically converted solar energy .
through the photosynthesis in plants , sunlight can be converted into fossil energy , such as coal and oil . it 's a principle which a resourceful tinkerer in saxony thought must be easy to copy .
in 1990 , it was still a vision .
today , the company choren in the saxon town of freiberg actually produces synthetic fuel from biomass , or plants of all kind . " the biomass goes into a multiple-stage gasification process , which undergoes the various chemical processes until it is a high-purity synthesized gas , " said managing director carlhans uhle .
" this gas in turn is converted into diesel through several processes . " choren calls its product sundiesel .
the technical term is biomass to liquids , or btl .
four kilograms of biomass , for example wood , become one liter of diesel .
but while fossil fuels developed over a period of some 400 million years , this process only takes 400 minutes in freiberg . " if you also consider the time it takes the plants to grow , then it 's around 400 days , " uhle said . a closed e n ergy cycle choren obtains the raw material for production from local farmers , saxon 's state forestry and sawmills .
since it does n't just use the plant fruit , but rather the entire plant , the output per hectare of cultivable land in btl in comparison to normal biodiesel is three to four times higher . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this " sundiesel-beetle " runs on choren 's fuel " we can take any biomass we want to , " uhle said .
" nothing negative is left over , except for a bit of slag , which can be used to tar floors .
we are a closed energy cycle . "
in view of the ongoing climate debate , this aspect was particularly important . when this fuel is burned , it releases only as much carbon dioxide previously absorbed by the plants produced for this purpose .
the fuel also contains no sooty particles and can be filled into any diesel engine without re-fitting . biomass fuel ca n be competitive sundiesel is still in the testing phase .
only a few hundred liters are produced daily .
but large automobile producers , such as daimlerchrysler and volkswagen , and the energy giant shell are already on board .
together with choren , they are building a commercial facility , which will take up operations in the coming year and produce 250 million liters -lrb- 66 million gallons -rrb- annually .
four further facilities are planned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plant-based biodiesel has n't caught on " our technicians ' forecasts say that we are at a stage with the large scale plant to be competitive , " uhle said .
" of course , it always depends on the oil price and the dollar . " with the current high oil prices , the fuel will definitely be competitive with the construction of the third facility in 2012 or 2013 - and that without further subsidies . a liter of sundiesel still costs double that of diesel from petroleum .
the production costs are high and each new plant requires 400 million euros -lrb- $ 515.8 million -rrb- in investments .

however , president mahmoud ahmadinejad said wednesday iran would reject the european union deal . " they say that they want to give us incentives , " ahmadinejad told a rally in the town of arak that was carried live on state-run television .
" they think that they can take away our gold and give us some nuts and chocolate in exchange .
there is no need to give us incentives . " a light-water research reactor is considered less of a proliferation risk than a heavy-water reactor , which can produce large amounts of plutonium .

" the five permanent un security council members plus germany were expected to meet this friday in london to review the offer .
but this meeting will likely be postponed until next week . " the package has not been approved , " nicholas burns , the us under secretary of state for political affairs , said late tuesday in washington .
" it is under development . " burns said the meeting would " probably " take place next week in london .

" the package involves iran giving up industrial-scale enrichment and agreeing to have it done in russia , " a diplomat close to the vienna-based un nuclear watchdog international atomic energy agency said . the europeans , backed by the united states , had offered benefits including help in obtaining a light-water reactor last august , but iran rejected this offer . iran would then get trade benefits - the europeans have already promised to help tehran get into the world trade organization . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu ready to help iran develop civilian nuclear power top eu officials said monday that the bloc is willing to back a " proliferation-proof " civilian nuclear program for iran and could offer " the most sophisticated " technology to help with the country 's power needs .

however , president mahmoud ahmadinejad said wednesday iran would reject the european union deal . " they say that they want to give us incentives , " ahmadinejad told a rally in the town of arak that was carried live on state-run television .
" they think that they can take away our gold and give us some nuts and chocolate in exchange .
there is no need to give us incentives . " a light-water research reactor is considered less of a proliferation risk than a heavy-water reactor , which can produce large amounts of plutonium .
iran is currently building a heavy-water reactor . diplomacy will take place i n private bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany hosted a meeting on the iran conflict earlier this year state department spokesman sean mccormack said the united states was working very closely with the so-called eu-3 -lrb- britain , germany and france -rrb- in developing a package to offer iran . " we are making progress in the consultations , " he told reporters in washington on tuesday . " what this package would do is provide the iranian regime a choice , " mccormack said .
" we present them with a crossroads .
so they can choose to continue down the pathway of intransigence , of non-cooperation , of obfuscation , which will lead to the increased isolation of the iranian people , or they can choose a pathway of cooperation . " however , he would not name any details of the offer . " i 'm going to let the diplomacy take place in private , " mccormack said . us " pleased " about eu efforts a western diplomat told afp news service the united states could accept the idea of an international consortium providing advanced , proliferation-resistant light-water reactor assistance to iran . " but only in the context of an agreement in which iran has verifiably agreed not to pursue uranium enrichment , including research , for the foreseeable future , " the diplomat said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian mps inspect parts of the isfahan nuclear plant he said washington was pleased that the eu had " for the first time committed itself to specific united nations security council sanctions on iran if iran fails to comply . " the five permanent un security council members plus germany were expected to meet this friday in london to review the offer .
but this meeting will likely be postponed until next week . " the package has not been approved , " nicholas burns , the us under secretary of state for political affairs , said late tuesday in washington .
" it is under development . " burns said the meeting would " probably " take place next week in london .
he said the talks on new incentives were progressing . offering iran a light-water reactor needs us backing , as european companies involved in this technology would not want to endanger their business with the united states , diplomats said . a package everyo n e ca n live with washington and the eu-3 favor a security council resolution that would require compliance .
this could open the door to sanctions , and even military action , if iran continues to enrich uranium . however , russia and china oppose such a resolution , saying they fear an escalation of the crisis .
this leaves the eu powers now trying to find a negotiation package acceptable to russia and china . " the package involves iran giving up industrial-scale enrichment and agreeing to have it done in russia , " a diplomat close to the vienna-based un nuclear watchdog international atomic energy agency said . the europeans , backed by the united states , had offered benefits including help in obtaining a light-water reactor last august , but iran rejected this offer . iran would then get trade benefits - the europeans have already promised to help tehran get into the world trade organization . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu ready to help iran develop civilian nuclear power top eu officials said monday that the bloc is willing to back a " proliferation-proof " civilian nuclear program for iran and could offer " the most sophisticated " technology to help with the country 's power needs .

alternatives to gas are rare and biodiesel from rapeseed , for example , has n't caught on .
but there 's hope .
a saxon firm has found a way to make fuel out of biomass . fuel is simply chemically converted solar energy .
through the photosynthesis in plants , sunlight can be converted into fossil energy , such as coal and oil . it 's a principle which a resourceful tinkerer in saxony thought must be easy to copy .
in 1990 , it was still a vision .
today , the company choren in the saxon town of freiberg actually produces synthetic fuel from biomass , or plants of all kind . " the biomass goes into a multiple-stage gasification process , which undergoes the various chemical processes until it is a high-purity synthesized gas , " said managing director carlhans uhle .
" this gas in turn is converted into diesel through several processes . " choren calls its product sundiesel .
the technical term is biomass to liquids , or btl .
four kilograms of biomass , for example wood , become one liter of diesel .
but while fossil fuels developed over a period of some 400 million years , this process only takes 400 minutes in freiberg . " if you also consider the time it takes the plants to grow , then it 's around 400 days , " uhle said . a closed e n ergy cycle choren obtains the raw material for production from local farmers , saxon 's state forestry and sawmills .
since it does n't just use the plant fruit , but rather the entire plant , the output per hectare of cultivable land in btl in comparison to normal biodiesel is three to four times higher . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this " sundiesel-beetle " runs on choren 's fuel " we can take any biomass we want to , " uhle said .
" nothing negative is left over , except for a bit of slag , which can be used to tar floors .
we are a closed energy cycle . "
in view of the ongoing climate debate , this aspect was particularly important . when this fuel is burned , it releases only as much carbon dioxide previously absorbed by the plants produced for this purpose .
the fuel also contains no sooty particles and can be filled into any diesel engine without re-fitting . biomass fuel ca n be competitive sundiesel is still in the testing phase .
only a few hundred liters are produced daily .
but large automobile producers , such as daimlerchrysler and volkswagen , and the energy giant shell are already on board .
together with choren , they are building a commercial facility , which will take up operations in the coming year and produce 250 million liters -lrb- 66 million gallons -rrb- annually .
four further facilities are planned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plant-based biodiesel has n't caught on " our technicians ' forecasts say that we are at a stage with the large scale plant to be competitive , " uhle said .
" of course , it always depends on the oil price and the dollar . " with the current high oil prices , the fuel will definitely be competitive with the construction of the third facility in 2012 or 2013 - and that without further subsidies . a liter of sundiesel still costs double that of diesel from petroleum .
the production costs are high and each new plant requires 400 million euros -lrb- $ 515.8 million -rrb- in investments .

alternatives to gas are rare and biodiesel from rapeseed , for example , has n't caught on .
but there 's hope .
a saxon firm has found a way to make fuel out of biomass . fuel is simply chemically converted solar energy .
through the photosynthesis in plants , sunlight can be converted into fossil energy , such as coal and oil . it 's a principle which a resourceful tinkerer in saxony thought must be easy to copy .
in 1990 , it was still a vision .
today , the company choren in the saxon town of freiberg actually produces synthetic fuel from biomass , or plants of all kind . " the biomass goes into a multiple-stage gasification process , which undergoes the various chemical processes until it is a high-purity synthesized gas , " said managing director carlhans uhle .
" this gas in turn is converted into diesel through several processes . " choren calls its product sundiesel .
the technical term is biomass to liquids , or btl .
four kilograms of biomass , for example wood , become one liter of diesel .
but while fossil fuels developed over a period of some 400 million years , this process only takes 400 minutes in freiberg . " if you also consider the time it takes the plants to grow , then it 's around 400 days , " uhle said . a closed e n ergy cycle choren obtains the raw material for production from local farmers , saxon 's state forestry and sawmills .
since it does n't just use the plant fruit , but rather the entire plant , the output per hectare of cultivable land in btl in comparison to normal biodiesel is three to four times higher . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this " sundiesel-beetle " runs on choren 's fuel " we can take any biomass we want to , " uhle said .
" nothing negative is left over , except for a bit of slag , which can be used to tar floors .
we are a closed energy cycle . "
in view of the ongoing climate debate , this aspect was particularly important . when this fuel is burned , it releases only as much carbon dioxide previously absorbed by the plants produced for this purpose .
the fuel also contains no sooty particles and can be filled into any diesel engine without re-fitting . biomass fuel ca n be competitive sundiesel is still in the testing phase .

the catalans hit two goals in the last 10 minutes to turn a game which was slipping away . fans from london and barcelona had been flooding into the french capital for most of wednesday , many without tickets , for what was billed as the most exciting european cup final in years .
now known as the champions league and unrecognisible from the knock-out format of old , the prestige of the competition remains and both barcelona and arsenal traveled to paris with their eyes on the most coveted club prize in european soccer and the legacy that belongs to it .
the winners would be awarded not only the trophy known as " old big ears " but the accolade of being the best team on the continent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who got in expected a spectacle it would be a title justifiably awarded to both teams .
barcelona - with their flair and flow , led by the incredible talents of the brazilian ronaldinho - and arsenal - the aristocrats of english soccer , fronted by one of the most devastating attackers in the history of the game , thierry henry .
two teams capable of rapid attacking soccer and prodigious skill , filled with quality from back to front .
the match was sold as ronaldinho versus henry but neither team are a one-man show .
eto 'o , deco , marquez , cole , ljungberg , pires ...
both sides started the game bursting with stars .
henry presented with two chances to open account but unsurprisingly it was henry who made the first - and second - chance , initially spinning away from rafael marquez in the area after being slipped in by alex hleb only to be thwarted by valdes .
from the corner , henry whipped a vicious low shot at the keeper from distance which valdes palmed away .
the game was barely three minutes old .
the young arsenal team had set their stall out early and were dictating the pace , obviously not in awe of the team they were facing .
barca seemed stunned but only momentarily .
ludo guily was soon testing jens lehmann after ashley cole has slipped on the left .
germany 's numer one comfortably held the rising shot from the frenchman .
it was no shock that arsenal coach arsene wenger had picked out ronaldinho as barca 's main creative threat .
each time the brazilian received the ball he found two gunners stifling his progress .
due to arsenal 's crowding tactics , ronaldinho 's first effort on goal had to come from a free kick in the 15th minute but the distance was too much even for him and the shot flew well wide of lehmann 's goal .
lehmann sees red bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : early bath : lehmann gets his marching orders just when the final looked to be settling down , drama struck in paris .
a ronaldinho slide rule pass put samuel eto 'o through on goal ; lehmann raced off his line and hauled the barca attacker down on the edge of the area .
as the last man , the referee had no choice and the german keeper saw red .
arsenal substituted robert pires for manuel almunia and the new keeper 's first job was to watch ronaldinho 's free kick fly just wide .
in the following minutes , the game looked like it could boil over , swinging from beauty to ugliness in a flash of studs .
eboue scythed down van bronkhurst in a red mist and moments later kolo toure was mugged by edmilson in a revenge attack . bodies started to litter the field and the tempo suffered .
when the game recovered , barca began to dominate .
eto 'o was tormenting eboue at will on the right while guily continued to test cole on the left but despite their dominance , barca could not find a way though arsenal 's famously stingy back line .
defender campbell draws first blood and it was a stalwart from that defensive wall which remarkably broke the deadlock and made the spanish giants pay .
after eboue had been body-checked by carlos puyol on the edge of the barca area , thierry henry floated an inch perfect free kick into the six-yard box where sol campbell rose above the static catalan defense to power a towering header past valdes to put ten-men arsenal in the lead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sol campbell heads the gunners in front barcelona responded in marauding style .
wave after wave of attacks flowed as the clock ticked down to half-time and the catalans almost achieved parity in style when eto 'o spun away from the arsenal defense on the edge of the penalty area .
his shot looked destined for the top corner but almunia got a finger to the ball and tipped it on to the post .
ronaldinho swung a leg at the rebound but the volley had no direction .
the second-half started with barcelona showing more purpose .
two minutes after the restart , deco , a champions league winner with porto in 2004 , rifled a low shot straight at almunia after good work by van bommel on the right .
minutes later , barca substitute andres iniesta rode a flurry of tackles to bear down on the arsenal goal but again almunia was equal to the shot when it came .
barca camped in arsenal half in frantic search for equalizer frustration was beginning to creep into the barca players .
even a centrally located ronaldinho free-kick on the edge of the box was charged down by the arsenal defense .
seconds later , the brazilian tricked his way into the box only for his deft flick to be punched away by almunia .
arsenal were playing a dangerous game ; protecting a one-goal lead against a team full of attacking panache and hoping to hit the catalans on the break .
barca increased their attacking chances by taking off midfielder van bommel and bringing on henrik larsson with half an hour to play .
but the londoners almost got their reward for the risks they were taking .
fabregas robbed guily on the left as barca swarmed forwardand played in henry .
his square ball across the penalty area was hit firmly by hleb but the rushed shot flew wide .
five minutes later , fredi ljungberg should have sealed the match , breaking down the left and into the box before firing his shot high .
valdes touched the ball over but the resulting corner was wasted .
henry then had a great chance to get the goal he so desired when he broke free but his shot was too close to valdes .
seconds later at the other end , ronaldinho also fluffed a great chance , dragging a shot wide of the post from ten meters .
barcelona champions after two goals in three minutes fifteen minutes to go and samuel eto 'o made no such mistake .
a great ball from midfield evaded arsenal 's defense and a clever step-over by larsson allowed the ball to run to the cameroon striker who swept his shot past almunia from close range .
two minutes later and arsenal 's dream to a severe blow .
larsson again was the provider as the swede slipped a delicate reverse ball into the path of second substitute juliano belletti who cracked a shot between almunia 's legs and into the net .
arsenal were spent and had nothing in reserve as time ran out , leaving barca to run the clock down .
it was a cruel end to a brave performance from the londoners but barcelona made the extra man and , in the end , extra class pay .
the final whistle brought ecstatic scenes from the barcelona players and fans leaving the arsenal players crushed .
barcelona were european champions and deservedly so , not just from the performance on the night but for a season during which their beautiful game had lit up the global game .

the catalans hit two goals in the last 10 minutes to turn a game which was slipping away . fans from london and barcelona had been flooding into the french capital for most of wednesday , many without tickets , for what was billed as the most exciting european cup final in years .
now known as the champions league and unrecognisible from the knock-out format of old , the prestige of the competition remains and both barcelona and arsenal traveled to paris with their eyes on the most coveted club prize in european soccer and the legacy that belongs to it .
the winners would be awarded not only the trophy known as " old big ears " but the accolade of being the best team on the continent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who got in expected a spectacle it would be a title justifiably awarded to both teams .
barcelona - with their flair and flow , led by the incredible talents of the brazilian ronaldinho - and arsenal - the aristocrats of english soccer , fronted by one of the most devastating attackers in the history of the game , thierry henry .
two teams capable of rapid attacking soccer and prodigious skill , filled with quality from back to front .
the match was sold as ronaldinho versus henry but neither team are a one-man show .
eto 'o , deco , marquez , cole , ljungberg , pires ...
both sides started the game bursting with stars .
henry presented with two chances to open account but unsurprisingly it was henry who made the first - and second - chance , initially spinning away from rafael marquez in the area after being slipped in by alex hleb only to be thwarted by valdes .
from the corner , henry whipped a vicious low shot at the keeper from distance which valdes palmed away .
the game was barely three minutes old .
the young arsenal team had set their stall out early and were dictating the pace , obviously not in awe of the team they were facing .
barca seemed stunned but only momentarily .
ludo guily was soon testing jens lehmann after ashley cole has slipped on the left .
germany 's numer one comfortably held the rising shot from the frenchman .
it was no shock that arsenal coach arsene wenger had picked out ronaldinho as barca 's main creative threat .
each time the brazilian received the ball he found two gunners stifling his progress .
due to arsenal 's crowding tactics , ronaldinho 's first effort on goal had to come from a free kick in the 15th minute but the distance was too much even for him and the shot flew well wide of lehmann 's goal .
lehmann sees red bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : early bath : lehmann gets his marching orders just when the final looked to be settling down , drama struck in paris .
a ronaldinho slide rule pass put samuel eto 'o through on goal ; lehmann raced off his line and hauled the barca attacker down on the edge of the area .
as the last man , the referee had no choice and the german keeper saw red .
arsenal substituted robert pires for manuel almunia and the new keeper 's first job was to watch ronaldinho 's free kick fly just wide .
in the following minutes , the game looked like it could boil over , swinging from beauty to ugliness in a flash of studs .
eboue scythed down van bronkhurst in a red mist and moments later kolo toure was mugged by edmilson in a revenge attack . bodies started to litter the field and the tempo suffered .
when the game recovered , barca began to dominate .
eto 'o was tormenting eboue at will on the right while guily continued to test cole on the left but despite their dominance , barca could not find a way though arsenal 's famously stingy back line .
defender campbell draws first blood and it was a stalwart from that defensive wall which remarkably broke the deadlock and made the spanish giants pay .
after eboue had been body-checked by carlos puyol on the edge of the barca area , thierry henry floated an inch perfect free kick into the six-yard box where sol campbell rose above the static catalan defense to power a towering header past valdes to put ten-men arsenal in the lead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sol campbell heads the gunners in front barcelona responded in marauding style .
wave after wave of attacks flowed as the clock ticked down to half-time and the catalans almost achieved parity in style when eto 'o spun away from the arsenal defense on the edge of the penalty area .
his shot looked destined for the top corner but almunia got a finger to the ball and tipped it on to the post .
ronaldinho swung a leg at the rebound but the volley had no direction .
the second-half started with barcelona showing more purpose .
two minutes after the restart , deco , a champions league winner with porto in 2004 , rifled a low shot straight at almunia after good work by van bommel on the right .
minutes later , barca substitute andres iniesta rode a flurry of tackles to bear down on the arsenal goal but again almunia was equal to the shot when it came .
barca camped in arsenal half in frantic search for equalizer frustration was beginning to creep into the barca players .
even a centrally located ronaldinho free-kick on the edge of the box was charged down by the arsenal defense .
seconds later , the brazilian tricked his way into the box only for his deft flick to be punched away by almunia .
arsenal were playing a dangerous game ; protecting a one-goal lead against a team full of attacking panache and hoping to hit the catalans on the break .
barca increased their attacking chances by taking off midfielder van bommel and bringing on henrik larsson with half an hour to play .
but the londoners almost got their reward for the risks they were taking .
fabregas robbed guily on the left as barca swarmed forwardand played in henry .
his square ball across the penalty area was hit firmly by hleb but the rushed shot flew wide .
five minutes later , fredi ljungberg should have sealed the match , breaking down the left and into the box before firing his shot high .
valdes touched the ball over but the resulting corner was wasted .
henry then had a great chance to get the goal he so desired when he broke free but his shot was too close to valdes .
seconds later at the other end , ronaldinho also fluffed a great chance , dragging a shot wide of the post from ten meters .
barcelona champions after two goals in three minutes fifteen minutes to go and samuel eto 'o made no such mistake .
a great ball from midfield evaded arsenal 's defense and a clever step-over by larsson allowed the ball to run to the cameroon striker who swept his shot past almunia from close range .
two minutes later and arsenal 's dream to a severe blow .
larsson again was the provider as the swede slipped a delicate reverse ball into the path of second substitute juliano belletti who cracked a shot between almunia 's legs and into the net .
arsenal were spent and had nothing in reserve as time ran out , leaving barca to run the clock down .
it was a cruel end to a brave performance from the londoners but barcelona made the extra man and , in the end , extra class pay .
the final whistle brought ecstatic scenes from the barcelona players and fans leaving the arsenal players crushed .
barcelona were european champions and deservedly so , not just from the performance on the night but for a season during which their beautiful game had lit up the global game .

d 'alema , 57 , will also hold one of two deputy prime ministerial positions along with francesco rutelli , who doubles as culture minister . prodi was formally sworn in as prime minister by president giorgio napolitano ahead of his 25-member cabinet , ushering in a new era in italian politics after his victory in last month 's general elections , which is still being contested by the ousted center-right . the appointment of the 65-year-old technocrat padoa-schioppa as economics minister is likely to be seen by the markets and international financial bodies as a promise of measures to reduce public debt , which mushroomed under the outgoing conservative government of silvio berlusconi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : padoa-schioppa 's presence in the cabinet may reassure the business-minded prodi , a former european commission president , was only able to complete his list after haggling within his nine-party coalition over key posts , which went on until the early hours of wednesday .
the bickering underlines the problems prodi is likely to face in government as he defends a razor-thin parliamentary majority after the closest italian election in living memory . " there is a great desire for a new start combined with a desire for cohesion and unity , " prodi said after announcing his cabinet .
" the first commitment will be to rebuild a spirit of solidarity and a consensus on the goals needed for the country to move forward , and that means lowering the level of tension and litigiousness , " he added .

mastella , whose party holds three senate seats , had threatened to pull out of the government if he was not handed a key ministry . the government is dominated by the two biggest center-left parties , the democrats of the left and the centrist margherita , while prodi is one of five independents .
it includes one communist , paolo ferrero of the refoundation communist party , who will have responsibility for welfare , and six women - four more than the outgoing center-right government .
alessandro bianchi , who is an independent but is closely associated with the smaller italian communist party , will take charge of transport .
more left-leaning than expected the corriere della sera newspaper said in a front page editorial the new government was more left-leaning than had been anticipated . " a government is born that is weighted to the left , even more than expected by the majority of those who elected it and the natural orientation of the coalition , " it said . the surprise choice of mastella for the justice ministry was an early blow to leftists in the disparate coalition who have pledged wide-ranging social reform , not least the state recognition of same-sex couples - fiercely opposed by pope benedict xvi .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.05.2006 prodi overcomes infighting to name new italian government großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi heads up italy 's 61st postwar government italy 's newly elected prime minister , romano prodi , unveiled his center-left government wednesday , ending weeks of political stalemate and pledging to rebuild solidarity and consensus after bitterly divisive elections . as expected , it features former prime minister massimo d 'alema as foreign minister and former european central bank board member tomasso padoa-schioppa as economics minister .
d 'alema , 57 , will also hold one of two deputy prime ministerial positions along with francesco rutelli , who doubles as culture minister . prodi was formally sworn in as prime minister by president giorgio napolitano ahead of his 25-member cabinet , ushering in a new era in italian politics after his victory in last month 's general elections , which is still being contested by the ousted center-right . the appointment of the 65-year-old technocrat padoa-schioppa as economics minister is likely to be seen by the markets and international financial bodies as a promise of measures to reduce public debt , which mushroomed under the outgoing conservative government of silvio berlusconi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : padoa-schioppa 's presence in the cabinet may reassure the business-minded prodi , a former european commission president , was only able to complete his list after haggling within his nine-party coalition over key posts , which went on until the early hours of wednesday .
the bickering underlines the problems prodi is likely to face in government as he defends a razor-thin parliamentary majority after the closest italian election in living memory . " there is a great desire for a new start combined with a desire for cohesion and unity , " prodi said after announcing his cabinet .
" the first commitment will be to rebuild a spirit of solidarity and a consensus on the goals needed for the country to move forward , and that means lowering the level of tension and litigiousness , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi eventually made way for democrats union for europe -lrb- udeur -rrb- leader mastella his ministerial list featured a surprise choice of clemente mastella , leader of the small catholic udeur party , as justice minister .
mastella , whose party holds three senate seats , had threatened to pull out of the government if he was not handed a key ministry . the government is dominated by the two biggest center-left parties , the democrats of the left and the centrist margherita , while prodi is one of five independents .
it includes one communist , paolo ferrero of the refoundation communist party , who will have responsibility for welfare , and six women - four more than the outgoing center-right government .
alessandro bianchi , who is an independent but is closely associated with the smaller italian communist party , will take charge of transport .
more left-leaning than expected the corriere della sera newspaper said in a front page editorial the new government was more left-leaning than had been anticipated . " a government is born that is weighted to the left , even more than expected by the majority of those who elected it and the natural orientation of the coalition , " it said . the surprise choice of mastella for the justice ministry was an early blow to leftists in the disparate coalition who have pledged wide-ranging social reform , not least the state recognition of same-sex couples - fiercely opposed by pope benedict xvi .

that was an obvious attempt at eroding freedom of the press , says dw 's heinz dylong . the role of the german federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- is defined by law : its goal is to collect and process information about foreign countries .
the collected information is then placed at the disposal of the german government .
so far , so good . a certain grey zone emerges in the area of so-called " self-protection " of the bnd .
that 's where the bnd can also be active inside the country .
and it is far into this grey zone that the bnd pushed itself .
in order to find out the source of leaks to the press , the intelligence agency not only spied on journalists , but also used the services of the journalists who investigated their own colleagues and even kept tabs on their private lives . one could play down the whole thing and say that grey zones are simply places in which borders are crossed rather quickly .
but the procedures in this case can not be played down .
the relationship between the press and intelligence agencies in a constitutional state is too sensitive , even conflicting .

the issue got even more controversial when the bnd - under the pretense of self-protection - obtained information about the journalistic research which concerned the agency itself , its work or its possible shortcomings .
this is no longer " merely " a border violation .
this is obviously an erosion of press freedom . berlin has now decided to draw initial consequences .
the secret report about the bnd activities should be made public .
additionally , the chancellery now formally stipulated what was actually always obvious : in order to detect leaks within its ranks , the bnd will not be allowed to spy on journalists in the future . until now , operative measures which involved journalists had to be approved by top bnd officials .
this , in turn , created the impression of a certain uneasiness in those cases , which , however , was eventually ignored .
the consequences are now at hand : clarification is necessary about what was approved by which top officials in which cases and for what reason . the government spokesman justified the new directive from the chancellery by saying that freedom of the press is such a supreme good , that the interests of the bnd 's self-protection must be subordinated to it .

" we 're playing football a la rijkaard , " said the two-time world footballer of the year .
" it 's a game based on open , attacking football .
we 're not copying anyone .
you ca n't really compare us to any other team . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barca 's style is a dream for ronaldinho " it 's a style of football that you dream about playing as a footballer , because we are given complete freedom to attack . " joan laporta , barcelona 's president , was even more effusive .
" the secret of our success is rijkaard , " laporta said .
" he is the ronaldinho of the bench . " insiders expect a flowing , open display barcelona 's former arsenal fullback giovanni van bronckhorst said the similar mentality of the two sides could make for an open contest . " both teams have played really well in the champions league this year and the philosophy of the two sides is the same , as we want to play attractive football and i think both teams have done that , " said van bronckhorst . " so this final will be something of a one-off because normally you have teams that play a bit defensively , but now you will see two teams that like to attack and so it should be a very attractive final . " " a final , though , is only a good one if you win it and we know that we are playing difficult opponents .
they now have the record for clean sheets in the champions league so that is proof of how well they defend . " " we will have to play well to beat them but we will maintain our philosophy no matter what happens . " french connection looking for élan in paris bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arsenal 's run has been a revelation arsenal 's run to their first champions league final has been down to a pragmatic streak that saw wenger opt for an unfamiliar 4-1-4-1 formation . a solid defense and a five-man midfield , with the likes of cesc fabregas , alexander hleb and robert pires streaming through in support of henry , helped account for real madrid , juventus and villarreal in the knockout rounds . wenger believes that his team will be more relaxed now that they have secured their place in europe 's top competition next year , and is certain the gunners can unlock the barcelona back four if they play their natural game . " if we do that , if we have a real go , i am convinced we can win , " said wenger , who nevertheless sounded a note of caution for the millions of fans anticipating a ' champagne ' final . many previous finals had been stifled by the fear of failure , he warned . " it 's difficult to predict .
like many finals , as long as nobody scores it stays quite locked , " wenger said .
" but because of the importance of the competition , once one team scores it will certainly be an open and crazy game . " expectations high as world 's best do battle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barca 's number 10 is up for an attacking game despite wenger 's measured assessment , ronaldinho said he doubted that the arsenal manager would send arsenal into battle with the game plan of trying to frustrate the spaniards . " i like the way wenger 's teams play because it 's attack , " ronaldinho said .
" a strong defense with players in front of them who are technically very strong , and very quick - players who know how to make a difference . " " it 's a final where you can expect to see goals .

" we 're playing football a la rijkaard , " said the two-time world footballer of the year .
" it 's a game based on open , attacking football .
we 're not copying anyone .
you ca n't really compare us to any other team . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barca 's style is a dream for ronaldinho " it 's a style of football that you dream about playing as a footballer , because we are given complete freedom to attack . " joan laporta , barcelona 's president , was even more effusive .
" the secret of our success is rijkaard , " laporta said .
" he is the ronaldinho of the bench . " insiders expect a flowing , open display barcelona 's former arsenal fullback giovanni van bronckhorst said the similar mentality of the two sides could make for an open contest . " both teams have played really well in the champions league this year and the philosophy of the two sides is the same , as we want to play attractive football and i think both teams have done that , " said van bronckhorst . " so this final will be something of a one-off because normally you have teams that play a bit defensively , but now you will see two teams that like to attack and so it should be a very attractive final . " " a final , though , is only a good one if you win it and we know that we are playing difficult opponents .
they now have the record for clean sheets in the champions league so that is proof of how well they defend . " " we will have to play well to beat them but we will maintain our philosophy no matter what happens . " french connection looking for élan in paris bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arsenal 's run has been a revelation arsenal 's run to their first champions league final has been down to a pragmatic streak that saw wenger opt for an unfamiliar 4-1-4-1 formation . a solid defense and a five-man midfield , with the likes of cesc fabregas , alexander hleb and robert pires streaming through in support of henry , helped account for real madrid , juventus and villarreal in the knockout rounds . wenger believes that his team will be more relaxed now that they have secured their place in europe 's top competition next year , and is certain the gunners can unlock the barcelona back four if they play their natural game . " if we do that , if we have a real go , i am convinced we can win , " said wenger , who nevertheless sounded a note of caution for the millions of fans anticipating a ' champagne ' final . many previous finals had been stifled by the fear of failure , he warned . " it 's difficult to predict .
like many finals , as long as nobody scores it stays quite locked , " wenger said .
" but because of the importance of the competition , once one team scores it will certainly be an open and crazy game . " expectations high as world 's best do battle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barca 's number 10 is up for an attacking game despite wenger 's measured assessment , ronaldinho said he doubted that the arsenal manager would send arsenal into battle with the game plan of trying to frustrate the spaniards . " i like the way wenger 's teams play because it 's attack , " ronaldinho said .
" a strong defense with players in front of them who are technically very strong , and very quick - players who know how to make a difference . " " it 's a final where you can expect to see goals .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.05.2006 barca capture europe 's greatest soccer prize in paris thriller großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barcelona 's carles puyol lifts the trophy after his team beat arsenal barcelona beat arsenal 2-1 to win the 2006 champions league final in a classic in the stade de france on wednesday night .
the catalans hit two goals in the last 10 minutes to turn a game which was slipping away . fans from london and barcelona had been flooding into the french capital for most of wednesday , many without tickets , for what was billed as the most exciting european cup final in years .
now known as the champions league and unrecognisible from the knock-out format of old , the prestige of the competition remains and both barcelona and arsenal traveled to paris with their eyes on the most coveted club prize in european soccer and the legacy that belongs to it .
the winners would be awarded not only the trophy known as " old big ears " but the accolade of being the best team on the continent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who got in expected a spectacle it would be a title justifiably awarded to both teams .
barcelona - with their flair and flow , led by the incredible talents of the brazilian ronaldinho - and arsenal - the aristocrats of english soccer , fronted by one of the most devastating attackers in the history of the game , thierry henry .
two teams capable of rapid attacking soccer and prodigious skill , filled with quality from back to front .
the match was sold as ronaldinho versus henry but neither team are a one-man show .
eto 'o , deco , marquez , cole , ljungberg , pires ...
both sides started the game bursting with stars .
henry presented with two chances to open account but unsurprisingly it was henry who made the first - and second - chance , initially spinning away from rafael marquez in the area after being slipped in by alex hleb only to be thwarted by valdes .
from the corner , henry whipped a vicious low shot at the keeper from distance which valdes palmed away .
the game was barely three minutes old .
the young arsenal team had set their stall out early and were dictating the pace , obviously not in awe of the team they were facing .
barca seemed stunned but only momentarily .
ludo guily was soon testing jens lehmann after ashley cole has slipped on the left .
germany 's numer one comfortably held the rising shot from the frenchman .
it was no shock that arsenal coach arsene wenger had picked out ronaldinho as barca 's main creative threat .
each time the brazilian received the ball he found two gunners stifling his progress .
due to arsenal 's crowding tactics , ronaldinho 's first effort on goal had to come from a free kick in the 15th minute but the distance was too much even for him and the shot flew well wide of lehmann 's goal .
lehmann sees red bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : early bath : lehmann gets his marching orders just when the final looked to be settling down , drama struck in paris .
a ronaldinho slide rule pass put samuel eto 'o through on goal ; lehmann raced off his line and hauled the barca attacker down on the edge of the area .
as the last man , the referee had no choice and the german keeper saw red .
arsenal substituted robert pires for manuel almunia and the new keeper 's first job was to watch ronaldinho 's free kick fly just wide .
in the following minutes , the game looked like it could boil over , swinging from beauty to ugliness in a flash of studs .
eboue scythed down van bronkhurst in a red mist and moments later kolo toure was mugged by edmilson in a revenge attack . bodies started to litter the field and the tempo suffered .
when the game recovered , barca began to dominate .
eto 'o was tormenting eboue at will on the right while guily continued to test cole on the left but despite their dominance , barca could not find a way though arsenal 's famously stingy back line .
defender campbell draws first blood and it was a stalwart from that defensive wall which remarkably broke the deadlock and made the spanish giants pay .
after eboue had been body-checked by carlos puyol on the edge of the barca area , thierry henry floated an inch perfect free kick into the six-yard box where sol campbell rose above the static catalan defense to power a towering header past valdes to put ten-men arsenal in the lead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sol campbell heads the gunners in front barcelona responded in marauding style .
wave after wave of attacks flowed as the clock ticked down to half-time and the catalans almost achieved parity in style when eto 'o spun away from the arsenal defense on the edge of the penalty area .
his shot looked destined for the top corner but almunia got a finger to the ball and tipped it on to the post .
ronaldinho swung a leg at the rebound but the volley had no direction .
the second-half started with barcelona showing more purpose .
two minutes after the restart , deco , a champions league winner with porto in 2004 , rifled a low shot straight at almunia after good work by van bommel on the right .
minutes later , barca substitute andres iniesta rode a flurry of tackles to bear down on the arsenal goal but again almunia was equal to the shot when it came .
barca camped in arsenal half in frantic search for equalizer frustration was beginning to creep into the barca players .
even a centrally located ronaldinho free-kick on the edge of the box was charged down by the arsenal defense .
seconds later , the brazilian tricked his way into the box only for his deft flick to be punched away by almunia .
arsenal were playing a dangerous game ; protecting a one-goal lead against a team full of attacking panache and hoping to hit the catalans on the break .
barca increased their attacking chances by taking off midfielder van bommel and bringing on henrik larsson with half an hour to play .
but the londoners almost got their reward for the risks they were taking .
fabregas robbed guily on the left as barca swarmed forwardand played in henry .
his square ball across the penalty area was hit firmly by hleb but the rushed shot flew wide .
five minutes later , fredi ljungberg should have sealed the match , breaking down the left and into the box before firing his shot high .
valdes touched the ball over but the resulting corner was wasted .
henry then had a great chance to get the goal he so desired when he broke free but his shot was too close to valdes .
seconds later at the other end , ronaldinho also fluffed a great chance , dragging a shot wide of the post from ten meters .
barcelona champions after two goals in three minutes fifteen minutes to go and samuel eto 'o made no such mistake .
a great ball from midfield evaded arsenal 's defense and a clever step-over by larsson allowed the ball to run to the cameroon striker who swept his shot past almunia from close range .
two minutes later and arsenal 's dream to a severe blow .
larsson again was the provider as the swede slipped a delicate reverse ball into the path of second substitute juliano belletti who cracked a shot between almunia 's legs and into the net .
arsenal were spent and had nothing in reserve as time ran out , leaving barca to run the clock down .
it was a cruel end to a brave performance from the londoners but barcelona made the extra man and , in the end , extra class pay .
the final whistle brought ecstatic scenes from the barcelona players and fans leaving the arsenal players crushed .
barcelona were european champions and deservedly so , not just from the performance on the night but for a season during which their beautiful game had lit up the global game .

that was an obvious attempt at eroding freedom of the press , says dw 's heinz dylong . the role of the german federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- is defined by law : its goal is to collect and process information about foreign countries .
the collected information is then placed at the disposal of the german government .
so far , so good . a certain grey zone emerges in the area of so-called " self-protection " of the bnd .
that 's where the bnd can also be active inside the country .
and it is far into this grey zone that the bnd pushed itself .
in order to find out the source of leaks to the press , the intelligence agency not only spied on journalists , but also used the services of the journalists who investigated their own colleagues and even kept tabs on their private lives . one could play down the whole thing and say that grey zones are simply places in which borders are crossed rather quickly .
but the procedures in this case can not be played down .
the relationship between the press and intelligence agencies in a constitutional state is too sensitive , even conflicting .
while intelligence agencies work secretly , placing the collected information only at the disposal of the government , journalistic research has as its goal to obtain information and offer it for public scrutiny . a prete n ce of self-protectio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : was the bnd purposefully interfering with freedom of the press ?
the issue got even more controversial when the bnd - under the pretense of self-protection - obtained information about the journalistic research which concerned the agency itself , its work or its possible shortcomings .
this is no longer " merely " a border violation .
this is obviously an erosion of press freedom . berlin has now decided to draw initial consequences .
the secret report about the bnd activities should be made public .
additionally , the chancellery now formally stipulated what was actually always obvious : in order to detect leaks within its ranks , the bnd will not be allowed to spy on journalists in the future . until now , operative measures which involved journalists had to be approved by top bnd officials .
this , in turn , created the impression of a certain uneasiness in those cases , which , however , was eventually ignored .
the consequences are now at hand : clarification is necessary about what was approved by which top officials in which cases and for what reason . the government spokesman justified the new directive from the chancellery by saying that freedom of the press is such a supreme good , that the interests of the bnd 's self-protection must be subordinated to it .
one could n't agree more . heinz dylong -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german mps vote to release secret report in spying scandal a parliamentary committee has decided to make public a top secret report on the role of the federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- in spying on journalists and recruiting them as informants in an effort to plug leaks .

that was an obvious attempt at eroding freedom of the press , says dw 's heinz dylong . the role of the german federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- is defined by law : its goal is to collect and process information about foreign countries .
the collected information is then placed at the disposal of the german government .
so far , so good . a certain grey zone emerges in the area of so-called " self-protection " of the bnd .
that 's where the bnd can also be active inside the country .
and it is far into this grey zone that the bnd pushed itself .
in order to find out the source of leaks to the press , the intelligence agency not only spied on journalists , but also used the services of the journalists who investigated their own colleagues and even kept tabs on their private lives . one could play down the whole thing and say that grey zones are simply places in which borders are crossed rather quickly .
but the procedures in this case can not be played down .
the relationship between the press and intelligence agencies in a constitutional state is too sensitive , even conflicting .
while intelligence agencies work secretly , placing the collected information only at the disposal of the government , journalistic research has as its goal to obtain information and offer it for public scrutiny . a prete n ce of self-protectio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : was the bnd purposefully interfering with freedom of the press ?
the issue got even more controversial when the bnd - under the pretense of self-protection - obtained information about the journalistic research which concerned the agency itself , its work or its possible shortcomings .
this is no longer " merely " a border violation .
this is obviously an erosion of press freedom . berlin has now decided to draw initial consequences .
the secret report about the bnd activities should be made public .
additionally , the chancellery now formally stipulated what was actually always obvious : in order to detect leaks within its ranks , the bnd will not be allowed to spy on journalists in the future . until now , operative measures which involved journalists had to be approved by top bnd officials .
this , in turn , created the impression of a certain uneasiness in those cases , which , however , was eventually ignored .
the consequences are now at hand : clarification is necessary about what was approved by which top officials in which cases and for what reason . the government spokesman justified the new directive from the chancellery by saying that freedom of the press is such a supreme good , that the interests of the bnd 's self-protection must be subordinated to it .
one could n't agree more . heinz dylong -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german mps vote to release secret report in spying scandal a parliamentary committee has decided to make public a top secret report on the role of the federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- in spying on journalists and recruiting them as informants in an effort to plug leaks .

however , president mahmoud ahmadinejad said wednesday iran would reject the european union deal . " they say that they want to give us incentives , " ahmadinejad told a rally in the town of arak that was carried live on state-run television .
" they think that they can take away our gold and give us some nuts and chocolate in exchange .
there is no need to give us incentives . " a light-water research reactor is considered less of a proliferation risk than a heavy-water reactor , which can produce large amounts of plutonium .
iran is currently building a heavy-water reactor . diplomacy will take place i n private bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany hosted a meeting on the iran conflict earlier this year state department spokesman sean mccormack said the united states was working very closely with the so-called eu-3 -lrb- britain , germany and france -rrb- in developing a package to offer iran . " we are making progress in the consultations , " he told reporters in washington on tuesday . " what this package would do is provide the iranian regime a choice , " mccormack said .
" we present them with a crossroads .
so they can choose to continue down the pathway of intransigence , of non-cooperation , of obfuscation , which will lead to the increased isolation of the iranian people , or they can choose a pathway of cooperation . " however , he would not name any details of the offer . " i 'm going to let the diplomacy take place in private , " mccormack said . us " pleased " about eu efforts a western diplomat told afp news service the united states could accept the idea of an international consortium providing advanced , proliferation-resistant light-water reactor assistance to iran . " but only in the context of an agreement in which iran has verifiably agreed not to pursue uranium enrichment , including research , for the foreseeable future , " the diplomat said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian mps inspect parts of the isfahan nuclear plant he said washington was pleased that the eu had " for the first time committed itself to specific united nations security council sanctions on iran if iran fails to comply . " the five permanent un security council members plus germany were expected to meet this friday in london to review the offer .
but this meeting will likely be postponed until next week . " the package has not been approved , " nicholas burns , the us under secretary of state for political affairs , said late tuesday in washington .
" it is under development . " burns said the meeting would " probably " take place next week in london .
he said the talks on new incentives were progressing . offering iran a light-water reactor needs us backing , as european companies involved in this technology would not want to endanger their business with the united states , diplomats said . a package everyo n e ca n live with washington and the eu-3 favor a security council resolution that would require compliance .
this could open the door to sanctions , and even military action , if iran continues to enrich uranium . however , russia and china oppose such a resolution , saying they fear an escalation of the crisis .
this leaves the eu powers now trying to find a negotiation package acceptable to russia and china . " the package involves iran giving up industrial-scale enrichment and agreeing to have it done in russia , " a diplomat close to the vienna-based un nuclear watchdog international atomic energy agency said . the europeans , backed by the united states , had offered benefits including help in obtaining a light-water reactor last august , but iran rejected this offer . iran would then get trade benefits - the europeans have already promised to help tehran get into the world trade organization . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu ready to help iran develop civilian nuclear power top eu officials said monday that the bloc is willing to back a " proliferation-proof " civilian nuclear program for iran and could offer " the most sophisticated " technology to help with the country 's power needs .

that was an obvious attempt at eroding freedom of the press , says dw 's heinz dylong . the role of the german federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- is defined by law : its goal is to collect and process information about foreign countries .
the collected information is then placed at the disposal of the german government .
so far , so good . a certain grey zone emerges in the area of so-called " self-protection " of the bnd .
that 's where the bnd can also be active inside the country .
and it is far into this grey zone that the bnd pushed itself .
in order to find out the source of leaks to the press , the intelligence agency not only spied on journalists , but also used the services of the journalists who investigated their own colleagues and even kept tabs on their private lives . one could play down the whole thing and say that grey zones are simply places in which borders are crossed rather quickly .
but the procedures in this case can not be played down .
the relationship between the press and intelligence agencies in a constitutional state is too sensitive , even conflicting .
while intelligence agencies work secretly , placing the collected information only at the disposal of the government , journalistic research has as its goal to obtain information and offer it for public scrutiny . a prete n ce of self-protectio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : was the bnd purposefully interfering with freedom of the press ?
the issue got even more controversial when the bnd - under the pretense of self-protection - obtained information about the journalistic research which concerned the agency itself , its work or its possible shortcomings .
this is no longer " merely " a border violation .
this is obviously an erosion of press freedom . berlin has now decided to draw initial consequences .
the secret report about the bnd activities should be made public .
additionally , the chancellery now formally stipulated what was actually always obvious : in order to detect leaks within its ranks , the bnd will not be allowed to spy on journalists in the future . until now , operative measures which involved journalists had to be approved by top bnd officials .
this , in turn , created the impression of a certain uneasiness in those cases , which , however , was eventually ignored .
the consequences are now at hand : clarification is necessary about what was approved by which top officials in which cases and for what reason . the government spokesman justified the new directive from the chancellery by saying that freedom of the press is such a supreme good , that the interests of the bnd 's self-protection must be subordinated to it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 17.05.2006 german company fills tanks with sun großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this machine can turn biomass into fuel rising oil prices remain a hot topic of discussion .
alternatives to gas are rare and biodiesel from rapeseed , for example , has n't caught on .
but there 's hope .
a saxon firm has found a way to make fuel out of biomass . fuel is simply chemically converted solar energy .
through the photosynthesis in plants , sunlight can be converted into fossil energy , such as coal and oil . it 's a principle which a resourceful tinkerer in saxony thought must be easy to copy .
in 1990 , it was still a vision .
today , the company choren in the saxon town of freiberg actually produces synthetic fuel from biomass , or plants of all kind . " the biomass goes into a multiple-stage gasification process , which undergoes the various chemical processes until it is a high-purity synthesized gas , " said managing director carlhans uhle .
" this gas in turn is converted into diesel through several processes . " choren calls its product sundiesel .
the technical term is biomass to liquids , or btl .
four kilograms of biomass , for example wood , become one liter of diesel .
but while fossil fuels developed over a period of some 400 million years , this process only takes 400 minutes in freiberg . " if you also consider the time it takes the plants to grow , then it 's around 400 days , " uhle said . a closed e n ergy cycle choren obtains the raw material for production from local farmers , saxon 's state forestry and sawmills .
since it does n't just use the plant fruit , but rather the entire plant , the output per hectare of cultivable land in btl in comparison to normal biodiesel is three to four times higher . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this " sundiesel-beetle " runs on choren 's fuel " we can take any biomass we want to , " uhle said .
" nothing negative is left over , except for a bit of slag , which can be used to tar floors .
we are a closed energy cycle . "
in view of the ongoing climate debate , this aspect was particularly important . when this fuel is burned , it releases only as much carbon dioxide previously absorbed by the plants produced for this purpose .
the fuel also contains no sooty particles and can be filled into any diesel engine without re-fitting . biomass fuel ca n be competitive sundiesel is still in the testing phase .
only a few hundred liters are produced daily .
but large automobile producers , such as daimlerchrysler and volkswagen , and the energy giant shell are already on board .
together with choren , they are building a commercial facility , which will take up operations in the coming year and produce 250 million liters -lrb- 66 million gallons -rrb- annually .
four further facilities are planned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plant-based biodiesel has n't caught on " our technicians ' forecasts say that we are at a stage with the large scale plant to be competitive , " uhle said .
" of course , it always depends on the oil price and the dollar . " with the current high oil prices , the fuel will definitely be competitive with the construction of the third facility in 2012 or 2013 - and that without further subsidies . a liter of sundiesel still costs double that of diesel from petroleum .
the production costs are high and each new plant requires 400 million euros -lrb- $ 515.8 million -rrb- in investments .
still , btl is sparking interest worldwide ; choren has had inquiries from all over europe , the united states and china . sabine kinkartz -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german drivers angry over easter gas price hike drivers in germany are becoming increasingly angry about rising prices for gasoline which have seen a new record for this year - just in time for the easter holidays .

experts are meeting in vienna this week to tackle the issue .
but is the european response to the challenge of floods sufficient ? disastrous flooding is hitting europe on a regular basis .
this spring once again , swelling rivers in central europe displaced thousands of people . " catastrophic floods endanger lives and are likely to cause human tragedy , as well as heavy economic losses , " stavros dimas , the european commissioner for the environment , said in a statement . experts are meeting in vienna this week for the european conference on flood risk management , which kicks off on wednesday .
they will be discussing various flood strategies and outlining suitable risk management based on experiences of recent floods . according to the european commission , europe suffered over 100 major damaging floods between 1998 and 2004 , including the catastrophic floods along the danube and elbe rivers in the summer of 2002 .
since 1998 , floods in europe have caused some 700 deaths and about half a million people have been forced to leave their homes .
the bill ?
at least 25 billion euros -lrb- $ 32 billion -rrb- in insured economic losses , the commission said . shari n g the burde n across europe a major problem in flood management , though , is that most of europe 's river basins , such as the elbe and danube , are shared by more than one country . " in the case of international river basins , steps must be coordinated between the member states concerned to prevent problems being passed from one area to another , " said sergey moroz from the conservation organization wwf 's european policy office in brussels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden 's famous zwinger palace was severely damaged in the 2002 floods officials at the german environmental protection non-governmental organization bund said too many countries and regions were just looking out for their own interests . " international coordination is very important , " said christian schweer from bund 's water policy unit .
" the sectionalism in europe has to stop . " cross-border cooperation is a major element of the european commission 's flood action program to improve damage prevention and reduction across member states . " this new directive will help member states choose the right tools with which to reduce the likelihood of floods and limit their impacts , " environment commissioner dimas said .
" in particular , it aims to ensure that member states cooperate in shared river basins and coastal areas to improve flood protection all over europe . " e n viro n me n tal factors must be part of floodi n g solutio n s the commission said europe is likely to see a higher flood risk and greater economic damage in the future .
climate change is expected to increase the scale and frequency of floods , it said . " floods have always existed , but in recent years , they became disasters because of human mismanagement of rivers , floodplains and catchments and inadequate land use , " moroz said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : urban development has come too close to rivers according to schweer , 80 percent of the original floodplains along the elbe and rhine rivers , for example , have been lost due to urban development and agricultural use .
" flood protection can not exclude environmental concerns , " schweer said . although the commission program does not explicitly name ecological flood control measures , the european parliament 's environment committee has put clear environmental objectives in its proposal for the directive . " it is important that rivers be given more room , " schweer said . member states will assess a n d ma n age floods the new directive proposed earlier this year builds on the eu water framework directive -lrb- wfd -rrb- , the cornerstone of the eu water protection policy . it will require member states to carry out preliminary assessments of their river basins and associated coastal areas at risk of flooding .
where flood damage risks exist , member states will develop flood risk maps . finally , flood risk management plans must be drawn up for these zones .
these are to include measures to reduce the probability of flooding and its potential consequences , such as prevention , protection , early warning , emergency response and recovery . " the current proposal is a step in the right direction , " moroz said .
" it coordinates flood management with ecological water management as required under the wfd and has the potential to mark the beginning of a new and transparent flood management approach . " bildunterschrift : even sand bags could n't hold up the water but he said a further challenge will be striking the right balance with respect to the eu solidarity funds , an instrument set up after the catastrophic floods in europe in the summer of 2002 .
it covers reconstruction after flooding events , plus other major catastrophes . " eu financial support has to ensure long-term solutions to resolve the inadequate land use and water management policies that have contributed to these catastrophic flood events , " moroz said .
rebuilding existing dikes or making them higher would only worsen the situation , he said . " hence , we call on the european commission to make sure its money does not contribute to aggravating existing problems , " moroz said . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de swelling rivers force hundreds to flee in central europe rising floodwaters this spring forced thousands in central europe to leave their homes .

however , president mahmoud ahmadinejad said wednesday iran would reject the european union deal . " they say that they want to give us incentives , " ahmadinejad told a rally in the town of arak that was carried live on state-run television .
" they think that they can take away our gold and give us some nuts and chocolate in exchange .
there is no need to give us incentives . " a light-water research reactor is considered less of a proliferation risk than a heavy-water reactor , which can produce large amounts of plutonium .
iran is currently building a heavy-water reactor . diplomacy will take place i n private bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany hosted a meeting on the iran conflict earlier this year state department spokesman sean mccormack said the united states was working very closely with the so-called eu-3 -lrb- britain , germany and france -rrb- in developing a package to offer iran . " we are making progress in the consultations , " he told reporters in washington on tuesday . " what this package would do is provide the iranian regime a choice , " mccormack said .
" we present them with a crossroads .
so they can choose to continue down the pathway of intransigence , of non-cooperation , of obfuscation , which will lead to the increased isolation of the iranian people , or they can choose a pathway of cooperation . " however , he would not name any details of the offer . " i 'm going to let the diplomacy take place in private , " mccormack said . us " pleased " about eu efforts a western diplomat told afp news service the united states could accept the idea of an international consortium providing advanced , proliferation-resistant light-water reactor assistance to iran . " but only in the context of an agreement in which iran has verifiably agreed not to pursue uranium enrichment , including research , for the foreseeable future , " the diplomat said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian mps inspect parts of the isfahan nuclear plant he said washington was pleased that the eu had " for the first time committed itself to specific united nations security council sanctions on iran if iran fails to comply . " the five permanent un security council members plus germany were expected to meet this friday in london to review the offer .
but this meeting will likely be postponed until next week . " the package has not been approved , " nicholas burns , the us under secretary of state for political affairs , said late tuesday in washington .
" it is under development . " burns said the meeting would " probably " take place next week in london .
he said the talks on new incentives were progressing . offering iran a light-water reactor needs us backing , as european companies involved in this technology would not want to endanger their business with the united states , diplomats said . a package everyo n e ca n live with washington and the eu-3 favor a security council resolution that would require compliance .
this could open the door to sanctions , and even military action , if iran continues to enrich uranium . however , russia and china oppose such a resolution , saying they fear an escalation of the crisis .
this leaves the eu powers now trying to find a negotiation package acceptable to russia and china . " the package involves iran giving up industrial-scale enrichment and agreeing to have it done in russia , " a diplomat close to the vienna-based un nuclear watchdog international atomic energy agency said . the europeans , backed by the united states , had offered benefits including help in obtaining a light-water reactor last august , but iran rejected this offer . iran would then get trade benefits - the europeans have already promised to help tehran get into the world trade organization . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu ready to help iran develop civilian nuclear power top eu officials said monday that the bloc is willing to back a " proliferation-proof " civilian nuclear program for iran and could offer " the most sophisticated " technology to help with the country 's power needs .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 17.05.2006 german company fills tanks with sun großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this machine can turn biomass into fuel rising oil prices remain a hot topic of discussion .
alternatives to gas are rare and biodiesel from rapeseed , for example , has n't caught on .
but there 's hope .
a saxon firm has found a way to make fuel out of biomass . fuel is simply chemically converted solar energy .
through the photosynthesis in plants , sunlight can be converted into fossil energy , such as coal and oil . it 's a principle which a resourceful tinkerer in saxony thought must be easy to copy .
in 1990 , it was still a vision .
today , the company choren in the saxon town of freiberg actually produces synthetic fuel from biomass , or plants of all kind . " the biomass goes into a multiple-stage gasification process , which undergoes the various chemical processes until it is a high-purity synthesized gas , " said managing director carlhans uhle .
" this gas in turn is converted into diesel through several processes . " choren calls its product sundiesel .
the technical term is biomass to liquids , or btl .
four kilograms of biomass , for example wood , become one liter of diesel .
but while fossil fuels developed over a period of some 400 million years , this process only takes 400 minutes in freiberg . " if you also consider the time it takes the plants to grow , then it 's around 400 days , " uhle said . a closed e n ergy cycle choren obtains the raw material for production from local farmers , saxon 's state forestry and sawmills .
since it does n't just use the plant fruit , but rather the entire plant , the output per hectare of cultivable land in btl in comparison to normal biodiesel is three to four times higher . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this " sundiesel-beetle " runs on choren 's fuel " we can take any biomass we want to , " uhle said .
" nothing negative is left over , except for a bit of slag , which can be used to tar floors .
we are a closed energy cycle . "
in view of the ongoing climate debate , this aspect was particularly important . when this fuel is burned , it releases only as much carbon dioxide previously absorbed by the plants produced for this purpose .
the fuel also contains no sooty particles and can be filled into any diesel engine without re-fitting . biomass fuel ca n be competitive sundiesel is still in the testing phase .
only a few hundred liters are produced daily .
but large automobile producers , such as daimlerchrysler and volkswagen , and the energy giant shell are already on board .
together with choren , they are building a commercial facility , which will take up operations in the coming year and produce 250 million liters -lrb- 66 million gallons -rrb- annually .
four further facilities are planned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plant-based biodiesel has n't caught on " our technicians ' forecasts say that we are at a stage with the large scale plant to be competitive , " uhle said .
" of course , it always depends on the oil price and the dollar . " with the current high oil prices , the fuel will definitely be competitive with the construction of the third facility in 2012 or 2013 - and that without further subsidies . a liter of sundiesel still costs double that of diesel from petroleum .
the production costs are high and each new plant requires 400 million euros -lrb- $ 515.8 million -rrb- in investments .
still , btl is sparking interest worldwide ; choren has had inquiries from all over europe , the united states and china . sabine kinkartz -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german drivers angry over easter gas price hike drivers in germany are becoming increasingly angry about rising prices for gasoline which have seen a new record for this year - just in time for the easter holidays .

the mission 's mandate is expected to start on june 30 , currently foreseen as voting day , and to be limited to four months . " we have an interest in congo endorsing peaceful , democratic development , " defense minister franz josef jung said after announcing the decision wednesday morning . the bundestag will begin debating the controversial deployment on friday and is expected to vote on it on june 1 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agreed on deployment : foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier -lrb- l . -rrb- and defense minister jung jung 's announcement was followed by sharp criticism from opposition party politician wolfgang gerhardt of the free-market liberal free democratic party , who called it one of the worst prepared missions he had ever experienced . " we ca n't just engage everywhere like with a small fire department , " he told german public broadcaster ard .
for once , a mission should be planned that resulted in a political solution , he added . the left party 's parliamentary group has already made clear it would oppose the deployment .

however , president mahmoud ahmadinejad said wednesday iran would reject the european union deal . " they say that they want to give us incentives , " ahmadinejad told a rally in the town of arak that was carried live on state-run television .
" they think that they can take away our gold and give us some nuts and chocolate in exchange .
there is no need to give us incentives . " a light-water research reactor is considered less of a proliferation risk than a heavy-water reactor , which can produce large amounts of plutonium .
iran is currently building a heavy-water reactor . diplomacy will take place i n private bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany hosted a meeting on the iran conflict earlier this year state department spokesman sean mccormack said the united states was working very closely with the so-called eu-3 -lrb- britain , germany and france -rrb- in developing a package to offer iran . " we are making progress in the consultations , " he told reporters in washington on tuesday . " what this package would do is provide the iranian regime a choice , " mccormack said .
" we present them with a crossroads .
so they can choose to continue down the pathway of intransigence , of non-cooperation , of obfuscation , which will lead to the increased isolation of the iranian people , or they can choose a pathway of cooperation . " however , he would not name any details of the offer . " i 'm going to let the diplomacy take place in private , " mccormack said . us " pleased " about eu efforts a western diplomat told afp news service the united states could accept the idea of an international consortium providing advanced , proliferation-resistant light-water reactor assistance to iran . " but only in the context of an agreement in which iran has verifiably agreed not to pursue uranium enrichment , including research , for the foreseeable future , " the diplomat said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian mps inspect parts of the isfahan nuclear plant he said washington was pleased that the eu had " for the first time committed itself to specific united nations security council sanctions on iran if iran fails to comply . " the five permanent un security council members plus germany were expected to meet this friday in london to review the offer .
but this meeting will likely be postponed until next week . " the package has not been approved , " nicholas burns , the us under secretary of state for political affairs , said late tuesday in washington .
" it is under development . " burns said the meeting would " probably " take place next week in london .
he said the talks on new incentives were progressing . offering iran a light-water reactor needs us backing , as european companies involved in this technology would not want to endanger their business with the united states , diplomats said . a package everyo n e ca n live with washington and the eu-3 favor a security council resolution that would require compliance .
this could open the door to sanctions , and even military action , if iran continues to enrich uranium . however , russia and china oppose such a resolution , saying they fear an escalation of the crisis .
this leaves the eu powers now trying to find a negotiation package acceptable to russia and china . " the package involves iran giving up industrial-scale enrichment and agreeing to have it done in russia , " a diplomat close to the vienna-based un nuclear watchdog international atomic energy agency said . the europeans , backed by the united states , had offered benefits including help in obtaining a light-water reactor last august , but iran rejected this offer . iran would then get trade benefits - the europeans have already promised to help tehran get into the world trade organization . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu ready to help iran develop civilian nuclear power top eu officials said monday that the bloc is willing to back a " proliferation-proof " civilian nuclear program for iran and could offer " the most sophisticated " technology to help with the country 's power needs .

that was an obvious attempt at eroding freedom of the press , says dw 's heinz dylong . the role of the german federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- is defined by law : its goal is to collect and process information about foreign countries .
the collected information is then placed at the disposal of the german government .
so far , so good . a certain grey zone emerges in the area of so-called " self-protection " of the bnd .
that 's where the bnd can also be active inside the country .
and it is far into this grey zone that the bnd pushed itself .
in order to find out the source of leaks to the press , the intelligence agency not only spied on journalists , but also used the services of the journalists who investigated their own colleagues and even kept tabs on their private lives . one could play down the whole thing and say that grey zones are simply places in which borders are crossed rather quickly .
but the procedures in this case can not be played down .
the relationship between the press and intelligence agencies in a constitutional state is too sensitive , even conflicting .
while intelligence agencies work secretly , placing the collected information only at the disposal of the government , journalistic research has as its goal to obtain information and offer it for public scrutiny . a prete n ce of self-protectio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : was the bnd purposefully interfering with freedom of the press ?
the issue got even more controversial when the bnd - under the pretense of self-protection - obtained information about the journalistic research which concerned the agency itself , its work or its possible shortcomings .
this is no longer " merely " a border violation .
this is obviously an erosion of press freedom . berlin has now decided to draw initial consequences .
the secret report about the bnd activities should be made public .
additionally , the chancellery now formally stipulated what was actually always obvious : in order to detect leaks within its ranks , the bnd will not be allowed to spy on journalists in the future . until now , operative measures which involved journalists had to be approved by top bnd officials .
this , in turn , created the impression of a certain uneasiness in those cases , which , however , was eventually ignored .
the consequences are now at hand : clarification is necessary about what was approved by which top officials in which cases and for what reason . the government spokesman justified the new directive from the chancellery by saying that freedom of the press is such a supreme good , that the interests of the bnd 's self-protection must be subordinated to it .
one could n't agree more . heinz dylong -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german mps vote to release secret report in spying scandal a parliamentary committee has decided to make public a top secret report on the role of the federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- in spying on journalists and recruiting them as informants in an effort to plug leaks .

however , president mahmoud ahmadinejad said wednesday iran would reject the european union deal . " they say that they want to give us incentives , " ahmadinejad told a rally in the town of arak that was carried live on state-run television .
" they think that they can take away our gold and give us some nuts and chocolate in exchange .
there is no need to give us incentives . " a light-water research reactor is considered less of a proliferation risk than a heavy-water reactor , which can produce large amounts of plutonium .
iran is currently building a heavy-water reactor . diplomacy will take place i n private bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany hosted a meeting on the iran conflict earlier this year state department spokesman sean mccormack said the united states was working very closely with the so-called eu-3 -lrb- britain , germany and france -rrb- in developing a package to offer iran . " we are making progress in the consultations , " he told reporters in washington on tuesday . " what this package would do is provide the iranian regime a choice , " mccormack said .
" we present them with a crossroads .
so they can choose to continue down the pathway of intransigence , of non-cooperation , of obfuscation , which will lead to the increased isolation of the iranian people , or they can choose a pathway of cooperation . " however , he would not name any details of the offer . " i 'm going to let the diplomacy take place in private , " mccormack said . us " pleased " about eu efforts a western diplomat told afp news service the united states could accept the idea of an international consortium providing advanced , proliferation-resistant light-water reactor assistance to iran .

but this meeting will likely be postponed until next week . " the package has not been approved , " nicholas burns , the us under secretary of state for political affairs , said late tuesday in washington .
" it is under development . " burns said the meeting would " probably " take place next week in london .
he said the talks on new incentives were progressing . offering iran a light-water reactor needs us backing , as european companies involved in this technology would not want to endanger their business with the united states , diplomats said . a package everyo n e ca n live with washington and the eu-3 favor a security council resolution that would require compliance .
this could open the door to sanctions , and even military action , if iran continues to enrich uranium . however , russia and china oppose such a resolution , saying they fear an escalation of the crisis .
this leaves the eu powers now trying to find a negotiation package acceptable to russia and china . " the package involves iran giving up industrial-scale enrichment and agreeing to have it done in russia , " a diplomat close to the vienna-based un nuclear watchdog international atomic energy agency said . the europeans , backed by the united states , had offered benefits including help in obtaining a light-water reactor last august , but iran rejected this offer . iran would then get trade benefits - the europeans have already promised to help tehran get into the world trade organization . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu ready to help iran develop civilian nuclear power top eu officials said monday that the bloc is willing to back a " proliferation-proof " civilian nuclear program for iran and could offer " the most sophisticated " technology to help with the country 's power needs .

alternatives to gas are rare and biodiesel from rapeseed , for example , has n't caught on .
but there 's hope .
a saxon firm has found a way to make fuel out of biomass . fuel is simply chemically converted solar energy .
through the photosynthesis in plants , sunlight can be converted into fossil energy , such as coal and oil . it 's a principle which a resourceful tinkerer in saxony thought must be easy to copy .
in 1990 , it was still a vision .
today , the company choren in the saxon town of freiberg actually produces synthetic fuel from biomass , or plants of all kind . " the biomass goes into a multiple-stage gasification process , which undergoes the various chemical processes until it is a high-purity synthesized gas , " said managing director carlhans uhle .
" this gas in turn is converted into diesel through several processes . " choren calls its product sundiesel .
the technical term is biomass to liquids , or btl .
four kilograms of biomass , for example wood , become one liter of diesel .
but while fossil fuels developed over a period of some 400 million years , this process only takes 400 minutes in freiberg . " if you also consider the time it takes the plants to grow , then it 's around 400 days , " uhle said . a closed e n ergy cycle choren obtains the raw material for production from local farmers , saxon 's state forestry and sawmills .
since it does n't just use the plant fruit , but rather the entire plant , the output per hectare of cultivable land in btl in comparison to normal biodiesel is three to four times higher . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this " sundiesel-beetle " runs on choren 's fuel " we can take any biomass we want to , " uhle said .
" nothing negative is left over , except for a bit of slag , which can be used to tar floors .
we are a closed energy cycle . "
in view of the ongoing climate debate , this aspect was particularly important . when this fuel is burned , it releases only as much carbon dioxide previously absorbed by the plants produced for this purpose .
the fuel also contains no sooty particles and can be filled into any diesel engine without re-fitting . biomass fuel ca n be competitive sundiesel is still in the testing phase .
only a few hundred liters are produced daily .
but large automobile producers , such as daimlerchrysler and volkswagen , and the energy giant shell are already on board .
together with choren , they are building a commercial facility , which will take up operations in the coming year and produce 250 million liters -lrb- 66 million gallons -rrb- annually .
four further facilities are planned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plant-based biodiesel has n't caught on " our technicians ' forecasts say that we are at a stage with the large scale plant to be competitive , " uhle said .
" of course , it always depends on the oil price and the dollar . " with the current high oil prices , the fuel will definitely be competitive with the construction of the third facility in 2012 or 2013 - and that without further subsidies . a liter of sundiesel still costs double that of diesel from petroleum .
the production costs are high and each new plant requires 400 million euros -lrb- $ 515.8 million -rrb- in investments .

however , president mahmoud ahmadinejad said wednesday iran would reject the european union deal . " they say that they want to give us incentives , " ahmadinejad told a rally in the town of arak that was carried live on state-run television .
" they think that they can take away our gold and give us some nuts and chocolate in exchange .
there is no need to give us incentives . " a light-water research reactor is considered less of a proliferation risk than a heavy-water reactor , which can produce large amounts of plutonium .
iran is currently building a heavy-water reactor . diplomacy will take place i n private bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany hosted a meeting on the iran conflict earlier this year state department spokesman sean mccormack said the united states was working very closely with the so-called eu-3 -lrb- britain , germany and france -rrb- in developing a package to offer iran . " we are making progress in the consultations , " he told reporters in washington on tuesday . " what this package would do is provide the iranian regime a choice , " mccormack said .
" we present them with a crossroads .
so they can choose to continue down the pathway of intransigence , of non-cooperation , of obfuscation , which will lead to the increased isolation of the iranian people , or they can choose a pathway of cooperation . " however , he would not name any details of the offer . " i 'm going to let the diplomacy take place in private , " mccormack said . us " pleased " about eu efforts a western diplomat told afp news service the united states could accept the idea of an international consortium providing advanced , proliferation-resistant light-water reactor assistance to iran . " but only in the context of an agreement in which iran has verifiably agreed not to pursue uranium enrichment , including research , for the foreseeable future , " the diplomat said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian mps inspect parts of the isfahan nuclear plant he said washington was pleased that the eu had " for the first time committed itself to specific united nations security council sanctions on iran if iran fails to comply . " the five permanent un security council members plus germany were expected to meet this friday in london to review the offer .
but this meeting will likely be postponed until next week . " the package has not been approved , " nicholas burns , the us under secretary of state for political affairs , said late tuesday in washington .
" it is under development . " burns said the meeting would " probably " take place next week in london .
he said the talks on new incentives were progressing . offering iran a light-water reactor needs us backing , as european companies involved in this technology would not want to endanger their business with the united states , diplomats said . a package everyo n e ca n live with washington and the eu-3 favor a security council resolution that would require compliance .
this could open the door to sanctions , and even military action , if iran continues to enrich uranium . however , russia and china oppose such a resolution , saying they fear an escalation of the crisis .
this leaves the eu powers now trying to find a negotiation package acceptable to russia and china . " the package involves iran giving up industrial-scale enrichment and agreeing to have it done in russia , " a diplomat close to the vienna-based un nuclear watchdog international atomic energy agency said . the europeans , backed by the united states , had offered benefits including help in obtaining a light-water reactor last august , but iran rejected this offer . iran would then get trade benefits - the europeans have already promised to help tehran get into the world trade organization . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu ready to help iran develop civilian nuclear power top eu officials said monday that the bloc is willing to back a " proliferation-proof " civilian nuclear program for iran and could offer " the most sophisticated " technology to help with the country 's power needs .

alternatives to gas are rare and biodiesel from rapeseed , for example , has n't caught on .
but there 's hope .
a saxon firm has found a way to make fuel out of biomass . fuel is simply chemically converted solar energy .
through the photosynthesis in plants , sunlight can be converted into fossil energy , such as coal and oil . it 's a principle which a resourceful tinkerer in saxony thought must be easy to copy .
in 1990 , it was still a vision .
today , the company choren in the saxon town of freiberg actually produces synthetic fuel from biomass , or plants of all kind . " the biomass goes into a multiple-stage gasification process , which undergoes the various chemical processes until it is a high-purity synthesized gas , " said managing director carlhans uhle .
" this gas in turn is converted into diesel through several processes . " choren calls its product sundiesel .
the technical term is biomass to liquids , or btl .
four kilograms of biomass , for example wood , become one liter of diesel .
but while fossil fuels developed over a period of some 400 million years , this process only takes 400 minutes in freiberg . " if you also consider the time it takes the plants to grow , then it 's around 400 days , " uhle said . a closed e n ergy cycle choren obtains the raw material for production from local farmers , saxon 's state forestry and sawmills .

" nothing negative is left over , except for a bit of slag , which can be used to tar floors .
we are a closed energy cycle . "
in view of the ongoing climate debate , this aspect was particularly important . when this fuel is burned , it releases only as much carbon dioxide previously absorbed by the plants produced for this purpose .
the fuel also contains no sooty particles and can be filled into any diesel engine without re-fitting . biomass fuel ca n be competitive sundiesel is still in the testing phase .
only a few hundred liters are produced daily .

alternatives to gas are rare and biodiesel from rapeseed , for example , has n't caught on .
but there 's hope .
a saxon firm has found a way to make fuel out of biomass . fuel is simply chemically converted solar energy .
through the photosynthesis in plants , sunlight can be converted into fossil energy , such as coal and oil . it 's a principle which a resourceful tinkerer in saxony thought must be easy to copy .
in 1990 , it was still a vision .
today , the company choren in the saxon town of freiberg actually produces synthetic fuel from biomass , or plants of all kind . " the biomass goes into a multiple-stage gasification process , which undergoes the various chemical processes until it is a high-purity synthesized gas , " said managing director carlhans uhle .
" this gas in turn is converted into diesel through several processes . " choren calls its product sundiesel .
the technical term is biomass to liquids , or btl .
four kilograms of biomass , for example wood , become one liter of diesel .
but while fossil fuels developed over a period of some 400 million years , this process only takes 400 minutes in freiberg . " if you also consider the time it takes the plants to grow , then it 's around 400 days , " uhle said . a closed e n ergy cycle choren obtains the raw material for production from local farmers , saxon 's state forestry and sawmills .
since it does n't just use the plant fruit , but rather the entire plant , the output per hectare of cultivable land in btl in comparison to normal biodiesel is three to four times higher . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this " sundiesel-beetle " runs on choren 's fuel " we can take any biomass we want to , " uhle said .
" nothing negative is left over , except for a bit of slag , which can be used to tar floors .
we are a closed energy cycle . "
in view of the ongoing climate debate , this aspect was particularly important . when this fuel is burned , it releases only as much carbon dioxide previously absorbed by the plants produced for this purpose .
the fuel also contains no sooty particles and can be filled into any diesel engine without re-fitting . biomass fuel ca n be competitive sundiesel is still in the testing phase .
only a few hundred liters are produced daily .
but large automobile producers , such as daimlerchrysler and volkswagen , and the energy giant shell are already on board .
together with choren , they are building a commercial facility , which will take up operations in the coming year and produce 250 million liters -lrb- 66 million gallons -rrb- annually .

however , president mahmoud ahmadinejad said wednesday iran would reject the european union deal . " they say that they want to give us incentives , " ahmadinejad told a rally in the town of arak that was carried live on state-run television .
" they think that they can take away our gold and give us some nuts and chocolate in exchange .
there is no need to give us incentives . " a light-water research reactor is considered less of a proliferation risk than a heavy-water reactor , which can produce large amounts of plutonium .
iran is currently building a heavy-water reactor . diplomacy will take place i n private bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany hosted a meeting on the iran conflict earlier this year state department spokesman sean mccormack said the united states was working very closely with the so-called eu-3 -lrb- britain , germany and france -rrb- in developing a package to offer iran . " we are making progress in the consultations , " he told reporters in washington on tuesday . " what this package would do is provide the iranian regime a choice , " mccormack said .
" we present them with a crossroads .
so they can choose to continue down the pathway of intransigence , of non-cooperation , of obfuscation , which will lead to the increased isolation of the iranian people , or they can choose a pathway of cooperation . " however , he would not name any details of the offer . " i 'm going to let the diplomacy take place in private , " mccormack said . us " pleased " about eu efforts a western diplomat told afp news service the united states could accept the idea of an international consortium providing advanced , proliferation-resistant light-water reactor assistance to iran . " but only in the context of an agreement in which iran has verifiably agreed not to pursue uranium enrichment , including research , for the foreseeable future , " the diplomat said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian mps inspect parts of the isfahan nuclear plant he said washington was pleased that the eu had " for the first time committed itself to specific united nations security council sanctions on iran if iran fails to comply . " the five permanent un security council members plus germany were expected to meet this friday in london to review the offer .
but this meeting will likely be postponed until next week . " the package has not been approved , " nicholas burns , the us under secretary of state for political affairs , said late tuesday in washington .
" it is under development . " burns said the meeting would " probably " take place next week in london .
he said the talks on new incentives were progressing . offering iran a light-water reactor needs us backing , as european companies involved in this technology would not want to endanger their business with the united states , diplomats said . a package everyo n e ca n live with washington and the eu-3 favor a security council resolution that would require compliance .
this could open the door to sanctions , and even military action , if iran continues to enrich uranium . however , russia and china oppose such a resolution , saying they fear an escalation of the crisis .
this leaves the eu powers now trying to find a negotiation package acceptable to russia and china . " the package involves iran giving up industrial-scale enrichment and agreeing to have it done in russia , " a diplomat close to the vienna-based un nuclear watchdog international atomic energy agency said . the europeans , backed by the united states , had offered benefits including help in obtaining a light-water reactor last august , but iran rejected this offer . iran would then get trade benefits - the europeans have already promised to help tehran get into the world trade organization . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu ready to help iran develop civilian nuclear power top eu officials said monday that the bloc is willing to back a " proliferation-proof " civilian nuclear program for iran and could offer " the most sophisticated " technology to help with the country 's power needs .

the catalans hit two goals in the last 10 minutes to turn a game which was slipping away . fans from london and barcelona had been flooding into the french capital for most of wednesday , many without tickets , for what was billed as the most exciting european cup final in years .
now known as the champions league and unrecognisible from the knock-out format of old , the prestige of the competition remains and both barcelona and arsenal traveled to paris with their eyes on the most coveted club prize in european soccer and the legacy that belongs to it .
the winners would be awarded not only the trophy known as " old big ears " but the accolade of being the best team on the continent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who got in expected a spectacle it would be a title justifiably awarded to both teams .
barcelona - with their flair and flow , led by the incredible talents of the brazilian ronaldinho - and arsenal - the aristocrats of english soccer , fronted by one of the most devastating attackers in the history of the game , thierry henry .
two teams capable of rapid attacking soccer and prodigious skill , filled with quality from back to front .
the match was sold as ronaldinho versus henry but neither team are a one-man show .
eto 'o , deco , marquez , cole , ljungberg , pires ...
both sides started the game bursting with stars .
henry presented with two chances to open account but unsurprisingly it was henry who made the first - and second - chance , initially spinning away from rafael marquez in the area after being slipped in by alex hleb only to be thwarted by valdes .
from the corner , henry whipped a vicious low shot at the keeper from distance which valdes palmed away .
the game was barely three minutes old .
the young arsenal team had set their stall out early and were dictating the pace , obviously not in awe of the team they were facing .
barca seemed stunned but only momentarily .
ludo guily was soon testing jens lehmann after ashley cole has slipped on the left .
germany 's numer one comfortably held the rising shot from the frenchman .
it was no shock that arsenal coach arsene wenger had picked out ronaldinho as barca 's main creative threat .
each time the brazilian received the ball he found two gunners stifling his progress .
due to arsenal 's crowding tactics , ronaldinho 's first effort on goal had to come from a free kick in the 15th minute but the distance was too much even for him and the shot flew well wide of lehmann 's goal .
lehmann sees red bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : early bath : lehmann gets his marching orders just when the final looked to be settling down , drama struck in paris .
a ronaldinho slide rule pass put samuel eto 'o through on goal ; lehmann raced off his line and hauled the barca attacker down on the edge of the area .
as the last man , the referee had no choice and the german keeper saw red .
arsenal substituted robert pires for manuel almunia and the new keeper 's first job was to watch ronaldinho 's free kick fly just wide .
in the following minutes , the game looked like it could boil over , swinging from beauty to ugliness in a flash of studs .
eboue scythed down van bronkhurst in a red mist and moments later kolo toure was mugged by edmilson in a revenge attack . bodies started to litter the field and the tempo suffered .
when the game recovered , barca began to dominate .
eto 'o was tormenting eboue at will on the right while guily continued to test cole on the left but despite their dominance , barca could not find a way though arsenal 's famously stingy back line .
defender campbell draws first blood and it was a stalwart from that defensive wall which remarkably broke the deadlock and made the spanish giants pay .
after eboue had been body-checked by carlos puyol on the edge of the barca area , thierry henry floated an inch perfect free kick into the six-yard box where sol campbell rose above the static catalan defense to power a towering header past valdes to put ten-men arsenal in the lead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sol campbell heads the gunners in front barcelona responded in marauding style .
wave after wave of attacks flowed as the clock ticked down to half-time and the catalans almost achieved parity in style when eto 'o spun away from the arsenal defense on the edge of the penalty area .
his shot looked destined for the top corner but almunia got a finger to the ball and tipped it on to the post .
ronaldinho swung a leg at the rebound but the volley had no direction .
the second-half started with barcelona showing more purpose .
two minutes after the restart , deco , a champions league winner with porto in 2004 , rifled a low shot straight at almunia after good work by van bommel on the right .
minutes later , barca substitute andres iniesta rode a flurry of tackles to bear down on the arsenal goal but again almunia was equal to the shot when it came .
barca camped in arsenal half in frantic search for equalizer frustration was beginning to creep into the barca players .
even a centrally located ronaldinho free-kick on the edge of the box was charged down by the arsenal defense .
seconds later , the brazilian tricked his way into the box only for his deft flick to be punched away by almunia .
arsenal were playing a dangerous game ; protecting a one-goal lead against a team full of attacking panache and hoping to hit the catalans on the break .
barca increased their attacking chances by taking off midfielder van bommel and bringing on henrik larsson with half an hour to play .
but the londoners almost got their reward for the risks they were taking .
fabregas robbed guily on the left as barca swarmed forwardand played in henry .
his square ball across the penalty area was hit firmly by hleb but the rushed shot flew wide .
five minutes later , fredi ljungberg should have sealed the match , breaking down the left and into the box before firing his shot high .
valdes touched the ball over but the resulting corner was wasted .
henry then had a great chance to get the goal he so desired when he broke free but his shot was too close to valdes .
seconds later at the other end , ronaldinho also fluffed a great chance , dragging a shot wide of the post from ten meters .
barcelona champions after two goals in three minutes fifteen minutes to go and samuel eto 'o made no such mistake .
a great ball from midfield evaded arsenal 's defense and a clever step-over by larsson allowed the ball to run to the cameroon striker who swept his shot past almunia from close range .
two minutes later and arsenal 's dream to a severe blow .
larsson again was the provider as the swede slipped a delicate reverse ball into the path of second substitute juliano belletti who cracked a shot between almunia 's legs and into the net .
arsenal were spent and had nothing in reserve as time ran out , leaving barca to run the clock down .
it was a cruel end to a brave performance from the londoners but barcelona made the extra man and , in the end , extra class pay .
the final whistle brought ecstatic scenes from the barcelona players and fans leaving the arsenal players crushed .
barcelona were european champions and deservedly so , not just from the performance on the night but for a season during which their beautiful game had lit up the global game .

d 'alema , 57 , will also hold one of two deputy prime ministerial positions along with francesco rutelli , who doubles as culture minister . prodi was formally sworn in as prime minister by president giorgio napolitano ahead of his 25-member cabinet , ushering in a new era in italian politics after his victory in last month 's general elections , which is still being contested by the ousted center-right . the appointment of the 65-year-old technocrat padoa-schioppa as economics minister is likely to be seen by the markets and international financial bodies as a promise of measures to reduce public debt , which mushroomed under the outgoing conservative government of silvio berlusconi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : padoa-schioppa 's presence in the cabinet may reassure the business-minded prodi , a former european commission president , was only able to complete his list after haggling within his nine-party coalition over key posts , which went on until the early hours of wednesday .
the bickering underlines the problems prodi is likely to face in government as he defends a razor-thin parliamentary majority after the closest italian election in living memory . " there is a great desire for a new start combined with a desire for cohesion and unity , " prodi said after announcing his cabinet .
" the first commitment will be to rebuild a spirit of solidarity and a consensus on the goals needed for the country to move forward , and that means lowering the level of tension and litigiousness , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi eventually made way for democrats union for europe -lrb- udeur -rrb- leader mastella his ministerial list featured a surprise choice of clemente mastella , leader of the small catholic udeur party , as justice minister .
mastella , whose party holds three senate seats , had threatened to pull out of the government if he was not handed a key ministry . the government is dominated by the two biggest center-left parties , the democrats of the left and the centrist margherita , while prodi is one of five independents .
it includes one communist , paolo ferrero of the refoundation communist party , who will have responsibility for welfare , and six women - four more than the outgoing center-right government .
alessandro bianchi , who is an independent but is closely associated with the smaller italian communist party , will take charge of transport .
more left-leaning than expected the corriere della sera newspaper said in a front page editorial the new government was more left-leaning than had been anticipated . " a government is born that is weighted to the left , even more than expected by the majority of those who elected it and the natural orientation of the coalition , " it said . the surprise choice of mastella for the justice ministry was an early blow to leftists in the disparate coalition who have pledged wide-ranging social reform , not least the state recognition of same-sex couples - fiercely opposed by pope benedict xvi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amato will take charge of the interior ministry former anti-corruption judge antonio di pietro , who led the " clean hands " investigation into the links between big business and politics a decade ago , has been handed the infrastructure portfolio .
giuliano amato , former vice chairman of the european convention , which wrote the european union 's stalled constitution , will be interior minister in the new government . prodi said he would go before the senate with a confidence motion on thursday .
a vote in senate , where he holds a two-seat majority , is likely on friday .

the catalans hit two goals in the last 10 minutes to turn a game which was slipping away . fans from london and barcelona had been flooding into the french capital for most of wednesday , many without tickets , for what was billed as the most exciting european cup final in years .
now known as the champions league and unrecognisible from the knock-out format of old , the prestige of the competition remains and both barcelona and arsenal traveled to paris with their eyes on the most coveted club prize in european soccer and the legacy that belongs to it .
the winners would be awarded not only the trophy known as " old big ears " but the accolade of being the best team on the continent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who got in expected a spectacle it would be a title justifiably awarded to both teams .
barcelona - with their flair and flow , led by the incredible talents of the brazilian ronaldinho - and arsenal - the aristocrats of english soccer , fronted by one of the most devastating attackers in the history of the game , thierry henry .
two teams capable of rapid attacking soccer and prodigious skill , filled with quality from back to front .
the match was sold as ronaldinho versus henry but neither team are a one-man show .
eto 'o , deco , marquez , cole , ljungberg , pires ...
both sides started the game bursting with stars .
henry presented with two chances to open account but unsurprisingly it was henry who made the first - and second - chance , initially spinning away from rafael marquez in the area after being slipped in by alex hleb only to be thwarted by valdes .
from the corner , henry whipped a vicious low shot at the keeper from distance which valdes palmed away .
the game was barely three minutes old .
the young arsenal team had set their stall out early and were dictating the pace , obviously not in awe of the team they were facing .
barca seemed stunned but only momentarily .
ludo guily was soon testing jens lehmann after ashley cole has slipped on the left .
germany 's numer one comfortably held the rising shot from the frenchman .
it was no shock that arsenal coach arsene wenger had picked out ronaldinho as barca 's main creative threat .
each time the brazilian received the ball he found two gunners stifling his progress .
due to arsenal 's crowding tactics , ronaldinho 's first effort on goal had to come from a free kick in the 15th minute but the distance was too much even for him and the shot flew well wide of lehmann 's goal .
lehmann sees red bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : early bath : lehmann gets his marching orders just when the final looked to be settling down , drama struck in paris .
a ronaldinho slide rule pass put samuel eto 'o through on goal ; lehmann raced off his line and hauled the barca attacker down on the edge of the area .
as the last man , the referee had no choice and the german keeper saw red .
arsenal substituted robert pires for manuel almunia and the new keeper 's first job was to watch ronaldinho 's free kick fly just wide .
in the following minutes , the game looked like it could boil over , swinging from beauty to ugliness in a flash of studs .
eboue scythed down van bronkhurst in a red mist and moments later kolo toure was mugged by edmilson in a revenge attack . bodies started to litter the field and the tempo suffered .
when the game recovered , barca began to dominate .
eto 'o was tormenting eboue at will on the right while guily continued to test cole on the left but despite their dominance , barca could not find a way though arsenal 's famously stingy back line .
defender campbell draws first blood and it was a stalwart from that defensive wall which remarkably broke the deadlock and made the spanish giants pay .
after eboue had been body-checked by carlos puyol on the edge of the barca area , thierry henry floated an inch perfect free kick into the six-yard box where sol campbell rose above the static catalan defense to power a towering header past valdes to put ten-men arsenal in the lead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sol campbell heads the gunners in front barcelona responded in marauding style .
wave after wave of attacks flowed as the clock ticked down to half-time and the catalans almost achieved parity in style when eto 'o spun away from the arsenal defense on the edge of the penalty area .
his shot looked destined for the top corner but almunia got a finger to the ball and tipped it on to the post .
ronaldinho swung a leg at the rebound but the volley had no direction .
the second-half started with barcelona showing more purpose .
two minutes after the restart , deco , a champions league winner with porto in 2004 , rifled a low shot straight at almunia after good work by van bommel on the right .
minutes later , barca substitute andres iniesta rode a flurry of tackles to bear down on the arsenal goal but again almunia was equal to the shot when it came .
barca camped in arsenal half in frantic search for equalizer frustration was beginning to creep into the barca players .
even a centrally located ronaldinho free-kick on the edge of the box was charged down by the arsenal defense .
seconds later , the brazilian tricked his way into the box only for his deft flick to be punched away by almunia .
arsenal were playing a dangerous game ; protecting a one-goal lead against a team full of attacking panache and hoping to hit the catalans on the break .
barca increased their attacking chances by taking off midfielder van bommel and bringing on henrik larsson with half an hour to play .
but the londoners almost got their reward for the risks they were taking .
fabregas robbed guily on the left as barca swarmed forwardand played in henry .
his square ball across the penalty area was hit firmly by hleb but the rushed shot flew wide .
five minutes later , fredi ljungberg should have sealed the match , breaking down the left and into the box before firing his shot high .
valdes touched the ball over but the resulting corner was wasted .
henry then had a great chance to get the goal he so desired when he broke free but his shot was too close to valdes .
seconds later at the other end , ronaldinho also fluffed a great chance , dragging a shot wide of the post from ten meters .
barcelona champions after two goals in three minutes fifteen minutes to go and samuel eto 'o made no such mistake .
a great ball from midfield evaded arsenal 's defense and a clever step-over by larsson allowed the ball to run to the cameroon striker who swept his shot past almunia from close range .
two minutes later and arsenal 's dream to a severe blow .
larsson again was the provider as the swede slipped a delicate reverse ball into the path of second substitute juliano belletti who cracked a shot between almunia 's legs and into the net .
arsenal were spent and had nothing in reserve as time ran out , leaving barca to run the clock down .
it was a cruel end to a brave performance from the londoners but barcelona made the extra man and , in the end , extra class pay .
the final whistle brought ecstatic scenes from the barcelona players and fans leaving the arsenal players crushed .
barcelona were european champions and deservedly so , not just from the performance on the night but for a season during which their beautiful game had lit up the global game .

" we 're playing football a la rijkaard , " said the two-time world footballer of the year .
" it 's a game based on open , attacking football .
we 're not copying anyone .
you ca n't really compare us to any other team . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barca 's style is a dream for ronaldinho " it 's a style of football that you dream about playing as a footballer , because we are given complete freedom to attack . " joan laporta , barcelona 's president , was even more effusive .
" the secret of our success is rijkaard , " laporta said .
" he is the ronaldinho of the bench . " insiders expect a flowing , open display barcelona 's former arsenal fullback giovanni van bronckhorst said the similar mentality of the two sides could make for an open contest . " both teams have played really well in the champions league this year and the philosophy of the two sides is the same , as we want to play attractive football and i think both teams have done that , " said van bronckhorst . " so this final will be something of a one-off because normally you have teams that play a bit defensively , but now you will see two teams that like to attack and so it should be a very attractive final . " " a final , though , is only a good one if you win it and we know that we are playing difficult opponents .
they now have the record for clean sheets in the champions league so that is proof of how well they defend . " " we will have to play well to beat them but we will maintain our philosophy no matter what happens . " french connection looking for élan in paris bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arsenal 's run has been a revelation arsenal 's run to their first champions league final has been down to a pragmatic streak that saw wenger opt for an unfamiliar 4-1-4-1 formation . a solid defense and a five-man midfield , with the likes of cesc fabregas , alexander hleb and robert pires streaming through in support of henry , helped account for real madrid , juventus and villarreal in the knockout rounds . wenger believes that his team will be more relaxed now that they have secured their place in europe 's top competition next year , and is certain the gunners can unlock the barcelona back four if they play their natural game . " if we do that , if we have a real go , i am convinced we can win , " said wenger , who nevertheless sounded a note of caution for the millions of fans anticipating a ' champagne ' final . many previous finals had been stifled by the fear of failure , he warned . " it 's difficult to predict .
like many finals , as long as nobody scores it stays quite locked , " wenger said .
" but because of the importance of the competition , once one team scores it will certainly be an open and crazy game .

d 'alema , 57 , will also hold one of two deputy prime ministerial positions along with francesco rutelli , who doubles as culture minister . prodi was formally sworn in as prime minister by president giorgio napolitano ahead of his 25-member cabinet , ushering in a new era in italian politics after his victory in last month 's general elections , which is still being contested by the ousted center-right . the appointment of the 65-year-old technocrat padoa-schioppa as economics minister is likely to be seen by the markets and international financial bodies as a promise of measures to reduce public debt , which mushroomed under the outgoing conservative government of silvio berlusconi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : padoa-schioppa 's presence in the cabinet may reassure the business-minded prodi , a former european commission president , was only able to complete his list after haggling within his nine-party coalition over key posts , which went on until the early hours of wednesday .
the bickering underlines the problems prodi is likely to face in government as he defends a razor-thin parliamentary majority after the closest italian election in living memory . " there is a great desire for a new start combined with a desire for cohesion and unity , " prodi said after announcing his cabinet .
" the first commitment will be to rebuild a spirit of solidarity and a consensus on the goals needed for the country to move forward , and that means lowering the level of tension and litigiousness , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi eventually made way for democrats union for europe -lrb- udeur -rrb- leader mastella his ministerial list featured a surprise choice of clemente mastella , leader of the small catholic udeur party , as justice minister .
mastella , whose party holds three senate seats , had threatened to pull out of the government if he was not handed a key ministry . the government is dominated by the two biggest center-left parties , the democrats of the left and the centrist margherita , while prodi is one of five independents .
it includes one communist , paolo ferrero of the refoundation communist party , who will have responsibility for welfare , and six women - four more than the outgoing center-right government .
alessandro bianchi , who is an independent but is closely associated with the smaller italian communist party , will take charge of transport .
more left-leaning than expected the corriere della sera newspaper said in a front page editorial the new government was more left-leaning than had been anticipated . " a government is born that is weighted to the left , even more than expected by the majority of those who elected it and the natural orientation of the coalition , " it said . the surprise choice of mastella for the justice ministry was an early blow to leftists in the disparate coalition who have pledged wide-ranging social reform , not least the state recognition of same-sex couples - fiercely opposed by pope benedict xvi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amato will take charge of the interior ministry former anti-corruption judge antonio di pietro , who led the " clean hands " investigation into the links between big business and politics a decade ago , has been handed the infrastructure portfolio .
giuliano amato , former vice chairman of the european convention , which wrote the european union 's stalled constitution , will be interior minister in the new government . prodi said he would go before the senate with a confidence motion on thursday .
a vote in senate , where he holds a two-seat majority , is likely on friday .

" we 're playing football a la rijkaard , " said the two-time world footballer of the year .
" it 's a game based on open , attacking football .
we 're not copying anyone .
you ca n't really compare us to any other team . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barca 's style is a dream for ronaldinho " it 's a style of football that you dream about playing as a footballer , because we are given complete freedom to attack . " joan laporta , barcelona 's president , was even more effusive .
" the secret of our success is rijkaard , " laporta said .
" he is the ronaldinho of the bench . " insiders expect a flowing , open display barcelona 's former arsenal fullback giovanni van bronckhorst said the similar mentality of the two sides could make for an open contest . " both teams have played really well in the champions league this year and the philosophy of the two sides is the same , as we want to play attractive football and i think both teams have done that , " said van bronckhorst . " so this final will be something of a one-off because normally you have teams that play a bit defensively , but now you will see two teams that like to attack and so it should be a very attractive final . " " a final , though , is only a good one if you win it and we know that we are playing difficult opponents .
they now have the record for clean sheets in the champions league so that is proof of how well they defend . " " we will have to play well to beat them but we will maintain our philosophy no matter what happens . " french connection looking for élan in paris bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arsenal 's run has been a revelation arsenal 's run to their first champions league final has been down to a pragmatic streak that saw wenger opt for an unfamiliar 4-1-4-1 formation . a solid defense and a five-man midfield , with the likes of cesc fabregas , alexander hleb and robert pires streaming through in support of henry , helped account for real madrid , juventus and villarreal in the knockout rounds . wenger believes that his team will be more relaxed now that they have secured their place in europe 's top competition next year , and is certain the gunners can unlock the barcelona back four if they play their natural game . " if we do that , if we have a real go , i am convinced we can win , " said wenger , who nevertheless sounded a note of caution for the millions of fans anticipating a ' champagne ' final . many previous finals had been stifled by the fear of failure , he warned . " it 's difficult to predict .
like many finals , as long as nobody scores it stays quite locked , " wenger said .
" but because of the importance of the competition , once one team scores it will certainly be an open and crazy game . " expectations high as world 's best do battle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barca 's number 10 is up for an attacking game despite wenger 's measured assessment , ronaldinho said he doubted that the arsenal manager would send arsenal into battle with the game plan of trying to frustrate the spaniards . " i like the way wenger 's teams play because it 's attack , " ronaldinho said .
" a strong defense with players in front of them who are technically very strong , and very quick - players who know how to make a difference . " " it 's a final where you can expect to see goals .

the catalans hit two goals in the last 10 minutes to turn a game which was slipping away . fans from london and barcelona had been flooding into the french capital for most of wednesday , many without tickets , for what was billed as the most exciting european cup final in years .
now known as the champions league and unrecognisible from the knock-out format of old , the prestige of the competition remains and both barcelona and arsenal traveled to paris with their eyes on the most coveted club prize in european soccer and the legacy that belongs to it .
the winners would be awarded not only the trophy known as " old big ears " but the accolade of being the best team on the continent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who got in expected a spectacle it would be a title justifiably awarded to both teams .
barcelona - with their flair and flow , led by the incredible talents of the brazilian ronaldinho - and arsenal - the aristocrats of english soccer , fronted by one of the most devastating attackers in the history of the game , thierry henry .
two teams capable of rapid attacking soccer and prodigious skill , filled with quality from back to front .
the match was sold as ronaldinho versus henry but neither team are a one-man show .
eto 'o , deco , marquez , cole , ljungberg , pires ...
both sides started the game bursting with stars .
henry presented with two chances to open account but unsurprisingly it was henry who made the first - and second - chance , initially spinning away from rafael marquez in the area after being slipped in by alex hleb only to be thwarted by valdes .
from the corner , henry whipped a vicious low shot at the keeper from distance which valdes palmed away .
the game was barely three minutes old .
the young arsenal team had set their stall out early and were dictating the pace , obviously not in awe of the team they were facing .
barca seemed stunned but only momentarily .
ludo guily was soon testing jens lehmann after ashley cole has slipped on the left .
germany 's numer one comfortably held the rising shot from the frenchman .
it was no shock that arsenal coach arsene wenger had picked out ronaldinho as barca 's main creative threat .
each time the brazilian received the ball he found two gunners stifling his progress .
due to arsenal 's crowding tactics , ronaldinho 's first effort on goal had to come from a free kick in the 15th minute but the distance was too much even for him and the shot flew well wide of lehmann 's goal .
lehmann sees red bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : early bath : lehmann gets his marching orders just when the final looked to be settling down , drama struck in paris .
a ronaldinho slide rule pass put samuel eto 'o through on goal ; lehmann raced off his line and hauled the barca attacker down on the edge of the area .
as the last man , the referee had no choice and the german keeper saw red .
arsenal substituted robert pires for manuel almunia and the new keeper 's first job was to watch ronaldinho 's free kick fly just wide .
in the following minutes , the game looked like it could boil over , swinging from beauty to ugliness in a flash of studs .
eboue scythed down van bronkhurst in a red mist and moments later kolo toure was mugged by edmilson in a revenge attack . bodies started to litter the field and the tempo suffered .
when the game recovered , barca began to dominate .
eto 'o was tormenting eboue at will on the right while guily continued to test cole on the left but despite their dominance , barca could not find a way though arsenal 's famously stingy back line .
defender campbell draws first blood and it was a stalwart from that defensive wall which remarkably broke the deadlock and made the spanish giants pay .
after eboue had been body-checked by carlos puyol on the edge of the barca area , thierry henry floated an inch perfect free kick into the six-yard box where sol campbell rose above the static catalan defense to power a towering header past valdes to put ten-men arsenal in the lead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sol campbell heads the gunners in front barcelona responded in marauding style .
wave after wave of attacks flowed as the clock ticked down to half-time and the catalans almost achieved parity in style when eto 'o spun away from the arsenal defense on the edge of the penalty area .
his shot looked destined for the top corner but almunia got a finger to the ball and tipped it on to the post .
ronaldinho swung a leg at the rebound but the volley had no direction .
the second-half started with barcelona showing more purpose .
two minutes after the restart , deco , a champions league winner with porto in 2004 , rifled a low shot straight at almunia after good work by van bommel on the right .
minutes later , barca substitute andres iniesta rode a flurry of tackles to bear down on the arsenal goal but again almunia was equal to the shot when it came .
barca camped in arsenal half in frantic search for equalizer frustration was beginning to creep into the barca players .
even a centrally located ronaldinho free-kick on the edge of the box was charged down by the arsenal defense .
seconds later , the brazilian tricked his way into the box only for his deft flick to be punched away by almunia .
arsenal were playing a dangerous game ; protecting a one-goal lead against a team full of attacking panache and hoping to hit the catalans on the break .
barca increased their attacking chances by taking off midfielder van bommel and bringing on henrik larsson with half an hour to play .
but the londoners almost got their reward for the risks they were taking .
fabregas robbed guily on the left as barca swarmed forwardand played in henry .
his square ball across the penalty area was hit firmly by hleb but the rushed shot flew wide .
five minutes later , fredi ljungberg should have sealed the match , breaking down the left and into the box before firing his shot high .
valdes touched the ball over but the resulting corner was wasted .
henry then had a great chance to get the goal he so desired when he broke free but his shot was too close to valdes .
seconds later at the other end , ronaldinho also fluffed a great chance , dragging a shot wide of the post from ten meters .
barcelona champions after two goals in three minutes fifteen minutes to go and samuel eto 'o made no such mistake .
a great ball from midfield evaded arsenal 's defense and a clever step-over by larsson allowed the ball to run to the cameroon striker who swept his shot past almunia from close range .
two minutes later and arsenal 's dream to a severe blow .
larsson again was the provider as the swede slipped a delicate reverse ball into the path of second substitute juliano belletti who cracked a shot between almunia 's legs and into the net .
arsenal were spent and had nothing in reserve as time ran out , leaving barca to run the clock down .
it was a cruel end to a brave performance from the londoners but barcelona made the extra man and , in the end , extra class pay .
the final whistle brought ecstatic scenes from the barcelona players and fans leaving the arsenal players crushed .
barcelona were european champions and deservedly so , not just from the performance on the night but for a season during which their beautiful game had lit up the global game .

d 'alema , 57 , will also hold one of two deputy prime ministerial positions along with francesco rutelli , who doubles as culture minister . prodi was formally sworn in as prime minister by president giorgio napolitano ahead of his 25-member cabinet , ushering in a new era in italian politics after his victory in last month 's general elections , which is still being contested by the ousted center-right . the appointment of the 65-year-old technocrat padoa-schioppa as economics minister is likely to be seen by the markets and international financial bodies as a promise of measures to reduce public debt , which mushroomed under the outgoing conservative government of silvio berlusconi .

" there is a great desire for a new start combined with a desire for cohesion and unity , " prodi said after announcing his cabinet .

d 'alema , 57 , will also hold one of two deputy prime ministerial positions along with francesco rutelli , who doubles as culture minister . prodi was formally sworn in as prime minister by president giorgio napolitano ahead of his 25-member cabinet , ushering in a new era in italian politics after his victory in last month 's general elections , which is still being contested by the ousted center-right . the appointment of the 65-year-old technocrat padoa-schioppa as economics minister is likely to be seen by the markets and international financial bodies as a promise of measures to reduce public debt , which mushroomed under the outgoing conservative government of silvio berlusconi .

the catalans hit two goals in the last 10 minutes to turn a game which was slipping away . fans from london and barcelona had been flooding into the french capital for most of wednesday , many without tickets , for what was billed as the most exciting european cup final in years .
now known as the champions league and unrecognisible from the knock-out format of old , the prestige of the competition remains and both barcelona and arsenal traveled to paris with their eyes on the most coveted club prize in european soccer and the legacy that belongs to it .
the winners would be awarded not only the trophy known as " old big ears " but the accolade of being the best team on the continent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who got in expected a spectacle it would be a title justifiably awarded to both teams .
barcelona - with their flair and flow , led by the incredible talents of the brazilian ronaldinho - and arsenal - the aristocrats of english soccer , fronted by one of the most devastating attackers in the history of the game , thierry henry .
two teams capable of rapid attacking soccer and prodigious skill , filled with quality from back to front .
the match was sold as ronaldinho versus henry but neither team are a one-man show .
eto 'o , deco , marquez , cole , ljungberg , pires ...
both sides started the game bursting with stars .
henry presented with two chances to open account but unsurprisingly it was henry who made the first - and second - chance , initially spinning away from rafael marquez in the area after being slipped in by alex hleb only to be thwarted by valdes .
from the corner , henry whipped a vicious low shot at the keeper from distance which valdes palmed away .
the game was barely three minutes old .
the young arsenal team had set their stall out early and were dictating the pace , obviously not in awe of the team they were facing .
barca seemed stunned but only momentarily .
ludo guily was soon testing jens lehmann after ashley cole has slipped on the left .
germany 's numer one comfortably held the rising shot from the frenchman .
it was no shock that arsenal coach arsene wenger had picked out ronaldinho as barca 's main creative threat .
each time the brazilian received the ball he found two gunners stifling his progress .
due to arsenal 's crowding tactics , ronaldinho 's first effort on goal had to come from a free kick in the 15th minute but the distance was too much even for him and the shot flew well wide of lehmann 's goal .
lehmann sees red bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : early bath : lehmann gets his marching orders just when the final looked to be settling down , drama struck in paris .
a ronaldinho slide rule pass put samuel eto 'o through on goal ; lehmann raced off his line and hauled the barca attacker down on the edge of the area .
as the last man , the referee had no choice and the german keeper saw red .
arsenal substituted robert pires for manuel almunia and the new keeper 's first job was to watch ronaldinho 's free kick fly just wide .
in the following minutes , the game looked like it could boil over , swinging from beauty to ugliness in a flash of studs .
eboue scythed down van bronkhurst in a red mist and moments later kolo toure was mugged by edmilson in a revenge attack . bodies started to litter the field and the tempo suffered .
when the game recovered , barca began to dominate .
eto 'o was tormenting eboue at will on the right while guily continued to test cole on the left but despite their dominance , barca could not find a way though arsenal 's famously stingy back line .
defender campbell draws first blood and it was a stalwart from that defensive wall which remarkably broke the deadlock and made the spanish giants pay .
after eboue had been body-checked by carlos puyol on the edge of the barca area , thierry henry floated an inch perfect free kick into the six-yard box where sol campbell rose above the static catalan defense to power a towering header past valdes to put ten-men arsenal in the lead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sol campbell heads the gunners in front barcelona responded in marauding style .
wave after wave of attacks flowed as the clock ticked down to half-time and the catalans almost achieved parity in style when eto 'o spun away from the arsenal defense on the edge of the penalty area .
his shot looked destined for the top corner but almunia got a finger to the ball and tipped it on to the post .
ronaldinho swung a leg at the rebound but the volley had no direction .
the second-half started with barcelona showing more purpose .
two minutes after the restart , deco , a champions league winner with porto in 2004 , rifled a low shot straight at almunia after good work by van bommel on the right .
minutes later , barca substitute andres iniesta rode a flurry of tackles to bear down on the arsenal goal but again almunia was equal to the shot when it came .
barca camped in arsenal half in frantic search for equalizer frustration was beginning to creep into the barca players .
even a centrally located ronaldinho free-kick on the edge of the box was charged down by the arsenal defense .
seconds later , the brazilian tricked his way into the box only for his deft flick to be punched away by almunia .
arsenal were playing a dangerous game ; protecting a one-goal lead against a team full of attacking panache and hoping to hit the catalans on the break .
barca increased their attacking chances by taking off midfielder van bommel and bringing on henrik larsson with half an hour to play .
but the londoners almost got their reward for the risks they were taking .
fabregas robbed guily on the left as barca swarmed forwardand played in henry .
his square ball across the penalty area was hit firmly by hleb but the rushed shot flew wide .
five minutes later , fredi ljungberg should have sealed the match , breaking down the left and into the box before firing his shot high .
valdes touched the ball over but the resulting corner was wasted .
henry then had a great chance to get the goal he so desired when he broke free but his shot was too close to valdes .
seconds later at the other end , ronaldinho also fluffed a great chance , dragging a shot wide of the post from ten meters .
barcelona champions after two goals in three minutes fifteen minutes to go and samuel eto 'o made no such mistake .
a great ball from midfield evaded arsenal 's defense and a clever step-over by larsson allowed the ball to run to the cameroon striker who swept his shot past almunia from close range .
two minutes later and arsenal 's dream to a severe blow .
larsson again was the provider as the swede slipped a delicate reverse ball into the path of second substitute juliano belletti who cracked a shot between almunia 's legs and into the net .
arsenal were spent and had nothing in reserve as time ran out , leaving barca to run the clock down .
it was a cruel end to a brave performance from the londoners but barcelona made the extra man and , in the end , extra class pay .
the final whistle brought ecstatic scenes from the barcelona players and fans leaving the arsenal players crushed .
barcelona were european champions and deservedly so , not just from the performance on the night but for a season during which their beautiful game had lit up the global game .

wave after wave of attacks flowed as the clock ticked down to half-time and the catalans almost achieved parity in style when eto 'o spun away from the arsenal defense on the edge of the penalty area .
his shot looked destined for the top corner but almunia got a finger to the ball and tipped it on to the post .
ronaldinho swung a leg at the rebound but the volley had no direction .
the second-half started with barcelona showing more purpose .
two minutes after the restart , deco , a champions league winner with porto in 2004 , rifled a low shot straight at almunia after good work by van bommel on the right .
minutes later , barca substitute andres iniesta rode a flurry of tackles to bear down on the arsenal goal but again almunia was equal to the shot when it came .
barca camped in arsenal half in frantic search for equalizer frustration was beginning to creep into the barca players .
even a centrally located ronaldinho free-kick on the edge of the box was charged down by the arsenal defense .
seconds later , the brazilian tricked his way into the box only for his deft flick to be punched away by almunia .
arsenal were playing a dangerous game ; protecting a one-goal lead against a team full of attacking panache and hoping to hit the catalans on the break .
barca increased their attacking chances by taking off midfielder van bommel and bringing on henrik larsson with half an hour to play .
but the londoners almost got their reward for the risks they were taking .
fabregas robbed guily on the left as barca swarmed forwardand played in henry .
his square ball across the penalty area was hit firmly by hleb but the rushed shot flew wide .
five minutes later , fredi ljungberg should have sealed the match , breaking down the left and into the box before firing his shot high .
valdes touched the ball over but the resulting corner was wasted .
henry then had a great chance to get the goal he so desired when he broke free but his shot was too close to valdes .
seconds later at the other end , ronaldinho also fluffed a great chance , dragging a shot wide of the post from ten meters .
barcelona champions after two goals in three minutes fifteen minutes to go and samuel eto 'o made no such mistake .
a great ball from midfield evaded arsenal 's defense and a clever step-over by larsson allowed the ball to run to the cameroon striker who swept his shot past almunia from close range .
two minutes later and arsenal 's dream to a severe blow .
larsson again was the provider as the swede slipped a delicate reverse ball into the path of second substitute juliano belletti who cracked a shot between almunia 's legs and into the net .
arsenal were spent and had nothing in reserve as time ran out , leaving barca to run the clock down .
it was a cruel end to a brave performance from the londoners but barcelona made the extra man and , in the end , extra class pay .
the final whistle brought ecstatic scenes from the barcelona players and fans leaving the arsenal players crushed .
barcelona were european champions and deservedly so , not just from the performance on the night but for a season during which their beautiful game had lit up the global game .

that was an obvious attempt at eroding freedom of the press , says dw 's heinz dylong . the role of the german federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- is defined by law : its goal is to collect and process information about foreign countries .
the collected information is then placed at the disposal of the german government .
so far , so good . a certain grey zone emerges in the area of so-called " self-protection " of the bnd .
that 's where the bnd can also be active inside the country .
and it is far into this grey zone that the bnd pushed itself .
in order to find out the source of leaks to the press , the intelligence agency not only spied on journalists , but also used the services of the journalists who investigated their own colleagues and even kept tabs on their private lives . one could play down the whole thing and say that grey zones are simply places in which borders are crossed rather quickly .
but the procedures in this case can not be played down .
the relationship between the press and intelligence agencies in a constitutional state is too sensitive , even conflicting .
while intelligence agencies work secretly , placing the collected information only at the disposal of the government , journalistic research has as its goal to obtain information and offer it for public scrutiny . a prete n ce of self-protectio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : was the bnd purposefully interfering with freedom of the press ?
the issue got even more controversial when the bnd - under the pretense of self-protection - obtained information about the journalistic research which concerned the agency itself , its work or its possible shortcomings .
this is no longer " merely " a border violation .
this is obviously an erosion of press freedom . berlin has now decided to draw initial consequences .
the secret report about the bnd activities should be made public .
additionally , the chancellery now formally stipulated what was actually always obvious : in order to detect leaks within its ranks , the bnd will not be allowed to spy on journalists in the future . until now , operative measures which involved journalists had to be approved by top bnd officials .
this , in turn , created the impression of a certain uneasiness in those cases , which , however , was eventually ignored .
the consequences are now at hand : clarification is necessary about what was approved by which top officials in which cases and for what reason . the government spokesman justified the new directive from the chancellery by saying that freedom of the press is such a supreme good , that the interests of the bnd 's self-protection must be subordinated to it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 17.05.2006 german company fills tanks with sun großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this machine can turn biomass into fuel rising oil prices remain a hot topic of discussion .
alternatives to gas are rare and biodiesel from rapeseed , for example , has n't caught on .
but there 's hope .
a saxon firm has found a way to make fuel out of biomass . fuel is simply chemically converted solar energy .
through the photosynthesis in plants , sunlight can be converted into fossil energy , such as coal and oil . it 's a principle which a resourceful tinkerer in saxony thought must be easy to copy .
in 1990 , it was still a vision .
today , the company choren in the saxon town of freiberg actually produces synthetic fuel from biomass , or plants of all kind . " the biomass goes into a multiple-stage gasification process , which undergoes the various chemical processes until it is a high-purity synthesized gas , " said managing director carlhans uhle .
" this gas in turn is converted into diesel through several processes . " choren calls its product sundiesel .
the technical term is biomass to liquids , or btl .
four kilograms of biomass , for example wood , become one liter of diesel .
but while fossil fuels developed over a period of some 400 million years , this process only takes 400 minutes in freiberg . " if you also consider the time it takes the plants to grow , then it 's around 400 days , " uhle said . a closed e n ergy cycle choren obtains the raw material for production from local farmers , saxon 's state forestry and sawmills .
since it does n't just use the plant fruit , but rather the entire plant , the output per hectare of cultivable land in btl in comparison to normal biodiesel is three to four times higher . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this " sundiesel-beetle " runs on choren 's fuel " we can take any biomass we want to , " uhle said .
" nothing negative is left over , except for a bit of slag , which can be used to tar floors .
we are a closed energy cycle . "
in view of the ongoing climate debate , this aspect was particularly important . when this fuel is burned , it releases only as much carbon dioxide previously absorbed by the plants produced for this purpose .
the fuel also contains no sooty particles and can be filled into any diesel engine without re-fitting . biomass fuel ca n be competitive sundiesel is still in the testing phase .
only a few hundred liters are produced daily .
but large automobile producers , such as daimlerchrysler and volkswagen , and the energy giant shell are already on board .
together with choren , they are building a commercial facility , which will take up operations in the coming year and produce 250 million liters -lrb- 66 million gallons -rrb- annually .
four further facilities are planned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plant-based biodiesel has n't caught on " our technicians ' forecasts say that we are at a stage with the large scale plant to be competitive , " uhle said .
" of course , it always depends on the oil price and the dollar . " with the current high oil prices , the fuel will definitely be competitive with the construction of the third facility in 2012 or 2013 - and that without further subsidies . a liter of sundiesel still costs double that of diesel from petroleum .
the production costs are high and each new plant requires 400 million euros -lrb- $ 515.8 million -rrb- in investments .
still , btl is sparking interest worldwide ; choren has had inquiries from all over europe , the united states and china . sabine kinkartz -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german drivers angry over easter gas price hike drivers in germany are becoming increasingly angry about rising prices for gasoline which have seen a new record for this year - just in time for the easter holidays .

" " a final , though , is only a good one if you win it and we know that we are playing difficult opponents .
they now have the record for clean sheets in the champions league so that is proof of how well they defend . " " we will have to play well to beat them but we will maintain our philosophy no matter what happens . " french connection looking for élan in paris bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arsenal 's run has been a revelation arsenal 's run to their first champions league final has been down to a pragmatic streak that saw wenger opt for an unfamiliar 4-1-4-1 formation . a solid defense and a five-man midfield , with the likes of cesc fabregas , alexander hleb and robert pires streaming through in support of henry , helped account for real madrid , juventus and villarreal in the knockout rounds . wenger believes that his team will be more relaxed now that they have secured their place in europe 's top competition next year , and is certain the gunners can unlock the barcelona back four if they play their natural game . " if we do that , if we have a real go , i am convinced we can win , " said wenger , who nevertheless sounded a note of caution for the millions of fans anticipating a ' champagne ' final . many previous finals had been stifled by the fear of failure , he warned . " it 's difficult to predict .
like many finals , as long as nobody scores it stays quite locked , " wenger said .
" but because of the importance of the competition , once one team scores it will certainly be an open and crazy game . " expectations high as world 's best do battle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barca 's number 10 is up for an attacking game despite wenger 's measured assessment , ronaldinho said he doubted that the arsenal manager would send arsenal into battle with the game plan of trying to frustrate the spaniards . " i like the way wenger 's teams play because it 's attack , " ronaldinho said .
" a strong defense with players in front of them who are technically very strong , and very quick - players who know how to make a difference . " " it 's a final where you can expect to see goals .

alternatives to gas are rare and biodiesel from rapeseed , for example , has n't caught on .
but there 's hope .
a saxon firm has found a way to make fuel out of biomass . fuel is simply chemically converted solar energy .
through the photosynthesis in plants , sunlight can be converted into fossil energy , such as coal and oil . it 's a principle which a resourceful tinkerer in saxony thought must be easy to copy .
in 1990 , it was still a vision .
today , the company choren in the saxon town of freiberg actually produces synthetic fuel from biomass , or plants of all kind . " the biomass goes into a multiple-stage gasification process , which undergoes the various chemical processes until it is a high-purity synthesized gas , " said managing director carlhans uhle .
" this gas in turn is converted into diesel through several processes . " choren calls its product sundiesel .
the technical term is biomass to liquids , or btl .
four kilograms of biomass , for example wood , become one liter of diesel .
but while fossil fuels developed over a period of some 400 million years , this process only takes 400 minutes in freiberg . " if you also consider the time it takes the plants to grow , then it 's around 400 days , " uhle said . a closed e n ergy cycle choren obtains the raw material for production from local farmers , saxon 's state forestry and sawmills .
since it does n't just use the plant fruit , but rather the entire plant , the output per hectare of cultivable land in btl in comparison to normal biodiesel is three to four times higher . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this " sundiesel-beetle " runs on choren 's fuel " we can take any biomass we want to , " uhle said .
" nothing negative is left over , except for a bit of slag , which can be used to tar floors .
we are a closed energy cycle . "
in view of the ongoing climate debate , this aspect was particularly important . when this fuel is burned , it releases only as much carbon dioxide previously absorbed by the plants produced for this purpose .
the fuel also contains no sooty particles and can be filled into any diesel engine without re-fitting . biomass fuel ca n be competitive sundiesel is still in the testing phase .
only a few hundred liters are produced daily .
but large automobile producers , such as daimlerchrysler and volkswagen , and the energy giant shell are already on board .
together with choren , they are building a commercial facility , which will take up operations in the coming year and produce 250 million liters -lrb- 66 million gallons -rrb- annually .
four further facilities are planned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plant-based biodiesel has n't caught on " our technicians ' forecasts say that we are at a stage with the large scale plant to be competitive , " uhle said .
" of course , it always depends on the oil price and the dollar . " with the current high oil prices , the fuel will definitely be competitive with the construction of the third facility in 2012 or 2013 - and that without further subsidies . a liter of sundiesel still costs double that of diesel from petroleum .
the production costs are high and each new plant requires 400 million euros -lrb- $ 515.8 million -rrb- in investments .

d 'alema , 57 , will also hold one of two deputy prime ministerial positions along with francesco rutelli , who doubles as culture minister . prodi was formally sworn in as prime minister by president giorgio napolitano ahead of his 25-member cabinet , ushering in a new era in italian politics after his victory in last month 's general elections , which is still being contested by the ousted center-right . the appointment of the 65-year-old technocrat padoa-schioppa as economics minister is likely to be seen by the markets and international financial bodies as a promise of measures to reduce public debt , which mushroomed under the outgoing conservative government of silvio berlusconi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : padoa-schioppa 's presence in the cabinet may reassure the business-minded prodi , a former european commission president , was only able to complete his list after haggling within his nine-party coalition over key posts , which went on until the early hours of wednesday .
the bickering underlines the problems prodi is likely to face in government as he defends a razor-thin parliamentary majority after the closest italian election in living memory . " there is a great desire for a new start combined with a desire for cohesion and unity , " prodi said after announcing his cabinet .
" the first commitment will be to rebuild a spirit of solidarity and a consensus on the goals needed for the country to move forward , and that means lowering the level of tension and litigiousness , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi eventually made way for democrats union for europe -lrb- udeur -rrb- leader mastella his ministerial list featured a surprise choice of clemente mastella , leader of the small catholic udeur party , as justice minister .
mastella , whose party holds three senate seats , had threatened to pull out of the government if he was not handed a key ministry . the government is dominated by the two biggest center-left parties , the democrats of the left and the centrist margherita , while prodi is one of five independents .
it includes one communist , paolo ferrero of the refoundation communist party , who will have responsibility for welfare , and six women - four more than the outgoing center-right government .
alessandro bianchi , who is an independent but is closely associated with the smaller italian communist party , will take charge of transport .
more left-leaning than expected the corriere della sera newspaper said in a front page editorial the new government was more left-leaning than had been anticipated . " a government is born that is weighted to the left , even more than expected by the majority of those who elected it and the natural orientation of the coalition , " it said . the surprise choice of mastella for the justice ministry was an early blow to leftists in the disparate coalition who have pledged wide-ranging social reform , not least the state recognition of same-sex couples - fiercely opposed by pope benedict xvi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amato will take charge of the interior ministry former anti-corruption judge antonio di pietro , who led the " clean hands " investigation into the links between big business and politics a decade ago , has been handed the infrastructure portfolio .
giuliano amato , former vice chairman of the european convention , which wrote the european union 's stalled constitution , will be interior minister in the new government . prodi said he would go before the senate with a confidence motion on thursday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.05.2006 europe takes on battle against flooding großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germany has been particularly hard hit by floods in recent years the european union is working on finding the answers to preventing and limiting floods .
experts are meeting in vienna this week to tackle the issue .
but is the european response to the challenge of floods sufficient ? disastrous flooding is hitting europe on a regular basis .
this spring once again , swelling rivers in central europe displaced thousands of people . " catastrophic floods endanger lives and are likely to cause human tragedy , as well as heavy economic losses , " stavros dimas , the european commissioner for the environment , said in a statement . experts are meeting in vienna this week for the european conference on flood risk management , which kicks off on wednesday .
they will be discussing various flood strategies and outlining suitable risk management based on experiences of recent floods . according to the european commission , europe suffered over 100 major damaging floods between 1998 and 2004 , including the catastrophic floods along the danube and elbe rivers in the summer of 2002 .
since 1998 , floods in europe have caused some 700 deaths and about half a million people have been forced to leave their homes .
the bill ?
at least 25 billion euros -lrb- $ 32 billion -rrb- in insured economic losses , the commission said . shari n g the burde n across europe a major problem in flood management , though , is that most of europe 's river basins , such as the elbe and danube , are shared by more than one country . " in the case of international river basins , steps must be coordinated between the member states concerned to prevent problems being passed from one area to another , " said sergey moroz from the conservation organization wwf 's european policy office in brussels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden 's famous zwinger palace was severely damaged in the 2002 floods officials at the german environmental protection non-governmental organization bund said too many countries and regions were just looking out for their own interests . " international coordination is very important , " said christian schweer from bund 's water policy unit .
" the sectionalism in europe has to stop . " cross-border cooperation is a major element of the european commission 's flood action program to improve damage prevention and reduction across member states . " this new directive will help member states choose the right tools with which to reduce the likelihood of floods and limit their impacts , " environment commissioner dimas said .
" in particular , it aims to ensure that member states cooperate in shared river basins and coastal areas to improve flood protection all over europe . " e n viro n me n tal factors must be part of floodi n g solutio n s the commission said europe is likely to see a higher flood risk and greater economic damage in the future .

experts are meeting in vienna this week to tackle the issue .
but is the european response to the challenge of floods sufficient ? disastrous flooding is hitting europe on a regular basis .
this spring once again , swelling rivers in central europe displaced thousands of people . " catastrophic floods endanger lives and are likely to cause human tragedy , as well as heavy economic losses , " stavros dimas , the european commissioner for the environment , said in a statement . experts are meeting in vienna this week for the european conference on flood risk management , which kicks off on wednesday .
they will be discussing various flood strategies and outlining suitable risk management based on experiences of recent floods . according to the european commission , europe suffered over 100 major damaging floods between 1998 and 2004 , including the catastrophic floods along the danube and elbe rivers in the summer of 2002 .
since 1998 , floods in europe have caused some 700 deaths and about half a million people have been forced to leave their homes .
the bill ?
at least 25 billion euros -lrb- $ 32 billion -rrb- in insured economic losses , the commission said . shari n g the burde n across europe a major problem in flood management , though , is that most of europe 's river basins , such as the elbe and danube , are shared by more than one country . " in the case of international river basins , steps must be coordinated between the member states concerned to prevent problems being passed from one area to another , " said sergey moroz from the conservation organization wwf 's european policy office in brussels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden 's famous zwinger palace was severely damaged in the 2002 floods officials at the german environmental protection non-governmental organization bund said too many countries and regions were just looking out for their own interests . " international coordination is very important , " said christian schweer from bund 's water policy unit .
" the sectionalism in europe has to stop . " cross-border cooperation is a major element of the european commission 's flood action program to improve damage prevention and reduction across member states . " this new directive will help member states choose the right tools with which to reduce the likelihood of floods and limit their impacts , " environment commissioner dimas said .
" in particular , it aims to ensure that member states cooperate in shared river basins and coastal areas to improve flood protection all over europe . " e n viro n me n tal factors must be part of floodi n g solutio n s the commission said europe is likely to see a higher flood risk and greater economic damage in the future .
climate change is expected to increase the scale and frequency of floods , it said .

alternatives to gas are rare and biodiesel from rapeseed , for example , has n't caught on .
but there 's hope .
a saxon firm has found a way to make fuel out of biomass . fuel is simply chemically converted solar energy .
through the photosynthesis in plants , sunlight can be converted into fossil energy , such as coal and oil . it 's a principle which a resourceful tinkerer in saxony thought must be easy to copy .
in 1990 , it was still a vision .
today , the company choren in the saxon town of freiberg actually produces synthetic fuel from biomass , or plants of all kind . " the biomass goes into a multiple-stage gasification process , which undergoes the various chemical processes until it is a high-purity synthesized gas , " said managing director carlhans uhle .
" this gas in turn is converted into diesel through several processes . " choren calls its product sundiesel .
the technical term is biomass to liquids , or btl .
four kilograms of biomass , for example wood , become one liter of diesel .
but while fossil fuels developed over a period of some 400 million years , this process only takes 400 minutes in freiberg . " if you also consider the time it takes the plants to grow , then it 's around 400 days , " uhle said . a closed e n ergy cycle choren obtains the raw material for production from local farmers , saxon 's state forestry and sawmills .
since it does n't just use the plant fruit , but rather the entire plant , the output per hectare of cultivable land in btl in comparison to normal biodiesel is three to four times higher . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this " sundiesel-beetle " runs on choren 's fuel " we can take any biomass we want to , " uhle said .
" nothing negative is left over , except for a bit of slag , which can be used to tar floors .
we are a closed energy cycle . "
in view of the ongoing climate debate , this aspect was particularly important . when this fuel is burned , it releases only as much carbon dioxide previously absorbed by the plants produced for this purpose .
the fuel also contains no sooty particles and can be filled into any diesel engine without re-fitting . biomass fuel ca n be competitive sundiesel is still in the testing phase .
only a few hundred liters are produced daily .
but large automobile producers , such as daimlerchrysler and volkswagen , and the energy giant shell are already on board .
together with choren , they are building a commercial facility , which will take up operations in the coming year and produce 250 million liters -lrb- 66 million gallons -rrb- annually .
four further facilities are planned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plant-based biodiesel has n't caught on " our technicians ' forecasts say that we are at a stage with the large scale plant to be competitive , " uhle said .
" of course , it always depends on the oil price and the dollar . " with the current high oil prices , the fuel will definitely be competitive with the construction of the third facility in 2012 or 2013 - and that without further subsidies . a liter of sundiesel still costs double that of diesel from petroleum .
the production costs are high and each new plant requires 400 million euros -lrb- $ 515.8 million -rrb- in investments .
still , btl is sparking interest worldwide ; choren has had inquiries from all over europe , the united states and china . sabine kinkartz -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german drivers angry over easter gas price hike drivers in germany are becoming increasingly angry about rising prices for gasoline which have seen a new record for this year - just in time for the easter holidays .

d 'alema , 57 , will also hold one of two deputy prime ministerial positions along with francesco rutelli , who doubles as culture minister . prodi was formally sworn in as prime minister by president giorgio napolitano ahead of his 25-member cabinet , ushering in a new era in italian politics after his victory in last month 's general elections , which is still being contested by the ousted center-right . the appointment of the 65-year-old technocrat padoa-schioppa as economics minister is likely to be seen by the markets and international financial bodies as a promise of measures to reduce public debt , which mushroomed under the outgoing conservative government of silvio berlusconi .

the bickering underlines the problems prodi is likely to face in government as he defends a razor-thin parliamentary majority after the closest italian election in living memory . " there is a great desire for a new start combined with a desire for cohesion and unity , " prodi said after announcing his cabinet .

it includes one communist , paolo ferrero of the refoundation communist party , who will have responsibility for welfare , and six women - four more than the outgoing center-right government .
alessandro bianchi , who is an independent but is closely associated with the smaller italian communist party , will take charge of transport .
more left-leaning than expected the corriere della sera newspaper said in a front page editorial the new government was more left-leaning than had been anticipated . " a government is born that is weighted to the left , even more than expected by the majority of those who elected it and the natural orientation of the coalition , " it said . the surprise choice of mastella for the justice ministry was an early blow to leftists in the disparate coalition who have pledged wide-ranging social reform , not least the state recognition of same-sex couples - fiercely opposed by pope benedict xvi .

however , president mahmoud ahmadinejad said wednesday iran would reject the european union deal . " they say that they want to give us incentives , " ahmadinejad told a rally in the town of arak that was carried live on state-run television .
" they think that they can take away our gold and give us some nuts and chocolate in exchange .
there is no need to give us incentives . " a light-water research reactor is considered less of a proliferation risk than a heavy-water reactor , which can produce large amounts of plutonium .
iran is currently building a heavy-water reactor . diplomacy will take place i n private bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany hosted a meeting on the iran conflict earlier this year state department spokesman sean mccormack said the united states was working very closely with the so-called eu-3 -lrb- britain , germany and france -rrb- in developing a package to offer iran .

" we present them with a crossroads .
so they can choose to continue down the pathway of intransigence , of non-cooperation , of obfuscation , which will lead to the increased isolation of the iranian people , or they can choose a pathway of cooperation .

but this meeting will likely be postponed until next week . " the package has not been approved , " nicholas burns , the us under secretary of state for political affairs , said late tuesday in washington .
" it is under development . " burns said the meeting would " probably " take place next week in london .
he said the talks on new incentives were progressing . offering iran a light-water reactor needs us backing , as european companies involved in this technology would not want to endanger their business with the united states , diplomats said . a package everyo n e ca n live with washington and the eu-3 favor a security council resolution that would require compliance .
this could open the door to sanctions , and even military action , if iran continues to enrich uranium . however , russia and china oppose such a resolution , saying they fear an escalation of the crisis .
this leaves the eu powers now trying to find a negotiation package acceptable to russia and china . " the package involves iran giving up industrial-scale enrichment and agreeing to have it done in russia , " a diplomat close to the vienna-based un nuclear watchdog international atomic energy agency said . the europeans , backed by the united states , had offered benefits including help in obtaining a light-water reactor last august , but iran rejected this offer . iran would then get trade benefits - the europeans have already promised to help tehran get into the world trade organization . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu ready to help iran develop civilian nuclear power top eu officials said monday that the bloc is willing to back a " proliferation-proof " civilian nuclear program for iran and could offer " the most sophisticated " technology to help with the country 's power needs .

there is no need to give us incentives . " a light-water research reactor is considered less of a proliferation risk than a heavy-water reactor , which can produce large amounts of plutonium .
iran is currently building a heavy-water reactor . diplomacy will take place i n private bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany hosted a meeting on the iran conflict earlier this year state department spokesman sean mccormack said the united states was working very closely with the so-called eu-3 -lrb- britain , germany and france -rrb- in developing a package to offer iran . " we are making progress in the consultations , " he told reporters in washington on tuesday . " what this package would do is provide the iranian regime a choice , " mccormack said .
" we present them with a crossroads .
so they can choose to continue down the pathway of intransigence , of non-cooperation , of obfuscation , which will lead to the increased isolation of the iranian people , or they can choose a pathway of cooperation . " however , he would not name any details of the offer . " i 'm going to let the diplomacy take place in private , " mccormack said . us " pleased " about eu efforts a western diplomat told afp news service the united states could accept the idea of an international consortium providing advanced , proliferation-resistant light-water reactor assistance to iran . " but only in the context of an agreement in which iran has verifiably agreed not to pursue uranium enrichment , including research , for the foreseeable future , " the diplomat said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian mps inspect parts of the isfahan nuclear plant he said washington was pleased that the eu had " for the first time committed itself to specific united nations security council sanctions on iran if iran fails to comply . " the five permanent un security council members plus germany were expected to meet this friday in london to review the offer .
but this meeting will likely be postponed until next week . " the package has not been approved , " nicholas burns , the us under secretary of state for political affairs , said late tuesday in washington .
" it is under development . " burns said the meeting would " probably " take place next week in london .
he said the talks on new incentives were progressing . offering iran a light-water reactor needs us backing , as european companies involved in this technology would not want to endanger their business with the united states , diplomats said . a package everyo n e ca n live with washington and the eu-3 favor a security council resolution that would require compliance .
this could open the door to sanctions , and even military action , if iran continues to enrich uranium . however , russia and china oppose such a resolution , saying they fear an escalation of the crisis .
this leaves the eu powers now trying to find a negotiation package acceptable to russia and china . " the package involves iran giving up industrial-scale enrichment and agreeing to have it done in russia , " a diplomat close to the vienna-based un nuclear watchdog international atomic energy agency said . the europeans , backed by the united states , had offered benefits including help in obtaining a light-water reactor last august , but iran rejected this offer . iran would then get trade benefits - the europeans have already promised to help tehran get into the world trade organization . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu ready to help iran develop civilian nuclear power top eu officials said monday that the bloc is willing to back a " proliferation-proof " civilian nuclear program for iran and could offer " the most sophisticated " technology to help with the country 's power needs .

d 'alema , 57 , will also hold one of two deputy prime ministerial positions along with francesco rutelli , who doubles as culture minister . prodi was formally sworn in as prime minister by president giorgio napolitano ahead of his 25-member cabinet , ushering in a new era in italian politics after his victory in last month 's general elections , which is still being contested by the ousted center-right . the appointment of the 65-year-old technocrat padoa-schioppa as economics minister is likely to be seen by the markets and international financial bodies as a promise of measures to reduce public debt , which mushroomed under the outgoing conservative government of silvio berlusconi .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.05.2006 europe takes on battle against flooding großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germany has been particularly hard hit by floods in recent years the european union is working on finding the answers to preventing and limiting floods .
experts are meeting in vienna this week to tackle the issue .
but is the european response to the challenge of floods sufficient ? disastrous flooding is hitting europe on a regular basis .
this spring once again , swelling rivers in central europe displaced thousands of people . " catastrophic floods endanger lives and are likely to cause human tragedy , as well as heavy economic losses , " stavros dimas , the european commissioner for the environment , said in a statement . experts are meeting in vienna this week for the european conference on flood risk management , which kicks off on wednesday .
they will be discussing various flood strategies and outlining suitable risk management based on experiences of recent floods . according to the european commission , europe suffered over 100 major damaging floods between 1998 and 2004 , including the catastrophic floods along the danube and elbe rivers in the summer of 2002 .
since 1998 , floods in europe have caused some 700 deaths and about half a million people have been forced to leave their homes .
the bill ?
at least 25 billion euros -lrb- $ 32 billion -rrb- in insured economic losses , the commission said . shari n g the burde n across europe a major problem in flood management , though , is that most of europe 's river basins , such as the elbe and danube , are shared by more than one country . " in the case of international river basins , steps must be coordinated between the member states concerned to prevent problems being passed from one area to another , " said sergey moroz from the conservation organization wwf 's european policy office in brussels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden 's famous zwinger palace was severely damaged in the 2002 floods officials at the german environmental protection non-governmental organization bund said too many countries and regions were just looking out for their own interests . " international coordination is very important , " said christian schweer from bund 's water policy unit .
" the sectionalism in europe has to stop . " cross-border cooperation is a major element of the european commission 's flood action program to improve damage prevention and reduction across member states . " this new directive will help member states choose the right tools with which to reduce the likelihood of floods and limit their impacts , " environment commissioner dimas said .
" in particular , it aims to ensure that member states cooperate in shared river basins and coastal areas to improve flood protection all over europe . " e n viro n me n tal factors must be part of floodi n g solutio n s the commission said europe is likely to see a higher flood risk and greater economic damage in the future .
climate change is expected to increase the scale and frequency of floods , it said . " floods have always existed , but in recent years , they became disasters because of human mismanagement of rivers , floodplains and catchments and inadequate land use , " moroz said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : urban development has come too close to rivers according to schweer , 80 percent of the original floodplains along the elbe and rhine rivers , for example , have been lost due to urban development and agricultural use .
" flood protection can not exclude environmental concerns , " schweer said . although the commission program does not explicitly name ecological flood control measures , the european parliament 's environment committee has put clear environmental objectives in its proposal for the directive . " it is important that rivers be given more room , " schweer said . member states will assess a n d ma n age floods the new directive proposed earlier this year builds on the eu water framework directive -lrb- wfd -rrb- , the cornerstone of the eu water protection policy . it will require member states to carry out preliminary assessments of their river basins and associated coastal areas at risk of flooding .
where flood damage risks exist , member states will develop flood risk maps . finally , flood risk management plans must be drawn up for these zones .
these are to include measures to reduce the probability of flooding and its potential consequences , such as prevention , protection , early warning , emergency response and recovery . " the current proposal is a step in the right direction , " moroz said .
" it coordinates flood management with ecological water management as required under the wfd and has the potential to mark the beginning of a new and transparent flood management approach . " bildunterschrift : even sand bags could n't hold up the water but he said a further challenge will be striking the right balance with respect to the eu solidarity funds , an instrument set up after the catastrophic floods in europe in the summer of 2002 .
it covers reconstruction after flooding events , plus other major catastrophes . " eu financial support has to ensure long-term solutions to resolve the inadequate land use and water management policies that have contributed to these catastrophic flood events , " moroz said .
rebuilding existing dikes or making them higher would only worsen the situation , he said . " hence , we call on the european commission to make sure its money does not contribute to aggravating existing problems , " moroz said . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de swelling rivers force hundreds to flee in central europe rising floodwaters this spring forced thousands in central europe to leave their homes .

experts are meeting in vienna this week to tackle the issue .
but is the european response to the challenge of floods sufficient ? disastrous flooding is hitting europe on a regular basis .
this spring once again , swelling rivers in central europe displaced thousands of people . " catastrophic floods endanger lives and are likely to cause human tragedy , as well as heavy economic losses , " stavros dimas , the european commissioner for the environment , said in a statement . experts are meeting in vienna this week for the european conference on flood risk management , which kicks off on wednesday .
they will be discussing various flood strategies and outlining suitable risk management based on experiences of recent floods . according to the european commission , europe suffered over 100 major damaging floods between 1998 and 2004 , including the catastrophic floods along the danube and elbe rivers in the summer of 2002 .
since 1998 , floods in europe have caused some 700 deaths and about half a million people have been forced to leave their homes .
the bill ?
at least 25 billion euros -lrb- $ 32 billion -rrb- in insured economic losses , the commission said . shari n g the burde n across europe a major problem in flood management , though , is that most of europe 's river basins , such as the elbe and danube , are shared by more than one country . " in the case of international river basins , steps must be coordinated between the member states concerned to prevent problems being passed from one area to another , " said sergey moroz from the conservation organization wwf 's european policy office in brussels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden 's famous zwinger palace was severely damaged in the 2002 floods officials at the german environmental protection non-governmental organization bund said too many countries and regions were just looking out for their own interests . " international coordination is very important , " said christian schweer from bund 's water policy unit .
" the sectionalism in europe has to stop . " cross-border cooperation is a major element of the european commission 's flood action program to improve damage prevention and reduction across member states . " this new directive will help member states choose the right tools with which to reduce the likelihood of floods and limit their impacts , " environment commissioner dimas said .
" in particular , it aims to ensure that member states cooperate in shared river basins and coastal areas to improve flood protection all over europe . " e n viro n me n tal factors must be part of floodi n g solutio n s the commission said europe is likely to see a higher flood risk and greater economic damage in the future .
climate change is expected to increase the scale and frequency of floods , it said . " floods have always existed , but in recent years , they became disasters because of human mismanagement of rivers , floodplains and catchments and inadequate land use , " moroz said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : urban development has come too close to rivers according to schweer , 80 percent of the original floodplains along the elbe and rhine rivers , for example , have been lost due to urban development and agricultural use .
" flood protection can not exclude environmental concerns , " schweer said . although the commission program does not explicitly name ecological flood control measures , the european parliament 's environment committee has put clear environmental objectives in its proposal for the directive . " it is important that rivers be given more room , " schweer said . member states will assess a n d ma n age floods the new directive proposed earlier this year builds on the eu water framework directive -lrb- wfd -rrb- , the cornerstone of the eu water protection policy . it will require member states to carry out preliminary assessments of their river basins and associated coastal areas at risk of flooding .
where flood damage risks exist , member states will develop flood risk maps . finally , flood risk management plans must be drawn up for these zones .
these are to include measures to reduce the probability of flooding and its potential consequences , such as prevention , protection , early warning , emergency response and recovery . " the current proposal is a step in the right direction , " moroz said .
" it coordinates flood management with ecological water management as required under the wfd and has the potential to mark the beginning of a new and transparent flood management approach . " bildunterschrift : even sand bags could n't hold up the water but he said a further challenge will be striking the right balance with respect to the eu solidarity funds , an instrument set up after the catastrophic floods in europe in the summer of 2002 .
it covers reconstruction after flooding events , plus other major catastrophes . " eu financial support has to ensure long-term solutions to resolve the inadequate land use and water management policies that have contributed to these catastrophic flood events , " moroz said .
rebuilding existing dikes or making them higher would only worsen the situation , he said . " hence , we call on the european commission to make sure its money does not contribute to aggravating existing problems , " moroz said . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de swelling rivers force hundreds to flee in central europe rising floodwaters this spring forced thousands in central europe to leave their homes .

the catalans hit two goals in the last 10 minutes to turn a game which was slipping away . fans from london and barcelona had been flooding into the french capital for most of wednesday , many without tickets , for what was billed as the most exciting european cup final in years .
now known as the champions league and unrecognisible from the knock-out format of old , the prestige of the competition remains and both barcelona and arsenal traveled to paris with their eyes on the most coveted club prize in european soccer and the legacy that belongs to it .
the winners would be awarded not only the trophy known as " old big ears " but the accolade of being the best team on the continent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who got in expected a spectacle it would be a title justifiably awarded to both teams .
barcelona - with their flair and flow , led by the incredible talents of the brazilian ronaldinho - and arsenal - the aristocrats of english soccer , fronted by one of the most devastating attackers in the history of the game , thierry henry .
two teams capable of rapid attacking soccer and prodigious skill , filled with quality from back to front .
the match was sold as ronaldinho versus henry but neither team are a one-man show .
eto 'o , deco , marquez , cole , ljungberg , pires ...
both sides started the game bursting with stars .
henry presented with two chances to open account but unsurprisingly it was henry who made the first - and second - chance , initially spinning away from rafael marquez in the area after being slipped in by alex hleb only to be thwarted by valdes .
from the corner , henry whipped a vicious low shot at the keeper from distance which valdes palmed away .
the game was barely three minutes old .
the young arsenal team had set their stall out early and were dictating the pace , obviously not in awe of the team they were facing .
barca seemed stunned but only momentarily .
ludo guily was soon testing jens lehmann after ashley cole has slipped on the left .
germany 's numer one comfortably held the rising shot from the frenchman .
it was no shock that arsenal coach arsene wenger had picked out ronaldinho as barca 's main creative threat .
each time the brazilian received the ball he found two gunners stifling his progress .
due to arsenal 's crowding tactics , ronaldinho 's first effort on goal had to come from a free kick in the 15th minute but the distance was too much even for him and the shot flew well wide of lehmann 's goal .
lehmann sees red bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : early bath : lehmann gets his marching orders just when the final looked to be settling down , drama struck in paris .
a ronaldinho slide rule pass put samuel eto 'o through on goal ; lehmann raced off his line and hauled the barca attacker down on the edge of the area .
as the last man , the referee had no choice and the german keeper saw red .
arsenal substituted robert pires for manuel almunia and the new keeper 's first job was to watch ronaldinho 's free kick fly just wide .
in the following minutes , the game looked like it could boil over , swinging from beauty to ugliness in a flash of studs .
eboue scythed down van bronkhurst in a red mist and moments later kolo toure was mugged by edmilson in a revenge attack . bodies started to litter the field and the tempo suffered .
when the game recovered , barca began to dominate .
eto 'o was tormenting eboue at will on the right while guily continued to test cole on the left but despite their dominance , barca could not find a way though arsenal 's famously stingy back line .
defender campbell draws first blood and it was a stalwart from that defensive wall which remarkably broke the deadlock and made the spanish giants pay .
after eboue had been body-checked by carlos puyol on the edge of the barca area , thierry henry floated an inch perfect free kick into the six-yard box where sol campbell rose above the static catalan defense to power a towering header past valdes to put ten-men arsenal in the lead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sol campbell heads the gunners in front barcelona responded in marauding style .
wave after wave of attacks flowed as the clock ticked down to half-time and the catalans almost achieved parity in style when eto 'o spun away from the arsenal defense on the edge of the penalty area .
his shot looked destined for the top corner but almunia got a finger to the ball and tipped it on to the post .
ronaldinho swung a leg at the rebound but the volley had no direction .
the second-half started with barcelona showing more purpose .
two minutes after the restart , deco , a champions league winner with porto in 2004 , rifled a low shot straight at almunia after good work by van bommel on the right .
minutes later , barca substitute andres iniesta rode a flurry of tackles to bear down on the arsenal goal but again almunia was equal to the shot when it came .
barca camped in arsenal half in frantic search for equalizer frustration was beginning to creep into the barca players .
even a centrally located ronaldinho free-kick on the edge of the box was charged down by the arsenal defense .
seconds later , the brazilian tricked his way into the box only for his deft flick to be punched away by almunia .
arsenal were playing a dangerous game ; protecting a one-goal lead against a team full of attacking panache and hoping to hit the catalans on the break .
barca increased their attacking chances by taking off midfielder van bommel and bringing on henrik larsson with half an hour to play .
but the londoners almost got their reward for the risks they were taking .
fabregas robbed guily on the left as barca swarmed forwardand played in henry .
his square ball across the penalty area was hit firmly by hleb but the rushed shot flew wide .
five minutes later , fredi ljungberg should have sealed the match , breaking down the left and into the box before firing his shot high .
valdes touched the ball over but the resulting corner was wasted .
henry then had a great chance to get the goal he so desired when he broke free but his shot was too close to valdes .
seconds later at the other end , ronaldinho also fluffed a great chance , dragging a shot wide of the post from ten meters .
barcelona champions after two goals in three minutes fifteen minutes to go and samuel eto 'o made no such mistake .
a great ball from midfield evaded arsenal 's defense and a clever step-over by larsson allowed the ball to run to the cameroon striker who swept his shot past almunia from close range .
two minutes later and arsenal 's dream to a severe blow .
larsson again was the provider as the swede slipped a delicate reverse ball into the path of second substitute juliano belletti who cracked a shot between almunia 's legs and into the net .
arsenal were spent and had nothing in reserve as time ran out , leaving barca to run the clock down .
it was a cruel end to a brave performance from the londoners but barcelona made the extra man and , in the end , extra class pay .
the final whistle brought ecstatic scenes from the barcelona players and fans leaving the arsenal players crushed .
barcelona were european champions and deservedly so , not just from the performance on the night but for a season during which their beautiful game had lit up the global game .

" we 're playing football a la rijkaard , " said the two-time world footballer of the year .
" it 's a game based on open , attacking football .
we 're not copying anyone .
you ca n't really compare us to any other team . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barca 's style is a dream for ronaldinho " it 's a style of football that you dream about playing as a footballer , because we are given complete freedom to attack . " joan laporta , barcelona 's president , was even more effusive .
" the secret of our success is rijkaard , " laporta said .
" he is the ronaldinho of the bench . " insiders expect a flowing , open display barcelona 's former arsenal fullback giovanni van bronckhorst said the similar mentality of the two sides could make for an open contest . " both teams have played really well in the champions league this year and the philosophy of the two sides is the same , as we want to play attractive football and i think both teams have done that , " said van bronckhorst . " so this final will be something of a one-off because normally you have teams that play a bit defensively , but now you will see two teams that like to attack and so it should be a very attractive final . " " a final , though , is only a good one if you win it and we know that we are playing difficult opponents .
they now have the record for clean sheets in the champions league so that is proof of how well they defend . " " we will have to play well to beat them but we will maintain our philosophy no matter what happens . " french connection looking for élan in paris bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arsenal 's run has been a revelation arsenal 's run to their first champions league final has been down to a pragmatic streak that saw wenger opt for an unfamiliar 4-1-4-1 formation . a solid defense and a five-man midfield , with the likes of cesc fabregas , alexander hleb and robert pires streaming through in support of henry , helped account for real madrid , juventus and villarreal in the knockout rounds . wenger believes that his team will be more relaxed now that they have secured their place in europe 's top competition next year , and is certain the gunners can unlock the barcelona back four if they play their natural game . " if we do that , if we have a real go , i am convinced we can win , " said wenger , who nevertheless sounded a note of caution for the millions of fans anticipating a ' champagne ' final . many previous finals had been stifled by the fear of failure , he warned . " it 's difficult to predict .
like many finals , as long as nobody scores it stays quite locked , " wenger said .
" but because of the importance of the competition , once one team scores it will certainly be an open and crazy game . " expectations high as world 's best do battle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barca 's number 10 is up for an attacking game despite wenger 's measured assessment , ronaldinho said he doubted that the arsenal manager would send arsenal into battle with the game plan of trying to frustrate the spaniards . " i like the way wenger 's teams play because it 's attack , " ronaldinho said .
" a strong defense with players in front of them who are technically very strong , and very quick - players who know how to make a difference . " " it 's a final where you can expect to see goals .

that was an obvious attempt at eroding freedom of the press , says dw 's heinz dylong . the role of the german federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- is defined by law : its goal is to collect and process information about foreign countries .
the collected information is then placed at the disposal of the german government .
so far , so good . a certain grey zone emerges in the area of so-called " self-protection " of the bnd .
that 's where the bnd can also be active inside the country .
and it is far into this grey zone that the bnd pushed itself .
in order to find out the source of leaks to the press , the intelligence agency not only spied on journalists , but also used the services of the journalists who investigated their own colleagues and even kept tabs on their private lives . one could play down the whole thing and say that grey zones are simply places in which borders are crossed rather quickly .
but the procedures in this case can not be played down .
the relationship between the press and intelligence agencies in a constitutional state is too sensitive , even conflicting .
while intelligence agencies work secretly , placing the collected information only at the disposal of the government , journalistic research has as its goal to obtain information and offer it for public scrutiny . a prete n ce of self-protectio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : was the bnd purposefully interfering with freedom of the press ?
the issue got even more controversial when the bnd - under the pretense of self-protection - obtained information about the journalistic research which concerned the agency itself , its work or its possible shortcomings .
this is no longer " merely " a border violation .
this is obviously an erosion of press freedom . berlin has now decided to draw initial consequences .
the secret report about the bnd activities should be made public .
additionally , the chancellery now formally stipulated what was actually always obvious : in order to detect leaks within its ranks , the bnd will not be allowed to spy on journalists in the future . until now , operative measures which involved journalists had to be approved by top bnd officials .
this , in turn , created the impression of a certain uneasiness in those cases , which , however , was eventually ignored .
the consequences are now at hand : clarification is necessary about what was approved by which top officials in which cases and for what reason . the government spokesman justified the new directive from the chancellery by saying that freedom of the press is such a supreme good , that the interests of the bnd 's self-protection must be subordinated to it .

the catalans hit two goals in the last 10 minutes to turn a game which was slipping away . fans from london and barcelona had been flooding into the french capital for most of wednesday , many without tickets , for what was billed as the most exciting european cup final in years .
now known as the champions league and unrecognisible from the knock-out format of old , the prestige of the competition remains and both barcelona and arsenal traveled to paris with their eyes on the most coveted club prize in european soccer and the legacy that belongs to it .
the winners would be awarded not only the trophy known as " old big ears " but the accolade of being the best team on the continent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who got in expected a spectacle it would be a title justifiably awarded to both teams .
barcelona - with their flair and flow , led by the incredible talents of the brazilian ronaldinho - and arsenal - the aristocrats of english soccer , fronted by one of the most devastating attackers in the history of the game , thierry henry .
two teams capable of rapid attacking soccer and prodigious skill , filled with quality from back to front .
the match was sold as ronaldinho versus henry but neither team are a one-man show .
eto 'o , deco , marquez , cole , ljungberg , pires ...
both sides started the game bursting with stars .
henry presented with two chances to open account but unsurprisingly it was henry who made the first - and second - chance , initially spinning away from rafael marquez in the area after being slipped in by alex hleb only to be thwarted by valdes .
from the corner , henry whipped a vicious low shot at the keeper from distance which valdes palmed away .
the game was barely three minutes old .
the young arsenal team had set their stall out early and were dictating the pace , obviously not in awe of the team they were facing .
barca seemed stunned but only momentarily .
ludo guily was soon testing jens lehmann after ashley cole has slipped on the left .
germany 's numer one comfortably held the rising shot from the frenchman .
it was no shock that arsenal coach arsene wenger had picked out ronaldinho as barca 's main creative threat .
each time the brazilian received the ball he found two gunners stifling his progress .
due to arsenal 's crowding tactics , ronaldinho 's first effort on goal had to come from a free kick in the 15th minute but the distance was too much even for him and the shot flew well wide of lehmann 's goal .
lehmann sees red bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : early bath : lehmann gets his marching orders just when the final looked to be settling down , drama struck in paris .
a ronaldinho slide rule pass put samuel eto 'o through on goal ; lehmann raced off his line and hauled the barca attacker down on the edge of the area .
as the last man , the referee had no choice and the german keeper saw red .
arsenal substituted robert pires for manuel almunia and the new keeper 's first job was to watch ronaldinho 's free kick fly just wide .
in the following minutes , the game looked like it could boil over , swinging from beauty to ugliness in a flash of studs .
eboue scythed down van bronkhurst in a red mist and moments later kolo toure was mugged by edmilson in a revenge attack . bodies started to litter the field and the tempo suffered .
when the game recovered , barca began to dominate .
eto 'o was tormenting eboue at will on the right while guily continued to test cole on the left but despite their dominance , barca could not find a way though arsenal 's famously stingy back line .
defender campbell draws first blood and it was a stalwart from that defensive wall which remarkably broke the deadlock and made the spanish giants pay .
after eboue had been body-checked by carlos puyol on the edge of the barca area , thierry henry floated an inch perfect free kick into the six-yard box where sol campbell rose above the static catalan defense to power a towering header past valdes to put ten-men arsenal in the lead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sol campbell heads the gunners in front barcelona responded in marauding style .
wave after wave of attacks flowed as the clock ticked down to half-time and the catalans almost achieved parity in style when eto 'o spun away from the arsenal defense on the edge of the penalty area .
his shot looked destined for the top corner but almunia got a finger to the ball and tipped it on to the post .
ronaldinho swung a leg at the rebound but the volley had no direction .
the second-half started with barcelona showing more purpose .
two minutes after the restart , deco , a champions league winner with porto in 2004 , rifled a low shot straight at almunia after good work by van bommel on the right .
minutes later , barca substitute andres iniesta rode a flurry of tackles to bear down on the arsenal goal but again almunia was equal to the shot when it came .
barca camped in arsenal half in frantic search for equalizer frustration was beginning to creep into the barca players .
even a centrally located ronaldinho free-kick on the edge of the box was charged down by the arsenal defense .
seconds later , the brazilian tricked his way into the box only for his deft flick to be punched away by almunia .
arsenal were playing a dangerous game ; protecting a one-goal lead against a team full of attacking panache and hoping to hit the catalans on the break .
barca increased their attacking chances by taking off midfielder van bommel and bringing on henrik larsson with half an hour to play .
but the londoners almost got their reward for the risks they were taking .
fabregas robbed guily on the left as barca swarmed forwardand played in henry .
his square ball across the penalty area was hit firmly by hleb but the rushed shot flew wide .
five minutes later , fredi ljungberg should have sealed the match , breaking down the left and into the box before firing his shot high .
valdes touched the ball over but the resulting corner was wasted .
henry then had a great chance to get the goal he so desired when he broke free but his shot was too close to valdes .
seconds later at the other end , ronaldinho also fluffed a great chance , dragging a shot wide of the post from ten meters .
barcelona champions after two goals in three minutes fifteen minutes to go and samuel eto 'o made no such mistake .
a great ball from midfield evaded arsenal 's defense and a clever step-over by larsson allowed the ball to run to the cameroon striker who swept his shot past almunia from close range .
two minutes later and arsenal 's dream to a severe blow .
larsson again was the provider as the swede slipped a delicate reverse ball into the path of second substitute juliano belletti who cracked a shot between almunia 's legs and into the net .
arsenal were spent and had nothing in reserve as time ran out , leaving barca to run the clock down .
it was a cruel end to a brave performance from the londoners but barcelona made the extra man and , in the end , extra class pay .
the final whistle brought ecstatic scenes from the barcelona players and fans leaving the arsenal players crushed .
barcelona were european champions and deservedly so , not just from the performance on the night but for a season during which their beautiful game had lit up the global game .

the catalans hit two goals in the last 10 minutes to turn a game which was slipping away . fans from london and barcelona had been flooding into the french capital for most of wednesday , many without tickets , for what was billed as the most exciting european cup final in years .
now known as the champions league and unrecognisible from the knock-out format of old , the prestige of the competition remains and both barcelona and arsenal traveled to paris with their eyes on the most coveted club prize in european soccer and the legacy that belongs to it .
the winners would be awarded not only the trophy known as " old big ears " but the accolade of being the best team on the continent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who got in expected a spectacle it would be a title justifiably awarded to both teams .
barcelona - with their flair and flow , led by the incredible talents of the brazilian ronaldinho - and arsenal - the aristocrats of english soccer , fronted by one of the most devastating attackers in the history of the game , thierry henry .
two teams capable of rapid attacking soccer and prodigious skill , filled with quality from back to front .
the match was sold as ronaldinho versus henry but neither team are a one-man show .
eto 'o , deco , marquez , cole , ljungberg , pires ...
both sides started the game bursting with stars .
henry presented with two chances to open account but unsurprisingly it was henry who made the first - and second - chance , initially spinning away from rafael marquez in the area after being slipped in by alex hleb only to be thwarted by valdes .
from the corner , henry whipped a vicious low shot at the keeper from distance which valdes palmed away .
the game was barely three minutes old .
the young arsenal team had set their stall out early and were dictating the pace , obviously not in awe of the team they were facing .
barca seemed stunned but only momentarily .
ludo guily was soon testing jens lehmann after ashley cole has slipped on the left .
germany 's numer one comfortably held the rising shot from the frenchman .
it was no shock that arsenal coach arsene wenger had picked out ronaldinho as barca 's main creative threat .
each time the brazilian received the ball he found two gunners stifling his progress .
due to arsenal 's crowding tactics , ronaldinho 's first effort on goal had to come from a free kick in the 15th minute but the distance was too much even for him and the shot flew well wide of lehmann 's goal .
lehmann sees red bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : early bath : lehmann gets his marching orders just when the final looked to be settling down , drama struck in paris .
a ronaldinho slide rule pass put samuel eto 'o through on goal ; lehmann raced off his line and hauled the barca attacker down on the edge of the area .
as the last man , the referee had no choice and the german keeper saw red .
arsenal substituted robert pires for manuel almunia and the new keeper 's first job was to watch ronaldinho 's free kick fly just wide .
in the following minutes , the game looked like it could boil over , swinging from beauty to ugliness in a flash of studs .
eboue scythed down van bronkhurst in a red mist and moments later kolo toure was mugged by edmilson in a revenge attack . bodies started to litter the field and the tempo suffered .
when the game recovered , barca began to dominate .
eto 'o was tormenting eboue at will on the right while guily continued to test cole on the left but despite their dominance , barca could not find a way though arsenal 's famously stingy back line .
defender campbell draws first blood and it was a stalwart from that defensive wall which remarkably broke the deadlock and made the spanish giants pay .
after eboue had been body-checked by carlos puyol on the edge of the barca area , thierry henry floated an inch perfect free kick into the six-yard box where sol campbell rose above the static catalan defense to power a towering header past valdes to put ten-men arsenal in the lead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sol campbell heads the gunners in front barcelona responded in marauding style .
wave after wave of attacks flowed as the clock ticked down to half-time and the catalans almost achieved parity in style when eto 'o spun away from the arsenal defense on the edge of the penalty area .
his shot looked destined for the top corner but almunia got a finger to the ball and tipped it on to the post .
ronaldinho swung a leg at the rebound but the volley had no direction .
the second-half started with barcelona showing more purpose .
two minutes after the restart , deco , a champions league winner with porto in 2004 , rifled a low shot straight at almunia after good work by van bommel on the right .
minutes later , barca substitute andres iniesta rode a flurry of tackles to bear down on the arsenal goal but again almunia was equal to the shot when it came .
barca camped in arsenal half in frantic search for equalizer frustration was beginning to creep into the barca players .
even a centrally located ronaldinho free-kick on the edge of the box was charged down by the arsenal defense .
seconds later , the brazilian tricked his way into the box only for his deft flick to be punched away by almunia .
arsenal were playing a dangerous game ; protecting a one-goal lead against a team full of attacking panache and hoping to hit the catalans on the break .
barca increased their attacking chances by taking off midfielder van bommel and bringing on henrik larsson with half an hour to play .
but the londoners almost got their reward for the risks they were taking .
fabregas robbed guily on the left as barca swarmed forwardand played in henry .
his square ball across the penalty area was hit firmly by hleb but the rushed shot flew wide .
five minutes later , fredi ljungberg should have sealed the match , breaking down the left and into the box before firing his shot high .
valdes touched the ball over but the resulting corner was wasted .
henry then had a great chance to get the goal he so desired when he broke free but his shot was too close to valdes .
seconds later at the other end , ronaldinho also fluffed a great chance , dragging a shot wide of the post from ten meters .
barcelona champions after two goals in three minutes fifteen minutes to go and samuel eto 'o made no such mistake .
a great ball from midfield evaded arsenal 's defense and a clever step-over by larsson allowed the ball to run to the cameroon striker who swept his shot past almunia from close range .
two minutes later and arsenal 's dream to a severe blow .
larsson again was the provider as the swede slipped a delicate reverse ball into the path of second substitute juliano belletti who cracked a shot between almunia 's legs and into the net .
arsenal were spent and had nothing in reserve as time ran out , leaving barca to run the clock down .
it was a cruel end to a brave performance from the londoners but barcelona made the extra man and , in the end , extra class pay .
the final whistle brought ecstatic scenes from the barcelona players and fans leaving the arsenal players crushed .
barcelona were european champions and deservedly so , not just from the performance on the night but for a season during which their beautiful game had lit up the global game .

after eboue had been body-checked by carlos puyol on the edge of the barca area , thierry henry floated an inch perfect free kick into the six-yard box where sol campbell rose above the static catalan defense to power a towering header past valdes to put ten-men arsenal in the lead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sol campbell heads the gunners in front barcelona responded in marauding style .
wave after wave of attacks flowed as the clock ticked down to half-time and the catalans almost achieved parity in style when eto 'o spun away from the arsenal defense on the edge of the penalty area .
his shot looked destined for the top corner but almunia got a finger to the ball and tipped it on to the post .
ronaldinho swung a leg at the rebound but the volley had no direction .
the second-half started with barcelona showing more purpose .
two minutes after the restart , deco , a champions league winner with porto in 2004 , rifled a low shot straight at almunia after good work by van bommel on the right .
minutes later , barca substitute andres iniesta rode a flurry of tackles to bear down on the arsenal goal but again almunia was equal to the shot when it came .
barca camped in arsenal half in frantic search for equalizer frustration was beginning to creep into the barca players .
even a centrally located ronaldinho free-kick on the edge of the box was charged down by the arsenal defense .
seconds later , the brazilian tricked his way into the box only for his deft flick to be punched away by almunia .
arsenal were playing a dangerous game ; protecting a one-goal lead against a team full of attacking panache and hoping to hit the catalans on the break .
barca increased their attacking chances by taking off midfielder van bommel and bringing on henrik larsson with half an hour to play .
but the londoners almost got their reward for the risks they were taking .
fabregas robbed guily on the left as barca swarmed forwardand played in henry .
his square ball across the penalty area was hit firmly by hleb but the rushed shot flew wide .
five minutes later , fredi ljungberg should have sealed the match , breaking down the left and into the box before firing his shot high .
valdes touched the ball over but the resulting corner was wasted .
henry then had a great chance to get the goal he so desired when he broke free but his shot was too close to valdes .
seconds later at the other end , ronaldinho also fluffed a great chance , dragging a shot wide of the post from ten meters .
barcelona champions after two goals in three minutes fifteen minutes to go and samuel eto 'o made no such mistake .
a great ball from midfield evaded arsenal 's defense and a clever step-over by larsson allowed the ball to run to the cameroon striker who swept his shot past almunia from close range .
two minutes later and arsenal 's dream to a severe blow .
larsson again was the provider as the swede slipped a delicate reverse ball into the path of second substitute juliano belletti who cracked a shot between almunia 's legs and into the net .
arsenal were spent and had nothing in reserve as time ran out , leaving barca to run the clock down .
it was a cruel end to a brave performance from the londoners but barcelona made the extra man and , in the end , extra class pay .
the final whistle brought ecstatic scenes from the barcelona players and fans leaving the arsenal players crushed .
barcelona were european champions and deservedly so , not just from the performance on the night but for a season during which their beautiful game had lit up the global game .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 17.05.2006 german company fills tanks with sun großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this machine can turn biomass into fuel rising oil prices remain a hot topic of discussion .
alternatives to gas are rare and biodiesel from rapeseed , for example , has n't caught on .
but there 's hope .
a saxon firm has found a way to make fuel out of biomass . fuel is simply chemically converted solar energy .
through the photosynthesis in plants , sunlight can be converted into fossil energy , such as coal and oil . it 's a principle which a resourceful tinkerer in saxony thought must be easy to copy .
in 1990 , it was still a vision .
today , the company choren in the saxon town of freiberg actually produces synthetic fuel from biomass , or plants of all kind . " the biomass goes into a multiple-stage gasification process , which undergoes the various chemical processes until it is a high-purity synthesized gas , " said managing director carlhans uhle .
" this gas in turn is converted into diesel through several processes . " choren calls its product sundiesel .
the technical term is biomass to liquids , or btl .
four kilograms of biomass , for example wood , become one liter of diesel .
but while fossil fuels developed over a period of some 400 million years , this process only takes 400 minutes in freiberg . " if you also consider the time it takes the plants to grow , then it 's around 400 days , " uhle said . a closed e n ergy cycle choren obtains the raw material for production from local farmers , saxon 's state forestry and sawmills .
since it does n't just use the plant fruit , but rather the entire plant , the output per hectare of cultivable land in btl in comparison to normal biodiesel is three to four times higher . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this " sundiesel-beetle " runs on choren 's fuel " we can take any biomass we want to , " uhle said .
" nothing negative is left over , except for a bit of slag , which can be used to tar floors .
we are a closed energy cycle . "
in view of the ongoing climate debate , this aspect was particularly important . when this fuel is burned , it releases only as much carbon dioxide previously absorbed by the plants produced for this purpose .
the fuel also contains no sooty particles and can be filled into any diesel engine without re-fitting . biomass fuel ca n be competitive sundiesel is still in the testing phase .
only a few hundred liters are produced daily .
but large automobile producers , such as daimlerchrysler and volkswagen , and the energy giant shell are already on board .
together with choren , they are building a commercial facility , which will take up operations in the coming year and produce 250 million liters -lrb- 66 million gallons -rrb- annually .
four further facilities are planned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plant-based biodiesel has n't caught on " our technicians ' forecasts say that we are at a stage with the large scale plant to be competitive , " uhle said .
" of course , it always depends on the oil price and the dollar . " with the current high oil prices , the fuel will definitely be competitive with the construction of the third facility in 2012 or 2013 - and that without further subsidies . a liter of sundiesel still costs double that of diesel from petroleum .
the production costs are high and each new plant requires 400 million euros -lrb- $ 515.8 million -rrb- in investments .
still , btl is sparking interest worldwide ; choren has had inquiries from all over europe , the united states and china . sabine kinkartz -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german drivers angry over easter gas price hike drivers in germany are becoming increasingly angry about rising prices for gasoline which have seen a new record for this year - just in time for the easter holidays .

experts are meeting in vienna this week to tackle the issue .
but is the european response to the challenge of floods sufficient ? disastrous flooding is hitting europe on a regular basis .
this spring once again , swelling rivers in central europe displaced thousands of people . " catastrophic floods endanger lives and are likely to cause human tragedy , as well as heavy economic losses , " stavros dimas , the european commissioner for the environment , said in a statement . experts are meeting in vienna this week for the european conference on flood risk management , which kicks off on wednesday .
they will be discussing various flood strategies and outlining suitable risk management based on experiences of recent floods . according to the european commission , europe suffered over 100 major damaging floods between 1998 and 2004 , including the catastrophic floods along the danube and elbe rivers in the summer of 2002 .
since 1998 , floods in europe have caused some 700 deaths and about half a million people have been forced to leave their homes .
the bill ?
at least 25 billion euros -lrb- $ 32 billion -rrb- in insured economic losses , the commission said . shari n g the burde n across europe a major problem in flood management , though , is that most of europe 's river basins , such as the elbe and danube , are shared by more than one country . " in the case of international river basins , steps must be coordinated between the member states concerned to prevent problems being passed from one area to another , " said sergey moroz from the conservation organization wwf 's european policy office in brussels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden 's famous zwinger palace was severely damaged in the 2002 floods officials at the german environmental protection non-governmental organization bund said too many countries and regions were just looking out for their own interests . " international coordination is very important , " said christian schweer from bund 's water policy unit .
" the sectionalism in europe has to stop . " cross-border cooperation is a major element of the european commission 's flood action program to improve damage prevention and reduction across member states . " this new directive will help member states choose the right tools with which to reduce the likelihood of floods and limit their impacts , " environment commissioner dimas said .
" in particular , it aims to ensure that member states cooperate in shared river basins and coastal areas to improve flood protection all over europe . " e n viro n me n tal factors must be part of floodi n g solutio n s the commission said europe is likely to see a higher flood risk and greater economic damage in the future .
climate change is expected to increase the scale and frequency of floods , it said . " floods have always existed , but in recent years , they became disasters because of human mismanagement of rivers , floodplains and catchments and inadequate land use , " moroz said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : urban development has come too close to rivers according to schweer , 80 percent of the original floodplains along the elbe and rhine rivers , for example , have been lost due to urban development and agricultural use .
" flood protection can not exclude environmental concerns , " schweer said . although the commission program does not explicitly name ecological flood control measures , the european parliament 's environment committee has put clear environmental objectives in its proposal for the directive . " it is important that rivers be given more room , " schweer said . member states will assess a n d ma n age floods the new directive proposed earlier this year builds on the eu water framework directive -lrb- wfd -rrb- , the cornerstone of the eu water protection policy . it will require member states to carry out preliminary assessments of their river basins and associated coastal areas at risk of flooding .
where flood damage risks exist , member states will develop flood risk maps . finally , flood risk management plans must be drawn up for these zones .
these are to include measures to reduce the probability of flooding and its potential consequences , such as prevention , protection , early warning , emergency response and recovery . " the current proposal is a step in the right direction , " moroz said .
" it coordinates flood management with ecological water management as required under the wfd and has the potential to mark the beginning of a new and transparent flood management approach . " bildunterschrift : even sand bags could n't hold up the water but he said a further challenge will be striking the right balance with respect to the eu solidarity funds , an instrument set up after the catastrophic floods in europe in the summer of 2002 .
it covers reconstruction after flooding events , plus other major catastrophes . " eu financial support has to ensure long-term solutions to resolve the inadequate land use and water management policies that have contributed to these catastrophic flood events , " moroz said .
rebuilding existing dikes or making them higher would only worsen the situation , he said . " hence , we call on the european commission to make sure its money does not contribute to aggravating existing problems , " moroz said . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de swelling rivers force hundreds to flee in central europe rising floodwaters this spring forced thousands in central europe to leave their homes .

however , president mahmoud ahmadinejad said wednesday iran would reject the european union deal . " they say that they want to give us incentives , " ahmadinejad told a rally in the town of arak that was carried live on state-run television .
" they think that they can take away our gold and give us some nuts and chocolate in exchange .
there is no need to give us incentives . " a light-water research reactor is considered less of a proliferation risk than a heavy-water reactor , which can produce large amounts of plutonium .
iran is currently building a heavy-water reactor . diplomacy will take place i n private bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany hosted a meeting on the iran conflict earlier this year state department spokesman sean mccormack said the united states was working very closely with the so-called eu-3 -lrb- britain , germany and france -rrb- in developing a package to offer iran . " we are making progress in the consultations , " he told reporters in washington on tuesday . " what this package would do is provide the iranian regime a choice , " mccormack said .
" we present them with a crossroads .
so they can choose to continue down the pathway of intransigence , of non-cooperation , of obfuscation , which will lead to the increased isolation of the iranian people , or they can choose a pathway of cooperation . " however , he would not name any details of the offer . " i 'm going to let the diplomacy take place in private , " mccormack said . us " pleased " about eu efforts a western diplomat told afp news service the united states could accept the idea of an international consortium providing advanced , proliferation-resistant light-water reactor assistance to iran . " but only in the context of an agreement in which iran has verifiably agreed not to pursue uranium enrichment , including research , for the foreseeable future , " the diplomat said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian mps inspect parts of the isfahan nuclear plant he said washington was pleased that the eu had " for the first time committed itself to specific united nations security council sanctions on iran if iran fails to comply . " the five permanent un security council members plus germany were expected to meet this friday in london to review the offer .
but this meeting will likely be postponed until next week . " the package has not been approved , " nicholas burns , the us under secretary of state for political affairs , said late tuesday in washington .
" it is under development . " burns said the meeting would " probably " take place next week in london .
he said the talks on new incentives were progressing . offering iran a light-water reactor needs us backing , as european companies involved in this technology would not want to endanger their business with the united states , diplomats said . a package everyo n e ca n live with washington and the eu-3 favor a security council resolution that would require compliance .
this could open the door to sanctions , and even military action , if iran continues to enrich uranium . however , russia and china oppose such a resolution , saying they fear an escalation of the crisis .
this leaves the eu powers now trying to find a negotiation package acceptable to russia and china . " the package involves iran giving up industrial-scale enrichment and agreeing to have it done in russia , " a diplomat close to the vienna-based un nuclear watchdog international atomic energy agency said . the europeans , backed by the united states , had offered benefits including help in obtaining a light-water reactor last august , but iran rejected this offer . iran would then get trade benefits - the europeans have already promised to help tehran get into the world trade organization . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu ready to help iran develop civilian nuclear power top eu officials said monday that the bloc is willing to back a " proliferation-proof " civilian nuclear program for iran and could offer " the most sophisticated " technology to help with the country 's power needs .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 17.05.2006 german company fills tanks with sun großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this machine can turn biomass into fuel rising oil prices remain a hot topic of discussion .
alternatives to gas are rare and biodiesel from rapeseed , for example , has n't caught on .
but there 's hope .
a saxon firm has found a way to make fuel out of biomass . fuel is simply chemically converted solar energy .
through the photosynthesis in plants , sunlight can be converted into fossil energy , such as coal and oil . it 's a principle which a resourceful tinkerer in saxony thought must be easy to copy .
in 1990 , it was still a vision .
today , the company choren in the saxon town of freiberg actually produces synthetic fuel from biomass , or plants of all kind . " the biomass goes into a multiple-stage gasification process , which undergoes the various chemical processes until it is a high-purity synthesized gas , " said managing director carlhans uhle .

where flood damage risks exist , member states will develop flood risk maps . finally , flood risk management plans must be drawn up for these zones .
these are to include measures to reduce the probability of flooding and its potential consequences , such as prevention , protection , early warning , emergency response and recovery . " the current proposal is a step in the right direction , " moroz said .
" it coordinates flood management with ecological water management as required under the wfd and has the potential to mark the beginning of a new and transparent flood management approach .

the catalans hit two goals in the last 10 minutes to turn a game which was slipping away . fans from london and barcelona had been flooding into the french capital for most of wednesday , many without tickets , for what was billed as the most exciting european cup final in years .
now known as the champions league and unrecognisible from the knock-out format of old , the prestige of the competition remains and both barcelona and arsenal traveled to paris with their eyes on the most coveted club prize in european soccer and the legacy that belongs to it .
the winners would be awarded not only the trophy known as " old big ears " but the accolade of being the best team on the continent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who got in expected a spectacle it would be a title justifiably awarded to both teams .
barcelona - with their flair and flow , led by the incredible talents of the brazilian ronaldinho - and arsenal - the aristocrats of english soccer , fronted by one of the most devastating attackers in the history of the game , thierry henry .
two teams capable of rapid attacking soccer and prodigious skill , filled with quality from back to front .
the match was sold as ronaldinho versus henry but neither team are a one-man show .
eto 'o , deco , marquez , cole , ljungberg , pires ...
both sides started the game bursting with stars .
henry presented with two chances to open account but unsurprisingly it was henry who made the first - and second - chance , initially spinning away from rafael marquez in the area after being slipped in by alex hleb only to be thwarted by valdes .
from the corner , henry whipped a vicious low shot at the keeper from distance which valdes palmed away .
the game was barely three minutes old .
the young arsenal team had set their stall out early and were dictating the pace , obviously not in awe of the team they were facing .
barca seemed stunned but only momentarily .
ludo guily was soon testing jens lehmann after ashley cole has slipped on the left .
germany 's numer one comfortably held the rising shot from the frenchman .
it was no shock that arsenal coach arsene wenger had picked out ronaldinho as barca 's main creative threat .
each time the brazilian received the ball he found two gunners stifling his progress .
due to arsenal 's crowding tactics , ronaldinho 's first effort on goal had to come from a free kick in the 15th minute but the distance was too much even for him and the shot flew well wide of lehmann 's goal .
lehmann sees red bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : early bath : lehmann gets his marching orders just when the final looked to be settling down , drama struck in paris .
a ronaldinho slide rule pass put samuel eto 'o through on goal ; lehmann raced off his line and hauled the barca attacker down on the edge of the area .
as the last man , the referee had no choice and the german keeper saw red .
arsenal substituted robert pires for manuel almunia and the new keeper 's first job was to watch ronaldinho 's free kick fly just wide .
in the following minutes , the game looked like it could boil over , swinging from beauty to ugliness in a flash of studs .
eboue scythed down van bronkhurst in a red mist and moments later kolo toure was mugged by edmilson in a revenge attack . bodies started to litter the field and the tempo suffered .
when the game recovered , barca began to dominate .
eto 'o was tormenting eboue at will on the right while guily continued to test cole on the left but despite their dominance , barca could not find a way though arsenal 's famously stingy back line .
defender campbell draws first blood and it was a stalwart from that defensive wall which remarkably broke the deadlock and made the spanish giants pay .
after eboue had been body-checked by carlos puyol on the edge of the barca area , thierry henry floated an inch perfect free kick into the six-yard box where sol campbell rose above the static catalan defense to power a towering header past valdes to put ten-men arsenal in the lead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sol campbell heads the gunners in front barcelona responded in marauding style .
wave after wave of attacks flowed as the clock ticked down to half-time and the catalans almost achieved parity in style when eto 'o spun away from the arsenal defense on the edge of the penalty area .
his shot looked destined for the top corner but almunia got a finger to the ball and tipped it on to the post .
ronaldinho swung a leg at the rebound but the volley had no direction .
the second-half started with barcelona showing more purpose .
two minutes after the restart , deco , a champions league winner with porto in 2004 , rifled a low shot straight at almunia after good work by van bommel on the right .
minutes later , barca substitute andres iniesta rode a flurry of tackles to bear down on the arsenal goal but again almunia was equal to the shot when it came .
barca camped in arsenal half in frantic search for equalizer frustration was beginning to creep into the barca players .
even a centrally located ronaldinho free-kick on the edge of the box was charged down by the arsenal defense .
seconds later , the brazilian tricked his way into the box only for his deft flick to be punched away by almunia .
arsenal were playing a dangerous game ; protecting a one-goal lead against a team full of attacking panache and hoping to hit the catalans on the break .
barca increased their attacking chances by taking off midfielder van bommel and bringing on henrik larsson with half an hour to play .
but the londoners almost got their reward for the risks they were taking .
fabregas robbed guily on the left as barca swarmed forwardand played in henry .
his square ball across the penalty area was hit firmly by hleb but the rushed shot flew wide .
five minutes later , fredi ljungberg should have sealed the match , breaking down the left and into the box before firing his shot high .
valdes touched the ball over but the resulting corner was wasted .
henry then had a great chance to get the goal he so desired when he broke free but his shot was too close to valdes .
seconds later at the other end , ronaldinho also fluffed a great chance , dragging a shot wide of the post from ten meters .
barcelona champions after two goals in three minutes fifteen minutes to go and samuel eto 'o made no such mistake .
a great ball from midfield evaded arsenal 's defense and a clever step-over by larsson allowed the ball to run to the cameroon striker who swept his shot past almunia from close range .
two minutes later and arsenal 's dream to a severe blow .
larsson again was the provider as the swede slipped a delicate reverse ball into the path of second substitute juliano belletti who cracked a shot between almunia 's legs and into the net .
arsenal were spent and had nothing in reserve as time ran out , leaving barca to run the clock down .
it was a cruel end to a brave performance from the londoners but barcelona made the extra man and , in the end , extra class pay .
the final whistle brought ecstatic scenes from the barcelona players and fans leaving the arsenal players crushed .
barcelona were european champions and deservedly so , not just from the performance on the night but for a season during which their beautiful game had lit up the global game .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.05.2006 barca capture europe 's greatest soccer prize in paris thriller großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barcelona 's carles puyol lifts the trophy after his team beat arsenal barcelona beat arsenal 2-1 to win the 2006 champions league final in a classic in the stade de france on wednesday night .
the catalans hit two goals in the last 10 minutes to turn a game which was slipping away . fans from london and barcelona had been flooding into the french capital for most of wednesday , many without tickets , for what was billed as the most exciting european cup final in years .
now known as the champions league and unrecognisible from the knock-out format of old , the prestige of the competition remains and both barcelona and arsenal traveled to paris with their eyes on the most coveted club prize in european soccer and the legacy that belongs to it .
the winners would be awarded not only the trophy known as " old big ears " but the accolade of being the best team on the continent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who got in expected a spectacle it would be a title justifiably awarded to both teams .
barcelona - with their flair and flow , led by the incredible talents of the brazilian ronaldinho - and arsenal - the aristocrats of english soccer , fronted by one of the most devastating attackers in the history of the game , thierry henry .
two teams capable of rapid attacking soccer and prodigious skill , filled with quality from back to front .
the match was sold as ronaldinho versus henry but neither team are a one-man show .
eto 'o , deco , marquez , cole , ljungberg , pires ...
both sides started the game bursting with stars .
henry presented with two chances to open account but unsurprisingly it was henry who made the first - and second - chance , initially spinning away from rafael marquez in the area after being slipped in by alex hleb only to be thwarted by valdes .
from the corner , henry whipped a vicious low shot at the keeper from distance which valdes palmed away .
the game was barely three minutes old .
the young arsenal team had set their stall out early and were dictating the pace , obviously not in awe of the team they were facing .
barca seemed stunned but only momentarily .
ludo guily was soon testing jens lehmann after ashley cole has slipped on the left .
germany 's numer one comfortably held the rising shot from the frenchman .
it was no shock that arsenal coach arsene wenger had picked out ronaldinho as barca 's main creative threat .
each time the brazilian received the ball he found two gunners stifling his progress .
due to arsenal 's crowding tactics , ronaldinho 's first effort on goal had to come from a free kick in the 15th minute but the distance was too much even for him and the shot flew well wide of lehmann 's goal .
lehmann sees red bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : early bath : lehmann gets his marching orders just when the final looked to be settling down , drama struck in paris .
a ronaldinho slide rule pass put samuel eto 'o through on goal ; lehmann raced off his line and hauled the barca attacker down on the edge of the area .
as the last man , the referee had no choice and the german keeper saw red .
arsenal substituted robert pires for manuel almunia and the new keeper 's first job was to watch ronaldinho 's free kick fly just wide .
in the following minutes , the game looked like it could boil over , swinging from beauty to ugliness in a flash of studs .
eboue scythed down van bronkhurst in a red mist and moments later kolo toure was mugged by edmilson in a revenge attack . bodies started to litter the field and the tempo suffered .
when the game recovered , barca began to dominate .
eto 'o was tormenting eboue at will on the right while guily continued to test cole on the left but despite their dominance , barca could not find a way though arsenal 's famously stingy back line .
defender campbell draws first blood and it was a stalwart from that defensive wall which remarkably broke the deadlock and made the spanish giants pay .
after eboue had been body-checked by carlos puyol on the edge of the barca area , thierry henry floated an inch perfect free kick into the six-yard box where sol campbell rose above the static catalan defense to power a towering header past valdes to put ten-men arsenal in the lead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sol campbell heads the gunners in front barcelona responded in marauding style .
wave after wave of attacks flowed as the clock ticked down to half-time and the catalans almost achieved parity in style when eto 'o spun away from the arsenal defense on the edge of the penalty area .
his shot looked destined for the top corner but almunia got a finger to the ball and tipped it on to the post .
ronaldinho swung a leg at the rebound but the volley had no direction .
the second-half started with barcelona showing more purpose .
two minutes after the restart , deco , a champions league winner with porto in 2004 , rifled a low shot straight at almunia after good work by van bommel on the right .
minutes later , barca substitute andres iniesta rode a flurry of tackles to bear down on the arsenal goal but again almunia was equal to the shot when it came .
barca camped in arsenal half in frantic search for equalizer frustration was beginning to creep into the barca players .
even a centrally located ronaldinho free-kick on the edge of the box was charged down by the arsenal defense .
seconds later , the brazilian tricked his way into the box only for his deft flick to be punched away by almunia .
arsenal were playing a dangerous game ; protecting a one-goal lead against a team full of attacking panache and hoping to hit the catalans on the break .
barca increased their attacking chances by taking off midfielder van bommel and bringing on henrik larsson with half an hour to play .
but the londoners almost got their reward for the risks they were taking .
fabregas robbed guily on the left as barca swarmed forwardand played in henry .
his square ball across the penalty area was hit firmly by hleb but the rushed shot flew wide .
five minutes later , fredi ljungberg should have sealed the match , breaking down the left and into the box before firing his shot high .
valdes touched the ball over but the resulting corner was wasted .
henry then had a great chance to get the goal he so desired when he broke free but his shot was too close to valdes .
seconds later at the other end , ronaldinho also fluffed a great chance , dragging a shot wide of the post from ten meters .
barcelona champions after two goals in three minutes fifteen minutes to go and samuel eto 'o made no such mistake .
a great ball from midfield evaded arsenal 's defense and a clever step-over by larsson allowed the ball to run to the cameroon striker who swept his shot past almunia from close range .
two minutes later and arsenal 's dream to a severe blow .
larsson again was the provider as the swede slipped a delicate reverse ball into the path of second substitute juliano belletti who cracked a shot between almunia 's legs and into the net .
arsenal were spent and had nothing in reserve as time ran out , leaving barca to run the clock down .
it was a cruel end to a brave performance from the londoners but barcelona made the extra man and , in the end , extra class pay .
the final whistle brought ecstatic scenes from the barcelona players and fans leaving the arsenal players crushed .
barcelona were european champions and deservedly so , not just from the performance on the night but for a season during which their beautiful game had lit up the global game .

the catalans hit two goals in the last 10 minutes to turn a game which was slipping away . fans from london and barcelona had been flooding into the french capital for most of wednesday , many without tickets , for what was billed as the most exciting european cup final in years .
now known as the champions league and unrecognisible from the knock-out format of old , the prestige of the competition remains and both barcelona and arsenal traveled to paris with their eyes on the most coveted club prize in european soccer and the legacy that belongs to it .
the winners would be awarded not only the trophy known as " old big ears " but the accolade of being the best team on the continent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who got in expected a spectacle it would be a title justifiably awarded to both teams .
barcelona - with their flair and flow , led by the incredible talents of the brazilian ronaldinho - and arsenal - the aristocrats of english soccer , fronted by one of the most devastating attackers in the history of the game , thierry henry .
two teams capable of rapid attacking soccer and prodigious skill , filled with quality from back to front .
the match was sold as ronaldinho versus henry but neither team are a one-man show .
eto 'o , deco , marquez , cole , ljungberg , pires ...
both sides started the game bursting with stars .
henry presented with two chances to open account but unsurprisingly it was henry who made the first - and second - chance , initially spinning away from rafael marquez in the area after being slipped in by alex hleb only to be thwarted by valdes .
from the corner , henry whipped a vicious low shot at the keeper from distance which valdes palmed away .
the game was barely three minutes old .
the young arsenal team had set their stall out early and were dictating the pace , obviously not in awe of the team they were facing .
barca seemed stunned but only momentarily .
ludo guily was soon testing jens lehmann after ashley cole has slipped on the left .
germany 's numer one comfortably held the rising shot from the frenchman .
it was no shock that arsenal coach arsene wenger had picked out ronaldinho as barca 's main creative threat .
each time the brazilian received the ball he found two gunners stifling his progress .
due to arsenal 's crowding tactics , ronaldinho 's first effort on goal had to come from a free kick in the 15th minute but the distance was too much even for him and the shot flew well wide of lehmann 's goal .
lehmann sees red bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : early bath : lehmann gets his marching orders just when the final looked to be settling down , drama struck in paris .
a ronaldinho slide rule pass put samuel eto 'o through on goal ; lehmann raced off his line and hauled the barca attacker down on the edge of the area .
as the last man , the referee had no choice and the german keeper saw red .
arsenal substituted robert pires for manuel almunia and the new keeper 's first job was to watch ronaldinho 's free kick fly just wide .
in the following minutes , the game looked like it could boil over , swinging from beauty to ugliness in a flash of studs .
eboue scythed down van bronkhurst in a red mist and moments later kolo toure was mugged by edmilson in a revenge attack . bodies started to litter the field and the tempo suffered .
when the game recovered , barca began to dominate .
eto 'o was tormenting eboue at will on the right while guily continued to test cole on the left but despite their dominance , barca could not find a way though arsenal 's famously stingy back line .
defender campbell draws first blood and it was a stalwart from that defensive wall which remarkably broke the deadlock and made the spanish giants pay .
after eboue had been body-checked by carlos puyol on the edge of the barca area , thierry henry floated an inch perfect free kick into the six-yard box where sol campbell rose above the static catalan defense to power a towering header past valdes to put ten-men arsenal in the lead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sol campbell heads the gunners in front barcelona responded in marauding style .
wave after wave of attacks flowed as the clock ticked down to half-time and the catalans almost achieved parity in style when eto 'o spun away from the arsenal defense on the edge of the penalty area .
his shot looked destined for the top corner but almunia got a finger to the ball and tipped it on to the post .
ronaldinho swung a leg at the rebound but the volley had no direction .
the second-half started with barcelona showing more purpose .
two minutes after the restart , deco , a champions league winner with porto in 2004 , rifled a low shot straight at almunia after good work by van bommel on the right .
minutes later , barca substitute andres iniesta rode a flurry of tackles to bear down on the arsenal goal but again almunia was equal to the shot when it came .
barca camped in arsenal half in frantic search for equalizer frustration was beginning to creep into the barca players .
even a centrally located ronaldinho free-kick on the edge of the box was charged down by the arsenal defense .
seconds later , the brazilian tricked his way into the box only for his deft flick to be punched away by almunia .
arsenal were playing a dangerous game ; protecting a one-goal lead against a team full of attacking panache and hoping to hit the catalans on the break .
barca increased their attacking chances by taking off midfielder van bommel and bringing on henrik larsson with half an hour to play .
but the londoners almost got their reward for the risks they were taking .
fabregas robbed guily on the left as barca swarmed forwardand played in henry .
his square ball across the penalty area was hit firmly by hleb but the rushed shot flew wide .
five minutes later , fredi ljungberg should have sealed the match , breaking down the left and into the box before firing his shot high .
valdes touched the ball over but the resulting corner was wasted .
henry then had a great chance to get the goal he so desired when he broke free but his shot was too close to valdes .
seconds later at the other end , ronaldinho also fluffed a great chance , dragging a shot wide of the post from ten meters .
barcelona champions after two goals in three minutes fifteen minutes to go and samuel eto 'o made no such mistake .
a great ball from midfield evaded arsenal 's defense and a clever step-over by larsson allowed the ball to run to the cameroon striker who swept his shot past almunia from close range .
two minutes later and arsenal 's dream to a severe blow .
larsson again was the provider as the swede slipped a delicate reverse ball into the path of second substitute juliano belletti who cracked a shot between almunia 's legs and into the net .
arsenal were spent and had nothing in reserve as time ran out , leaving barca to run the clock down .
it was a cruel end to a brave performance from the londoners but barcelona made the extra man and , in the end , extra class pay .
the final whistle brought ecstatic scenes from the barcelona players and fans leaving the arsenal players crushed .
barcelona were european champions and deservedly so , not just from the performance on the night but for a season during which their beautiful game had lit up the global game .

the catalans hit two goals in the last 10 minutes to turn a game which was slipping away . fans from london and barcelona had been flooding into the french capital for most of wednesday , many without tickets , for what was billed as the most exciting european cup final in years .
now known as the champions league and unrecognisible from the knock-out format of old , the prestige of the competition remains and both barcelona and arsenal traveled to paris with their eyes on the most coveted club prize in european soccer and the legacy that belongs to it .
the winners would be awarded not only the trophy known as " old big ears " but the accolade of being the best team on the continent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who got in expected a spectacle it would be a title justifiably awarded to both teams .
barcelona - with their flair and flow , led by the incredible talents of the brazilian ronaldinho - and arsenal - the aristocrats of english soccer , fronted by one of the most devastating attackers in the history of the game , thierry henry .
two teams capable of rapid attacking soccer and prodigious skill , filled with quality from back to front .
the match was sold as ronaldinho versus henry but neither team are a one-man show .
eto 'o , deco , marquez , cole , ljungberg , pires ...
both sides started the game bursting with stars .
henry presented with two chances to open account but unsurprisingly it was henry who made the first - and second - chance , initially spinning away from rafael marquez in the area after being slipped in by alex hleb only to be thwarted by valdes .
from the corner , henry whipped a vicious low shot at the keeper from distance which valdes palmed away .
the game was barely three minutes old .
the young arsenal team had set their stall out early and were dictating the pace , obviously not in awe of the team they were facing .
barca seemed stunned but only momentarily .
ludo guily was soon testing jens lehmann after ashley cole has slipped on the left .
germany 's numer one comfortably held the rising shot from the frenchman .
it was no shock that arsenal coach arsene wenger had picked out ronaldinho as barca 's main creative threat .
each time the brazilian received the ball he found two gunners stifling his progress .
due to arsenal 's crowding tactics , ronaldinho 's first effort on goal had to come from a free kick in the 15th minute but the distance was too much even for him and the shot flew well wide of lehmann 's goal .
lehmann sees red bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : early bath : lehmann gets his marching orders just when the final looked to be settling down , drama struck in paris .
a ronaldinho slide rule pass put samuel eto 'o through on goal ; lehmann raced off his line and hauled the barca attacker down on the edge of the area .
as the last man , the referee had no choice and the german keeper saw red .
arsenal substituted robert pires for manuel almunia and the new keeper 's first job was to watch ronaldinho 's free kick fly just wide .
in the following minutes , the game looked like it could boil over , swinging from beauty to ugliness in a flash of studs .
eboue scythed down van bronkhurst in a red mist and moments later kolo toure was mugged by edmilson in a revenge attack . bodies started to litter the field and the tempo suffered .
when the game recovered , barca began to dominate .
eto 'o was tormenting eboue at will on the right while guily continued to test cole on the left but despite their dominance , barca could not find a way though arsenal 's famously stingy back line .
defender campbell draws first blood and it was a stalwart from that defensive wall which remarkably broke the deadlock and made the spanish giants pay .
after eboue had been body-checked by carlos puyol on the edge of the barca area , thierry henry floated an inch perfect free kick into the six-yard box where sol campbell rose above the static catalan defense to power a towering header past valdes to put ten-men arsenal in the lead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sol campbell heads the gunners in front barcelona responded in marauding style .
wave after wave of attacks flowed as the clock ticked down to half-time and the catalans almost achieved parity in style when eto 'o spun away from the arsenal defense on the edge of the penalty area .
his shot looked destined for the top corner but almunia got a finger to the ball and tipped it on to the post .
ronaldinho swung a leg at the rebound but the volley had no direction .
the second-half started with barcelona showing more purpose .
two minutes after the restart , deco , a champions league winner with porto in 2004 , rifled a low shot straight at almunia after good work by van bommel on the right .
minutes later , barca substitute andres iniesta rode a flurry of tackles to bear down on the arsenal goal but again almunia was equal to the shot when it came .
barca camped in arsenal half in frantic search for equalizer frustration was beginning to creep into the barca players .
even a centrally located ronaldinho free-kick on the edge of the box was charged down by the arsenal defense .
seconds later , the brazilian tricked his way into the box only for his deft flick to be punched away by almunia .
arsenal were playing a dangerous game ; protecting a one-goal lead against a team full of attacking panache and hoping to hit the catalans on the break .
barca increased their attacking chances by taking off midfielder van bommel and bringing on henrik larsson with half an hour to play .
but the londoners almost got their reward for the risks they were taking .
fabregas robbed guily on the left as barca swarmed forwardand played in henry .
his square ball across the penalty area was hit firmly by hleb but the rushed shot flew wide .
five minutes later , fredi ljungberg should have sealed the match , breaking down the left and into the box before firing his shot high .
valdes touched the ball over but the resulting corner was wasted .
henry then had a great chance to get the goal he so desired when he broke free but his shot was too close to valdes .
seconds later at the other end , ronaldinho also fluffed a great chance , dragging a shot wide of the post from ten meters .
barcelona champions after two goals in three minutes fifteen minutes to go and samuel eto 'o made no such mistake .
a great ball from midfield evaded arsenal 's defense and a clever step-over by larsson allowed the ball to run to the cameroon striker who swept his shot past almunia from close range .
two minutes later and arsenal 's dream to a severe blow .
larsson again was the provider as the swede slipped a delicate reverse ball into the path of second substitute juliano belletti who cracked a shot between almunia 's legs and into the net .
arsenal were spent and had nothing in reserve as time ran out , leaving barca to run the clock down .
it was a cruel end to a brave performance from the londoners but barcelona made the extra man and , in the end , extra class pay .
the final whistle brought ecstatic scenes from the barcelona players and fans leaving the arsenal players crushed .
barcelona were european champions and deservedly so , not just from the performance on the night but for a season during which their beautiful game had lit up the global game .

experts are meeting in vienna this week to tackle the issue .
but is the european response to the challenge of floods sufficient ? disastrous flooding is hitting europe on a regular basis .
this spring once again , swelling rivers in central europe displaced thousands of people . " catastrophic floods endanger lives and are likely to cause human tragedy , as well as heavy economic losses , " stavros dimas , the european commissioner for the environment , said in a statement . experts are meeting in vienna this week for the european conference on flood risk management , which kicks off on wednesday .
they will be discussing various flood strategies and outlining suitable risk management based on experiences of recent floods . according to the european commission , europe suffered over 100 major damaging floods between 1998 and 2004 , including the catastrophic floods along the danube and elbe rivers in the summer of 2002 .
since 1998 , floods in europe have caused some 700 deaths and about half a million people have been forced to leave their homes .
the bill ?
at least 25 billion euros -lrb- $ 32 billion -rrb- in insured economic losses , the commission said . shari n g the burde n across europe a major problem in flood management , though , is that most of europe 's river basins , such as the elbe and danube , are shared by more than one country . " in the case of international river basins , steps must be coordinated between the member states concerned to prevent problems being passed from one area to another , " said sergey moroz from the conservation organization wwf 's european policy office in brussels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden 's famous zwinger palace was severely damaged in the 2002 floods officials at the german environmental protection non-governmental organization bund said too many countries and regions were just looking out for their own interests . " international coordination is very important , " said christian schweer from bund 's water policy unit .
" the sectionalism in europe has to stop . " cross-border cooperation is a major element of the european commission 's flood action program to improve damage prevention and reduction across member states . " this new directive will help member states choose the right tools with which to reduce the likelihood of floods and limit their impacts , " environment commissioner dimas said .
" in particular , it aims to ensure that member states cooperate in shared river basins and coastal areas to improve flood protection all over europe . " e n viro n me n tal factors must be part of floodi n g solutio n s the commission said europe is likely to see a higher flood risk and greater economic damage in the future .
climate change is expected to increase the scale and frequency of floods , it said . " floods have always existed , but in recent years , they became disasters because of human mismanagement of rivers , floodplains and catchments and inadequate land use , " moroz said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : urban development has come too close to rivers according to schweer , 80 percent of the original floodplains along the elbe and rhine rivers , for example , have been lost due to urban development and agricultural use .
" flood protection can not exclude environmental concerns , " schweer said . although the commission program does not explicitly name ecological flood control measures , the european parliament 's environment committee has put clear environmental objectives in its proposal for the directive . " it is important that rivers be given more room , " schweer said . member states will assess a n d ma n age floods the new directive proposed earlier this year builds on the eu water framework directive -lrb- wfd -rrb- , the cornerstone of the eu water protection policy . it will require member states to carry out preliminary assessments of their river basins and associated coastal areas at risk of flooding .
where flood damage risks exist , member states will develop flood risk maps . finally , flood risk management plans must be drawn up for these zones .
these are to include measures to reduce the probability of flooding and its potential consequences , such as prevention , protection , early warning , emergency response and recovery . " the current proposal is a step in the right direction , " moroz said .
" it coordinates flood management with ecological water management as required under the wfd and has the potential to mark the beginning of a new and transparent flood management approach . " bildunterschrift : even sand bags could n't hold up the water but he said a further challenge will be striking the right balance with respect to the eu solidarity funds , an instrument set up after the catastrophic floods in europe in the summer of 2002 .
it covers reconstruction after flooding events , plus other major catastrophes . " eu financial support has to ensure long-term solutions to resolve the inadequate land use and water management policies that have contributed to these catastrophic flood events , " moroz said .
rebuilding existing dikes or making them higher would only worsen the situation , he said . " hence , we call on the european commission to make sure its money does not contribute to aggravating existing problems , " moroz said . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : swelling rivers force hundreds to flee in central europe rising floodwaters this spring forced thousands in central europe to leave their homes .

with relations between the islamic world and the west now such a focus of attention some will see the mere act of staging word into art as a political statement .
isabelle caussé , who helped curate it , says that though many of the artists have been deeply influenced by the politics of the middle east the museum 's aim was simply to show to the world developments in modern art in a huge region whose culture remains unfamiliar to most people outside its borders .
' word into art - artists of the modern middle east ' continues at the british museum in london until september 2nd .
admission is free .

the county council has said it is to consider the idea of becoming a unitary authority , as well as ways it could better work with district councils .
it has launched its review ahead of a whitehall announcement on the future of local government due this summer .
oxford city council has already made it clear it wants to become a stand-alone unitary authority .
' lack of clarity ' the government has asked councils which operate in a two-tier local government system - with county and district authorities - to decide whether the current structure delivers the best system .
councillor keith mitchell , county council leader , said he was " concerned " about the possible impact of any reorganisation .
he said : " we are ready for all eventualities .
we know that the city council wants unitary status .
" however we also know that there are good arguments for an enhanced two-tier system that is seamless to residents .
" given the lack of clarity from government , we also need to examine the case for a unitary county council . "
the city council has joined with councils in exeter , ipswich and norwich in a campaign to take control of education , social services and trading standards from their county councils .
their case is backed by a report commissioned by the councils and produced by birmingham university 's institute of local government studies .
the report says gaining unitary status would not cost extra and would in the long term save money .

the agency has called for stricter water measures in the south east , which it said was drier than parts of africa , to accommodate housing growth .
it also highlighted the need to balance public and environmental demand .
the agency 's latest drought update said fish were dying in berkshire .
it also said southern water was expected to ask for a second permit to use river water .
' fish dying ' near-average rainfall in april improved water supplies in the south east which is starting the summer after two dry winters , but groundwater and river levels remained low , officers said .
the agency also said there was now little chance of improvement until the autumn .
it warned that southern , central and eastern england were likely to see widespread environment problems this summer .
this week , hundreds of fish died in a stream near reading after low water flow led to an obstruction and the fish were unable to escape rising temperatures and falling oxygen levels . "
all of us need to do what we can " barbara young , chief executive thirteen million people in the south east have now been banned from using hosepipes in order to protect the public water supply .
this week , sutton and east surrey water was granted a six-month drought order to ban car washing , the filling of swimming pools and watering of parks and sports grounds .
southern and mid kent water companies are awaiting decisions on similar applications .
the environment agency said a drought permit that allowed southern water to take supplies from the river medway had now expired , but the water firm was looking to apply for a further permit to fill the reservoir during the summer .
before the board meeting , barbara young , chief executive of the environment agency , said : " it is important for us to try to balance public demand with the needs of the environment .
" all of us need to do what we can to conserve water so we do not take more than is absolutely necessary from the environment . "
the agency said the board meeting on wednesday was open to the public and people were invited to meet and put questions to board members .

david roberts , of the immigration and nationality directorate -lrb- ind -rrb- , said there was little point hunting individuals who overstayed their visas .
he also said he did not have the " faintest idea " how many illegal immigrants there were in the uk .
the tories said his words and those of other ind officials " beggared belief " .
but mr roberts , who is head of removals at the directorate , said the directorate 's resources were better targeted on firms employing illegal workers .
he told mps he did not " have the faintest idea " how many illegal immigrants there were in the uk , although he was aware of estimates suggesting the number of illegal immigrants was about 400,000 . "
we are making huge efforts to remove them , but not on the basis of tracing individuals " david roberts , ind head of removals but he also admitted he did not know how many people had been told by the home office to leave the country .
" in terms of the number of letters sent to people who have been refused permission to stay here , i simply was n't able to get that information , " he told the commons home affairs committee .
the situation was branded " amazing " and a " mockery of the immigration control system " by labour mp david winnick .
mr roberts said he could " understand the public 's frustration " but the system would be tightened up when new " electronic borders " came into effect .
' huge efforts ' the ind 's efforts were focused on removing failed asylum seekers and on mounting " targeted " and " high profile " raids on firms employing illegal immigrants .
" we are making huge efforts to remove them , but not on the basis of tracing individuals , " mr roberts told the home affairs select committee .
he added : " there was a time , quite a few years ago , when i was an immigration officer , when indeed we knocked on lots of doors , following up lots of individual cases .
" and it came as no surprise that none of those individuals were at the addresses we had for them . "
he said a " far more sophisticated , intelligence-led approach " was now used to find people who had overstayed their visas and were working illegally .
but unless they posed a " risk to national security , " he could not accept pursuing individuals was an " effective strategy " , he told the committee .
public confidence committee chairman john denham asked what a worried constituent ordered to leave the country should be advised to do .
" i get the impression the correct answer for me to give would be ' not very much , they do n't track individuals .
i would n't worry about it ' , " said mr denham . "
there is no excuse for not tracking every one of these individuals until they are sure they are out of country " david davis , shadow home secretary mr roberts replied that the ind did a lot of operations targeted at where people work and kept in contact with people " as part of a reporting regime " .
but he added : " if the committee concludes that we should be tracking individuals as part of its inquiry then that presents a series of challenges to us , to act on that recommendation in relation to the internal controls we have in the uk . "
he said the ind had carried out more than 3,500 raids on companies last year .
and although this had only resulted in 293 successful prosecutions , it was expelling more than 1,000 illegal immigrants per month - which he said was well in excess of its target .
he said the uk 's illegal immigration problem , which according to one estimate was about 0.7 % of the population , was small compared to the united states , where they made up " 7 or 8 % " of the population .
but he admitted public confidence in the immigration system was fragile .
" not having public confidence and allowing perceptions of a lack of enforcement i think is a huge challenge for us that we need to address , " he told mps .
' no excuse ' commenting on mr roberts ' evidence and other revelations that national insurance numbers were given to people without checking their immigration status , shadow home secretary , david davis , said : " this sounds like deliberate negligence on the part of the home office .
" there is no excuse for not tracking every one of these individuals until they are sure they are out of country .
" as for limiting their actions to those they consider a security risk , it is hard to believe that the home office is in a position to assess the threat to the public safety of every single one of 250 thousand failed asylum seekers currently still at large in this country .
" it beggars belief that along with our porous borders , problems with foreign criminals and our inability to deport a quarter of a million failed asylum seekers we also manage to hand out national insurance numbers without checking up on a person 's immigration status . "

mr roberts said he could " understand the public 's frustration " but the system would be tightened up when new " electronic borders " came into effect .
' huge efforts ' the ind 's efforts were focused on removing failed asylum seekers and on mounting " targeted " and " high profile " raids on firms employing illegal immigrants .
" we are making huge efforts to remove them , but not on the basis of tracing individuals , " mr roberts told the home affairs select committee .
he added : " there was a time , quite a few years ago , when i was an immigration officer , when indeed we knocked on lots of doors , following up lots of individual cases .
" and it came as no surprise that none of those individuals were at the addresses we had for them . "
he said a " far more sophisticated , intelligence-led approach " was now used to find people who had overstayed their visas and were working illegally .
but unless they posed a " risk to national security , " he could not accept pursuing individuals was an " effective strategy " , he told the committee .
public confidence committee chairman john denham asked what a worried constituent ordered to leave the country should be advised to do .
" i get the impression the correct answer for me to give would be ' not very much , they do n't track individuals .
i would n't worry about it ' , " said mr denham .
there is no excuse for not tracking every one of these individuals until they are sure they are out of country david davis , shadow home secretary mr roberts replied that the ind did a lot of operations targeted at where people work and kept in contact with people " as part of a reporting regime " .
but he added : " if the committee concludes that we should be tracking individuals as part of its inquiry then that presents a series of challenges to us , to act on that recommendation in relation to the internal controls we have in the uk . "
he said the ind had carried out more than 3,500 raids on companies last year .
and although this had only resulted in 293 successful prosecutions , it was expelling more than 1,000 illegal immigrants per month - which he said was well in excess of its target .
he said the uk 's illegal immigration problem , which according to one estimate was about 0.7 % of the population , was small compared to the united states , where they made up " 7 or 8 % " of the population .
but he admitted public confidence in the immigration system was fragile .
" not having public confidence and allowing perceptions of a lack of enforcement i think is a huge challenge for us that we need to address , " he told mps .
' no excuse ' commenting on mr roberts ' evidence and other revelations that national insurance numbers were given to people without checking their immigration status , shadow home secretary , david davis , said : " this sounds like deliberate negligence on the part of the home office .
" there is no excuse for not tracking every one of these individuals until they are sure they are out of country .
" as for limiting their actions to those they consider a security risk , it is hard to believe that the home office is in a position to assess the threat to the public safety of every single one of 250 thousand failed asylum seekers currently still at large in this country .
" it beggars belief that along with our porous borders , problems with foreign criminals and our inability to deport a quarter of a million failed asylum seekers we also manage to hand out national insurance numbers without checking up on a person 's immigration status . "

a decision on the two nations joining the eu in 2007 is being delayed .
pressure group migration watch uk urged ministers to be " very cautious " after previous vast underestimates of numbers of east europeans coming to the uk .
the home office said no decision on restrictions on romanian and bulgarians working in the uk had been made .
the european commission has said the two countries are on track to join the eu on 1 january .

linda honey said she can not see any point in merging the service - which will join the trust serving notts , leics , northants and derbyshire .
but lincoln mp gillian merron insists the change will bring faster response times and improved the service .
government minister lord warner announced the merger on tuesday .
there will be less bureaucracy , more money to invest in front line services and better care for patients lord warner , health minister mrs honey said : " big is not always beautiful - the ambulance service has consistently shown its ability to modernise , meet its targets and maintain financial balance over past 15 years .
" i am a loss to see the point of the consultation process as the majority of the respondents from across the east midlands were against the proposals . "
boston mp mark simmons has also said he could not understand why the government did not listen to local objections to the scheme .
but the chairman of the east midlands ambulance service -lrb- emas -rrb- chris faircliffe said he was looking forward to sharing good practice with colleagues from lincolnshire and northamptonshire .
improved care lord warner said : " by creating fewer larger ambulance trusts , there will be less bureaucracy , more money to invest in front line services and better care for patients .
the boundary changes that were recommended will create larger organisations that will be better equipped to meet the challenges faced by a 21st century service . "
" we know that these changes are important for local people , which is why we put the proposals to public consultation .
he said the larger trusts will mean more investment in front-line services and improved patient care - and there would be no reduction in ambulance vehicles or front-line staff .

there will be less bureaucracy , more money to invest in front line services and better care for patients lord warner , health minister mrs honey said : " big is not always beautiful - the ambulance service has consistently shown its ability to modernise , meet its targets and maintain financial balance over past 15 years .
" i am a loss to see the point of the consultation process as the majority of the respondents from across the east midlands were against the proposals . "
boston mp mark simmons has also said he could not understand why the government did not listen to local objections to the scheme .
but the chairman of the east midlands ambulance service -lrb- emas -rrb- chris faircliffe said he was looking forward to sharing good practice with colleagues from lincolnshire and northamptonshire .
improved care lord warner said : " by creating fewer larger ambulance trusts , there will be less bureaucracy , more money to invest in front line services and better care for patients .
the boundary changes that were recommended will create larger organisations that will be better equipped to meet the challenges faced by a 21st century service . "
" we know that these changes are important for local people , which is why we put the proposals to public consultation .
he said the larger trusts will mean more investment in front-line services and improved patient care - and there would be no reduction in ambulance vehicles or front-line staff .
east midlands ambulance service has covered the counties of leicestershire , rutland , derbyshire and nottinghamshire since 1999 .

a report by the affordable rural housing commission says at least 11,000 new homes a year must be built .
it suggests a new tax on second homes and more restrictions on the right to buy council houses in rural areas .
without such action , rural communities will be reduced to retirement towns and " dormitories " for the wealthy , it adds .
the commission has also emphasised the obligation on national park authorities to play their part in building affordable homes , as well as the involvement of planners and rural communities themselves . "
villages and country towns must be allowed to evolve in the way they did in the past " elinor goodman village 's unusual attraction commission chair elinor goodman said : " we recommend that 11,000 affordable homes need to be built .
that 's equivalent to around six new houses a year in each rural ward in england .
" villages and country towns must be allowed to evolve in the way they did in the past - they ca n't just be preserved in aspic .
" most can probably absorb some more houses , as long as they are in scale and character and maintain the identity of individual communities . "
she said the issue of second homes was not a major problem across the country , but was a real concern in some areas where there was a disproportionately high number .
professor martin shucksmith , also of the commission , told bbc news that commuters buying up property is the main difficulty .
' restricted supply ' but other groups , such as people retiring to the countryside , are causing concerns .
" the problem is a mixture of these new groups coming in with the money that they have and on the other side , the very restricted supply which arises by choice really because the planning system restricts the amount of houses that are built in rural england . "
private development is also needed , to provide the first step on the housing ladder and to generate cross-subsidies to pay for the affordable housing , said the commission .
it was set up last year in response to widespread concern over the lack of affordable homes in rural areas .
caroline spelman , shadow secretary of state for communities and local government , said : " there is clearly a problem with a lack of affordable housing in rural areas , and across the country , but higher taxes and more regulation are not the answer .
" this is another sign that labour are turning council tax into a crude wealth tax and punishing those who have saved and worked hard . "

a report by the affordable rural housing commission says at least 11,000 new homes a year must be built .
