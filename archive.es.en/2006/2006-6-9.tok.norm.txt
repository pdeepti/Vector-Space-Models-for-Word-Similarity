others ask whether the hoopla is n't just a bit too much . no matter how you look at the world cup , it 's always close to the official motto of " a time to make friends , " wrote the karlsruhe-based badische neueste nachrichten .
" germany wants to present itself as an open , good-natured , dynamic country , " the paper said .
" if it manages that , the benefits would be immeasurable . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wil the motto " a time to make friends " translate into a real feeling ?
that view is shared by the heilbronner stimme which opined that germany would be a winner - irrespective of how it performed on the pitch - if the official world cup motto translated into a tangible feeling for the fans .
" people expect perfect organization from the germans , but not warmth and joie de vivre .
the world cup offers the chance for an image makeover in a very simple way , " the paper wrote .
" the nicest praise would be the conclusion : germany is different . " the dresden-based sächsische zeitung wrote that the world has noticed that germany is making an effort and is showing off its best side .
" the london times writes that germany is ready for a new image , the dutch are writing friendly things about us and the danes are discovering new success stories about the ' world champs in organization , " ' the paper wrote .
" of course clichés still persist .
but it shows that germany can and will change its image through the mammoth soccer event , despite the recent xenophobic attacks , " the daily said . some newspapers also took a jibe at the commercial hoopla and hype that has consumed the event . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some wonder if germany has n't gone overboard with soccer mania " if all that 's been written and said in the past months is true , then a real multifunctional world cup is heading towards this country , " the münchner merkur wrote .
it added that the biggest soccer event of the world was meant to kick-start the economy , create jobs , lift sagging spirits and present the image of a modern , friendly germany abroad .
" that 's quite a lot for a single tournament and we have n't even begun to talk about soccer as yet , " the paper wrote .
it all adds up to a sated feeling , almost one of reluctance for the ordinary citizen , it said .
" you might say that all this is now a part of modern sport , you ca n't change it .
the opening game should put things in perspective . " " it would be wonderful if modernizer klinsmann is successful and his team cuts a brave figure .
that could revive germans ' belief in their own abilities , " the southern german augsburger allgemeine wrote .
the paper however reminded that the euphoria of germany winning the last world cup , in 1990 - the year that german reunification took place - did n't last long .
" the world cup does n't solve our problems . " berlin-based daily der tagesspiegel commented that there were several people who are completely annoyed by the whole hype surrounding the event and do n't care about it all .
" a game !
is n't there anything more important than that ? " the paper asked rhetorically .
" but there is some comfort for those who ca n't stand the world cup - it 's over in 33 days , " the daily wrote .
" but everyone - even those who hate it - will have something special at the end of the tournament : the memory of a world cup in your own country . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hosts plot costa rica 's downfall as world cup kicks off the waiting is almost over .
nearly six years after germany was awarded the 2006 world cup , the globe 's biggest soccer spectacle is ready to kick-off in munich friday with the hosts playing costa rica in the first game .
-lrb- june 9 , 2006 -rrb- some soccer fans want to reclaim the game the world cup , which starts friday , will be the culmination of two years of hype that has left no marketing stone unturned .
for " true " fans , it has become capitalistic excess and some are rebelling .
-lrb- june 8 , 2006 -rrb- german hosts marginalized by fifa 's occupying power if there was any doubt , this is fifa 's world cup .
world soccer 's governing body has assumed almost total control and the german hosts are increasingly pushed aside .
there is , not surprisingly , trouble in soccer paradise .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.06.2006 washington wants german troops in iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : donald rumsfeld feels the us needs german support in iraq us defense secretary donald rumsfeld is putting germany under increasing pressure to send troops to iraq , say german media reports . according to the daily berliner zeitung , rumsfeld called on his german counterpart franz josef jung to deploy bundeswehr soldiers in training iraqi forces in baghdad .
the request apparently came shortly after the german elections last autumn , with washington hoping that the new government might do a u-turn from the social democratic-green party coalition 's staunch resistance to the military invasion . but chancellor angela merkel has adhered to the same policy upheld by her predecessor , gerhard schröder , who categorically rejected involvement in the us-led military presence in iraq . german newspapers allege that in government circles , sending troops to the country , even in a training capacity , is seen as the thin end of the wedge . " if we gave them an inch , they would take a mile , " the berliner zeitung quoted one source as saying . germany stays firm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr plays a role in the conflict , but the us wants more speaking after a meeting of nato defense ministers in brussels thursday , jung stressed that despite repeated urging from washington , germany would not be sending the bundeswehr to iraq . in 2004 , nato agreed to a training mission which has so far seen 1,000 iraqi officers trained in the iraqi capital and a further 500 in europe , including at the bundeswehr 's military academy in hamburg .
german soldiers are also training iraqis in the united arab emirates . " germany is contributing to stabilizing the iraqi forces , " emphasized jung in brussels , but reiterated that deploying troops inside the country remained out of the question . modern-day challenges at the meeting , nato defense ministers approved new guidelines to adapt the military alliance to modern-day challenges and provide for the deployment of hundreds of thousands of troops , a spokesman said . the move comes as the alliance is increasingly called upon to conduct missions unlike the purely military operations it has run in the past , like moving aid into quake-hit pakistan or providing training . " nato has gone through very fundamental changes in terms of what it has done and what it is doing , and this will bring the force planning into line with the realities of the 21st century , " said spokesman james appathurai . simultaneous missions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr is increasingly deployed for disaster relief , such as in pakistan in 2005 the so-called " ministerial guidance " will prepare nato to conduct simultaneously two large missions , involving some 60,000 troops , and six smaller ones , comprising up to 30,000 soldiers each . " we no longer need to prepare for one big war .
we have to prepare for , and indeed carry out , a multitude of military operations , " appathurai said . the document will guide the 26 members of the alliance in ways to prepare for nato 's new operations and work with other bodies like the un , the eu and non-governmental organizations . the spokesman said that the allies had also committed " to endeavor " to boost their military spending to two percent of gross domestic product ; a level only achieved currently by seven states . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : troops are n't answer in afghanistan the bundestag extended the german 's army 's mandate in afghanistan in a clear vote on wednesday , but deutsche welle 's nina werkhäuser says more soldiers wo n't solve the country 's problems .

others ask whether the hoopla is n't just a bit too much . no matter how you look at the world cup , it 's always close to the official motto of " a time to make friends , " wrote the karlsruhe-based badische neueste nachrichten .
" germany wants to present itself as an open , good-natured , dynamic country , " the paper said .
" if it manages that , the benefits would be immeasurable . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wil the motto " a time to make friends " translate into a real feeling ?
that view is shared by the heilbronner stimme which opined that germany would be a winner - irrespective of how it performed on the pitch - if the official world cup motto translated into a tangible feeling for the fans .
" people expect perfect organization from the germans , but not warmth and joie de vivre .
the world cup offers the chance for an image makeover in a very simple way , " the paper wrote .
" the nicest praise would be the conclusion : germany is different . " the dresden-based sächsische zeitung wrote that the world has noticed that germany is making an effort and is showing off its best side .
" the london times writes that germany is ready for a new image , the dutch are writing friendly things about us and the danes are discovering new success stories about the ' world champs in organization , " ' the paper wrote .
" of course clichés still persist .
but it shows that germany can and will change its image through the mammoth soccer event , despite the recent xenophobic attacks , " the daily said . some newspapers also took a jibe at the commercial hoopla and hype that has consumed the event . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some wonder if germany has n't gone overboard with soccer mania " if all that 's been written and said in the past months is true , then a real multifunctional world cup is heading towards this country , " the münchner merkur wrote .
it added that the biggest soccer event of the world was meant to kick-start the economy , create jobs , lift sagging spirits and present the image of a modern , friendly germany abroad .
" that 's quite a lot for a single tournament and we have n't even begun to talk about soccer as yet , " the paper wrote .
it all adds up to a sated feeling , almost one of reluctance for the ordinary citizen , it said .
" you might say that all this is now a part of modern sport , you ca n't change it .
the opening game should put things in perspective . " " it would be wonderful if modernizer klinsmann is successful and his team cuts a brave figure .
that could revive germans ' belief in their own abilities , " the southern german augsburger allgemeine wrote .
the paper however reminded that the euphoria of germany winning the last world cup , in 1990 - the year that german reunification took place - did n't last long .
" the world cup does n't solve our problems . " berlin-based daily der tagesspiegel commented that there were several people who are completely annoyed by the whole hype surrounding the event and do n't care about it all .
" a game !
is n't there anything more important than that ? " the paper asked rhetorically .
" but there is some comfort for those who ca n't stand the world cup - it 's over in 33 days , " the daily wrote .
" but everyone - even those who hate it - will have something special at the end of the tournament : the memory of a world cup in your own country . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hosts plot costa rica 's downfall as world cup kicks off the waiting is almost over .
nearly six years after germany was awarded the 2006 world cup , the globe 's biggest soccer spectacle is ready to kick-off in munich friday with the hosts playing costa rica in the first game .
-lrb- june 9 , 2006 -rrb- some soccer fans want to reclaim the game the world cup , which starts friday , will be the culmination of two years of hype that has left no marketing stone unturned .
for " true " fans , it has become capitalistic excess and some are rebelling .
-lrb- june 8 , 2006 -rrb- german hosts marginalized by fifa 's occupying power if there was any doubt , this is fifa 's world cup .
world soccer 's governing body has assumed almost total control and the german hosts are increasingly pushed aside .
there is , not surprisingly , trouble in soccer paradise .

" i am writing to you to spare you and the world from the upcoming sitting of the city council in which they will decide not to give me the prize , " handke said in the letter .
" also to spare myself ... and above all to spare my work , which i do not want to become an endless target for the vulgar insults of party politicians . " he suggested that the council meeting be cancelled and its members sent into nature to breathe fresh air , " for example to have a picnic on the banks of the rhine . " an ongoing controversy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she stood up for her fellow countryman : austrian author and nobel prize winner jelinek handke was named winner of the prize last month , but the düsseldorf city council said last week that it would veto the jury 's decision because of his eulogy for former yugoslav president and alleged war criminal slobodan milosevic . the writer attended milosevic 's funeral in march and lauded him as " a man who defended his people . " the speech also sparked a bitter row in france with the administrator of the paris state theater comedie francaise , marcel bozonnet , canceling the 2007 season of handke 's play " voyage to the sonorous land or the art of asking . " bozonnet 's decision was condemned in art circles in france , where handke lives , and further afield as censorship .
the critics included his german publishers , suhrkamp , and his compatriot , nobel literature laureate elfriede jelinek . handke said he was " disgusted " by the decision and defended himself as merely having sought to counter the dominant , one-sided " polemic " view of the break-up of the former yugoslavia . a sense of deja-vu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : handke 's plays are performed all over the world , but no longer at comedie francaise but when it was announced he should receive the heinrich heine prize , the same debate about whether an artist 's work can be separated from his political views resurged in germany .
local politicians said honoring handke was a slap in the face of those who suffered under milosevic and vowed to deny him the prize , which was due to be awarded on dec .
13 . the winner is chosen by an independent panel , but must be confirmed by düsseldorf authorities who donate the prize money of 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 63,300 -rrb- . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans divided over prize for pro-serb author handke the decision to award the city of düsseldorf 's prestigious heine prize to controversial austrian author peter handke - known for his pro-serbian stance during the balkan wars - has been met with criticism in germany .

the request apparently came shortly after the german elections last autumn , with washington hoping that the new government might do a u-turn from the social democratic-green party coalition 's staunch resistance to the military invasion . but chancellor angela merkel has adhered to the same policy upheld by her predecessor , gerhard schröder , who categorically rejected involvement in the us-led military presence in iraq . german newspapers allege that in government circles , sending troops to the country , even in a training capacity , is seen as the thin end of the wedge .

" nato has gone through very fundamental changes in terms of what it has done and what it is doing , and this will bring the force planning into line with the realities of the 21st century , " said spokesman james appathurai . simultaneous missions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr is increasingly deployed for disaster relief , such as in pakistan in 2005 the so-called " ministerial guidance " will prepare nato to conduct simultaneously two large missions , involving some 60,000 troops , and six smaller ones , comprising up to 30,000 soldiers each .

the waiting is over .
nearly six years after germany was awarded the 2006 world cup , the globe 's biggest soccer spectacle began in munich friday with the hosts playing costa rica in the first game . since that ecstatic night in zurich on july 6 , 2000 when franz beckenbauer 's glitzy team of soccer legends , celebrities and politicians won the right to stage the tournament , enough column inches have been written on germany 's preparations to stretch from berlin to san jose .
now the real action starts . germany remain confident that their first opponents will not spoil the opening party .
assistant coach joachim löw revealed earlier in the week that the staff and players had studied dvds of the central americans ' warm-up matches and that the belief was that the hosts would get their world cup campaign off to a winning start . " it is the first match and we are a bit nervous but we have done our homework and i think we are in a position to beat costa rica , " löw told reporters .
" if we turn up and show our strengths we will win the match . " germany manager jürgen klinsmann has forced all of his players to watch clips of their opponents and löw claims costa rica were no longer an unknown quantity . " we have collected a lot of information on them by watching dvd clips of league games and international matches , " said löw .
" we know their strengths and weaknesses but of course we will not be discussing them in public . " costa rica n culture , lifestyle as well as tactics studied bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's first game will be no san jose beach at sunset klinsmann seems to have left nothing to chance .
the coach has even had his stars studying costa rica 's culture and lifestyle for clues on how their opponents will play in the opening match .
the german team have been viewing a short film about the friendly central american country , famed for its diverse wildlife and the fact that it has no military forces . " we introduced the players to the country , how the people live there and what their mentality is like , " löw added .
" we 've also seen from games that they 're technically skilful and they love to play beautiful soccer .
that 's a reflection of the national character . " germany captain michael ballack , who will not be playing because of injuries , said everyone had enjoyed the lesson . " it was highly educational , " ballack said .
" we all loved hearing about costa rica and getting an insight into the culture . " while having as much knowledge as possible of their opponents will give the german team a sense of preparation , the real revelations will come on the pitch .
and the hosts will be wary of any surprises . coach kli n sma n n set to start with sta n dard formatio n klinsmann is likely to deploy a standard 4-4-2 formation to counter costa rica coach alexandre guimaraes 's promise that his team are going to abandon their nice guy approach and hit their opponents with a new aggressive form of their renowned free-flowing style . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack scored against colombia but will he start the first game ?
the defensive back four charged with repelling costa rican strikers alvaro saborio and paulo wanchope is expected to be the one which kept colombia at bay in the last test match : arne friedrich , per metesacker , christoph metzelder and philipp lahm , with new number one jens lehmann tending goal behind them . with ballack missing , the midfield will probably feature bernd schneider , torsten frings and bastian schweinsteiger .
the combative tim borowski is most likely to take ballack 's place while sebastian kehl is also on standby . responsible for getting germany 's first goals of the tournament will be striking partnership miroslav klose and lukas podolski . costa rica 's trai n er says his team is n o soft touch costa rica are unlikely to roll over for the hosts just to get the party started on an upbeat note .
coach guimaraes , who was also in charge four years ago in japan / korea , has returned after the unsuccessful tenure of the american steve sampson and has built a new-look team which are tougher and more mature than in the last world cup when they were considered a soft touch . " before , costa rica were a fair play team , naive and just interested in attacking , " he recently told reporters .
" this time , everybody 's going to notice the difference . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paulo wanchope still leads the line for costa rica costa rica 's world cup debut performance in italy in 1990 saw them reach the last 16 , shocking scotland and sweden on the way .
guimaraes is optimistic that his team can at least emulate that despite struggling through the qualifying rounds . their main threat will come from paulo wanchope , their all-time leading scorer with 43 goals including eight in the qualifiers .
despite losing some of his pace , the striker has a wealth of international experience garnered from a career spent in the english and spanish leagues . world cup experie n ce from back to fro n t the team 's spine consists of the other remaining members of the class of 2002 ; including defenders harold wallace , luis marin and gilberto martinez , midfield playmaker walter centeno and forward ronald gomez .
but while these players may be well-known , germany will have to be wary of the newcomers alvaro saborio and midfielder carlos hernandez whose inclusion helped turn a near-disastrous qualifying campaign into a ticket to germany with spectacular and important long-range goals . it all adds up to a potentially thrilling game with the whiff of an upset curling around the fifa world cup stadium in munich . germany -lrb- 4-4-2 -rrb- : 1-jens lehmann ; 3-arne friedrich , 21-christoph metzelder , 17-per mertesacker , 16-phillip lahm ; 18-bernd schneider , 8-torsten frings , 13-michael ballack , 7-bastian schweinsteiger ; 20-lukas podolski , 11-miroslav klose costa rica -lrb- 3-5-2 -rrb- : 18-jose francisco porras ; 4-michael umana , 3-luis marin , 12-leonardo gonzalez ; 20-douglas sequeira , 5-gilberto martinez , 8-mauricio solis , 10-walter centeno , 6-danny fonseca ; 11-ronald gomez , 9-paulo wanchope nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de klinsmann : " we 're hungry for the opening game " german national soccer coach jürgen klinsmann said he ca n't wait for the world cup to begin after his team won their last pre-cup game against colombia 3-0 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.06.2006 washington wants german troops in iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : donald rumsfeld feels the us needs german support in iraq us defense secretary donald rumsfeld is putting germany under increasing pressure to send troops to iraq , say german media reports . according to the daily berliner zeitung , rumsfeld called on his german counterpart franz josef jung to deploy bundeswehr soldiers in training iraqi forces in baghdad .
the request apparently came shortly after the german elections last autumn , with washington hoping that the new government might do a u-turn from the social democratic-green party coalition 's staunch resistance to the military invasion . but chancellor angela merkel has adhered to the same policy upheld by her predecessor , gerhard schröder , who categorically rejected involvement in the us-led military presence in iraq . german newspapers allege that in government circles , sending troops to the country , even in a training capacity , is seen as the thin end of the wedge . " if we gave them an inch , they would take a mile , " the berliner zeitung quoted one source as saying . germany stays firm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr plays a role in the conflict , but the us wants more speaking after a meeting of nato defense ministers in brussels thursday , jung stressed that despite repeated urging from washington , germany would not be sending the bundeswehr to iraq . in 2004 , nato agreed to a training mission which has so far seen 1,000 iraqi officers trained in the iraqi capital and a further 500 in europe , including at the bundeswehr 's military academy in hamburg .
german soldiers are also training iraqis in the united arab emirates . " germany is contributing to stabilizing the iraqi forces , " emphasized jung in brussels , but reiterated that deploying troops inside the country remained out of the question . modern-day challenges at the meeting , nato defense ministers approved new guidelines to adapt the military alliance to modern-day challenges and provide for the deployment of hundreds of thousands of troops , a spokesman said . the move comes as the alliance is increasingly called upon to conduct missions unlike the purely military operations it has run in the past , like moving aid into quake-hit pakistan or providing training . " nato has gone through very fundamental changes in terms of what it has done and what it is doing , and this will bring the force planning into line with the realities of the 21st century , " said spokesman james appathurai . simultaneous missions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr is increasingly deployed for disaster relief , such as in pakistan in 2005 the so-called " ministerial guidance " will prepare nato to conduct simultaneously two large missions , involving some 60,000 troops , and six smaller ones , comprising up to 30,000 soldiers each . " we no longer need to prepare for one big war .
we have to prepare for , and indeed carry out , a multitude of military operations , " appathurai said . the document will guide the 26 members of the alliance in ways to prepare for nato 's new operations and work with other bodies like the un , the eu and non-governmental organizations . the spokesman said that the allies had also committed " to endeavor " to boost their military spending to two percent of gross domestic product ; a level only achieved currently by seven states . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : troops are n't answer in afghanistan the bundestag extended the german 's army 's mandate in afghanistan in a clear vote on wednesday , but deutsche welle 's nina werkhäuser says more soldiers wo n't solve the country 's problems .

the waiting is over .
nearly six years after germany was awarded the 2006 world cup , the globe 's biggest soccer spectacle began in munich friday with the hosts playing costa rica in the first game . since that ecstatic night in zurich on july 6 , 2000 when franz beckenbauer 's glitzy team of soccer legends , celebrities and politicians won the right to stage the tournament , enough column inches have been written on germany 's preparations to stretch from berlin to san jose .
now the real action starts . germany remain confident that their first opponents will not spoil the opening party .
assistant coach joachim löw revealed earlier in the week that the staff and players had studied dvds of the central americans ' warm-up matches and that the belief was that the hosts would get their world cup campaign off to a winning start . " it is the first match and we are a bit nervous but we have done our homework and i think we are in a position to beat costa rica , " löw told reporters .
" if we turn up and show our strengths we will win the match . " germany manager jürgen klinsmann has forced all of his players to watch clips of their opponents and löw claims costa rica were no longer an unknown quantity . " we have collected a lot of information on them by watching dvd clips of league games and international matches , " said löw .
" we know their strengths and weaknesses but of course we will not be discussing them in public . " costa rica n culture , lifestyle as well as tactics studied bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's first game will be no san jose beach at sunset klinsmann seems to have left nothing to chance .
the coach has even had his stars studying costa rica 's culture and lifestyle for clues on how their opponents will play in the opening match .
the german team have been viewing a short film about the friendly central american country , famed for its diverse wildlife and the fact that it has no military forces . " we introduced the players to the country , how the people live there and what their mentality is like , " löw added .
" we 've also seen from games that they 're technically skilful and they love to play beautiful soccer .
that 's a reflection of the national character . " germany captain michael ballack , who will not be playing because of injuries , said everyone had enjoyed the lesson . " it was highly educational , " ballack said .
" we all loved hearing about costa rica and getting an insight into the culture . " while having as much knowledge as possible of their opponents will give the german team a sense of preparation , the real revelations will come on the pitch .
and the hosts will be wary of any surprises . coach kli n sma n n set to start with sta n dard formatio n klinsmann is likely to deploy a standard 4-4-2 formation to counter costa rica coach alexandre guimaraes 's promise that his team are going to abandon their nice guy approach and hit their opponents with a new aggressive form of their renowned free-flowing style . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack scored against colombia but will he start the first game ?
the defensive back four charged with repelling costa rican strikers alvaro saborio and paulo wanchope is expected to be the one which kept colombia at bay in the last test match : arne friedrich , per metesacker , christoph metzelder and philipp lahm , with new number one jens lehmann tending goal behind them . with ballack missing , the midfield will probably feature bernd schneider , torsten frings and bastian schweinsteiger .
the combative tim borowski is most likely to take ballack 's place while sebastian kehl is also on standby . responsible for getting germany 's first goals of the tournament will be striking partnership miroslav klose and lukas podolski . costa rica 's trai n er says his team is n o soft touch costa rica are unlikely to roll over for the hosts just to get the party started on an upbeat note .
coach guimaraes , who was also in charge four years ago in japan / korea , has returned after the unsuccessful tenure of the american steve sampson and has built a new-look team which are tougher and more mature than in the last world cup when they were considered a soft touch . " before , costa rica were a fair play team , naive and just interested in attacking , " he recently told reporters .
" this time , everybody 's going to notice the difference . "

a woman that is like a german clock . "
this , however , is a story about why a german teenager will grow to be a bitter , old man . at the beginning of shakespeare 's poetic comedy love 's labor lost , king ferdinand of spain declares that his court will be devoted to ascetic study .
he lays out the rules of the game by imposing three conditions on his courtiers : no women allowed within a mile of the court , obligatory fasting once a week , and no more than three hours of sleep per night . what a great way to increase concentration ! the bard of avon , despite his literary genius , did n't know that king ferdinand 's experiment - in addition to being destined to fail - was pretty accurately describing the main symptoms of the 21st century 's malaise de mode , the new ascetism , namely internet dependency . an increasing number of people and , especially , all those new kids on the block , are living in a twisted universe in which physical contact with the human species is reduced to a bare minimum .
they inhabit a world in which nourishment comes as an accidental afterthought in between playing the angel of darkness online and looking for an internet hot date whose online profile matches the looks and curves of laura croft .
and they are often stuck in a time warp in which sleep-deprivation and hours in front of the computer screen lead to hallucinatory experiences that in the not so distant past required serious drug abuse . these kids have no idea what the psychedelic seventies were about . tour d 'amour yet despite what the pale-faced cassandras of this world will tell you about humanity 's impeding doom and cultural downfall , the last glimmer of hope has not been entirely extinguished .
for some people , it is still love , in its pure madness and untainted naiveté , that makes the world go around .
or , at least , makes us go around the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when love is concerned , no vehicle is fast enough - especially a bike one such brave defender of stirred up emotions - a lovesick 16-year-old german boy - hopped on his bicycle in hamm , in the western german state of north-rhine westphalia , and cycled more than 200 kilometers -lrb- 120 miles -rrb- overnight to meet a girl he had met on the internet , german police said on wednesday . very little is known about this boy , except that he will probably stay grounded throughout the fifa world cup . what we do know is that he chose not be cynical , although on that fateful night he could 've simply kept chewing on pringles and dinking can after can of cherry coke .
he also could have been a little more cautious , wondering whether his internet sweetheart was , in fact , one of those german tabloid anti-heroes , who - in a state of drunken stupor and , despite the freudian banality of it all - attack their retired neighbors with a bockwurst , sometimes with fatal consequences . like a shakespearean hero who overdosed on love potion , the young german rose above cultural stereotypes and societal prejudices .
he broke the chains of internet dependency .
he took no map , no money or food .
he also did n't ask for his parents ' permission , but ventured out into the unknown , following his heart . a thwarted attempt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a happy ending is never guaranteed unfortunately , there always comes a moment in which the prosaics of life takes over the poetic imagination .
in bremen , some two thirds of the way to hamburg , where he was headed , the boy got lost .
well-behaved and well-brought up as he is , he went to the first police station to ask for directions from kind german policemen , fully trained to make the world feel at home during the soccer championship . big mistake !
german police officers - despite their recent training in exchanging polite remarks and reducing the fear factor - are not exactly the most romantic guys around .
cops rarely get pensive while watching the sunset .
they are into chasing criminals and showing off their guns , not sobbing at the end of sleepless in seattle . the police dutifully informed the boy 's parents , who , in their turn , were anything but amused .
they came to pick him up and take him back home to hamm .
there are unconfirmed reports that some huffing and puffing was involved . the unsuspecting girl in hamburg knew nothing about her suitor 's exertions .
he said he had wanted to surprise her . no wonder kids turn out pessimistic and distrustful when they grow up . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de love-struck german judge turns blind eye to justice wearing black robes and being addressed as " your honor " apparently does n't keep people from doing really , really stupid things , as one love-struck german judge recently proved .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.06.2006 washington wants german troops in iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : donald rumsfeld feels the us needs german support in iraq us defense secretary donald rumsfeld is putting germany under increasing pressure to send troops to iraq , say german media reports . according to the daily berliner zeitung , rumsfeld called on his german counterpart franz josef jung to deploy bundeswehr soldiers in training iraqi forces in baghdad .
the request apparently came shortly after the german elections last autumn , with washington hoping that the new government might do a u-turn from the social democratic-green party coalition 's staunch resistance to the military invasion . but chancellor angela merkel has adhered to the same policy upheld by her predecessor , gerhard schröder , who categorically rejected involvement in the us-led military presence in iraq . german newspapers allege that in government circles , sending troops to the country , even in a training capacity , is seen as the thin end of the wedge . " if we gave them an inch , they would take a mile , " the berliner zeitung quoted one source as saying . germany stays firm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr plays a role in the conflict , but the us wants more speaking after a meeting of nato defense ministers in brussels thursday , jung stressed that despite repeated urging from washington , germany would not be sending the bundeswehr to iraq . in 2004 , nato agreed to a training mission which has so far seen 1,000 iraqi officers trained in the iraqi capital and a further 500 in europe , including at the bundeswehr 's military academy in hamburg .
german soldiers are also training iraqis in the united arab emirates . " germany is contributing to stabilizing the iraqi forces , " emphasized jung in brussels , but reiterated that deploying troops inside the country remained out of the question . modern-day challenges at the meeting , nato defense ministers approved new guidelines to adapt the military alliance to modern-day challenges and provide for the deployment of hundreds of thousands of troops , a spokesman said . the move comes as the alliance is increasingly called upon to conduct missions unlike the purely military operations it has run in the past , like moving aid into quake-hit pakistan or providing training .

a woman that is like a german clock . "
this , however , is a story about why a german teenager will grow to be a bitter , old man . at the beginning of shakespeare 's poetic comedy love 's labor lost , king ferdinand of spain declares that his court will be devoted to ascetic study .
he lays out the rules of the game by imposing three conditions on his courtiers : no women allowed within a mile of the court , obligatory fasting once a week , and no more than three hours of sleep per night . what a great way to increase concentration ! the bard of avon , despite his literary genius , did n't know that king ferdinand 's experiment - in addition to being destined to fail - was pretty accurately describing the main symptoms of the 21st century 's malaise de mode , the new ascetism , namely internet dependency . an increasing number of people and , especially , all those new kids on the block , are living in a twisted universe in which physical contact with the human species is reduced to a bare minimum .
they inhabit a world in which nourishment comes as an accidental afterthought in between playing the angel of darkness online and looking for an internet hot date whose online profile matches the looks and curves of laura croft .
and they are often stuck in a time warp in which sleep-deprivation and hours in front of the computer screen lead to hallucinatory experiences that in the not so distant past required serious drug abuse . these kids have no idea what the psychedelic seventies were about . tour d 'amour yet despite what the pale-faced cassandras of this world will tell you about humanity 's impeding doom and cultural downfall , the last glimmer of hope has not been entirely extinguished .
for some people , it is still love , in its pure madness and untainted naiveté , that makes the world go around .
or , at least , makes us go around the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when love is concerned , no vehicle is fast enough - especially a bike one such brave defender of stirred up emotions - a lovesick 16-year-old german boy - hopped on his bicycle in hamm , in the western german state of north-rhine westphalia , and cycled more than 200 kilometers -lrb- 120 miles -rrb- overnight to meet a girl he had met on the internet , german police said on wednesday . very little is known about this boy , except that he will probably stay grounded throughout the fifa world cup . what we do know is that he chose not be cynical , although on that fateful night he could 've simply kept chewing on pringles and dinking can after can of cherry coke .
he also could have been a little more cautious , wondering whether his internet sweetheart was , in fact , one of those german tabloid anti-heroes , who - in a state of drunken stupor and , despite the freudian banality of it all - attack their retired neighbors with a bockwurst , sometimes with fatal consequences . like a shakespearean hero who overdosed on love potion , the young german rose above cultural stereotypes and societal prejudices .
he broke the chains of internet dependency .
he took no map , no money or food .
he also did n't ask for his parents ' permission , but ventured out into the unknown , following his heart . a thwarted attempt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a happy ending is never guaranteed unfortunately , there always comes a moment in which the prosaics of life takes over the poetic imagination .
in bremen , some two thirds of the way to hamburg , where he was headed , the boy got lost .
well-behaved and well-brought up as he is , he went to the first police station to ask for directions from kind german policemen , fully trained to make the world feel at home during the soccer championship . big mistake !
german police officers - despite their recent training in exchanging polite remarks and reducing the fear factor - are not exactly the most romantic guys around .
cops rarely get pensive while watching the sunset .
they are into chasing criminals and showing off their guns , not sobbing at the end of sleepless in seattle . the police dutifully informed the boy 's parents , who , in their turn , were anything but amused .
they came to pick him up and take him back home to hamm .
there are unconfirmed reports that some huffing and puffing was involved . the unsuspecting girl in hamburg knew nothing about her suitor 's exertions .
he said he had wanted to surprise her . no wonder kids turn out pessimistic and distrustful when they grow up . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de love-struck german judge turns blind eye to justice wearing black robes and being addressed as " your honor " apparently does n't keep people from doing really , really stupid things , as one love-struck german judge recently proved .

" germany is contributing to stabilizing the iraqi forces , " emphasized jung in brussels , but reiterated that deploying troops inside the country remained out of the question . modern-day challenges at the meeting , nato defense ministers approved new guidelines to adapt the military alliance to modern-day challenges and provide for the deployment of hundreds of thousands of troops , a spokesman said . the move comes as the alliance is increasingly called upon to conduct missions unlike the purely military operations it has run in the past , like moving aid into quake-hit pakistan or providing training . " nato has gone through very fundamental changes in terms of what it has done and what it is doing , and this will bring the force planning into line with the realities of the 21st century , " said spokesman james appathurai . simultaneous missions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr is increasingly deployed for disaster relief , such as in pakistan in 2005 the so-called " ministerial guidance " will prepare nato to conduct simultaneously two large missions , involving some 60,000 troops , and six smaller ones , comprising up to 30,000 soldiers each . " we no longer need to prepare for one big war .
we have to prepare for , and indeed carry out , a multitude of military operations , " appathurai said . the document will guide the 26 members of the alliance in ways to prepare for nato 's new operations and work with other bodies like the un , the eu and non-governmental organizations . the spokesman said that the allies had also committed " to endeavor " to boost their military spending to two percent of gross domestic product ; a level only achieved currently by seven states . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : troops are n't answer in afghanistan the bundestag extended the german 's army 's mandate in afghanistan in a clear vote on wednesday , but deutsche welle 's nina werkhäuser says more soldiers wo n't solve the country 's problems .

a woman that is like a german clock . "
this , however , is a story about why a german teenager will grow to be a bitter , old man . at the beginning of shakespeare 's poetic comedy love 's labor lost , king ferdinand of spain declares that his court will be devoted to ascetic study .
he lays out the rules of the game by imposing three conditions on his courtiers : no women allowed within a mile of the court , obligatory fasting once a week , and no more than three hours of sleep per night . what a great way to increase concentration ! the bard of avon , despite his literary genius , did n't know that king ferdinand 's experiment - in addition to being destined to fail - was pretty accurately describing the main symptoms of the 21st century 's malaise de mode , the new ascetism , namely internet dependency . an increasing number of people and , especially , all those new kids on the block , are living in a twisted universe in which physical contact with the human species is reduced to a bare minimum .
they inhabit a world in which nourishment comes as an accidental afterthought in between playing the angel of darkness online and looking for an internet hot date whose online profile matches the looks and curves of laura croft .
and they are often stuck in a time warp in which sleep-deprivation and hours in front of the computer screen lead to hallucinatory experiences that in the not so distant past required serious drug abuse . these kids have no idea what the psychedelic seventies were about . tour d 'amour yet despite what the pale-faced cassandras of this world will tell you about humanity 's impeding doom and cultural downfall , the last glimmer of hope has not been entirely extinguished .
for some people , it is still love , in its pure madness and untainted naiveté , that makes the world go around .
or , at least , makes us go around the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when love is concerned , no vehicle is fast enough - especially a bike one such brave defender of stirred up emotions - a lovesick 16-year-old german boy - hopped on his bicycle in hamm , in the western german state of north-rhine westphalia , and cycled more than 200 kilometers -lrb- 120 miles -rrb- overnight to meet a girl he had met on the internet , german police said on wednesday . very little is known about this boy , except that he will probably stay grounded throughout the fifa world cup . what we do know is that he chose not be cynical , although on that fateful night he could 've simply kept chewing on pringles and dinking can after can of cherry coke .
he also could have been a little more cautious , wondering whether his internet sweetheart was , in fact , one of those german tabloid anti-heroes , who - in a state of drunken stupor and , despite the freudian banality of it all - attack their retired neighbors with a bockwurst , sometimes with fatal consequences . like a shakespearean hero who overdosed on love potion , the young german rose above cultural stereotypes and societal prejudices .
he broke the chains of internet dependency .
he took no map , no money or food .
he also did n't ask for his parents ' permission , but ventured out into the unknown , following his heart . a thwarted attempt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a happy ending is never guaranteed unfortunately , there always comes a moment in which the prosaics of life takes over the poetic imagination .
in bremen , some two thirds of the way to hamburg , where he was headed , the boy got lost .
well-behaved and well-brought up as he is , he went to the first police station to ask for directions from kind german policemen , fully trained to make the world feel at home during the soccer championship . big mistake !
german police officers - despite their recent training in exchanging polite remarks and reducing the fear factor - are not exactly the most romantic guys around .
cops rarely get pensive while watching the sunset .
they are into chasing criminals and showing off their guns , not sobbing at the end of sleepless in seattle . the police dutifully informed the boy 's parents , who , in their turn , were anything but amused .
they came to pick him up and take him back home to hamm .
there are unconfirmed reports that some huffing and puffing was involved . the unsuspecting girl in hamburg knew nothing about her suitor 's exertions .
he said he had wanted to surprise her . no wonder kids turn out pessimistic and distrustful when they grow up . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de love-struck german judge turns blind eye to justice wearing black robes and being addressed as " your honor " apparently does n't keep people from doing really , really stupid things , as one love-struck german judge recently proved .

" i am writing to you to spare you and the world from the upcoming sitting of the city council in which they will decide not to give me the prize , " handke said in the letter .
" also to spare myself ... and above all to spare my work , which i do not want to become an endless target for the vulgar insults of party politicians . " he suggested that the council meeting be cancelled and its members sent into nature to breathe fresh air , " for example to have a picnic on the banks of the rhine . " an ongoing controversy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she stood up for her fellow countryman : austrian author and nobel prize winner jelinek handke was named winner of the prize last month , but the düsseldorf city council said last week that it would veto the jury 's decision because of his eulogy for former yugoslav president and alleged war criminal slobodan milosevic . the writer attended milosevic 's funeral in march and lauded him as " a man who defended his people . " the speech also sparked a bitter row in france with the administrator of the paris state theater comedie francaise , marcel bozonnet , canceling the 2007 season of handke 's play " voyage to the sonorous land or the art of asking . " bozonnet 's decision was condemned in art circles in france , where handke lives , and further afield as censorship .
the critics included his german publishers , suhrkamp , and his compatriot , nobel literature laureate elfriede jelinek . handke said he was " disgusted " by the decision and defended himself as merely having sought to counter the dominant , one-sided " polemic " view of the break-up of the former yugoslavia . a sense of deja-vu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : handke 's plays are performed all over the world , but no longer at comedie francaise but when it was announced he should receive the heinrich heine prize , the same debate about whether an artist 's work can be separated from his political views resurged in germany .

others ask whether the hoopla is n't just a bit too much . no matter how you look at the world cup , it 's always close to the official motto of " a time to make friends , " wrote the karlsruhe-based badische neueste nachrichten .
" germany wants to present itself as an open , good-natured , dynamic country , " the paper said .
" if it manages that , the benefits would be immeasurable . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wil the motto " a time to make friends " translate into a real feeling ?
that view is shared by the heilbronner stimme which opined that germany would be a winner - irrespective of how it performed on the pitch - if the official world cup motto translated into a tangible feeling for the fans .
" people expect perfect organization from the germans , but not warmth and joie de vivre .
the world cup offers the chance for an image makeover in a very simple way , " the paper wrote .
" the nicest praise would be the conclusion : germany is different . " the dresden-based sächsische zeitung wrote that the world has noticed that germany is making an effort and is showing off its best side .
" the london times writes that germany is ready for a new image , the dutch are writing friendly things about us and the danes are discovering new success stories about the ' world champs in organization , " ' the paper wrote .
" of course clichés still persist .
but it shows that germany can and will change its image through the mammoth soccer event , despite the recent xenophobic attacks , " the daily said . some newspapers also took a jibe at the commercial hoopla and hype that has consumed the event . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some wonder if germany has n't gone overboard with soccer mania " if all that 's been written and said in the past months is true , then a real multifunctional world cup is heading towards this country , " the münchner merkur wrote .
it added that the biggest soccer event of the world was meant to kick-start the economy , create jobs , lift sagging spirits and present the image of a modern , friendly germany abroad .
" that 's quite a lot for a single tournament and we have n't even begun to talk about soccer as yet , " the paper wrote .
it all adds up to a sated feeling , almost one of reluctance for the ordinary citizen , it said .
" you might say that all this is now a part of modern sport , you ca n't change it .
the opening game should put things in perspective . " " it would be wonderful if modernizer klinsmann is successful and his team cuts a brave figure .
that could revive germans ' belief in their own abilities , " the southern german augsburger allgemeine wrote .
the paper however reminded that the euphoria of germany winning the last world cup , in 1990 - the year that german reunification took place - did n't last long .
" the world cup does n't solve our problems . " berlin-based daily der tagesspiegel commented that there were several people who are completely annoyed by the whole hype surrounding the event and do n't care about it all .
" a game !
is n't there anything more important than that ? " the paper asked rhetorically .
" but there is some comfort for those who ca n't stand the world cup - it 's over in 33 days , " the daily wrote .
" but everyone - even those who hate it - will have something special at the end of the tournament : the memory of a world cup in your own country .

but the prospect of thousands of people flooding into the country with no intention of leaving after the tournament ends is less easy to deal with , although visa restrictions and increased border controls will at least strengthen the host nation 's hand . germany is preparing to suspend the free travel arrangements it has with certain neighbors under the european union 's schengen agreement and reimpose passport checks on the borders with denmark , austria , france , belgium , luxembourg and the netherlands . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will reintroduce border controls with eu neighbors the threat of illegal immigrants entering germany during the world cup is a real one .

the federal government has not loosened its visa requirements for non-eu and non-western countries and as a result , fans of countries like ukraine may face disappointment when trying to enter the country to watch the games unless they can fulfill the visa criteria . german embassies around the world have issued warnings to foreign nationals intending to travel to the world cup that having a ticket for the games will not guarantee them a visa or entry .

the waiting is over .
nearly six years after germany was awarded the 2006 world cup , the globe 's biggest soccer spectacle began in munich friday with the hosts playing costa rica in the first game . since that ecstatic night in zurich on july 6 , 2000 when franz beckenbauer 's glitzy team of soccer legends , celebrities and politicians won the right to stage the tournament , enough column inches have been written on germany 's preparations to stretch from berlin to san jose .
now the real action starts . germany remain confident that their first opponents will not spoil the opening party .
assistant coach joachim löw revealed earlier in the week that the staff and players had studied dvds of the central americans ' warm-up matches and that the belief was that the hosts would get their world cup campaign off to a winning start . " it is the first match and we are a bit nervous but we have done our homework and i think we are in a position to beat costa rica , " löw told reporters .
" if we turn up and show our strengths we will win the match . " germany manager jürgen klinsmann has forced all of his players to watch clips of their opponents and löw claims costa rica were no longer an unknown quantity . " we have collected a lot of information on them by watching dvd clips of league games and international matches , " said löw .
" we know their strengths and weaknesses but of course we will not be discussing them in public . " costa rica n culture , lifestyle as well as tactics studied bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's first game will be no san jose beach at sunset klinsmann seems to have left nothing to chance .
the coach has even had his stars studying costa rica 's culture and lifestyle for clues on how their opponents will play in the opening match .
the german team have been viewing a short film about the friendly central american country , famed for its diverse wildlife and the fact that it has no military forces . " we introduced the players to the country , how the people live there and what their mentality is like , " löw added .
" we 've also seen from games that they 're technically skilful and they love to play beautiful soccer .
that 's a reflection of the national character . " germany captain michael ballack , who will not be playing because of injuries , said everyone had enjoyed the lesson . " it was highly educational , " ballack said .
" we all loved hearing about costa rica and getting an insight into the culture . " while having as much knowledge as possible of their opponents will give the german team a sense of preparation , the real revelations will come on the pitch .
and the hosts will be wary of any surprises . coach kli n sma n n set to start with sta n dard formatio n klinsmann is likely to deploy a standard 4-4-2 formation to counter costa rica coach alexandre guimaraes 's promise that his team are going to abandon their nice guy approach and hit their opponents with a new aggressive form of their renowned free-flowing style . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack scored against colombia but will he start the first game ?
the defensive back four charged with repelling costa rican strikers alvaro saborio and paulo wanchope is expected to be the one which kept colombia at bay in the last test match : arne friedrich , per metesacker , christoph metzelder and philipp lahm , with new number one jens lehmann tending goal behind them . with ballack missing , the midfield will probably feature bernd schneider , torsten frings and bastian schweinsteiger .
the combative tim borowski is most likely to take ballack 's place while sebastian kehl is also on standby . responsible for getting germany 's first goals of the tournament will be striking partnership miroslav klose and lukas podolski . costa rica 's trai n er says his team is n o soft touch costa rica are unlikely to roll over for the hosts just to get the party started on an upbeat note .
coach guimaraes , who was also in charge four years ago in japan / korea , has returned after the unsuccessful tenure of the american steve sampson and has built a new-look team which are tougher and more mature than in the last world cup when they were considered a soft touch . " before , costa rica were a fair play team , naive and just interested in attacking , " he recently told reporters .
" this time , everybody 's going to notice the difference . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paulo wanchope still leads the line for costa rica costa rica 's world cup debut performance in italy in 1990 saw them reach the last 16 , shocking scotland and sweden on the way .
guimaraes is optimistic that his team can at least emulate that despite struggling through the qualifying rounds . their main threat will come from paulo wanchope , their all-time leading scorer with 43 goals including eight in the qualifiers .

but while these players may be well-known , germany will have to be wary of the newcomers alvaro saborio and midfielder carlos hernandez whose inclusion helped turn a near-disastrous qualifying campaign into a ticket to germany with spectacular and important long-range goals . it all adds up to a potentially thrilling game with the whiff of an upset curling around the fifa world cup stadium in munich . germany -lrb- 4-4-2 -rrb- : 1-jens lehmann ; 3-arne friedrich , 21-christoph metzelder , 17-per mertesacker , 16-phillip lahm ; 18-bernd schneider , 8-torsten frings , 13-michael ballack , 7-bastian schweinsteiger ; 20-lukas podolski , 11-miroslav klose costa rica -lrb- 3-5-2 -rrb- : 18-jose francisco porras ; 4-michael umana , 3-luis marin , 12-leonardo gonzalez ; 20-douglas sequeira , 5-gilberto martinez , 8-mauricio solis , 10-walter centeno , 6-danny fonseca ; 11-ronald gomez , 9-paulo wanchope nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de klinsmann : " we 're hungry for the opening game " german national soccer coach jürgen klinsmann said he ca n't wait for the world cup to begin after his team won their last pre-cup game against colombia 3-0 .

the waiting is over .
nearly six years after germany was awarded the 2006 world cup , the globe 's biggest soccer spectacle began in munich friday with the hosts playing costa rica in the first game . since that ecstatic night in zurich on july 6 , 2000 when franz beckenbauer 's glitzy team of soccer legends , celebrities and politicians won the right to stage the tournament , enough column inches have been written on germany 's preparations to stretch from berlin to san jose .
now the real action starts . germany remain confident that their first opponents will not spoil the opening party .
assistant coach joachim löw revealed earlier in the week that the staff and players had studied dvds of the central americans ' warm-up matches and that the belief was that the hosts would get their world cup campaign off to a winning start . " it is the first match and we are a bit nervous but we have done our homework and i think we are in a position to beat costa rica , " löw told reporters .
" if we turn up and show our strengths we will win the match . " germany manager jürgen klinsmann has forced all of his players to watch clips of their opponents and löw claims costa rica were no longer an unknown quantity . " we have collected a lot of information on them by watching dvd clips of league games and international matches , " said löw .
" we know their strengths and weaknesses but of course we will not be discussing them in public . " costa rica n culture , lifestyle as well as tactics studied bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's first game will be no san jose beach at sunset klinsmann seems to have left nothing to chance .
the coach has even had his stars studying costa rica 's culture and lifestyle for clues on how their opponents will play in the opening match .
the german team have been viewing a short film about the friendly central american country , famed for its diverse wildlife and the fact that it has no military forces . " we introduced the players to the country , how the people live there and what their mentality is like , " löw added .
" we 've also seen from games that they 're technically skilful and they love to play beautiful soccer .
that 's a reflection of the national character . " germany captain michael ballack , who will not be playing because of injuries , said everyone had enjoyed the lesson . " it was highly educational , " ballack said .
" we all loved hearing about costa rica and getting an insight into the culture . " while having as much knowledge as possible of their opponents will give the german team a sense of preparation , the real revelations will come on the pitch .
and the hosts will be wary of any surprises . coach kli n sma n n set to start with sta n dard formatio n klinsmann is likely to deploy a standard 4-4-2 formation to counter costa rica coach alexandre guimaraes 's promise that his team are going to abandon their nice guy approach and hit their opponents with a new aggressive form of their renowned free-flowing style . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack scored against colombia but will he start the first game ?
the defensive back four charged with repelling costa rican strikers alvaro saborio and paulo wanchope is expected to be the one which kept colombia at bay in the last test match : arne friedrich , per metesacker , christoph metzelder and philipp lahm , with new number one jens lehmann tending goal behind them . with ballack missing , the midfield will probably feature bernd schneider , torsten frings and bastian schweinsteiger .
the combative tim borowski is most likely to take ballack 's place while sebastian kehl is also on standby . responsible for getting germany 's first goals of the tournament will be striking partnership miroslav klose and lukas podolski . costa rica 's trai n er says his team is n o soft touch costa rica are unlikely to roll over for the hosts just to get the party started on an upbeat note .
coach guimaraes , who was also in charge four years ago in japan / korea , has returned after the unsuccessful tenure of the american steve sampson and has built a new-look team which are tougher and more mature than in the last world cup when they were considered a soft touch . " before , costa rica were a fair play team , naive and just interested in attacking , " he recently told reporters .
" this time , everybody 's going to notice the difference . "

guimaraes is optimistic that his team can at least emulate that despite struggling through the qualifying rounds . their main threat will come from paulo wanchope , their all-time leading scorer with 43 goals including eight in the qualifiers .

the waiting is over .
nearly six years after germany was awarded the 2006 world cup , the globe 's biggest soccer spectacle began in munich friday with the hosts playing costa rica in the first game . since that ecstatic night in zurich on july 6 , 2000 when franz beckenbauer 's glitzy team of soccer legends , celebrities and politicians won the right to stage the tournament , enough column inches have been written on germany 's preparations to stretch from berlin to san jose .
now the real action starts . germany remain confident that their first opponents will not spoil the opening party .
assistant coach joachim löw revealed earlier in the week that the staff and players had studied dvds of the central americans ' warm-up matches and that the belief was that the hosts would get their world cup campaign off to a winning start . " it is the first match and we are a bit nervous but we have done our homework and i think we are in a position to beat costa rica , " löw told reporters .
" if we turn up and show our strengths we will win the match . " germany manager jürgen klinsmann has forced all of his players to watch clips of their opponents and löw claims costa rica were no longer an unknown quantity . " we have collected a lot of information on them by watching dvd clips of league games and international matches , " said löw .
" we know their strengths and weaknesses but of course we will not be discussing them in public .

the waiting is over .
nearly six years after germany was awarded the 2006 world cup , the globe 's biggest soccer spectacle began in munich friday with the hosts playing costa rica in the first game . since that ecstatic night in zurich on july 6 , 2000 when franz beckenbauer 's glitzy team of soccer legends , celebrities and politicians won the right to stage the tournament , enough column inches have been written on germany 's preparations to stretch from berlin to san jose .
now the real action starts . germany remain confident that their first opponents will not spoil the opening party .
assistant coach joachim löw revealed earlier in the week that the staff and players had studied dvds of the central americans ' warm-up matches and that the belief was that the hosts would get their world cup campaign off to a winning start . " it is the first match and we are a bit nervous but we have done our homework and i think we are in a position to beat costa rica , " löw told reporters .
" if we turn up and show our strengths we will win the match . " germany manager jürgen klinsmann has forced all of his players to watch clips of their opponents and löw claims costa rica were no longer an unknown quantity . " we have collected a lot of information on them by watching dvd clips of league games and international matches , " said löw .
" we know their strengths and weaknesses but of course we will not be discussing them in public . " costa rica n culture , lifestyle as well as tactics studied bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's first game will be no san jose beach at sunset klinsmann seems to have left nothing to chance .
the coach has even had his stars studying costa rica 's culture and lifestyle for clues on how their opponents will play in the opening match .
the german team have been viewing a short film about the friendly central american country , famed for its diverse wildlife and the fact that it has no military forces . " we introduced the players to the country , how the people live there and what their mentality is like , " löw added .
" we 've also seen from games that they 're technically skilful and they love to play beautiful soccer .
that 's a reflection of the national character . " germany captain michael ballack , who will not be playing because of injuries , said everyone had enjoyed the lesson . " it was highly educational , " ballack said .
" we all loved hearing about costa rica and getting an insight into the culture . " while having as much knowledge as possible of their opponents will give the german team a sense of preparation , the real revelations will come on the pitch .
and the hosts will be wary of any surprises . coach kli n sma n n set to start with sta n dard formatio n klinsmann is likely to deploy a standard 4-4-2 formation to counter costa rica coach alexandre guimaraes 's promise that his team are going to abandon their nice guy approach and hit their opponents with a new aggressive form of their renowned free-flowing style . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack scored against colombia but will he start the first game ?
the defensive back four charged with repelling costa rican strikers alvaro saborio and paulo wanchope is expected to be the one which kept colombia at bay in the last test match : arne friedrich , per metesacker , christoph metzelder and philipp lahm , with new number one jens lehmann tending goal behind them . with ballack missing , the midfield will probably feature bernd schneider , torsten frings and bastian schweinsteiger .
the combative tim borowski is most likely to take ballack 's place while sebastian kehl is also on standby . responsible for getting germany 's first goals of the tournament will be striking partnership miroslav klose and lukas podolski . costa rica 's trai n er says his team is n o soft touch costa rica are unlikely to roll over for the hosts just to get the party started on an upbeat note .
coach guimaraes , who was also in charge four years ago in japan / korea , has returned after the unsuccessful tenure of the american steve sampson and has built a new-look team which are tougher and more mature than in the last world cup when they were considered a soft touch . " before , costa rica were a fair play team , naive and just interested in attacking , " he recently told reporters .
" this time , everybody 's going to notice the difference . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paulo wanchope still leads the line for costa rica costa rica 's world cup debut performance in italy in 1990 saw them reach the last 16 , shocking scotland and sweden on the way .
guimaraes is optimistic that his team can at least emulate that despite struggling through the qualifying rounds . their main threat will come from paulo wanchope , their all-time leading scorer with 43 goals including eight in the qualifiers .
despite losing some of his pace , the striker has a wealth of international experience garnered from a career spent in the english and spanish leagues . world cup experie n ce from back to fro n t the team 's spine consists of the other remaining members of the class of 2002 ; including defenders harold wallace , luis marin and gilberto martinez , midfield playmaker walter centeno and forward ronald gomez .
but while these players may be well-known , germany will have to be wary of the newcomers alvaro saborio and midfielder carlos hernandez whose inclusion helped turn a near-disastrous qualifying campaign into a ticket to germany with spectacular and important long-range goals . it all adds up to a potentially thrilling game with the whiff of an upset curling around the fifa world cup stadium in munich . germany -lrb- 4-4-2 -rrb- : 1-jens lehmann ; 3-arne friedrich , 21-christoph metzelder , 17-per mertesacker , 16-phillip lahm ; 18-bernd schneider , 8-torsten frings , 13-michael ballack , 7-bastian schweinsteiger ; 20-lukas podolski , 11-miroslav klose costa rica -lrb- 3-5-2 -rrb- : 18-jose francisco porras ; 4-michael umana , 3-luis marin , 12-leonardo gonzalez ; 20-douglas sequeira , 5-gilberto martinez , 8-mauricio solis , 10-walter centeno , 6-danny fonseca ; 11-ronald gomez , 9-paulo wanchope nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de klinsmann : " we 're hungry for the opening game " german national soccer coach jürgen klinsmann said he ca n't wait for the world cup to begin after his team won their last pre-cup game against colombia 3-0 .

others ask whether the hoopla is n't just a bit too much . no matter how you look at the world cup , it 's always close to the official motto of " a time to make friends , " wrote the karlsruhe-based badische neueste nachrichten .
" germany wants to present itself as an open , good-natured , dynamic country , " the paper said .
" if it manages that , the benefits would be immeasurable . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wil the motto " a time to make friends " translate into a real feeling ?
that view is shared by the heilbronner stimme which opined that germany would be a winner - irrespective of how it performed on the pitch - if the official world cup motto translated into a tangible feeling for the fans .
" people expect perfect organization from the germans , but not warmth and joie de vivre .
the world cup offers the chance for an image makeover in a very simple way , " the paper wrote .
" the nicest praise would be the conclusion : germany is different . " the dresden-based sächsische zeitung wrote that the world has noticed that germany is making an effort and is showing off its best side .
" the london times writes that germany is ready for a new image , the dutch are writing friendly things about us and the danes are discovering new success stories about the ' world champs in organization , " ' the paper wrote .
" of course clichés still persist .
but it shows that germany can and will change its image through the mammoth soccer event , despite the recent xenophobic attacks , " the daily said . some newspapers also took a jibe at the commercial hoopla and hype that has consumed the event . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some wonder if germany has n't gone overboard with soccer mania " if all that 's been written and said in the past months is true , then a real multifunctional world cup is heading towards this country , " the münchner merkur wrote .
it added that the biggest soccer event of the world was meant to kick-start the economy , create jobs , lift sagging spirits and present the image of a modern , friendly germany abroad .
" that 's quite a lot for a single tournament and we have n't even begun to talk about soccer as yet , " the paper wrote .
it all adds up to a sated feeling , almost one of reluctance for the ordinary citizen , it said .
" you might say that all this is now a part of modern sport , you ca n't change it .
the opening game should put things in perspective . " " it would be wonderful if modernizer klinsmann is successful and his team cuts a brave figure .
that could revive germans ' belief in their own abilities , " the southern german augsburger allgemeine wrote .
the paper however reminded that the euphoria of germany winning the last world cup , in 1990 - the year that german reunification took place - did n't last long .
" the world cup does n't solve our problems . " berlin-based daily der tagesspiegel commented that there were several people who are completely annoyed by the whole hype surrounding the event and do n't care about it all .
" a game !
is n't there anything more important than that ? " the paper asked rhetorically .
" but there is some comfort for those who ca n't stand the world cup - it 's over in 33 days , " the daily wrote .
" but everyone - even those who hate it - will have something special at the end of the tournament : the memory of a world cup in your own country .

-lrb- june 9 , 2006 -rrb- some soccer fans want to reclaim the game the world cup , which starts friday , will be the culmination of two years of hype that has left no marketing stone unturned .

the request apparently came shortly after the german elections last autumn , with washington hoping that the new government might do a u-turn from the social democratic-green party coalition 's staunch resistance to the military invasion . but chancellor angela merkel has adhered to the same policy upheld by her predecessor , gerhard schröder , who categorically rejected involvement in the us-led military presence in iraq . german newspapers allege that in government circles , sending troops to the country , even in a training capacity , is seen as the thin end of the wedge . " if we gave them an inch , they would take a mile , " the berliner zeitung quoted one source as saying . germany stays firm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr plays a role in the conflict , but the us wants more speaking after a meeting of nato defense ministers in brussels thursday , jung stressed that despite repeated urging from washington , germany would not be sending the bundeswehr to iraq . in 2004 , nato agreed to a training mission which has so far seen 1,000 iraqi officers trained in the iraqi capital and a further 500 in europe , including at the bundeswehr 's military academy in hamburg .
german soldiers are also training iraqis in the united arab emirates . " germany is contributing to stabilizing the iraqi forces , " emphasized jung in brussels , but reiterated that deploying troops inside the country remained out of the question . modern-day challenges at the meeting , nato defense ministers approved new guidelines to adapt the military alliance to modern-day challenges and provide for the deployment of hundreds of thousands of troops , a spokesman said . the move comes as the alliance is increasingly called upon to conduct missions unlike the purely military operations it has run in the past , like moving aid into quake-hit pakistan or providing training . " nato has gone through very fundamental changes in terms of what it has done and what it is doing , and this will bring the force planning into line with the realities of the 21st century , " said spokesman james appathurai . simultaneous missions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr is increasingly deployed for disaster relief , such as in pakistan in 2005 the so-called " ministerial guidance " will prepare nato to conduct simultaneously two large missions , involving some 60,000 troops , and six smaller ones , comprising up to 30,000 soldiers each . " we no longer need to prepare for one big war .
we have to prepare for , and indeed carry out , a multitude of military operations , " appathurai said . the document will guide the 26 members of the alliance in ways to prepare for nato 's new operations and work with other bodies like the un , the eu and non-governmental organizations . the spokesman said that the allies had also committed " to endeavor " to boost their military spending to two percent of gross domestic product ; a level only achieved currently by seven states . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : troops are n't answer in afghanistan the bundestag extended the german 's army 's mandate in afghanistan in a clear vote on wednesday , but deutsche welle 's nina werkhäuser says more soldiers wo n't solve the country 's problems .

the request apparently came shortly after the german elections last autumn , with washington hoping that the new government might do a u-turn from the social democratic-green party coalition 's staunch resistance to the military invasion . but chancellor angela merkel has adhered to the same policy upheld by her predecessor , gerhard schröder , who categorically rejected involvement in the us-led military presence in iraq . german newspapers allege that in government circles , sending troops to the country , even in a training capacity , is seen as the thin end of the wedge . " if we gave them an inch , they would take a mile , " the berliner zeitung quoted one source as saying . germany stays firm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr plays a role in the conflict , but the us wants more speaking after a meeting of nato defense ministers in brussels thursday , jung stressed that despite repeated urging from washington , germany would not be sending the bundeswehr to iraq . in 2004 , nato agreed to a training mission which has so far seen 1,000 iraqi officers trained in the iraqi capital and a further 500 in europe , including at the bundeswehr 's military academy in hamburg .
german soldiers are also training iraqis in the united arab emirates . " germany is contributing to stabilizing the iraqi forces , " emphasized jung in brussels , but reiterated that deploying troops inside the country remained out of the question . modern-day challenges at the meeting , nato defense ministers approved new guidelines to adapt the military alliance to modern-day challenges and provide for the deployment of hundreds of thousands of troops , a spokesman said . the move comes as the alliance is increasingly called upon to conduct missions unlike the purely military operations it has run in the past , like moving aid into quake-hit pakistan or providing training . " nato has gone through very fundamental changes in terms of what it has done and what it is doing , and this will bring the force planning into line with the realities of the 21st century , " said spokesman james appathurai . simultaneous missions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr is increasingly deployed for disaster relief , such as in pakistan in 2005 the so-called " ministerial guidance " will prepare nato to conduct simultaneously two large missions , involving some 60,000 troops , and six smaller ones , comprising up to 30,000 soldiers each . " we no longer need to prepare for one big war .
we have to prepare for , and indeed carry out , a multitude of military operations , " appathurai said . the document will guide the 26 members of the alliance in ways to prepare for nato 's new operations and work with other bodies like the un , the eu and non-governmental organizations . the spokesman said that the allies had also committed " to endeavor " to boost their military spending to two percent of gross domestic product ; a level only achieved currently by seven states . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : troops are n't answer in afghanistan the bundestag extended the german 's army 's mandate in afghanistan in a clear vote on wednesday , but deutsche welle 's nina werkhäuser says more soldiers wo n't solve the country 's problems .

" i am writing to you to spare you and the world from the upcoming sitting of the city council in which they will decide not to give me the prize , " handke said in the letter .
" also to spare myself ... and above all to spare my work , which i do not want to become an endless target for the vulgar insults of party politicians . " he suggested that the council meeting be cancelled and its members sent into nature to breathe fresh air , " for example to have a picnic on the banks of the rhine . " an ongoing controversy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she stood up for her fellow countryman : austrian author and nobel prize winner jelinek handke was named winner of the prize last month , but the düsseldorf city council said last week that it would veto the jury 's decision because of his eulogy for former yugoslav president and alleged war criminal slobodan milosevic . the writer attended milosevic 's funeral in march and lauded him as " a man who defended his people . " the speech also sparked a bitter row in france with the administrator of the paris state theater comedie francaise , marcel bozonnet , canceling the 2007 season of handke 's play " voyage to the sonorous land or the art of asking . " bozonnet 's decision was condemned in art circles in france , where handke lives , and further afield as censorship .
the critics included his german publishers , suhrkamp , and his compatriot , nobel literature laureate elfriede jelinek . handke said he was " disgusted " by the decision and defended himself as merely having sought to counter the dominant , one-sided " polemic " view of the break-up of the former yugoslavia . a sense of deja-vu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : handke 's plays are performed all over the world , but no longer at comedie francaise but when it was announced he should receive the heinrich heine prize , the same debate about whether an artist 's work can be separated from his political views resurged in germany .
local politicians said honoring handke was a slap in the face of those who suffered under milosevic and vowed to deny him the prize , which was due to be awarded on dec .
13 . the winner is chosen by an independent panel , but must be confirmed by düsseldorf authorities who donate the prize money of 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 63,300 -rrb- . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans divided over prize for pro-serb author handke the decision to award the city of düsseldorf 's prestigious heine prize to controversial austrian author peter handke - known for his pro-serbian stance during the balkan wars - has been met with criticism in germany .
-lrb- may 29 , 2006 -rrb- opinion : a truly idiotic decision by declaring themselves ready to revoke the decision of an independent literary jury , german politicians are embarrassing themselves and damaging the fundaments of democratic culture , says dw-world.de 's toma tasovac .

the waiting is over .
nearly six years after germany was awarded the 2006 world cup , the globe 's biggest soccer spectacle began in munich friday with the hosts playing costa rica in the first game . since that ecstatic night in zurich on july 6 , 2000 when franz beckenbauer 's glitzy team of soccer legends , celebrities and politicians won the right to stage the tournament , enough column inches have been written on germany 's preparations to stretch from berlin to san jose .
now the real action starts . germany remain confident that their first opponents will not spoil the opening party .
assistant coach joachim löw revealed earlier in the week that the staff and players had studied dvds of the central americans ' warm-up matches and that the belief was that the hosts would get their world cup campaign off to a winning start . " it is the first match and we are a bit nervous but we have done our homework and i think we are in a position to beat costa rica , " löw told reporters .
" if we turn up and show our strengths we will win the match . " germany manager jürgen klinsmann has forced all of his players to watch clips of their opponents and löw claims costa rica were no longer an unknown quantity . " we have collected a lot of information on them by watching dvd clips of league games and international matches , " said löw .
" we know their strengths and weaknesses but of course we will not be discussing them in public . " costa rica n culture , lifestyle as well as tactics studied bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's first game will be no san jose beach at sunset klinsmann seems to have left nothing to chance .
the coach has even had his stars studying costa rica 's culture and lifestyle for clues on how their opponents will play in the opening match .
the german team have been viewing a short film about the friendly central american country , famed for its diverse wildlife and the fact that it has no military forces . " we introduced the players to the country , how the people live there and what their mentality is like , " löw added .
" we 've also seen from games that they 're technically skilful and they love to play beautiful soccer .
that 's a reflection of the national character . " germany captain michael ballack , who will not be playing because of injuries , said everyone had enjoyed the lesson . " it was highly educational , " ballack said .
" we all loved hearing about costa rica and getting an insight into the culture . " while having as much knowledge as possible of their opponents will give the german team a sense of preparation , the real revelations will come on the pitch .
and the hosts will be wary of any surprises . coach kli n sma n n set to start with sta n dard formatio n klinsmann is likely to deploy a standard 4-4-2 formation to counter costa rica coach alexandre guimaraes 's promise that his team are going to abandon their nice guy approach and hit their opponents with a new aggressive form of their renowned free-flowing style . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack scored against colombia but will he start the first game ?
the defensive back four charged with repelling costa rican strikers alvaro saborio and paulo wanchope is expected to be the one which kept colombia at bay in the last test match : arne friedrich , per metesacker , christoph metzelder and philipp lahm , with new number one jens lehmann tending goal behind them . with ballack missing , the midfield will probably feature bernd schneider , torsten frings and bastian schweinsteiger .
the combative tim borowski is most likely to take ballack 's place while sebastian kehl is also on standby . responsible for getting germany 's first goals of the tournament will be striking partnership miroslav klose and lukas podolski . costa rica 's trai n er says his team is n o soft touch costa rica are unlikely to roll over for the hosts just to get the party started on an upbeat note .
coach guimaraes , who was also in charge four years ago in japan / korea , has returned after the unsuccessful tenure of the american steve sampson and has built a new-look team which are tougher and more mature than in the last world cup when they were considered a soft touch . " before , costa rica were a fair play team , naive and just interested in attacking , " he recently told reporters .
" this time , everybody 's going to notice the difference . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paulo wanchope still leads the line for costa rica costa rica 's world cup debut performance in italy in 1990 saw them reach the last 16 , shocking scotland and sweden on the way .
guimaraes is optimistic that his team can at least emulate that despite struggling through the qualifying rounds . their main threat will come from paulo wanchope , their all-time leading scorer with 43 goals including eight in the qualifiers .
despite losing some of his pace , the striker has a wealth of international experience garnered from a career spent in the english and spanish leagues . world cup experie n ce from back to fro n t the team 's spine consists of the other remaining members of the class of 2002 ; including defenders harold wallace , luis marin and gilberto martinez , midfield playmaker walter centeno and forward ronald gomez .
but while these players may be well-known , germany will have to be wary of the newcomers alvaro saborio and midfielder carlos hernandez whose inclusion helped turn a near-disastrous qualifying campaign into a ticket to germany with spectacular and important long-range goals . it all adds up to a potentially thrilling game with the whiff of an upset curling around the fifa world cup stadium in munich . germany -lrb- 4-4-2 -rrb- : 1-jens lehmann ; 3-arne friedrich , 21-christoph metzelder , 17-per mertesacker , 16-phillip lahm ; 18-bernd schneider , 8-torsten frings , 13-michael ballack , 7-bastian schweinsteiger ; 20-lukas podolski , 11-miroslav klose costa rica -lrb- 3-5-2 -rrb- : 18-jose francisco porras ; 4-michael umana , 3-luis marin , 12-leonardo gonzalez ; 20-douglas sequeira , 5-gilberto martinez , 8-mauricio solis , 10-walter centeno , 6-danny fonseca ; 11-ronald gomez , 9-paulo wanchope nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de klinsmann : " we 're hungry for the opening game " german national soccer coach jürgen klinsmann said he ca n't wait for the world cup to begin after his team won their last pre-cup game against colombia 3-0 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.06.2006 washington wants german troops in iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : donald rumsfeld feels the us needs german support in iraq us defense secretary donald rumsfeld is putting germany under increasing pressure to send troops to iraq , say german media reports . according to the daily berliner zeitung , rumsfeld called on his german counterpart franz josef jung to deploy bundeswehr soldiers in training iraqi forces in baghdad .
the request apparently came shortly after the german elections last autumn , with washington hoping that the new government might do a u-turn from the social democratic-green party coalition 's staunch resistance to the military invasion . but chancellor angela merkel has adhered to the same policy upheld by her predecessor , gerhard schröder , who categorically rejected involvement in the us-led military presence in iraq . german newspapers allege that in government circles , sending troops to the country , even in a training capacity , is seen as the thin end of the wedge . " if we gave them an inch , they would take a mile , " the berliner zeitung quoted one source as saying . germany stays firm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr plays a role in the conflict , but the us wants more speaking after a meeting of nato defense ministers in brussels thursday , jung stressed that despite repeated urging from washington , germany would not be sending the bundeswehr to iraq . in 2004 , nato agreed to a training mission which has so far seen 1,000 iraqi officers trained in the iraqi capital and a further 500 in europe , including at the bundeswehr 's military academy in hamburg .
german soldiers are also training iraqis in the united arab emirates . " germany is contributing to stabilizing the iraqi forces , " emphasized jung in brussels , but reiterated that deploying troops inside the country remained out of the question . modern-day challenges at the meeting , nato defense ministers approved new guidelines to adapt the military alliance to modern-day challenges and provide for the deployment of hundreds of thousands of troops , a spokesman said . the move comes as the alliance is increasingly called upon to conduct missions unlike the purely military operations it has run in the past , like moving aid into quake-hit pakistan or providing training . " nato has gone through very fundamental changes in terms of what it has done and what it is doing , and this will bring the force planning into line with the realities of the 21st century , " said spokesman james appathurai . simultaneous missions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr is increasingly deployed for disaster relief , such as in pakistan in 2005 the so-called " ministerial guidance " will prepare nato to conduct simultaneously two large missions , involving some 60,000 troops , and six smaller ones , comprising up to 30,000 soldiers each . " we no longer need to prepare for one big war .
we have to prepare for , and indeed carry out , a multitude of military operations , " appathurai said . the document will guide the 26 members of the alliance in ways to prepare for nato 's new operations and work with other bodies like the un , the eu and non-governmental organizations . the spokesman said that the allies had also committed " to endeavor " to boost their military spending to two percent of gross domestic product ; a level only achieved currently by seven states . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : troops are n't answer in afghanistan the bundestag extended the german 's army 's mandate in afghanistan in a clear vote on wednesday , but deutsche welle 's nina werkhäuser says more soldiers wo n't solve the country 's problems .

the waiting is over .
nearly six years after germany was awarded the 2006 world cup , the globe 's biggest soccer spectacle began in munich friday with the hosts playing costa rica in the first game . since that ecstatic night in zurich on july 6 , 2000 when franz beckenbauer 's glitzy team of soccer legends , celebrities and politicians won the right to stage the tournament , enough column inches have been written on germany 's preparations to stretch from berlin to san jose .
now the real action starts . germany remain confident that their first opponents will not spoil the opening party .
assistant coach joachim löw revealed earlier in the week that the staff and players had studied dvds of the central americans ' warm-up matches and that the belief was that the hosts would get their world cup campaign off to a winning start . " it is the first match and we are a bit nervous but we have done our homework and i think we are in a position to beat costa rica , " löw told reporters .
" if we turn up and show our strengths we will win the match . " germany manager jürgen klinsmann has forced all of his players to watch clips of their opponents and löw claims costa rica were no longer an unknown quantity . " we have collected a lot of information on them by watching dvd clips of league games and international matches , " said löw .
" we know their strengths and weaknesses but of course we will not be discussing them in public . " costa rica n culture , lifestyle as well as tactics studied bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's first game will be no san jose beach at sunset klinsmann seems to have left nothing to chance .
the coach has even had his stars studying costa rica 's culture and lifestyle for clues on how their opponents will play in the opening match .
the german team have been viewing a short film about the friendly central american country , famed for its diverse wildlife and the fact that it has no military forces . " we introduced the players to the country , how the people live there and what their mentality is like , " löw added .
" we 've also seen from games that they 're technically skilful and they love to play beautiful soccer .
that 's a reflection of the national character . " germany captain michael ballack , who will not be playing because of injuries , said everyone had enjoyed the lesson . " it was highly educational , " ballack said .
" we all loved hearing about costa rica and getting an insight into the culture . " while having as much knowledge as possible of their opponents will give the german team a sense of preparation , the real revelations will come on the pitch .
and the hosts will be wary of any surprises . coach kli n sma n n set to start with sta n dard formatio n klinsmann is likely to deploy a standard 4-4-2 formation to counter costa rica coach alexandre guimaraes 's promise that his team are going to abandon their nice guy approach and hit their opponents with a new aggressive form of their renowned free-flowing style . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack scored against colombia but will he start the first game ?
the defensive back four charged with repelling costa rican strikers alvaro saborio and paulo wanchope is expected to be the one which kept colombia at bay in the last test match : arne friedrich , per metesacker , christoph metzelder and philipp lahm , with new number one jens lehmann tending goal behind them . with ballack missing , the midfield will probably feature bernd schneider , torsten frings and bastian schweinsteiger .
the combative tim borowski is most likely to take ballack 's place while sebastian kehl is also on standby . responsible for getting germany 's first goals of the tournament will be striking partnership miroslav klose and lukas podolski . costa rica 's trai n er says his team is n o soft touch costa rica are unlikely to roll over for the hosts just to get the party started on an upbeat note .
coach guimaraes , who was also in charge four years ago in japan / korea , has returned after the unsuccessful tenure of the american steve sampson and has built a new-look team which are tougher and more mature than in the last world cup when they were considered a soft touch . " before , costa rica were a fair play team , naive and just interested in attacking , " he recently told reporters .
" this time , everybody 's going to notice the difference . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paulo wanchope still leads the line for costa rica costa rica 's world cup debut performance in italy in 1990 saw them reach the last 16 , shocking scotland and sweden on the way .
guimaraes is optimistic that his team can at least emulate that despite struggling through the qualifying rounds . their main threat will come from paulo wanchope , their all-time leading scorer with 43 goals including eight in the qualifiers .
despite losing some of his pace , the striker has a wealth of international experience garnered from a career spent in the english and spanish leagues . world cup experie n ce from back to fro n t the team 's spine consists of the other remaining members of the class of 2002 ; including defenders harold wallace , luis marin and gilberto martinez , midfield playmaker walter centeno and forward ronald gomez .
but while these players may be well-known , germany will have to be wary of the newcomers alvaro saborio and midfielder carlos hernandez whose inclusion helped turn a near-disastrous qualifying campaign into a ticket to germany with spectacular and important long-range goals . it all adds up to a potentially thrilling game with the whiff of an upset curling around the fifa world cup stadium in munich . germany -lrb- 4-4-2 -rrb- : 1-jens lehmann ; 3-arne friedrich , 21-christoph metzelder , 17-per mertesacker , 16-phillip lahm ; 18-bernd schneider , 8-torsten frings , 13-michael ballack , 7-bastian schweinsteiger ; 20-lukas podolski , 11-miroslav klose costa rica -lrb- 3-5-2 -rrb- : 18-jose francisco porras ; 4-michael umana , 3-luis marin , 12-leonardo gonzalez ; 20-douglas sequeira , 5-gilberto martinez , 8-mauricio solis , 10-walter centeno , 6-danny fonseca ; 11-ronald gomez , 9-paulo wanchope nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de klinsmann : " we 're hungry for the opening game " german national soccer coach jürgen klinsmann said he ca n't wait for the world cup to begin after his team won their last pre-cup game against colombia 3-0 .

the request apparently came shortly after the german elections last autumn , with washington hoping that the new government might do a u-turn from the social democratic-green party coalition 's staunch resistance to the military invasion . but chancellor angela merkel has adhered to the same policy upheld by her predecessor , gerhard schröder , who categorically rejected involvement in the us-led military presence in iraq . german newspapers allege that in government circles , sending troops to the country , even in a training capacity , is seen as the thin end of the wedge .

" germany is contributing to stabilizing the iraqi forces , " emphasized jung in brussels , but reiterated that deploying troops inside the country remained out of the question . modern-day challenges at the meeting , nato defense ministers approved new guidelines to adapt the military alliance to modern-day challenges and provide for the deployment of hundreds of thousands of troops , a spokesman said . the move comes as the alliance is increasingly called upon to conduct missions unlike the purely military operations it has run in the past , like moving aid into quake-hit pakistan or providing training .

the waiting is over .
nearly six years after germany was awarded the 2006 world cup , the globe 's biggest soccer spectacle began in munich friday with the hosts playing costa rica in the first game . since that ecstatic night in zurich on july 6 , 2000 when franz beckenbauer 's glitzy team of soccer legends , celebrities and politicians won the right to stage the tournament , enough column inches have been written on germany 's preparations to stretch from berlin to san jose .
now the real action starts . germany remain confident that their first opponents will not spoil the opening party .
assistant coach joachim löw revealed earlier in the week that the staff and players had studied dvds of the central americans ' warm-up matches and that the belief was that the hosts would get their world cup campaign off to a winning start . " it is the first match and we are a bit nervous but we have done our homework and i think we are in a position to beat costa rica , " löw told reporters .
" if we turn up and show our strengths we will win the match . " germany manager jürgen klinsmann has forced all of his players to watch clips of their opponents and löw claims costa rica were no longer an unknown quantity . " we have collected a lot of information on them by watching dvd clips of league games and international matches , " said löw .
" we know their strengths and weaknesses but of course we will not be discussing them in public . " costa rica n culture , lifestyle as well as tactics studied bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's first game will be no san jose beach at sunset klinsmann seems to have left nothing to chance .
the coach has even had his stars studying costa rica 's culture and lifestyle for clues on how their opponents will play in the opening match .
the german team have been viewing a short film about the friendly central american country , famed for its diverse wildlife and the fact that it has no military forces . " we introduced the players to the country , how the people live there and what their mentality is like , " löw added .
" we 've also seen from games that they 're technically skilful and they love to play beautiful soccer .
that 's a reflection of the national character . " germany captain michael ballack , who will not be playing because of injuries , said everyone had enjoyed the lesson . " it was highly educational , " ballack said .
" we all loved hearing about costa rica and getting an insight into the culture . " while having as much knowledge as possible of their opponents will give the german team a sense of preparation , the real revelations will come on the pitch .
and the hosts will be wary of any surprises . coach kli n sma n n set to start with sta n dard formatio n klinsmann is likely to deploy a standard 4-4-2 formation to counter costa rica coach alexandre guimaraes 's promise that his team are going to abandon their nice guy approach and hit their opponents with a new aggressive form of their renowned free-flowing style . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack scored against colombia but will he start the first game ?
the defensive back four charged with repelling costa rican strikers alvaro saborio and paulo wanchope is expected to be the one which kept colombia at bay in the last test match : arne friedrich , per metesacker , christoph metzelder and philipp lahm , with new number one jens lehmann tending goal behind them . with ballack missing , the midfield will probably feature bernd schneider , torsten frings and bastian schweinsteiger .
the combative tim borowski is most likely to take ballack 's place while sebastian kehl is also on standby . responsible for getting germany 's first goals of the tournament will be striking partnership miroslav klose and lukas podolski . costa rica 's trai n er says his team is n o soft touch costa rica are unlikely to roll over for the hosts just to get the party started on an upbeat note .
coach guimaraes , who was also in charge four years ago in japan / korea , has returned after the unsuccessful tenure of the american steve sampson and has built a new-look team which are tougher and more mature than in the last world cup when they were considered a soft touch . " before , costa rica were a fair play team , naive and just interested in attacking , " he recently told reporters .
" this time , everybody 's going to notice the difference . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paulo wanchope still leads the line for costa rica costa rica 's world cup debut performance in italy in 1990 saw them reach the last 16 , shocking scotland and sweden on the way .
guimaraes is optimistic that his team can at least emulate that despite struggling through the qualifying rounds . their main threat will come from paulo wanchope , their all-time leading scorer with 43 goals including eight in the qualifiers .
despite losing some of his pace , the striker has a wealth of international experience garnered from a career spent in the english and spanish leagues . world cup experie n ce from back to fro n t the team 's spine consists of the other remaining members of the class of 2002 ; including defenders harold wallace , luis marin and gilberto martinez , midfield playmaker walter centeno and forward ronald gomez .
but while these players may be well-known , germany will have to be wary of the newcomers alvaro saborio and midfielder carlos hernandez whose inclusion helped turn a near-disastrous qualifying campaign into a ticket to germany with spectacular and important long-range goals . it all adds up to a potentially thrilling game with the whiff of an upset curling around the fifa world cup stadium in munich . germany -lrb- 4-4-2 -rrb- : 1-jens lehmann ; 3-arne friedrich , 21-christoph metzelder , 17-per mertesacker , 16-phillip lahm ; 18-bernd schneider , 8-torsten frings , 13-michael ballack , 7-bastian schweinsteiger ; 20-lukas podolski , 11-miroslav klose costa rica -lrb- 3-5-2 -rrb- : 18-jose francisco porras ; 4-michael umana , 3-luis marin , 12-leonardo gonzalez ; 20-douglas sequeira , 5-gilberto martinez , 8-mauricio solis , 10-walter centeno , 6-danny fonseca ; 11-ronald gomez , 9-paulo wanchope nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de klinsmann : " we 're hungry for the opening game " german national soccer coach jürgen klinsmann said he ca n't wait for the world cup to begin after his team won their last pre-cup game against colombia 3-0 .

the waiting is over .
nearly six years after germany was awarded the 2006 world cup , the globe 's biggest soccer spectacle began in munich friday with the hosts playing costa rica in the first game . since that ecstatic night in zurich on july 6 , 2000 when franz beckenbauer 's glitzy team of soccer legends , celebrities and politicians won the right to stage the tournament , enough column inches have been written on germany 's preparations to stretch from berlin to san jose .
now the real action starts . germany remain confident that their first opponents will not spoil the opening party .
assistant coach joachim löw revealed earlier in the week that the staff and players had studied dvds of the central americans ' warm-up matches and that the belief was that the hosts would get their world cup campaign off to a winning start . " it is the first match and we are a bit nervous but we have done our homework and i think we are in a position to beat costa rica , " löw told reporters .
" if we turn up and show our strengths we will win the match . " germany manager jürgen klinsmann has forced all of his players to watch clips of their opponents and löw claims costa rica were no longer an unknown quantity . " we have collected a lot of information on them by watching dvd clips of league games and international matches , " said löw .
" we know their strengths and weaknesses but of course we will not be discussing them in public . " costa rica n culture , lifestyle as well as tactics studied bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's first game will be no san jose beach at sunset klinsmann seems to have left nothing to chance .
the coach has even had his stars studying costa rica 's culture and lifestyle for clues on how their opponents will play in the opening match .
the german team have been viewing a short film about the friendly central american country , famed for its diverse wildlife and the fact that it has no military forces . " we introduced the players to the country , how the people live there and what their mentality is like , " löw added .
" we 've also seen from games that they 're technically skilful and they love to play beautiful soccer .
that 's a reflection of the national character . " germany captain michael ballack , who will not be playing because of injuries , said everyone had enjoyed the lesson . " it was highly educational , " ballack said .
" we all loved hearing about costa rica and getting an insight into the culture . " while having as much knowledge as possible of their opponents will give the german team a sense of preparation , the real revelations will come on the pitch .
and the hosts will be wary of any surprises . coach kli n sma n n set to start with sta n dard formatio n klinsmann is likely to deploy a standard 4-4-2 formation to counter costa rica coach alexandre guimaraes 's promise that his team are going to abandon their nice guy approach and hit their opponents with a new aggressive form of their renowned free-flowing style . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack scored against colombia but will he start the first game ?
the defensive back four charged with repelling costa rican strikers alvaro saborio and paulo wanchope is expected to be the one which kept colombia at bay in the last test match : arne friedrich , per metesacker , christoph metzelder and philipp lahm , with new number one jens lehmann tending goal behind them . with ballack missing , the midfield will probably feature bernd schneider , torsten frings and bastian schweinsteiger .
the combative tim borowski is most likely to take ballack 's place while sebastian kehl is also on standby . responsible for getting germany 's first goals of the tournament will be striking partnership miroslav klose and lukas podolski . costa rica 's trai n er says his team is n o soft touch costa rica are unlikely to roll over for the hosts just to get the party started on an upbeat note .
coach guimaraes , who was also in charge four years ago in japan / korea , has returned after the unsuccessful tenure of the american steve sampson and has built a new-look team which are tougher and more mature than in the last world cup when they were considered a soft touch . " before , costa rica were a fair play team , naive and just interested in attacking , " he recently told reporters .
" this time , everybody 's going to notice the difference . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paulo wanchope still leads the line for costa rica costa rica 's world cup debut performance in italy in 1990 saw them reach the last 16 , shocking scotland and sweden on the way .
guimaraes is optimistic that his team can at least emulate that despite struggling through the qualifying rounds . their main threat will come from paulo wanchope , their all-time leading scorer with 43 goals including eight in the qualifiers .
despite losing some of his pace , the striker has a wealth of international experience garnered from a career spent in the english and spanish leagues . world cup experie n ce from back to fro n t the team 's spine consists of the other remaining members of the class of 2002 ; including defenders harold wallace , luis marin and gilberto martinez , midfield playmaker walter centeno and forward ronald gomez .
but while these players may be well-known , germany will have to be wary of the newcomers alvaro saborio and midfielder carlos hernandez whose inclusion helped turn a near-disastrous qualifying campaign into a ticket to germany with spectacular and important long-range goals . it all adds up to a potentially thrilling game with the whiff of an upset curling around the fifa world cup stadium in munich . germany -lrb- 4-4-2 -rrb- : 1-jens lehmann ; 3-arne friedrich , 21-christoph metzelder , 17-per mertesacker , 16-phillip lahm ; 18-bernd schneider , 8-torsten frings , 13-michael ballack , 7-bastian schweinsteiger ; 20-lukas podolski , 11-miroslav klose costa rica -lrb- 3-5-2 -rrb- : 18-jose francisco porras ; 4-michael umana , 3-luis marin , 12-leonardo gonzalez ; 20-douglas sequeira , 5-gilberto martinez , 8-mauricio solis , 10-walter centeno , 6-danny fonseca ; 11-ronald gomez , 9-paulo wanchope nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de klinsmann : " we 're hungry for the opening game " german national soccer coach jürgen klinsmann said he ca n't wait for the world cup to begin after his team won their last pre-cup game against colombia 3-0 .

a woman that is like a german clock . "
this , however , is a story about why a german teenager will grow to be a bitter , old man . at the beginning of shakespeare 's poetic comedy love 's labor lost , king ferdinand of spain declares that his court will be devoted to ascetic study .
he lays out the rules of the game by imposing three conditions on his courtiers : no women allowed within a mile of the court , obligatory fasting once a week , and no more than three hours of sleep per night . what a great way to increase concentration ! the bard of avon , despite his literary genius , did n't know that king ferdinand 's experiment - in addition to being destined to fail - was pretty accurately describing the main symptoms of the 21st century 's malaise de mode , the new ascetism , namely internet dependency . an increasing number of people and , especially , all those new kids on the block , are living in a twisted universe in which physical contact with the human species is reduced to a bare minimum .
they inhabit a world in which nourishment comes as an accidental afterthought in between playing the angel of darkness online and looking for an internet hot date whose online profile matches the looks and curves of laura croft .
and they are often stuck in a time warp in which sleep-deprivation and hours in front of the computer screen lead to hallucinatory experiences that in the not so distant past required serious drug abuse . these kids have no idea what the psychedelic seventies were about . tour d 'amour yet despite what the pale-faced cassandras of this world will tell you about humanity 's impeding doom and cultural downfall , the last glimmer of hope has not been entirely extinguished .
for some people , it is still love , in its pure madness and untainted naiveté , that makes the world go around .
or , at least , makes us go around the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when love is concerned , no vehicle is fast enough - especially a bike one such brave defender of stirred up emotions - a lovesick 16-year-old german boy - hopped on his bicycle in hamm , in the western german state of north-rhine westphalia , and cycled more than 200 kilometers -lrb- 120 miles -rrb- overnight to meet a girl he had met on the internet , german police said on wednesday . very little is known about this boy , except that he will probably stay grounded throughout the fifa world cup . what we do know is that he chose not be cynical , although on that fateful night he could 've simply kept chewing on pringles and dinking can after can of cherry coke .
he also could have been a little more cautious , wondering whether his internet sweetheart was , in fact , one of those german tabloid anti-heroes , who - in a state of drunken stupor and , despite the freudian banality of it all - attack their retired neighbors with a bockwurst , sometimes with fatal consequences . like a shakespearean hero who overdosed on love potion , the young german rose above cultural stereotypes and societal prejudices .
he broke the chains of internet dependency .
he took no map , no money or food .
he also did n't ask for his parents ' permission , but ventured out into the unknown , following his heart . a thwarted attempt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a happy ending is never guaranteed unfortunately , there always comes a moment in which the prosaics of life takes over the poetic imagination .
in bremen , some two thirds of the way to hamburg , where he was headed , the boy got lost .
well-behaved and well-brought up as he is , he went to the first police station to ask for directions from kind german policemen , fully trained to make the world feel at home during the soccer championship . big mistake !
german police officers - despite their recent training in exchanging polite remarks and reducing the fear factor - are not exactly the most romantic guys around .
cops rarely get pensive while watching the sunset .
they are into chasing criminals and showing off their guns , not sobbing at the end of sleepless in seattle . the police dutifully informed the boy 's parents , who , in their turn , were anything but amused .
they came to pick him up and take him back home to hamm .
there are unconfirmed reports that some huffing and puffing was involved . the unsuspecting girl in hamburg knew nothing about her suitor 's exertions .
he said he had wanted to surprise her . no wonder kids turn out pessimistic and distrustful when they grow up . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de love-struck german judge turns blind eye to justice wearing black robes and being addressed as " your honor " apparently does n't keep people from doing really , really stupid things , as one love-struck german judge recently proved .

others ask whether the hoopla is n't just a bit too much . no matter how you look at the world cup , it 's always close to the official motto of " a time to make friends , " wrote the karlsruhe-based badische neueste nachrichten .
" germany wants to present itself as an open , good-natured , dynamic country , " the paper said .
" if it manages that , the benefits would be immeasurable . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wil the motto " a time to make friends " translate into a real feeling ?
that view is shared by the heilbronner stimme which opined that germany would be a winner - irrespective of how it performed on the pitch - if the official world cup motto translated into a tangible feeling for the fans .
" people expect perfect organization from the germans , but not warmth and joie de vivre .
the world cup offers the chance for an image makeover in a very simple way , " the paper wrote .
" the nicest praise would be the conclusion : germany is different . " the dresden-based sächsische zeitung wrote that the world has noticed that germany is making an effort and is showing off its best side .
" the london times writes that germany is ready for a new image , the dutch are writing friendly things about us and the danes are discovering new success stories about the ' world champs in organization , " ' the paper wrote .
" of course clichés still persist .
but it shows that germany can and will change its image through the mammoth soccer event , despite the recent xenophobic attacks , " the daily said . some newspapers also took a jibe at the commercial hoopla and hype that has consumed the event . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some wonder if germany has n't gone overboard with soccer mania " if all that 's been written and said in the past months is true , then a real multifunctional world cup is heading towards this country , " the münchner merkur wrote .
it added that the biggest soccer event of the world was meant to kick-start the economy , create jobs , lift sagging spirits and present the image of a modern , friendly germany abroad .
" that 's quite a lot for a single tournament and we have n't even begun to talk about soccer as yet , " the paper wrote .
it all adds up to a sated feeling , almost one of reluctance for the ordinary citizen , it said .
" you might say that all this is now a part of modern sport , you ca n't change it .
the opening game should put things in perspective . " " it would be wonderful if modernizer klinsmann is successful and his team cuts a brave figure .
that could revive germans ' belief in their own abilities , " the southern german augsburger allgemeine wrote .
the paper however reminded that the euphoria of germany winning the last world cup , in 1990 - the year that german reunification took place - did n't last long .
" the world cup does n't solve our problems . " berlin-based daily der tagesspiegel commented that there were several people who are completely annoyed by the whole hype surrounding the event and do n't care about it all .
" a game !
is n't there anything more important than that ? " the paper asked rhetorically .
" but there is some comfort for those who ca n't stand the world cup - it 's over in 33 days , " the daily wrote .
" but everyone - even those who hate it - will have something special at the end of the tournament : the memory of a world cup in your own country .

nearly six years after germany was awarded the 2006 world cup , the globe 's biggest soccer spectacle is ready to kick-off in munich friday with the hosts playing costa rica in the first game .
-lrb- june 9 , 2006 -rrb- some soccer fans want to reclaim the game the world cup , which starts friday , will be the culmination of two years of hype that has left no marketing stone unturned .
for " true " fans , it has become capitalistic excess and some are rebelling .

world soccer 's governing body has assumed almost total control and the german hosts are increasingly pushed aside .

others ask whether the hoopla is n't just a bit too much . no matter how you look at the world cup , it 's always close to the official motto of " a time to make friends , " wrote the karlsruhe-based badische neueste nachrichten .
" germany wants to present itself as an open , good-natured , dynamic country , " the paper said .
" if it manages that , the benefits would be immeasurable . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wil the motto " a time to make friends " translate into a real feeling ?

" people expect perfect organization from the germans , but not warmth and joie de vivre .
the world cup offers the chance for an image makeover in a very simple way , " the paper wrote .
" the nicest praise would be the conclusion : germany is different . " the dresden-based sächsische zeitung wrote that the world has noticed that germany is making an effort and is showing off its best side .

the waiting is over .
nearly six years after germany was awarded the 2006 world cup , the globe 's biggest soccer spectacle began in munich friday with the hosts playing costa rica in the first game . since that ecstatic night in zurich on july 6 , 2000 when franz beckenbauer 's glitzy team of soccer legends , celebrities and politicians won the right to stage the tournament , enough column inches have been written on germany 's preparations to stretch from berlin to san jose .
now the real action starts . germany remain confident that their first opponents will not spoil the opening party .
assistant coach joachim löw revealed earlier in the week that the staff and players had studied dvds of the central americans ' warm-up matches and that the belief was that the hosts would get their world cup campaign off to a winning start . " it is the first match and we are a bit nervous but we have done our homework and i think we are in a position to beat costa rica , " löw told reporters .
" if we turn up and show our strengths we will win the match . " germany manager jürgen klinsmann has forced all of his players to watch clips of their opponents and löw claims costa rica were no longer an unknown quantity . " we have collected a lot of information on them by watching dvd clips of league games and international matches , " said löw .
" we know their strengths and weaknesses but of course we will not be discussing them in public . " costa rica n culture , lifestyle as well as tactics studied bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's first game will be no san jose beach at sunset klinsmann seems to have left nothing to chance .
the coach has even had his stars studying costa rica 's culture and lifestyle for clues on how their opponents will play in the opening match .
the german team have been viewing a short film about the friendly central american country , famed for its diverse wildlife and the fact that it has no military forces . " we introduced the players to the country , how the people live there and what their mentality is like , " löw added .
" we 've also seen from games that they 're technically skilful and they love to play beautiful soccer .
that 's a reflection of the national character . " germany captain michael ballack , who will not be playing because of injuries , said everyone had enjoyed the lesson . " it was highly educational , " ballack said .
" we all loved hearing about costa rica and getting an insight into the culture . " while having as much knowledge as possible of their opponents will give the german team a sense of preparation , the real revelations will come on the pitch .
and the hosts will be wary of any surprises . coach kli n sma n n set to start with sta n dard formatio n klinsmann is likely to deploy a standard 4-4-2 formation to counter costa rica coach alexandre guimaraes 's promise that his team are going to abandon their nice guy approach and hit their opponents with a new aggressive form of their renowned free-flowing style . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack scored against colombia but will he start the first game ?
the defensive back four charged with repelling costa rican strikers alvaro saborio and paulo wanchope is expected to be the one which kept colombia at bay in the last test match : arne friedrich , per metesacker , christoph metzelder and philipp lahm , with new number one jens lehmann tending goal behind them . with ballack missing , the midfield will probably feature bernd schneider , torsten frings and bastian schweinsteiger .
the combative tim borowski is most likely to take ballack 's place while sebastian kehl is also on standby . responsible for getting germany 's first goals of the tournament will be striking partnership miroslav klose and lukas podolski . costa rica 's trai n er says his team is n o soft touch costa rica are unlikely to roll over for the hosts just to get the party started on an upbeat note .
coach guimaraes , who was also in charge four years ago in japan / korea , has returned after the unsuccessful tenure of the american steve sampson and has built a new-look team which are tougher and more mature than in the last world cup when they were considered a soft touch . " before , costa rica were a fair play team , naive and just interested in attacking , " he recently told reporters .
" this time , everybody 's going to notice the difference . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paulo wanchope still leads the line for costa rica costa rica 's world cup debut performance in italy in 1990 saw them reach the last 16 , shocking scotland and sweden on the way .
guimaraes is optimistic that his team can at least emulate that despite struggling through the qualifying rounds . their main threat will come from paulo wanchope , their all-time leading scorer with 43 goals including eight in the qualifiers .
despite losing some of his pace , the striker has a wealth of international experience garnered from a career spent in the english and spanish leagues . world cup experie n ce from back to fro n t the team 's spine consists of the other remaining members of the class of 2002 ; including defenders harold wallace , luis marin and gilberto martinez , midfield playmaker walter centeno and forward ronald gomez .
but while these players may be well-known , germany will have to be wary of the newcomers alvaro saborio and midfielder carlos hernandez whose inclusion helped turn a near-disastrous qualifying campaign into a ticket to germany with spectacular and important long-range goals . it all adds up to a potentially thrilling game with the whiff of an upset curling around the fifa world cup stadium in munich . germany -lrb- 4-4-2 -rrb- : 1-jens lehmann ; 3-arne friedrich , 21-christoph metzelder , 17-per mertesacker , 16-phillip lahm ; 18-bernd schneider , 8-torsten frings , 13-michael ballack , 7-bastian schweinsteiger ; 20-lukas podolski , 11-miroslav klose costa rica -lrb- 3-5-2 -rrb- : 18-jose francisco porras ; 4-michael umana , 3-luis marin , 12-leonardo gonzalez ; 20-douglas sequeira , 5-gilberto martinez , 8-mauricio solis , 10-walter centeno , 6-danny fonseca ; 11-ronald gomez , 9-paulo wanchope nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de klinsmann : " we 're hungry for the opening game " german national soccer coach jürgen klinsmann said he ca n't wait for the world cup to begin after his team won their last pre-cup game against colombia 3-0 .

" i am writing to you to spare you and the world from the upcoming sitting of the city council in which they will decide not to give me the prize , " handke said in the letter .

the waiting is over .
nearly six years after germany was awarded the 2006 world cup , the globe 's biggest soccer spectacle began in munich friday with the hosts playing costa rica in the first game . since that ecstatic night in zurich on july 6 , 2000 when franz beckenbauer 's glitzy team of soccer legends , celebrities and politicians won the right to stage the tournament , enough column inches have been written on germany 's preparations to stretch from berlin to san jose .
now the real action starts . germany remain confident that their first opponents will not spoil the opening party .
assistant coach joachim löw revealed earlier in the week that the staff and players had studied dvds of the central americans ' warm-up matches and that the belief was that the hosts would get their world cup campaign off to a winning start . " it is the first match and we are a bit nervous but we have done our homework and i think we are in a position to beat costa rica , " löw told reporters .
" if we turn up and show our strengths we will win the match . " germany manager jürgen klinsmann has forced all of his players to watch clips of their opponents and löw claims costa rica were no longer an unknown quantity . " we have collected a lot of information on them by watching dvd clips of league games and international matches , " said löw .
" we know their strengths and weaknesses but of course we will not be discussing them in public . " costa rica n culture , lifestyle as well as tactics studied bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's first game will be no san jose beach at sunset klinsmann seems to have left nothing to chance .
the coach has even had his stars studying costa rica 's culture and lifestyle for clues on how their opponents will play in the opening match .
the german team have been viewing a short film about the friendly central american country , famed for its diverse wildlife and the fact that it has no military forces . " we introduced the players to the country , how the people live there and what their mentality is like , " löw added .
" we 've also seen from games that they 're technically skilful and they love to play beautiful soccer .
that 's a reflection of the national character . " germany captain michael ballack , who will not be playing because of injuries , said everyone had enjoyed the lesson . " it was highly educational , " ballack said .
" we all loved hearing about costa rica and getting an insight into the culture . " while having as much knowledge as possible of their opponents will give the german team a sense of preparation , the real revelations will come on the pitch .
and the hosts will be wary of any surprises . coach kli n sma n n set to start with sta n dard formatio n klinsmann is likely to deploy a standard 4-4-2 formation to counter costa rica coach alexandre guimaraes 's promise that his team are going to abandon their nice guy approach and hit their opponents with a new aggressive form of their renowned free-flowing style . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack scored against colombia but will he start the first game ?
the defensive back four charged with repelling costa rican strikers alvaro saborio and paulo wanchope is expected to be the one which kept colombia at bay in the last test match : arne friedrich , per metesacker , christoph metzelder and philipp lahm , with new number one jens lehmann tending goal behind them . with ballack missing , the midfield will probably feature bernd schneider , torsten frings and bastian schweinsteiger .
the combative tim borowski is most likely to take ballack 's place while sebastian kehl is also on standby . responsible for getting germany 's first goals of the tournament will be striking partnership miroslav klose and lukas podolski . costa rica 's trai n er says his team is n o soft touch costa rica are unlikely to roll over for the hosts just to get the party started on an upbeat note .
coach guimaraes , who was also in charge four years ago in japan / korea , has returned after the unsuccessful tenure of the american steve sampson and has built a new-look team which are tougher and more mature than in the last world cup when they were considered a soft touch . " before , costa rica were a fair play team , naive and just interested in attacking , " he recently told reporters .
" this time , everybody 's going to notice the difference . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paulo wanchope still leads the line for costa rica costa rica 's world cup debut performance in italy in 1990 saw them reach the last 16 , shocking scotland and sweden on the way .
guimaraes is optimistic that his team can at least emulate that despite struggling through the qualifying rounds . their main threat will come from paulo wanchope , their all-time leading scorer with 43 goals including eight in the qualifiers .
despite losing some of his pace , the striker has a wealth of international experience garnered from a career spent in the english and spanish leagues . world cup experie n ce from back to fro n t the team 's spine consists of the other remaining members of the class of 2002 ; including defenders harold wallace , luis marin and gilberto martinez , midfield playmaker walter centeno and forward ronald gomez .
but while these players may be well-known , germany will have to be wary of the newcomers alvaro saborio and midfielder carlos hernandez whose inclusion helped turn a near-disastrous qualifying campaign into a ticket to germany with spectacular and important long-range goals . it all adds up to a potentially thrilling game with the whiff of an upset curling around the fifa world cup stadium in munich . germany -lrb- 4-4-2 -rrb- : 1-jens lehmann ; 3-arne friedrich , 21-christoph metzelder , 17-per mertesacker , 16-phillip lahm ; 18-bernd schneider , 8-torsten frings , 13-michael ballack , 7-bastian schweinsteiger ; 20-lukas podolski , 11-miroslav klose costa rica -lrb- 3-5-2 -rrb- : 18-jose francisco porras ; 4-michael umana , 3-luis marin , 12-leonardo gonzalez ; 20-douglas sequeira , 5-gilberto martinez , 8-mauricio solis , 10-walter centeno , 6-danny fonseca ; 11-ronald gomez , 9-paulo wanchope nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de klinsmann : " we 're hungry for the opening game " german national soccer coach jürgen klinsmann said he ca n't wait for the world cup to begin after his team won their last pre-cup game against colombia 3-0 .

but the prospect of thousands of people flooding into the country with no intention of leaving after the tournament ends is less easy to deal with , although visa restrictions and increased border controls will at least strengthen the host nation 's hand . germany is preparing to suspend the free travel arrangements it has with certain neighbors under the european union 's schengen agreement and reimpose passport checks on the borders with denmark , austria , france , belgium , luxembourg and the netherlands . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will reintroduce border controls with eu neighbors the threat of illegal immigrants entering germany during the world cup is a real one .

officials in tunisia also announced recently that they suspected many of those queuing for visas to germany were not soccer fans but people desperate for a ticket to a job and a new life in europe . such news has put germany on high alert .
the federal government has not loosened its visa requirements for non-eu and non-western countries and as a result , fans of countries like ukraine may face disappointment when trying to enter the country to watch the games unless they can fulfill the visa criteria . german embassies around the world have issued warnings to foreign nationals intending to travel to the world cup that having a ticket for the games will not guarantee them a visa or entry . " may be turned back " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : signing up for tickets ; not applying for a visa the announcements also advise fans that the best way of getting a visa is to have documents proving they have a job , travel health insurance and a return plane ticket .
visa applicants must also prove , in an interview , that they are on a short-term visit and have the funds to travel while in germany . " there will always be applicants , especially from poor countries , who want to come here and stay for economic reasons , " a german foreign ministry spokesperson told dw-world.de.

but the prospect of thousands of people flooding into the country with no intention of leaving after the tournament ends is less easy to deal with , although visa restrictions and increased border controls will at least strengthen the host nation 's hand . germany is preparing to suspend the free travel arrangements it has with certain neighbors under the european union 's schengen agreement and reimpose passport checks on the borders with denmark , austria , france , belgium , luxembourg and the netherlands . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will reintroduce border controls with eu neighbors the threat of illegal immigrants entering germany during the world cup is a real one .

the foreign ministry is bracing for a rush on visa applications while the interior ministry is fearing a flood of visitors who do not have the required papers . on top of that , there a further twenty countries , including mexico , costa rica and paraguay , which do not require visas . visa scams put germany on high alert the foreign ministry recently announced that it had uncovered a visa scam in one participating african country in which potential migrants were advised to throw away their passports on arrival and claim asylum .
officials in tunisia also announced recently that they suspected many of those queuing for visas to germany were not soccer fans but people desperate for a ticket to a job and a new life in europe . such news has put germany on high alert .
the federal government has not loosened its visa requirements for non-eu and non-western countries and as a result , fans of countries like ukraine may face disappointment when trying to enter the country to watch the games unless they can fulfill the visa criteria . german embassies around the world have issued warnings to foreign nationals intending to travel to the world cup that having a ticket for the games will not guarantee them a visa or entry . " may be turned back " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : signing up for tickets ; not applying for a visa the announcements also advise fans that the best way of getting a visa is to have documents proving they have a job , travel health insurance and a return plane ticket .

the waiting is over .
nearly six years after germany was awarded the 2006 world cup , the globe 's biggest soccer spectacle began in munich friday with the hosts playing costa rica in the first game . since that ecstatic night in zurich on july 6 , 2000 when franz beckenbauer 's glitzy team of soccer legends , celebrities and politicians won the right to stage the tournament , enough column inches have been written on germany 's preparations to stretch from berlin to san jose .
now the real action starts . germany remain confident that their first opponents will not spoil the opening party .
assistant coach joachim löw revealed earlier in the week that the staff and players had studied dvds of the central americans ' warm-up matches and that the belief was that the hosts would get their world cup campaign off to a winning start . " it is the first match and we are a bit nervous but we have done our homework and i think we are in a position to beat costa rica , " löw told reporters .
" if we turn up and show our strengths we will win the match . " germany manager jürgen klinsmann has forced all of his players to watch clips of their opponents and löw claims costa rica were no longer an unknown quantity . " we have collected a lot of information on them by watching dvd clips of league games and international matches , " said löw .
" we know their strengths and weaknesses but of course we will not be discussing them in public . " costa rica n culture , lifestyle as well as tactics studied bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's first game will be no san jose beach at sunset klinsmann seems to have left nothing to chance .
the coach has even had his stars studying costa rica 's culture and lifestyle for clues on how their opponents will play in the opening match .
the german team have been viewing a short film about the friendly central american country , famed for its diverse wildlife and the fact that it has no military forces . " we introduced the players to the country , how the people live there and what their mentality is like , " löw added .
" we 've also seen from games that they 're technically skilful and they love to play beautiful soccer .
that 's a reflection of the national character . " germany captain michael ballack , who will not be playing because of injuries , said everyone had enjoyed the lesson . " it was highly educational , " ballack said .
" we all loved hearing about costa rica and getting an insight into the culture . " while having as much knowledge as possible of their opponents will give the german team a sense of preparation , the real revelations will come on the pitch .
and the hosts will be wary of any surprises . coach kli n sma n n set to start with sta n dard formatio n klinsmann is likely to deploy a standard 4-4-2 formation to counter costa rica coach alexandre guimaraes 's promise that his team are going to abandon their nice guy approach and hit their opponents with a new aggressive form of their renowned free-flowing style . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack scored against colombia but will he start the first game ?
the defensive back four charged with repelling costa rican strikers alvaro saborio and paulo wanchope is expected to be the one which kept colombia at bay in the last test match : arne friedrich , per metesacker , christoph metzelder and philipp lahm , with new number one jens lehmann tending goal behind them . with ballack missing , the midfield will probably feature bernd schneider , torsten frings and bastian schweinsteiger .
the combative tim borowski is most likely to take ballack 's place while sebastian kehl is also on standby . responsible for getting germany 's first goals of the tournament will be striking partnership miroslav klose and lukas podolski . costa rica 's trai n er says his team is n o soft touch costa rica are unlikely to roll over for the hosts just to get the party started on an upbeat note .
coach guimaraes , who was also in charge four years ago in japan / korea , has returned after the unsuccessful tenure of the american steve sampson and has built a new-look team which are tougher and more mature than in the last world cup when they were considered a soft touch . " before , costa rica were a fair play team , naive and just interested in attacking , " he recently told reporters .
" this time , everybody 's going to notice the difference . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paulo wanchope still leads the line for costa rica costa rica 's world cup debut performance in italy in 1990 saw them reach the last 16 , shocking scotland and sweden on the way .
guimaraes is optimistic that his team can at least emulate that despite struggling through the qualifying rounds . their main threat will come from paulo wanchope , their all-time leading scorer with 43 goals including eight in the qualifiers .
despite losing some of his pace , the striker has a wealth of international experience garnered from a career spent in the english and spanish leagues . world cup experie n ce from back to fro n t the team 's spine consists of the other remaining members of the class of 2002 ; including defenders harold wallace , luis marin and gilberto martinez , midfield playmaker walter centeno and forward ronald gomez .
but while these players may be well-known , germany will have to be wary of the newcomers alvaro saborio and midfielder carlos hernandez whose inclusion helped turn a near-disastrous qualifying campaign into a ticket to germany with spectacular and important long-range goals . it all adds up to a potentially thrilling game with the whiff of an upset curling around the fifa world cup stadium in munich . germany -lrb- 4-4-2 -rrb- : 1-jens lehmann ; 3-arne friedrich , 21-christoph metzelder , 17-per mertesacker , 16-phillip lahm ; 18-bernd schneider , 8-torsten frings , 13-michael ballack , 7-bastian schweinsteiger ; 20-lukas podolski , 11-miroslav klose costa rica -lrb- 3-5-2 -rrb- : 18-jose francisco porras ; 4-michael umana , 3-luis marin , 12-leonardo gonzalez ; 20-douglas sequeira , 5-gilberto martinez , 8-mauricio solis , 10-walter centeno , 6-danny fonseca ; 11-ronald gomez , 9-paulo wanchope nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de klinsmann : " we 're hungry for the opening game " german national soccer coach jürgen klinsmann said he ca n't wait for the world cup to begin after his team won their last pre-cup game against colombia 3-0 .

the waiting is over .
nearly six years after germany was awarded the 2006 world cup , the globe 's biggest soccer spectacle began in munich friday with the hosts playing costa rica in the first game . since that ecstatic night in zurich on july 6 , 2000 when franz beckenbauer 's glitzy team of soccer legends , celebrities and politicians won the right to stage the tournament , enough column inches have been written on germany 's preparations to stretch from berlin to san jose .
now the real action starts . germany remain confident that their first opponents will not spoil the opening party .
assistant coach joachim löw revealed earlier in the week that the staff and players had studied dvds of the central americans ' warm-up matches and that the belief was that the hosts would get their world cup campaign off to a winning start . " it is the first match and we are a bit nervous but we have done our homework and i think we are in a position to beat costa rica , " löw told reporters .
" if we turn up and show our strengths we will win the match . " germany manager jürgen klinsmann has forced all of his players to watch clips of their opponents and löw claims costa rica were no longer an unknown quantity . " we have collected a lot of information on them by watching dvd clips of league games and international matches , " said löw .
" we know their strengths and weaknesses but of course we will not be discussing them in public . " costa rica n culture , lifestyle as well as tactics studied bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's first game will be no san jose beach at sunset klinsmann seems to have left nothing to chance .
the coach has even had his stars studying costa rica 's culture and lifestyle for clues on how their opponents will play in the opening match .
the german team have been viewing a short film about the friendly central american country , famed for its diverse wildlife and the fact that it has no military forces . " we introduced the players to the country , how the people live there and what their mentality is like , " löw added .
" we 've also seen from games that they 're technically skilful and they love to play beautiful soccer .
that 's a reflection of the national character . " germany captain michael ballack , who will not be playing because of injuries , said everyone had enjoyed the lesson . " it was highly educational , " ballack said .
" we all loved hearing about costa rica and getting an insight into the culture . " while having as much knowledge as possible of their opponents will give the german team a sense of preparation , the real revelations will come on the pitch .
and the hosts will be wary of any surprises . coach kli n sma n n set to start with sta n dard formatio n klinsmann is likely to deploy a standard 4-4-2 formation to counter costa rica coach alexandre guimaraes 's promise that his team are going to abandon their nice guy approach and hit their opponents with a new aggressive form of their renowned free-flowing style . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack scored against colombia but will he start the first game ?
the defensive back four charged with repelling costa rican strikers alvaro saborio and paulo wanchope is expected to be the one which kept colombia at bay in the last test match : arne friedrich , per metesacker , christoph metzelder and philipp lahm , with new number one jens lehmann tending goal behind them . with ballack missing , the midfield will probably feature bernd schneider , torsten frings and bastian schweinsteiger .
the combative tim borowski is most likely to take ballack 's place while sebastian kehl is also on standby . responsible for getting germany 's first goals of the tournament will be striking partnership miroslav klose and lukas podolski . costa rica 's trai n er says his team is n o soft touch costa rica are unlikely to roll over for the hosts just to get the party started on an upbeat note .
coach guimaraes , who was also in charge four years ago in japan / korea , has returned after the unsuccessful tenure of the american steve sampson and has built a new-look team which are tougher and more mature than in the last world cup when they were considered a soft touch . " before , costa rica were a fair play team , naive and just interested in attacking , " he recently told reporters .
" this time , everybody 's going to notice the difference . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paulo wanchope still leads the line for costa rica costa rica 's world cup debut performance in italy in 1990 saw them reach the last 16 , shocking scotland and sweden on the way .
guimaraes is optimistic that his team can at least emulate that despite struggling through the qualifying rounds . their main threat will come from paulo wanchope , their all-time leading scorer with 43 goals including eight in the qualifiers .
despite losing some of his pace , the striker has a wealth of international experience garnered from a career spent in the english and spanish leagues . world cup experie n ce from back to fro n t the team 's spine consists of the other remaining members of the class of 2002 ; including defenders harold wallace , luis marin and gilberto martinez , midfield playmaker walter centeno and forward ronald gomez .
but while these players may be well-known , germany will have to be wary of the newcomers alvaro saborio and midfielder carlos hernandez whose inclusion helped turn a near-disastrous qualifying campaign into a ticket to germany with spectacular and important long-range goals . it all adds up to a potentially thrilling game with the whiff of an upset curling around the fifa world cup stadium in munich . germany -lrb- 4-4-2 -rrb- : 1-jens lehmann ; 3-arne friedrich , 21-christoph metzelder , 17-per mertesacker , 16-phillip lahm ; 18-bernd schneider , 8-torsten frings , 13-michael ballack , 7-bastian schweinsteiger ; 20-lukas podolski , 11-miroslav klose costa rica -lrb- 3-5-2 -rrb- : 18-jose francisco porras ; 4-michael umana , 3-luis marin , 12-leonardo gonzalez ; 20-douglas sequeira , 5-gilberto martinez , 8-mauricio solis , 10-walter centeno , 6-danny fonseca ; 11-ronald gomez , 9-paulo wanchope nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de klinsmann : " we 're hungry for the opening game " german national soccer coach jürgen klinsmann said he ca n't wait for the world cup to begin after his team won their last pre-cup game against colombia 3-0 .

a woman that is like a german clock . "
this , however , is a story about why a german teenager will grow to be a bitter , old man . at the beginning of shakespeare 's poetic comedy love 's labor lost , king ferdinand of spain declares that his court will be devoted to ascetic study .
he lays out the rules of the game by imposing three conditions on his courtiers : no women allowed within a mile of the court , obligatory fasting once a week , and no more than three hours of sleep per night . what a great way to increase concentration ! the bard of avon , despite his literary genius , did n't know that king ferdinand 's experiment - in addition to being destined to fail - was pretty accurately describing the main symptoms of the 21st century 's malaise de mode , the new ascetism , namely internet dependency . an increasing number of people and , especially , all those new kids on the block , are living in a twisted universe in which physical contact with the human species is reduced to a bare minimum .
they inhabit a world in which nourishment comes as an accidental afterthought in between playing the angel of darkness online and looking for an internet hot date whose online profile matches the looks and curves of laura croft .
and they are often stuck in a time warp in which sleep-deprivation and hours in front of the computer screen lead to hallucinatory experiences that in the not so distant past required serious drug abuse . these kids have no idea what the psychedelic seventies were about . tour d 'amour yet despite what the pale-faced cassandras of this world will tell you about humanity 's impeding doom and cultural downfall , the last glimmer of hope has not been entirely extinguished .
for some people , it is still love , in its pure madness and untainted naiveté , that makes the world go around .
or , at least , makes us go around the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when love is concerned , no vehicle is fast enough - especially a bike one such brave defender of stirred up emotions - a lovesick 16-year-old german boy - hopped on his bicycle in hamm , in the western german state of north-rhine westphalia , and cycled more than 200 kilometers -lrb- 120 miles -rrb- overnight to meet a girl he had met on the internet , german police said on wednesday . very little is known about this boy , except that he will probably stay grounded throughout the fifa world cup . what we do know is that he chose not be cynical , although on that fateful night he could 've simply kept chewing on pringles and dinking can after can of cherry coke .
he also could have been a little more cautious , wondering whether his internet sweetheart was , in fact , one of those german tabloid anti-heroes , who - in a state of drunken stupor and , despite the freudian banality of it all - attack their retired neighbors with a bockwurst , sometimes with fatal consequences . like a shakespearean hero who overdosed on love potion , the young german rose above cultural stereotypes and societal prejudices .
he broke the chains of internet dependency .
he took no map , no money or food .
he also did n't ask for his parents ' permission , but ventured out into the unknown , following his heart . a thwarted attempt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a happy ending is never guaranteed unfortunately , there always comes a moment in which the prosaics of life takes over the poetic imagination .
in bremen , some two thirds of the way to hamburg , where he was headed , the boy got lost .
well-behaved and well-brought up as he is , he went to the first police station to ask for directions from kind german policemen , fully trained to make the world feel at home during the soccer championship . big mistake !
german police officers - despite their recent training in exchanging polite remarks and reducing the fear factor - are not exactly the most romantic guys around .
cops rarely get pensive while watching the sunset .
they are into chasing criminals and showing off their guns , not sobbing at the end of sleepless in seattle . the police dutifully informed the boy 's parents , who , in their turn , were anything but amused .
they came to pick him up and take him back home to hamm .
there are unconfirmed reports that some huffing and puffing was involved . the unsuspecting girl in hamburg knew nothing about her suitor 's exertions .
he said he had wanted to surprise her . no wonder kids turn out pessimistic and distrustful when they grow up . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de love-struck german judge turns blind eye to justice wearing black robes and being addressed as " your honor " apparently does n't keep people from doing really , really stupid things , as one love-struck german judge recently proved .

the waiting is over .
nearly six years after germany was awarded the 2006 world cup , the globe 's biggest soccer spectacle began in munich friday with the hosts playing costa rica in the first game . since that ecstatic night in zurich on july 6 , 2000 when franz beckenbauer 's glitzy team of soccer legends , celebrities and politicians won the right to stage the tournament , enough column inches have been written on germany 's preparations to stretch from berlin to san jose .
now the real action starts . germany remain confident that their first opponents will not spoil the opening party .
assistant coach joachim löw revealed earlier in the week that the staff and players had studied dvds of the central americans ' warm-up matches and that the belief was that the hosts would get their world cup campaign off to a winning start . " it is the first match and we are a bit nervous but we have done our homework and i think we are in a position to beat costa rica , " löw told reporters .
" if we turn up and show our strengths we will win the match . " germany manager jürgen klinsmann has forced all of his players to watch clips of their opponents and löw claims costa rica were no longer an unknown quantity . " we have collected a lot of information on them by watching dvd clips of league games and international matches , " said löw .
" we know their strengths and weaknesses but of course we will not be discussing them in public . " costa rica n culture , lifestyle as well as tactics studied bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's first game will be no san jose beach at sunset klinsmann seems to have left nothing to chance .
the coach has even had his stars studying costa rica 's culture and lifestyle for clues on how their opponents will play in the opening match .
the german team have been viewing a short film about the friendly central american country , famed for its diverse wildlife and the fact that it has no military forces . " we introduced the players to the country , how the people live there and what their mentality is like , " löw added .
" we 've also seen from games that they 're technically skilful and they love to play beautiful soccer .
that 's a reflection of the national character . " germany captain michael ballack , who will not be playing because of injuries , said everyone had enjoyed the lesson . " it was highly educational , " ballack said .
" we all loved hearing about costa rica and getting an insight into the culture . " while having as much knowledge as possible of their opponents will give the german team a sense of preparation , the real revelations will come on the pitch .
and the hosts will be wary of any surprises . coach kli n sma n n set to start with sta n dard formatio n klinsmann is likely to deploy a standard 4-4-2 formation to counter costa rica coach alexandre guimaraes 's promise that his team are going to abandon their nice guy approach and hit their opponents with a new aggressive form of their renowned free-flowing style . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack scored against colombia but will he start the first game ?
the defensive back four charged with repelling costa rican strikers alvaro saborio and paulo wanchope is expected to be the one which kept colombia at bay in the last test match : arne friedrich , per metesacker , christoph metzelder and philipp lahm , with new number one jens lehmann tending goal behind them . with ballack missing , the midfield will probably feature bernd schneider , torsten frings and bastian schweinsteiger .
the combative tim borowski is most likely to take ballack 's place while sebastian kehl is also on standby . responsible for getting germany 's first goals of the tournament will be striking partnership miroslav klose and lukas podolski . costa rica 's trai n er says his team is n o soft touch costa rica are unlikely to roll over for the hosts just to get the party started on an upbeat note .
coach guimaraes , who was also in charge four years ago in japan / korea , has returned after the unsuccessful tenure of the american steve sampson and has built a new-look team which are tougher and more mature than in the last world cup when they were considered a soft touch . " before , costa rica were a fair play team , naive and just interested in attacking , " he recently told reporters .
" this time , everybody 's going to notice the difference . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paulo wanchope still leads the line for costa rica costa rica 's world cup debut performance in italy in 1990 saw them reach the last 16 , shocking scotland and sweden on the way .
guimaraes is optimistic that his team can at least emulate that despite struggling through the qualifying rounds . their main threat will come from paulo wanchope , their all-time leading scorer with 43 goals including eight in the qualifiers .
despite losing some of his pace , the striker has a wealth of international experience garnered from a career spent in the english and spanish leagues . world cup experie n ce from back to fro n t the team 's spine consists of the other remaining members of the class of 2002 ; including defenders harold wallace , luis marin and gilberto martinez , midfield playmaker walter centeno and forward ronald gomez .
but while these players may be well-known , germany will have to be wary of the newcomers alvaro saborio and midfielder carlos hernandez whose inclusion helped turn a near-disastrous qualifying campaign into a ticket to germany with spectacular and important long-range goals . it all adds up to a potentially thrilling game with the whiff of an upset curling around the fifa world cup stadium in munich . germany -lrb- 4-4-2 -rrb- : 1-jens lehmann ; 3-arne friedrich , 21-christoph metzelder , 17-per mertesacker , 16-phillip lahm ; 18-bernd schneider , 8-torsten frings , 13-michael ballack , 7-bastian schweinsteiger ; 20-lukas podolski , 11-miroslav klose costa rica -lrb- 3-5-2 -rrb- : 18-jose francisco porras ; 4-michael umana , 3-luis marin , 12-leonardo gonzalez ; 20-douglas sequeira , 5-gilberto martinez , 8-mauricio solis , 10-walter centeno , 6-danny fonseca ; 11-ronald gomez , 9-paulo wanchope nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de klinsmann : " we 're hungry for the opening game " german national soccer coach jürgen klinsmann said he ca n't wait for the world cup to begin after his team won their last pre-cup game against colombia 3-0 .

the waiting is over .
nearly six years after germany was awarded the 2006 world cup , the globe 's biggest soccer spectacle began in munich friday with the hosts playing costa rica in the first game . since that ecstatic night in zurich on july 6 , 2000 when franz beckenbauer 's glitzy team of soccer legends , celebrities and politicians won the right to stage the tournament , enough column inches have been written on germany 's preparations to stretch from berlin to san jose .
now the real action starts . germany remain confident that their first opponents will not spoil the opening party .
assistant coach joachim löw revealed earlier in the week that the staff and players had studied dvds of the central americans ' warm-up matches and that the belief was that the hosts would get their world cup campaign off to a winning start . " it is the first match and we are a bit nervous but we have done our homework and i think we are in a position to beat costa rica , " löw told reporters .
" if we turn up and show our strengths we will win the match . " germany manager jürgen klinsmann has forced all of his players to watch clips of their opponents and löw claims costa rica were no longer an unknown quantity . " we have collected a lot of information on them by watching dvd clips of league games and international matches , " said löw .
" we know their strengths and weaknesses but of course we will not be discussing them in public . " costa rica n culture , lifestyle as well as tactics studied bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's first game will be no san jose beach at sunset klinsmann seems to have left nothing to chance .
the coach has even had his stars studying costa rica 's culture and lifestyle for clues on how their opponents will play in the opening match .
the german team have been viewing a short film about the friendly central american country , famed for its diverse wildlife and the fact that it has no military forces . " we introduced the players to the country , how the people live there and what their mentality is like , " löw added .
" we 've also seen from games that they 're technically skilful and they love to play beautiful soccer .
that 's a reflection of the national character . " germany captain michael ballack , who will not be playing because of injuries , said everyone had enjoyed the lesson . " it was highly educational , " ballack said .
" we all loved hearing about costa rica and getting an insight into the culture . " while having as much knowledge as possible of their opponents will give the german team a sense of preparation , the real revelations will come on the pitch .
and the hosts will be wary of any surprises . coach kli n sma n n set to start with sta n dard formatio n klinsmann is likely to deploy a standard 4-4-2 formation to counter costa rica coach alexandre guimaraes 's promise that his team are going to abandon their nice guy approach and hit their opponents with a new aggressive form of their renowned free-flowing style . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack scored against colombia but will he start the first game ?
the defensive back four charged with repelling costa rican strikers alvaro saborio and paulo wanchope is expected to be the one which kept colombia at bay in the last test match : arne friedrich , per metesacker , christoph metzelder and philipp lahm , with new number one jens lehmann tending goal behind them . with ballack missing , the midfield will probably feature bernd schneider , torsten frings and bastian schweinsteiger .
the combative tim borowski is most likely to take ballack 's place while sebastian kehl is also on standby . responsible for getting germany 's first goals of the tournament will be striking partnership miroslav klose and lukas podolski . costa rica 's trai n er says his team is n o soft touch costa rica are unlikely to roll over for the hosts just to get the party started on an upbeat note .
coach guimaraes , who was also in charge four years ago in japan / korea , has returned after the unsuccessful tenure of the american steve sampson and has built a new-look team which are tougher and more mature than in the last world cup when they were considered a soft touch . " before , costa rica were a fair play team , naive and just interested in attacking , " he recently told reporters .
" this time , everybody 's going to notice the difference . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paulo wanchope still leads the line for costa rica costa rica 's world cup debut performance in italy in 1990 saw them reach the last 16 , shocking scotland and sweden on the way .
guimaraes is optimistic that his team can at least emulate that despite struggling through the qualifying rounds . their main threat will come from paulo wanchope , their all-time leading scorer with 43 goals including eight in the qualifiers .
despite losing some of his pace , the striker has a wealth of international experience garnered from a career spent in the english and spanish leagues . world cup experie n ce from back to fro n t the team 's spine consists of the other remaining members of the class of 2002 ; including defenders harold wallace , luis marin and gilberto martinez , midfield playmaker walter centeno and forward ronald gomez .
but while these players may be well-known , germany will have to be wary of the newcomers alvaro saborio and midfielder carlos hernandez whose inclusion helped turn a near-disastrous qualifying campaign into a ticket to germany with spectacular and important long-range goals . it all adds up to a potentially thrilling game with the whiff of an upset curling around the fifa world cup stadium in munich . germany -lrb- 4-4-2 -rrb- : 1-jens lehmann ; 3-arne friedrich , 21-christoph metzelder , 17-per mertesacker , 16-phillip lahm ; 18-bernd schneider , 8-torsten frings , 13-michael ballack , 7-bastian schweinsteiger ; 20-lukas podolski , 11-miroslav klose costa rica -lrb- 3-5-2 -rrb- : 18-jose francisco porras ; 4-michael umana , 3-luis marin , 12-leonardo gonzalez ; 20-douglas sequeira , 5-gilberto martinez , 8-mauricio solis , 10-walter centeno , 6-danny fonseca ; 11-ronald gomez , 9-paulo wanchope nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de klinsmann : " we 're hungry for the opening game " german national soccer coach jürgen klinsmann said he ca n't wait for the world cup to begin after his team won their last pre-cup game against colombia 3-0 .

the request apparently came shortly after the german elections last autumn , with washington hoping that the new government might do a u-turn from the social democratic-green party coalition 's staunch resistance to the military invasion . but chancellor angela merkel has adhered to the same policy upheld by her predecessor , gerhard schröder , who categorically rejected involvement in the us-led military presence in iraq . german newspapers allege that in government circles , sending troops to the country , even in a training capacity , is seen as the thin end of the wedge . " if we gave them an inch , they would take a mile , " the berliner zeitung quoted one source as saying . germany stays firm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr plays a role in the conflict , but the us wants more speaking after a meeting of nato defense ministers in brussels thursday , jung stressed that despite repeated urging from washington , germany would not be sending the bundeswehr to iraq . in 2004 , nato agreed to a training mission which has so far seen 1,000 iraqi officers trained in the iraqi capital and a further 500 in europe , including at the bundeswehr 's military academy in hamburg .
german soldiers are also training iraqis in the united arab emirates . " germany is contributing to stabilizing the iraqi forces , " emphasized jung in brussels , but reiterated that deploying troops inside the country remained out of the question . modern-day challenges at the meeting , nato defense ministers approved new guidelines to adapt the military alliance to modern-day challenges and provide for the deployment of hundreds of thousands of troops , a spokesman said . the move comes as the alliance is increasingly called upon to conduct missions unlike the purely military operations it has run in the past , like moving aid into quake-hit pakistan or providing training . " nato has gone through very fundamental changes in terms of what it has done and what it is doing , and this will bring the force planning into line with the realities of the 21st century , " said spokesman james appathurai . simultaneous missions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr is increasingly deployed for disaster relief , such as in pakistan in 2005 the so-called " ministerial guidance " will prepare nato to conduct simultaneously two large missions , involving some 60,000 troops , and six smaller ones , comprising up to 30,000 soldiers each . " we no longer need to prepare for one big war .
we have to prepare for , and indeed carry out , a multitude of military operations , " appathurai said . the document will guide the 26 members of the alliance in ways to prepare for nato 's new operations and work with other bodies like the un , the eu and non-governmental organizations . the spokesman said that the allies had also committed " to endeavor " to boost their military spending to two percent of gross domestic product ; a level only achieved currently by seven states . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : troops are n't answer in afghanistan the bundestag extended the german 's army 's mandate in afghanistan in a clear vote on wednesday , but deutsche welle 's nina werkhäuser says more soldiers wo n't solve the country 's problems .

a woman that is like a german clock . "
this , however , is a story about why a german teenager will grow to be a bitter , old man . at the beginning of shakespeare 's poetic comedy love 's labor lost , king ferdinand of spain declares that his court will be devoted to ascetic study .
he lays out the rules of the game by imposing three conditions on his courtiers : no women allowed within a mile of the court , obligatory fasting once a week , and no more than three hours of sleep per night . what a great way to increase concentration ! the bard of avon , despite his literary genius , did n't know that king ferdinand 's experiment - in addition to being destined to fail - was pretty accurately describing the main symptoms of the 21st century 's malaise de mode , the new ascetism , namely internet dependency . an increasing number of people and , especially , all those new kids on the block , are living in a twisted universe in which physical contact with the human species is reduced to a bare minimum .
they inhabit a world in which nourishment comes as an accidental afterthought in between playing the angel of darkness online and looking for an internet hot date whose online profile matches the looks and curves of laura croft .
and they are often stuck in a time warp in which sleep-deprivation and hours in front of the computer screen lead to hallucinatory experiences that in the not so distant past required serious drug abuse . these kids have no idea what the psychedelic seventies were about . tour d 'amour yet despite what the pale-faced cassandras of this world will tell you about humanity 's impeding doom and cultural downfall , the last glimmer of hope has not been entirely extinguished .
for some people , it is still love , in its pure madness and untainted naiveté , that makes the world go around .
or , at least , makes us go around the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when love is concerned , no vehicle is fast enough - especially a bike one such brave defender of stirred up emotions - a lovesick 16-year-old german boy - hopped on his bicycle in hamm , in the western german state of north-rhine westphalia , and cycled more than 200 kilometers -lrb- 120 miles -rrb- overnight to meet a girl he had met on the internet , german police said on wednesday . very little is known about this boy , except that he will probably stay grounded throughout the fifa world cup . what we do know is that he chose not be cynical , although on that fateful night he could 've simply kept chewing on pringles and dinking can after can of cherry coke .
he also could have been a little more cautious , wondering whether his internet sweetheart was , in fact , one of those german tabloid anti-heroes , who - in a state of drunken stupor and , despite the freudian banality of it all - attack their retired neighbors with a bockwurst , sometimes with fatal consequences . like a shakespearean hero who overdosed on love potion , the young german rose above cultural stereotypes and societal prejudices .
he broke the chains of internet dependency .
he took no map , no money or food .
he also did n't ask for his parents ' permission , but ventured out into the unknown , following his heart . a thwarted attempt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a happy ending is never guaranteed unfortunately , there always comes a moment in which the prosaics of life takes over the poetic imagination .
in bremen , some two thirds of the way to hamburg , where he was headed , the boy got lost .
well-behaved and well-brought up as he is , he went to the first police station to ask for directions from kind german policemen , fully trained to make the world feel at home during the soccer championship . big mistake !
german police officers - despite their recent training in exchanging polite remarks and reducing the fear factor - are not exactly the most romantic guys around .
cops rarely get pensive while watching the sunset .
they are into chasing criminals and showing off their guns , not sobbing at the end of sleepless in seattle . the police dutifully informed the boy 's parents , who , in their turn , were anything but amused .
they came to pick him up and take him back home to hamm .
there are unconfirmed reports that some huffing and puffing was involved . the unsuspecting girl in hamburg knew nothing about her suitor 's exertions .
he said he had wanted to surprise her . no wonder kids turn out pessimistic and distrustful when they grow up . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de love-struck german judge turns blind eye to justice wearing black robes and being addressed as " your honor " apparently does n't keep people from doing really , really stupid things , as one love-struck german judge recently proved .

he lays out the rules of the game by imposing three conditions on his courtiers : no women allowed within a mile of the court , obligatory fasting once a week , and no more than three hours of sleep per night . what a great way to increase concentration ! the bard of avon , despite his literary genius , did n't know that king ferdinand 's experiment - in addition to being destined to fail - was pretty accurately describing the main symptoms of the 21st century 's malaise de mode , the new ascetism , namely internet dependency . an increasing number of people and , especially , all those new kids on the block , are living in a twisted universe in which physical contact with the human species is reduced to a bare minimum .
they inhabit a world in which nourishment comes as an accidental afterthought in between playing the angel of darkness online and looking for an internet hot date whose online profile matches the looks and curves of laura croft .
and they are often stuck in a time warp in which sleep-deprivation and hours in front of the computer screen lead to hallucinatory experiences that in the not so distant past required serious drug abuse . these kids have no idea what the psychedelic seventies were about . tour d 'amour yet despite what the pale-faced cassandras of this world will tell you about humanity 's impeding doom and cultural downfall , the last glimmer of hope has not been entirely extinguished .
for some people , it is still love , in its pure madness and untainted naiveté , that makes the world go around .
or , at least , makes us go around the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when love is concerned , no vehicle is fast enough - especially a bike one such brave defender of stirred up emotions - a lovesick 16-year-old german boy - hopped on his bicycle in hamm , in the western german state of north-rhine westphalia , and cycled more than 200 kilometers -lrb- 120 miles -rrb- overnight to meet a girl he had met on the internet , german police said on wednesday . very little is known about this boy , except that he will probably stay grounded throughout the fifa world cup . what we do know is that he chose not be cynical , although on that fateful night he could 've simply kept chewing on pringles and dinking can after can of cherry coke .
he also could have been a little more cautious , wondering whether his internet sweetheart was , in fact , one of those german tabloid anti-heroes , who - in a state of drunken stupor and , despite the freudian banality of it all - attack their retired neighbors with a bockwurst , sometimes with fatal consequences . like a shakespearean hero who overdosed on love potion , the young german rose above cultural stereotypes and societal prejudices .
he broke the chains of internet dependency .
he took no map , no money or food .
he also did n't ask for his parents ' permission , but ventured out into the unknown , following his heart . a thwarted attempt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a happy ending is never guaranteed unfortunately , there always comes a moment in which the prosaics of life takes over the poetic imagination .
in bremen , some two thirds of the way to hamburg , where he was headed , the boy got lost .
well-behaved and well-brought up as he is , he went to the first police station to ask for directions from kind german policemen , fully trained to make the world feel at home during the soccer championship . big mistake !
german police officers - despite their recent training in exchanging polite remarks and reducing the fear factor - are not exactly the most romantic guys around .
cops rarely get pensive while watching the sunset .
they are into chasing criminals and showing off their guns , not sobbing at the end of sleepless in seattle . the police dutifully informed the boy 's parents , who , in their turn , were anything but amused .
they came to pick him up and take him back home to hamm .
there are unconfirmed reports that some huffing and puffing was involved . the unsuspecting girl in hamburg knew nothing about her suitor 's exertions .
he said he had wanted to surprise her . no wonder kids turn out pessimistic and distrustful when they grow up . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de love-struck german judge turns blind eye to justice wearing black robes and being addressed as " your honor " apparently does n't keep people from doing really , really stupid things , as one love-struck german judge recently proved .

the waiting is over .
nearly six years after germany was awarded the 2006 world cup , the globe 's biggest soccer spectacle began in munich friday with the hosts playing costa rica in the first game . since that ecstatic night in zurich on july 6 , 2000 when franz beckenbauer 's glitzy team of soccer legends , celebrities and politicians won the right to stage the tournament , enough column inches have been written on germany 's preparations to stretch from berlin to san jose .
now the real action starts . germany remain confident that their first opponents will not spoil the opening party .
assistant coach joachim löw revealed earlier in the week that the staff and players had studied dvds of the central americans ' warm-up matches and that the belief was that the hosts would get their world cup campaign off to a winning start . " it is the first match and we are a bit nervous but we have done our homework and i think we are in a position to beat costa rica , " löw told reporters .
" if we turn up and show our strengths we will win the match . " germany manager jürgen klinsmann has forced all of his players to watch clips of their opponents and löw claims costa rica were no longer an unknown quantity . " we have collected a lot of information on them by watching dvd clips of league games and international matches , " said löw .
" we know their strengths and weaknesses but of course we will not be discussing them in public . " costa rica n culture , lifestyle as well as tactics studied bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's first game will be no san jose beach at sunset klinsmann seems to have left nothing to chance .
the coach has even had his stars studying costa rica 's culture and lifestyle for clues on how their opponents will play in the opening match .
the german team have been viewing a short film about the friendly central american country , famed for its diverse wildlife and the fact that it has no military forces . " we introduced the players to the country , how the people live there and what their mentality is like , " löw added .
" we 've also seen from games that they 're technically skilful and they love to play beautiful soccer .
that 's a reflection of the national character . " germany captain michael ballack , who will not be playing because of injuries , said everyone had enjoyed the lesson . " it was highly educational , " ballack said .
" we all loved hearing about costa rica and getting an insight into the culture . " while having as much knowledge as possible of their opponents will give the german team a sense of preparation , the real revelations will come on the pitch .
and the hosts will be wary of any surprises . coach kli n sma n n set to start with sta n dard formatio n klinsmann is likely to deploy a standard 4-4-2 formation to counter costa rica coach alexandre guimaraes 's promise that his team are going to abandon their nice guy approach and hit their opponents with a new aggressive form of their renowned free-flowing style . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack scored against colombia but will he start the first game ?
the defensive back four charged with repelling costa rican strikers alvaro saborio and paulo wanchope is expected to be the one which kept colombia at bay in the last test match : arne friedrich , per metesacker , christoph metzelder and philipp lahm , with new number one jens lehmann tending goal behind them . with ballack missing , the midfield will probably feature bernd schneider , torsten frings and bastian schweinsteiger .
the combative tim borowski is most likely to take ballack 's place while sebastian kehl is also on standby . responsible for getting germany 's first goals of the tournament will be striking partnership miroslav klose and lukas podolski . costa rica 's trai n er says his team is n o soft touch costa rica are unlikely to roll over for the hosts just to get the party started on an upbeat note .
coach guimaraes , who was also in charge four years ago in japan / korea , has returned after the unsuccessful tenure of the american steve sampson and has built a new-look team which are tougher and more mature than in the last world cup when they were considered a soft touch . " before , costa rica were a fair play team , naive and just interested in attacking , " he recently told reporters .
" this time , everybody 's going to notice the difference . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paulo wanchope still leads the line for costa rica costa rica 's world cup debut performance in italy in 1990 saw them reach the last 16 , shocking scotland and sweden on the way .
guimaraes is optimistic that his team can at least emulate that despite struggling through the qualifying rounds . their main threat will come from paulo wanchope , their all-time leading scorer with 43 goals including eight in the qualifiers .

but while these players may be well-known , germany will have to be wary of the newcomers alvaro saborio and midfielder carlos hernandez whose inclusion helped turn a near-disastrous qualifying campaign into a ticket to germany with spectacular and important long-range goals . it all adds up to a potentially thrilling game with the whiff of an upset curling around the fifa world cup stadium in munich . germany -lrb- 4-4-2 -rrb- : 1-jens lehmann ; 3-arne friedrich , 21-christoph metzelder , 17-per mertesacker , 16-phillip lahm ; 18-bernd schneider , 8-torsten frings , 13-michael ballack , 7-bastian schweinsteiger ; 20-lukas podolski , 11-miroslav klose costa rica -lrb- 3-5-2 -rrb- : 18-jose francisco porras ; 4-michael umana , 3-luis marin , 12-leonardo gonzalez ; 20-douglas sequeira , 5-gilberto martinez , 8-mauricio solis , 10-walter centeno , 6-danny fonseca ; 11-ronald gomez , 9-paulo wanchope nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de klinsmann : " we 're hungry for the opening game " german national soccer coach jürgen klinsmann said he ca n't wait for the world cup to begin after his team won their last pre-cup game against colombia 3-0 .

the waiting is over .
nearly six years after germany was awarded the 2006 world cup , the globe 's biggest soccer spectacle began in munich friday with the hosts playing costa rica in the first game . since that ecstatic night in zurich on july 6 , 2000 when franz beckenbauer 's glitzy team of soccer legends , celebrities and politicians won the right to stage the tournament , enough column inches have been written on germany 's preparations to stretch from berlin to san jose .
now the real action starts . germany remain confident that their first opponents will not spoil the opening party .
assistant coach joachim löw revealed earlier in the week that the staff and players had studied dvds of the central americans ' warm-up matches and that the belief was that the hosts would get their world cup campaign off to a winning start . " it is the first match and we are a bit nervous but we have done our homework and i think we are in a position to beat costa rica , " löw told reporters .
" if we turn up and show our strengths we will win the match . " germany manager jürgen klinsmann has forced all of his players to watch clips of their opponents and löw claims costa rica were no longer an unknown quantity . " we have collected a lot of information on them by watching dvd clips of league games and international matches , " said löw .
" we know their strengths and weaknesses but of course we will not be discussing them in public . " costa rica n culture , lifestyle as well as tactics studied bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's first game will be no san jose beach at sunset klinsmann seems to have left nothing to chance .
the coach has even had his stars studying costa rica 's culture and lifestyle for clues on how their opponents will play in the opening match .
the german team have been viewing a short film about the friendly central american country , famed for its diverse wildlife and the fact that it has no military forces . " we introduced the players to the country , how the people live there and what their mentality is like , " löw added .
" we 've also seen from games that they 're technically skilful and they love to play beautiful soccer .
that 's a reflection of the national character . " germany captain michael ballack , who will not be playing because of injuries , said everyone had enjoyed the lesson . " it was highly educational , " ballack said .
" we all loved hearing about costa rica and getting an insight into the culture . " while having as much knowledge as possible of their opponents will give the german team a sense of preparation , the real revelations will come on the pitch .
and the hosts will be wary of any surprises . coach kli n sma n n set to start with sta n dard formatio n klinsmann is likely to deploy a standard 4-4-2 formation to counter costa rica coach alexandre guimaraes 's promise that his team are going to abandon their nice guy approach and hit their opponents with a new aggressive form of their renowned free-flowing style . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack scored against colombia but will he start the first game ?
the defensive back four charged with repelling costa rican strikers alvaro saborio and paulo wanchope is expected to be the one which kept colombia at bay in the last test match : arne friedrich , per metesacker , christoph metzelder and philipp lahm , with new number one jens lehmann tending goal behind them . with ballack missing , the midfield will probably feature bernd schneider , torsten frings and bastian schweinsteiger .
the combative tim borowski is most likely to take ballack 's place while sebastian kehl is also on standby . responsible for getting germany 's first goals of the tournament will be striking partnership miroslav klose and lukas podolski . costa rica 's trai n er says his team is n o soft touch costa rica are unlikely to roll over for the hosts just to get the party started on an upbeat note .
coach guimaraes , who was also in charge four years ago in japan / korea , has returned after the unsuccessful tenure of the american steve sampson and has built a new-look team which are tougher and more mature than in the last world cup when they were considered a soft touch . " before , costa rica were a fair play team , naive and just interested in attacking , " he recently told reporters .
" this time , everybody 's going to notice the difference . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paulo wanchope still leads the line for costa rica costa rica 's world cup debut performance in italy in 1990 saw them reach the last 16 , shocking scotland and sweden on the way .
guimaraes is optimistic that his team can at least emulate that despite struggling through the qualifying rounds . their main threat will come from paulo wanchope , their all-time leading scorer with 43 goals including eight in the qualifiers .
despite losing some of his pace , the striker has a wealth of international experience garnered from a career spent in the english and spanish leagues . world cup experie n ce from back to fro n t the team 's spine consists of the other remaining members of the class of 2002 ; including defenders harold wallace , luis marin and gilberto martinez , midfield playmaker walter centeno and forward ronald gomez .
but while these players may be well-known , germany will have to be wary of the newcomers alvaro saborio and midfielder carlos hernandez whose inclusion helped turn a near-disastrous qualifying campaign into a ticket to germany with spectacular and important long-range goals . it all adds up to a potentially thrilling game with the whiff of an upset curling around the fifa world cup stadium in munich . germany -lrb- 4-4-2 -rrb- : 1-jens lehmann ; 3-arne friedrich , 21-christoph metzelder , 17-per mertesacker , 16-phillip lahm ; 18-bernd schneider , 8-torsten frings , 13-michael ballack , 7-bastian schweinsteiger ; 20-lukas podolski , 11-miroslav klose costa rica -lrb- 3-5-2 -rrb- : 18-jose francisco porras ; 4-michael umana , 3-luis marin , 12-leonardo gonzalez ; 20-douglas sequeira , 5-gilberto martinez , 8-mauricio solis , 10-walter centeno , 6-danny fonseca ; 11-ronald gomez , 9-paulo wanchope nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de klinsmann : " we 're hungry for the opening game " german national soccer coach jürgen klinsmann said he ca n't wait for the world cup to begin after his team won their last pre-cup game against colombia 3-0 .

but the prospect of thousands of people flooding into the country with no intention of leaving after the tournament ends is less easy to deal with , although visa restrictions and increased border controls will at least strengthen the host nation 's hand . germany is preparing to suspend the free travel arrangements it has with certain neighbors under the european union 's schengen agreement and reimpose passport checks on the borders with denmark , austria , france , belgium , luxembourg and the netherlands . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will reintroduce border controls with eu neighbors the threat of illegal immigrants entering germany during the world cup is a real one .

the federal government has not loosened its visa requirements for non-eu and non-western countries and as a result , fans of countries like ukraine may face disappointment when trying to enter the country to watch the games unless they can fulfill the visa criteria . german embassies around the world have issued warnings to foreign nationals intending to travel to the world cup that having a ticket for the games will not guarantee them a visa or entry .

the waiting is over .
nearly six years after germany was awarded the 2006 world cup , the globe 's biggest soccer spectacle began in munich friday with the hosts playing costa rica in the first game . since that ecstatic night in zurich on july 6 , 2000 when franz beckenbauer 's glitzy team of soccer legends , celebrities and politicians won the right to stage the tournament , enough column inches have been written on germany 's preparations to stretch from berlin to san jose .
now the real action starts . germany remain confident that their first opponents will not spoil the opening party .
assistant coach joachim löw revealed earlier in the week that the staff and players had studied dvds of the central americans ' warm-up matches and that the belief was that the hosts would get their world cup campaign off to a winning start . " it is the first match and we are a bit nervous but we have done our homework and i think we are in a position to beat costa rica , " löw told reporters .
" if we turn up and show our strengths we will win the match . " germany manager jürgen klinsmann has forced all of his players to watch clips of their opponents and löw claims costa rica were no longer an unknown quantity . " we have collected a lot of information on them by watching dvd clips of league games and international matches , " said löw .
" we know their strengths and weaknesses but of course we will not be discussing them in public . " costa rica n culture , lifestyle as well as tactics studied bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's first game will be no san jose beach at sunset klinsmann seems to have left nothing to chance .
the coach has even had his stars studying costa rica 's culture and lifestyle for clues on how their opponents will play in the opening match .
the german team have been viewing a short film about the friendly central american country , famed for its diverse wildlife and the fact that it has no military forces . " we introduced the players to the country , how the people live there and what their mentality is like , " löw added .
" we 've also seen from games that they 're technically skilful and they love to play beautiful soccer .
that 's a reflection of the national character . " germany captain michael ballack , who will not be playing because of injuries , said everyone had enjoyed the lesson . " it was highly educational , " ballack said .
" we all loved hearing about costa rica and getting an insight into the culture . " while having as much knowledge as possible of their opponents will give the german team a sense of preparation , the real revelations will come on the pitch .
and the hosts will be wary of any surprises . coach kli n sma n n set to start with sta n dard formatio n klinsmann is likely to deploy a standard 4-4-2 formation to counter costa rica coach alexandre guimaraes 's promise that his team are going to abandon their nice guy approach and hit their opponents with a new aggressive form of their renowned free-flowing style . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack scored against colombia but will he start the first game ?
the defensive back four charged with repelling costa rican strikers alvaro saborio and paulo wanchope is expected to be the one which kept colombia at bay in the last test match : arne friedrich , per metesacker , christoph metzelder and philipp lahm , with new number one jens lehmann tending goal behind them . with ballack missing , the midfield will probably feature bernd schneider , torsten frings and bastian schweinsteiger .
the combative tim borowski is most likely to take ballack 's place while sebastian kehl is also on standby . responsible for getting germany 's first goals of the tournament will be striking partnership miroslav klose and lukas podolski . costa rica 's trai n er says his team is n o soft touch costa rica are unlikely to roll over for the hosts just to get the party started on an upbeat note .
coach guimaraes , who was also in charge four years ago in japan / korea , has returned after the unsuccessful tenure of the american steve sampson and has built a new-look team which are tougher and more mature than in the last world cup when they were considered a soft touch . " before , costa rica were a fair play team , naive and just interested in attacking , " he recently told reporters .
" this time , everybody 's going to notice the difference . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paulo wanchope still leads the line for costa rica costa rica 's world cup debut performance in italy in 1990 saw them reach the last 16 , shocking scotland and sweden on the way .
guimaraes is optimistic that his team can at least emulate that despite struggling through the qualifying rounds . their main threat will come from paulo wanchope , their all-time leading scorer with 43 goals including eight in the qualifiers .
despite losing some of his pace , the striker has a wealth of international experience garnered from a career spent in the english and spanish leagues . world cup experie n ce from back to fro n t the team 's spine consists of the other remaining members of the class of 2002 ; including defenders harold wallace , luis marin and gilberto martinez , midfield playmaker walter centeno and forward ronald gomez .
but while these players may be well-known , germany will have to be wary of the newcomers alvaro saborio and midfielder carlos hernandez whose inclusion helped turn a near-disastrous qualifying campaign into a ticket to germany with spectacular and important long-range goals . it all adds up to a potentially thrilling game with the whiff of an upset curling around the fifa world cup stadium in munich . germany -lrb- 4-4-2 -rrb- : 1-jens lehmann ; 3-arne friedrich , 21-christoph metzelder , 17-per mertesacker , 16-phillip lahm ; 18-bernd schneider , 8-torsten frings , 13-michael ballack , 7-bastian schweinsteiger ; 20-lukas podolski , 11-miroslav klose costa rica -lrb- 3-5-2 -rrb- : 18-jose francisco porras ; 4-michael umana , 3-luis marin , 12-leonardo gonzalez ; 20-douglas sequeira , 5-gilberto martinez , 8-mauricio solis , 10-walter centeno , 6-danny fonseca ; 11-ronald gomez , 9-paulo wanchope nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de klinsmann : " we 're hungry for the opening game " german national soccer coach jürgen klinsmann said he ca n't wait for the world cup to begin after his team won their last pre-cup game against colombia 3-0 .

a woman that is like a german clock . "
this , however , is a story about why a german teenager will grow to be a bitter , old man . at the beginning of shakespeare 's poetic comedy love 's labor lost , king ferdinand of spain declares that his court will be devoted to ascetic study .
he lays out the rules of the game by imposing three conditions on his courtiers : no women allowed within a mile of the court , obligatory fasting once a week , and no more than three hours of sleep per night . what a great way to increase concentration ! the bard of avon , despite his literary genius , did n't know that king ferdinand 's experiment - in addition to being destined to fail - was pretty accurately describing the main symptoms of the 21st century 's malaise de mode , the new ascetism , namely internet dependency . an increasing number of people and , especially , all those new kids on the block , are living in a twisted universe in which physical contact with the human species is reduced to a bare minimum .
they inhabit a world in which nourishment comes as an accidental afterthought in between playing the angel of darkness online and looking for an internet hot date whose online profile matches the looks and curves of laura croft .

as hosts and as tournament openers , everyone was expecting a good performance from jürgen klinsmann 's team to get the competition off to a flying start .
costa rica , clear underdogs , were hoping to spoil the party . as it was germany started strongly but were not having it all their own way .
the early exchanges saw possession flow from one team to the other .
that is until the combination of bernd schneider and bastian schweinsteiger released philipp lahm on the left .
the nippy defender cut inside his man and launched a curling , long-range shot that cannoned off the post and into the net with just six minutes on the clock . costa rica soon back on equal terms germany were soon pegged back when a static defense was caught looking for the linesman 's flag and costa rica 's paulo wanchope slipped through the statues to gather the through ball and slip it beyond an incredulous jens lehmann on 12 minutes . the hosts were back in the lead less than five minutes later when schneider and schweinsteiger again combined , with the bayern midfielder threading a ball behind the defense for miroslav klose to score from close range .
in the second half klose added a third when he followed up his own header to put the home team 3-1 ahead with an hour gone . slack defense saved blushes by frings wonder goal not exactly cruising , germany looked safe and they looked like they believed that too when a sleepy back line was again caught out by wanchope who drifted between per mertesacker and christoph metzelder to finish past lehmann with aplomb from six meters out on 72 minutes . costa rica threw everyone forward to get the equalizer but found themselves the victim of a stunning strike from torsten frings with just four minutes remaining .
schweinsteiger stroked the ball into his midfield partner 's path and without breaking stride , frings struck a shot from 40 meters out that flew into the top right hand corner to give germany a 4-2 victory . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hosts plot costa rica 's downfall as world cup kicks off the waiting is over .

a woman that is like a german clock . "
this , however , is a story about why a german teenager will grow to be a bitter , old man . at the beginning of shakespeare 's poetic comedy love 's labor lost , king ferdinand of spain declares that his court will be devoted to ascetic study .
he lays out the rules of the game by imposing three conditions on his courtiers : no women allowed within a mile of the court , obligatory fasting once a week , and no more than three hours of sleep per night . what a great way to increase concentration ! the bard of avon , despite his literary genius , did n't know that king ferdinand 's experiment - in addition to being destined to fail - was pretty accurately describing the main symptoms of the 21st century 's malaise de mode , the new ascetism , namely internet dependency . an increasing number of people and , especially , all those new kids on the block , are living in a twisted universe in which physical contact with the human species is reduced to a bare minimum .
they inhabit a world in which nourishment comes as an accidental afterthought in between playing the angel of darkness online and looking for an internet hot date whose online profile matches the looks and curves of laura croft .
and they are often stuck in a time warp in which sleep-deprivation and hours in front of the computer screen lead to hallucinatory experiences that in the not so distant past required serious drug abuse . these kids have no idea what the psychedelic seventies were about . tour d 'amour yet despite what the pale-faced cassandras of this world will tell you about humanity 's impeding doom and cultural downfall , the last glimmer of hope has not been entirely extinguished .
for some people , it is still love , in its pure madness and untainted naiveté , that makes the world go around .
or , at least , makes us go around the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when love is concerned , no vehicle is fast enough - especially a bike one such brave defender of stirred up emotions - a lovesick 16-year-old german boy - hopped on his bicycle in hamm , in the western german state of north-rhine westphalia , and cycled more than 200 kilometers -lrb- 120 miles -rrb- overnight to meet a girl he had met on the internet , german police said on wednesday . very little is known about this boy , except that he will probably stay grounded throughout the fifa world cup . what we do know is that he chose not be cynical , although on that fateful night he could 've simply kept chewing on pringles and dinking can after can of cherry coke .
he also could have been a little more cautious , wondering whether his internet sweetheart was , in fact , one of those german tabloid anti-heroes , who - in a state of drunken stupor and , despite the freudian banality of it all - attack their retired neighbors with a bockwurst , sometimes with fatal consequences . like a shakespearean hero who overdosed on love potion , the young german rose above cultural stereotypes and societal prejudices .
he broke the chains of internet dependency .
he took no map , no money or food .
he also did n't ask for his parents ' permission , but ventured out into the unknown , following his heart . a thwarted attempt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a happy ending is never guaranteed unfortunately , there always comes a moment in which the prosaics of life takes over the poetic imagination .
in bremen , some two thirds of the way to hamburg , where he was headed , the boy got lost .
well-behaved and well-brought up as he is , he went to the first police station to ask for directions from kind german policemen , fully trained to make the world feel at home during the soccer championship . big mistake !
german police officers - despite their recent training in exchanging polite remarks and reducing the fear factor - are not exactly the most romantic guys around .
cops rarely get pensive while watching the sunset .
they are into chasing criminals and showing off their guns , not sobbing at the end of sleepless in seattle . the police dutifully informed the boy 's parents , who , in their turn , were anything but amused .
they came to pick him up and take him back home to hamm .
there are unconfirmed reports that some huffing and puffing was involved . the unsuspecting girl in hamburg knew nothing about her suitor 's exertions .
he said he had wanted to surprise her . no wonder kids turn out pessimistic and distrustful when they grow up . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de love-struck german judge turns blind eye to justice wearing black robes and being addressed as " your honor " apparently does n't keep people from doing really , really stupid things , as one love-struck german judge recently proved .

others ask whether the hoopla is n't just a bit too much . no matter how you look at the world cup , it 's always close to the official motto of " a time to make friends , " wrote the karlsruhe-based badische neueste nachrichten .
" germany wants to present itself as an open , good-natured , dynamic country , " the paper said .
" if it manages that , the benefits would be immeasurable . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wil the motto " a time to make friends " translate into a real feeling ?
that view is shared by the heilbronner stimme which opined that germany would be a winner - irrespective of how it performed on the pitch - if the official world cup motto translated into a tangible feeling for the fans .
" people expect perfect organization from the germans , but not warmth and joie de vivre .
the world cup offers the chance for an image makeover in a very simple way , " the paper wrote .
" the nicest praise would be the conclusion : germany is different . " the dresden-based sächsische zeitung wrote that the world has noticed that germany is making an effort and is showing off its best side .
" the london times writes that germany is ready for a new image , the dutch are writing friendly things about us and the danes are discovering new success stories about the ' world champs in organization , " ' the paper wrote .

it all adds up to a sated feeling , almost one of reluctance for the ordinary citizen , it said .
" you might say that all this is now a part of modern sport , you ca n't change it .
the opening game should put things in perspective . " " it would be wonderful if modernizer klinsmann is successful and his team cuts a brave figure .

" the world cup does n't solve our problems . " berlin-based daily der tagesspiegel commented that there were several people who are completely annoyed by the whole hype surrounding the event and do n't care about it all .
" a game !

" but there is some comfort for those who ca n't stand the world cup - it 's over in 33 days , " the daily wrote .

the request apparently came shortly after the german elections last autumn , with washington hoping that the new government might do a u-turn from the social democratic-green party coalition 's staunch resistance to the military invasion . but chancellor angela merkel has adhered to the same policy upheld by her predecessor , gerhard schröder , who categorically rejected involvement in the us-led military presence in iraq . german newspapers allege that in government circles , sending troops to the country , even in a training capacity , is seen as the thin end of the wedge . " if we gave them an inch , they would take a mile , " the berliner zeitung quoted one source as saying . germany stays firm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr plays a role in the conflict , but the us wants more speaking after a meeting of nato defense ministers in brussels thursday , jung stressed that despite repeated urging from washington , germany would not be sending the bundeswehr to iraq . in 2004 , nato agreed to a training mission which has so far seen 1,000 iraqi officers trained in the iraqi capital and a further 500 in europe , including at the bundeswehr 's military academy in hamburg .
german soldiers are also training iraqis in the united arab emirates . " germany is contributing to stabilizing the iraqi forces , " emphasized jung in brussels , but reiterated that deploying troops inside the country remained out of the question . modern-day challenges at the meeting , nato defense ministers approved new guidelines to adapt the military alliance to modern-day challenges and provide for the deployment of hundreds of thousands of troops , a spokesman said . the move comes as the alliance is increasingly called upon to conduct missions unlike the purely military operations it has run in the past , like moving aid into quake-hit pakistan or providing training . " nato has gone through very fundamental changes in terms of what it has done and what it is doing , and this will bring the force planning into line with the realities of the 21st century , " said spokesman james appathurai . simultaneous missions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr is increasingly deployed for disaster relief , such as in pakistan in 2005 the so-called " ministerial guidance " will prepare nato to conduct simultaneously two large missions , involving some 60,000 troops , and six smaller ones , comprising up to 30,000 soldiers each . " we no longer need to prepare for one big war .
we have to prepare for , and indeed carry out , a multitude of military operations , " appathurai said . the document will guide the 26 members of the alliance in ways to prepare for nato 's new operations and work with other bodies like the un , the eu and non-governmental organizations . the spokesman said that the allies had also committed " to endeavor " to boost their military spending to two percent of gross domestic product ; a level only achieved currently by seven states . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : troops are n't answer in afghanistan the bundestag extended the german 's army 's mandate in afghanistan in a clear vote on wednesday , but deutsche welle 's nina werkhäuser says more soldiers wo n't solve the country 's problems .

" i am writing to you to spare you and the world from the upcoming sitting of the city council in which they will decide not to give me the prize , " handke said in the letter .
" also to spare myself ... and above all to spare my work , which i do not want to become an endless target for the vulgar insults of party politicians . " he suggested that the council meeting be cancelled and its members sent into nature to breathe fresh air , " for example to have a picnic on the banks of the rhine . " an ongoing controversy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she stood up for her fellow countryman : austrian author and nobel prize winner jelinek handke was named winner of the prize last month , but the düsseldorf city council said last week that it would veto the jury 's decision because of his eulogy for former yugoslav president and alleged war criminal slobodan milosevic . the writer attended milosevic 's funeral in march and lauded him as " a man who defended his people . " the speech also sparked a bitter row in france with the administrator of the paris state theater comedie francaise , marcel bozonnet , canceling the 2007 season of handke 's play " voyage to the sonorous land or the art of asking . " bozonnet 's decision was condemned in art circles in france , where handke lives , and further afield as censorship .
the critics included his german publishers , suhrkamp , and his compatriot , nobel literature laureate elfriede jelinek . handke said he was " disgusted " by the decision and defended himself as merely having sought to counter the dominant , one-sided " polemic " view of the break-up of the former yugoslavia . a sense of deja-vu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : handke 's plays are performed all over the world , but no longer at comedie francaise but when it was announced he should receive the heinrich heine prize , the same debate about whether an artist 's work can be separated from his political views resurged in germany .
local politicians said honoring handke was a slap in the face of those who suffered under milosevic and vowed to deny him the prize , which was due to be awarded on dec .

others ask whether the hoopla is n't just a bit too much . no matter how you look at the world cup , it 's always close to the official motto of " a time to make friends , " wrote the karlsruhe-based badische neueste nachrichten .

" if it manages that , the benefits would be immeasurable . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wil the motto " a time to make friends " translate into a real feeling ?

the world cup offers the chance for an image makeover in a very simple way , " the paper wrote .
" the nicest praise would be the conclusion : germany is different . " the dresden-based sächsische zeitung wrote that the world has noticed that germany is making an effort and is showing off its best side .

as hosts and as tournament openers , everyone was expecting a good performance from jürgen klinsmann 's team to get the competition off to a flying start .
costa rica , clear underdogs , were hoping to spoil the party . as it was germany started strongly but were not having it all their own way .
the early exchanges saw possession flow from one team to the other .
that is until the combination of bernd schneider and bastian schweinsteiger released philipp lahm on the left .
the nippy defender cut inside his man and launched a curling , long-range shot that cannoned off the post and into the net with just six minutes on the clock . costa rica soon back on equal terms germany were soon pegged back when a static defense was caught looking for the linesman 's flag and costa rica 's paulo wanchope slipped through the statues to gather the through ball and slip it beyond an incredulous jens lehmann on 12 minutes . the hosts were back in the lead less than five minutes later when schneider and schweinsteiger again combined , with the bayern midfielder threading a ball behind the defense for miroslav klose to score from close range .
in the second half klose added a third when he followed up his own header to put the home team 3-1 ahead with an hour gone . slack defense saved blushes by frings wonder goal not exactly cruising , germany looked safe and they looked like they believed that too when a sleepy back line was again caught out by wanchope who drifted between per mertesacker and christoph metzelder to finish past lehmann with aplomb from six meters out on 72 minutes . costa rica threw everyone forward to get the equalizer but found themselves the victim of a stunning strike from torsten frings with just four minutes remaining .
schweinsteiger stroked the ball into his midfield partner 's path and without breaking stride , frings struck a shot from 40 meters out that flew into the top right hand corner to give germany a 4-2 victory . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hosts plot costa rica 's downfall as world cup kicks off the waiting is over .

for southampton , the problem could soon get worse when the city centre 's last purpose-built unit of its kind shuts its doors at the end of june .
the bourne road service has five beds for drug and alcohol detoxification patients and ten aftercare beds .
people with drug and alcohol addictions have been referred there since 1989 , with their treatment funded by local drug action teams , pcts and social services . "
it 's very regrettable but in the end it 's a business decision " simon mantle once at bourne road they are offered a seven to 14-day detoxification programme followed by six weeks of aftercare .
still , this can only cater for a very small number of addicts who are in need of treatment .
simon mantle , chief executive of two saints housing association , which runs the service , told the bbc news website that there is a long waiting list of people hoping to get a place on the programme .
but since 2002 , the association has been facing a loss of £ 344,000 , and a decision to close the service was made last month .
private treatment mr mantle said : " it 's very regrettable but in the end it 's a business decision .
it was n't sustainable in the long run . "
he said the only option for people in the city will now be to travel to the new forest , wiltshire or portsmouth , to go into hospital or receive support to battle their addiction at home .
for those people who can afford to pay for addiction treatment , or who have private health insurance , there are other options available .
the priory hospital in marchwood , near southampton , is more often associated with its celebrity clientele than its addiction treatment programme .
dr simon kelly , consultant psychiatrist at the priory , said celebrities only make up about 1 % of the patients , who fund the treatment - which starts at £ 105 for an hour - themselves or through private medical insurance .
the private clinic offers a substantial 28-day in-patient programme , which comes with up to 12 months aftercare and a price tag on £ 15,232 .
the success rate on the priory programme is claimed to be about 70 % .
" success " is judged to be the number of patients still abstinent after one year , according to dr kelly .
" if you get to one year , you 're likely to get to five years , " he explained .
mental breakdown mike , a 50-year-old it manager , came to the priory nine and a half months ago .
he had spent 30 years denying he was an alcoholic , but when he had a mental breakdown and shut himself inside his hotel room during a business trip he knew he had to seek help . "
i do n't think there is enough -lsb- help for addicts -rsb- and i think the problem is just going to get worse " mike " i did n't think i was an alcoholic because i was n't drinking every day .
i did n't think i had a problem but i was a binge drinker , " he said .
" if i picked up a glass of wine i did n't know if it was going to be three glasses or three bottles .
" i did n't want to come here .
i hated it here and did n't want to stay - i 've never been so miserable .
but after a few days something changed . "
mike - not his real name - realised going through with the programme was his only real choice .
" then , i did n't want to leave because i felt safe , " he said .
" if i had n't -lsb- gone to the priory -rsb- it would have just got worse .
i most certainly would n't be back at work . "
vital lifeline mike has two broken marriages behind him because of his addiction , but at last , he says he is starting to enjoy life again after spending 30 years of it " drunk , in fear and emotional turmoil " .
before being admitted to the priory he had counselling and had gone to alcoholism meetings but that never worked on its own .
he says it was only the residential detoxification option that saved him .
" i do n't think there is enough -lsb- help for addicts -rsb- and i think the problem is just going to get worse . "
and with the closure of a unit that has been a vital lifeline to those addicts who can not afford private treatment , it seems the future looks uncertain for those most in need .
mr mantle said : " sadly , there are no plans in the foreseeable future for something like this in the city . "

for southampton , the problem could soon get worse when the city centre 's last purpose-built unit of its kind shuts its doors at the end of june .
the bourne road service has five beds for drug and alcohol detoxification patients and ten aftercare beds .
people with drug and alcohol addictions have been referred there since 1989 , with their treatment funded by local drug action teams , pcts and social services .
it 's very regrettable but in the end it 's a business decision simon mantle once at bourne road they are offered a seven to 14-day detoxification programme followed by six weeks of aftercare .
still , this can only cater for a very small number of addicts who are in need of treatment .
simon mantle , chief executive of two saints housing association , which runs the service , told the bbc news website that there is a long waiting list of people hoping to get a place on the programme .
but since 2002 , the association has been facing a loss of £ 344,000 , and a decision to close the service was made last month .
private treatment mr mantle said : " it 's very regrettable but in the end it 's a business decision .
it was n't sustainable in the long run . "
he said the only option for people in the city will now be to travel to the new forest , wiltshire or portsmouth , to go into hospital or receive support to battle their addiction at home .
for those people who can afford to pay for addiction treatment , or who have private health insurance , there are other options available .
the priory hospital in marchwood , near southampton , is more often associated with its celebrity clientele than its addiction treatment programme .
the addiction treatment programme at the priory lasts for 12 months dr simon kelly , consultant psychiatrist at the priory , said celebrities only make up about 1 % of the patients , who fund the treatment - which starts at £ 105 for an hour - themselves or through private medical insurance .
the private clinic offers a substantial 28-day in-patient programme , which comes with up to 12 months aftercare and a price tag on £ 15,232 .
the success rate on the priory programme is claimed to be about 70 % .
" success " is judged to be the number of patients still abstinent after one year , according to dr kelly .
" if you get to one year , you 're likely to get to five years , " he explained .
mental breakdown mike , a 50-year-old it manager , came to the priory nine and a half months ago .
he had spent 30 years denying he was an alcoholic , but when he had a mental breakdown and shut himself inside his hotel room during a business trip he knew he had to seek help .
i do n't think there is enough -lsb- help for addicts -rsb- and i think the problem is just going to get worse mike " i did n't think i was an alcoholic because i was n't drinking every day .
i did n't think i had a problem but i was a binge drinker , " he said .
" if i picked up a glass of wine i did n't know if it was going to be three glasses or three bottles .
" i did n't want to come here .
i hated it here and did n't want to stay - i 've never been so miserable .
but after a few days something changed . "
mike - not his real name - realised going through with the programme was his only real choice .
" then , i did n't want to leave because i felt safe , " he said .
" if i had n't -lsb- gone to the priory -rsb- it would have just got worse .
i most certainly would n't be back at work . "
vital lifeline mike has two broken marriages behind him because of his addiction , but at last , he says he is starting to enjoy life again after spending 30 years of it " drunk , in fear and emotional turmoil " .
before being admitted to the priory he had counselling and had gone to alcoholism meetings but that never worked on its own .
he says it was only the residential detoxification option that saved him .
" i do n't think there is enough -lsb- help for addicts -rsb- and i think the problem is just going to get worse . "
and with the closure of a unit that has been a vital lifeline to those addicts who can not afford private treatment , it seems the future looks uncertain for those most in need .
mr mantle said : " sadly , there are no plans in the foreseeable future for something like this in the city . "

people with drug and alcohol addictions have been referred there since 1989 , with their treatment funded by local drug action teams , pcts and social services .
it 's very regrettable but in the end it 's a business decision simon mantle once at bourne road they are offered a seven to 14-day detoxification programme followed by six weeks of aftercare .
still , this can only cater for a very small number of addicts who are in need of treatment .
simon mantle , chief executive of two saints housing association , which runs the service , told the bbc news website that there is a long waiting list of people hoping to get a place on the programme .
but since 2002 , the association has been facing a loss of £ 344,000 , and a decision to close the service was made last month .
private treatment mr mantle said : " it 's very regrettable but in the end it 's a business decision .
it was n't sustainable in the long run . "
he said the only option for people in the city will now be to travel to the new forest , wiltshire or portsmouth , to go into hospital or receive support to battle their addiction at home .
for those people who can afford to pay for addiction treatment , or who have private health insurance , there are other options available .
the priory hospital in marchwood , near southampton , is more often associated with its celebrity clientele than its addiction treatment programme .
the addiction treatment programme at the priory lasts for 12 months dr simon kelly , consultant psychiatrist at the priory , said celebrities only make up about 1 % of the patients , who fund the treatment - which starts at £ 105 for an hour - themselves or through private medical insurance .
the private clinic offers a substantial 28-day in-patient programme , which comes with up to 12 months aftercare and a price tag on £ 15,232 .
the success rate on the priory programme is claimed to be about 70 % .
" success " is judged to be the number of patients still abstinent after one year , according to dr kelly .
" if you get to one year , you 're likely to get to five years , " he explained .
mental breakdown mike , a 50-year-old it manager , came to the priory nine and a half months ago .
he had spent 30 years denying he was an alcoholic , but when he had a mental breakdown and shut himself inside his hotel room during a business trip he knew he had to seek help .
i do n't think there is enough -lsb- help for addicts -rsb- and i think the problem is just going to get worse mike " i did n't think i was an alcoholic because i was n't drinking every day .
i did n't think i had a problem but i was a binge drinker , " he said .
" if i picked up a glass of wine i did n't know if it was going to be three glasses or three bottles .
" i did n't want to come here .
i hated it here and did n't want to stay - i 've never been so miserable .
but after a few days something changed . "
mike - not his real name - realised going through with the programme was his only real choice .
" then , i did n't want to leave because i felt safe , " he said .
" if i had n't -lsb- gone to the priory -rsb- it would have just got worse .
i most certainly would n't be back at work . "
vital lifeline mike has two broken marriages behind him because of his addiction , but at last , he says he is starting to enjoy life again after spending 30 years of it " drunk , in fear and emotional turmoil " .
before being admitted to the priory he had counselling and had gone to alcoholism meetings but that never worked on its own .
he says it was only the residential detoxification option that saved him .
" i do n't think there is enough -lsb- help for addicts -rsb- and i think the problem is just going to get worse . "
and with the closure of a unit that has been a vital lifeline to those addicts who can not afford private treatment , it seems the future looks uncertain for those most in need .
mr mantle said : " sadly , there are no plans in the foreseeable future for something like this in the city . "

i do n't think there is enough -lsb- help for addicts -rsb- and i think the problem is just going to get worse mike " i did n't think i was an alcoholic because i was n't drinking every day .
i did n't think i had a problem but i was a binge drinker , " he said .
" if i picked up a glass of wine i did n't know if it was going to be three glasses or three bottles .
" i did n't want to come here .
i hated it here and did n't want to stay - i 've never been so miserable .
but after a few days something changed . "
mike - not his real name - realised going through with the programme was his only real choice .
" then , i did n't want to leave because i felt safe , " he said .
" if i had n't -lsb- gone to the priory -rsb- it would have just got worse .
i most certainly would n't be back at work . "
vital lifeline mike has two broken marriages behind him because of his addiction , but at last , he says he is starting to enjoy life again after spending 30 years of it " drunk , in fear and emotional turmoil " .
before being admitted to the priory he had counselling and had gone to alcoholism meetings but that never worked on its own .
he says it was only the residential detoxification option that saved him .
" i do n't think there is enough -lsb- help for addicts -rsb- and i think the problem is just going to get worse . "
and with the closure of a unit that has been a vital lifeline to those addicts who can not afford private treatment , it seems the future looks uncertain for those most in need .
mr mantle said : " sadly , there are no plans in the foreseeable future for something like this in the city . "

for southampton , the problem could soon get worse when the city centre 's last purpose-built unit of its kind shuts its doors at the end of june .
the bourne road service has five beds for drug and alcohol detoxification patients and ten aftercare beds .
people with drug and alcohol addictions have been referred there since 1989 , with their treatment funded by local drug action teams , pcts and social services .
it 's very regrettable but in the end it 's a business decision simon mantle once at bourne road they are offered a seven to 14-day detoxification programme followed by six weeks of aftercare .
still , this can only cater for a very small number of addicts who are in need of treatment .
simon mantle , chief executive of two saints housing association , which runs the service , told the bbc news website that there is a long waiting list of people hoping to get a place on the programme .
but since 2002 , the association has been facing a loss of £ 344,000 , and a decision to close the service was made last month .
private treatment mr mantle said : " it 's very regrettable but in the end it 's a business decision .
it was n't sustainable in the long run . "
he said the only option for people in the city will now be to travel to the new forest , wiltshire or portsmouth , to go into hospital or receive support to battle their addiction at home .
for those people who can afford to pay for addiction treatment , or who have private health insurance , there are other options available .
the priory hospital in marchwood , near southampton , is more often associated with its celebrity clientele than its addiction treatment programme .
the addiction treatment programme at the priory lasts for 12 months dr simon kelly , consultant psychiatrist at the priory , said celebrities only make up about 1 % of the patients , who fund the treatment - which starts at £ 105 for an hour - themselves or through private medical insurance .
the private clinic offers a substantial 28-day in-patient programme , which comes with up to 12 months aftercare and a price tag on £ 15,232 .
the success rate on the priory programme is claimed to be about 70 % .
" success " is judged to be the number of patients still abstinent after one year , according to dr kelly .
" if you get to one year , you 're likely to get to five years , " he explained .

" we are in all different markets and countries .
severstal is still limited to russia and has a very small presence in the usa .
" we are convinced that our offer makes the best value for arcelor shareholders . "
arcelor and severstal were not immediately available for comment .
mittal first launched its hostile bid for arcelor in january .
arcelor 's current intention to merge with severstal would give it 68 % of the new firm , leaving 32 % in the hands of severstal 's owner , billionaire alexey mordashov .
mr mordashov is said to have close ties with the kremlin .

on your browser you may have a pop-up blocker that stops the irritating adverts imposing themselves between you and what you want to look at .
but this does not cover all the possible ways that the bad guys are trying to catch you out .
increasingly the makers of adware , spyware and viruses are using ordinary-looking websites as launch pads for their malicious creations that try to compromise your windows computer when you visit .
safety first a survey released in mid-may revealed the dangers inherent in just poking around the web .
on average , between 4 % and 6 % of the sites found during common searches were classified as dangerous .
the research highlighted that some searches were far more dangerous .
for instance , 64 % of the sites found when users went looking for " free screensavers " had security problems .
the search results were analysed using the site advisor add-on for the internet explorer and firefox web browsers that flags up dangerous websites .
one other way that web users can see at a glance if a site is nice or nasty is by using the scandoo website created by british firm scansafe .
eldar tuvey , scansafe managing director , said the idea for scandoo came about because of questions from friends and relatives asking how they could know if sites they were visiting were safe .
via scandoo , users can type in search terms as they usually would but instead of getting back raw results , the sites are ranked as to how safe they are .
sites are flagged with a variety of symbols to denote those that are safe , or if they harbour adware and spyware or content some would consider suitable only for adult audiences .
staying safe online use anti-spyware and anti-virus programs on at least a weekly basis update anti-virus and spyware products install a firewall and make sure it is switched on make sure updates to your operating system are installed take time to educate yourself and family about the risks monitor your computer and stay alert to threats " we went through search engines because that 's the gateway to the web itself , " said mr tuvey .
he added that scandoo was still very much under development and may not yet flag up all malicious sites as such .
" part of the problem is the lack of consistent definitions in the industry about what is adware exactly , " he said .
" some scanners pick up potentially unwanted programs as adware and some do n't . "
but , he added , scandoo had a feedback system through which users could let scansafe know if a site cited as benign was risky .
he said scansafe was now working on ways to get scandoo working with the toolbars many people have added to their net browsers .
admin rights organisations such as auction site ebay , web monitoring firm netcraft and many others produce toolbars that warn if a user strays on to a site known to be used , for example , by phishing gangs .
netcraft has now collected information about more than 32,000 websites considered to be dangerous .
steve lamb , technical security advisor for microsoft in the uk , said one good way to limit the risk of falling victim to malicious code on websites was to set up separate named accounts for each user of a windows computer .
each account should have " limited administrative privileges " he said , a choice made when the account is first created .
" this means that they can not deliberately change the set-up of the machine , " said mr lamb .
scandoo acts as a wrapper for web searches this , he said , should stop people inadvertently downloading and installing the little programs that can lead to a computer becoming infested with spyware and adware .
mr lamb also pointed people towards the webpages run by the uk 's get safe online project which has advice on how to browse the web safely .
there are other places that web users can turn to for help in separating good software from bad .
but users need to be aware that there are lots of fake computer security products available on the internet - many of which are created by those keen to ensure only the ads they want users to see pop up in front of them .

on your browser you may have a pop-up blocker that stops the irritating adverts imposing themselves between you and what you want to look at .
but this does not cover all the possible ways that the bad guys are trying to catch you out .
increasingly the makers of adware , spyware and viruses are using ordinary-looking websites as launch pads for their malicious creations that try to compromise your windows computer when you visit .
safety first a survey released in mid-may revealed the dangers inherent in just poking around the web .
on average , between 4 % and 6 % of the sites found during common searches were classified as dangerous .
the research highlighted that some searches were far more dangerous .
for instance , 64 % of the sites found when users went looking for " free screensavers " had security problems .
the search results were analysed using the site advisor add-on for the internet explorer and firefox web browsers that flags up dangerous websites .
one other way that web users can see at a glance if a site is nice or nasty is by using the scandoo website created by british firm scansafe .
eldar tuvey , scansafe managing director , said the idea for scandoo came about because of questions from friends and relatives asking how they could know if sites they were visiting were safe .
via scandoo , users can type in search terms as they usually would but instead of getting back raw results , the sites are ranked as to how safe they are .
sites are flagged with a variety of symbols to denote those that are safe , or if they harbour adware and spyware or content some would consider suitable only for adult audiences .
staying safe online use anti-spyware and anti-virus programs on at least a weekly basis update anti-virus and spyware products install a firewall and make sure it is switched on make sure updates to your operating system are installed take time to educate yourself and family about the risks monitor your computer and stay alert to threats " we went through search engines because that 's the gateway to the web itself , " said mr tuvey .
he added that scandoo was still very much under development and may not yet flag up all malicious sites as such .
" part of the problem is the lack of consistent definitions in the industry about what is adware exactly , " he said .
" some scanners pick up potentially unwanted programs as adware and some do n't . "
but , he added , scandoo had a feedback system through which users could let scansafe know if a site cited as benign was risky .
he said scansafe was now working on ways to get scandoo working with the toolbars many people have added to their net browsers .
admin rights organisations such as auction site ebay , web monitoring firm netcraft and many others produce toolbars that warn if a user strays on to a site known to be used , for example , by phishing gangs .
netcraft has now collected information about more than 32,000 websites considered to be dangerous .
steve lamb , technical security advisor for microsoft in the uk , said one good way to limit the risk of falling victim to malicious code on websites was to set up separate named accounts for each user of a windows computer .
each account should have " limited administrative privileges " he said , a choice made when the account is first created .
" this means that they can not deliberately change the set-up of the machine , " said mr lamb .
scandoo acts as a wrapper for web searches this , he said , should stop people inadvertently downloading and installing the little programs that can lead to a computer becoming infested with spyware and adware .
mr lamb also pointed people towards the webpages run by the uk 's get safe online project which has advice on how to browse the web safely .
there are other places that web users can turn to for help in separating good software from bad .
but users need to be aware that there are lots of fake computer security products available on the internet - many of which are created by those keen to ensure only the ads they want users to see pop up in front of them .

he added that scandoo was still very much under development and may not yet flag up all malicious sites as such .
" part of the problem is the lack of consistent definitions in the industry about what is adware exactly , " he said .
" some scanners pick up potentially unwanted programs as adware and some do n't . "
but , he added , scandoo had a feedback system through which users could let scansafe know if a site cited as benign was risky .
he said scansafe was now working on ways to get scandoo working with the toolbars many people have added to their net browsers .
admin rights organisations such as auction site ebay , web monitoring firm netcraft and many others produce toolbars that warn if a user strays on to a site known to be used , for example , by phishing gangs .
netcraft has now collected information about more than 32,000 websites considered to be dangerous .
steve lamb , technical security advisor for microsoft in the uk , said one good way to limit the risk of falling victim to malicious code on websites was to set up separate named accounts for each user of a windows computer .
each account should have " limited administrative privileges " he said , a choice made when the account is first created .
" this means that they can not deliberately change the set-up of the machine , " said mr lamb .
scandoo acts as a wrapper for web searches this , he said , should stop people inadvertently downloading and installing the little programs that can lead to a computer becoming infested with spyware and adware .
mr lamb also pointed people towards the webpages run by the uk 's get safe online project which has advice on how to browse the web safely .
there are other places that web users can turn to for help in separating good software from bad .
but users need to be aware that there are lots of fake computer security products available on the internet - many of which are created by those keen to ensure only the ads they want users to see pop up in front of them .
anti-spyware campaigner suzi turner maintains a list of so-called " rogue anti-spyware products " that is worth consulting to see if a security program is what it claims to be .
more in-depth information can be found on the website of the stop badware organisation which analyses some of the spyware and adware found online .
backed by google , sun , the oxford internet institute and the berkman center for internet and society at harvard , the campaign aims to name and shame those firms that use underhand methods to get malicious software on to users ' pcs .
at the same time , internet service firms are starting to clean up some traffic before it gets to their customers .
for instance one of bt 's broadband packages comes with a range of security software and countermeasures included , provided you are willing to pay a little extra .
the good news is that computer security is getting harder to avoid and excuses for not protecting yourself and family online are becoming harder to find .

safety first a survey released in mid-may revealed the dangers inherent in just poking around the web .
on average , between 4 % and 6 % of the sites found during common searches were classified as dangerous .
the research highlighted that some searches were far more dangerous .
for instance , 64 % of the sites found when users went looking for " free screensavers " had security problems .
the search results were analysed using the site advisor add-on for the internet explorer and firefox web browsers that flags up dangerous websites .
one other way that web users can see at a glance if a site is nice or nasty is by using the scandoo website created by british firm scansafe .
eldar tuvey , scansafe managing director , said the idea for scandoo came about because of questions from friends and relatives asking how they could know if sites they were visiting were safe .

on your browser you may have a pop-up blocker that stops the irritating adverts imposing themselves between you and what you want to look at .
but this does not cover all the possible ways that the bad guys are trying to catch you out .
increasingly the makers of adware , spyware and viruses are using ordinary-looking websites as launch pads for their malicious creations that try to compromise your windows computer when you visit .
safety first a survey released in mid-may revealed the dangers inherent in just poking around the web .
on average , between 4 % and 6 % of the sites found during common searches were classified as dangerous .
the research highlighted that some searches were far more dangerous .
for instance , 64 % of the sites found when users went looking for " free screensavers " had security problems .
the search results were analysed using the site advisor add-on for the internet explorer and firefox web browsers that flags up dangerous websites .
one other way that web users can see at a glance if a site is nice or nasty is by using the scandoo website created by british firm scansafe .
eldar tuvey , scansafe managing director , said the idea for scandoo came about because of questions from friends and relatives asking how they could know if sites they were visiting were safe .
via scandoo , users can type in search terms as they usually would but instead of getting back raw results , the sites are ranked as to how safe they are .
sites are flagged with a variety of symbols to denote those that are safe , or if they harbour adware and spyware or content some would consider suitable only for adult audiences .
staying safe online use anti-spyware and anti-virus programs on at least a weekly basis update anti-virus and spyware products install a firewall and make sure it is switched on make sure updates to your operating system are installed take time to educate yourself and family about the risks monitor your computer and stay alert to threats " we went through search engines because that 's the gateway to the web itself , " said mr tuvey .
he added that scandoo was still very much under development and may not yet flag up all malicious sites as such .
" part of the problem is the lack of consistent definitions in the industry about what is adware exactly , " he said .
" some scanners pick up potentially unwanted programs as adware and some do n't . "
but , he added , scandoo had a feedback system through which users could let scansafe know if a site cited as benign was risky .
he said scansafe was now working on ways to get scandoo working with the toolbars many people have added to their net browsers .
admin rights organisations such as auction site ebay , web monitoring firm netcraft and many others produce toolbars that warn if a user strays on to a site known to be used , for example , by phishing gangs .
netcraft has now collected information about more than 32,000 websites considered to be dangerous .
steve lamb , technical security advisor for microsoft in the uk , said one good way to limit the risk of falling victim to malicious code on websites was to set up separate named accounts for each user of a windows computer .
each account should have " limited administrative privileges " he said , a choice made when the account is first created .
" this means that they can not deliberately change the set-up of the machine , " said mr lamb .
scandoo acts as a wrapper for web searches this , he said , should stop people inadvertently downloading and installing the little programs that can lead to a computer becoming infested with spyware and adware .
mr lamb also pointed people towards the webpages run by the uk 's get safe online project which has advice on how to browse the web safely .
there are other places that web users can turn to for help in separating good software from bad .
but users need to be aware that there are lots of fake computer security products available on the internet - many of which are created by those keen to ensure only the ads they want users to see pop up in front of them .
anti-spyware campaigner suzi turner maintains a list of so-called " rogue anti-spyware products " that is worth consulting to see if a security program is what it claims to be .
more in-depth information can be found on the website of the stop badware organisation which analyses some of the spyware and adware found online .
backed by google , sun , the oxford internet institute and the berkman center for internet and society at harvard , the campaign aims to name and shame those firms that use underhand methods to get malicious software on to users ' pcs .
at the same time , internet service firms are starting to clean up some traffic before it gets to their customers .
for instance one of bt 's broadband packages comes with a range of security software and countermeasures included , provided you are willing to pay a little extra .
the good news is that computer security is getting harder to avoid and excuses for not protecting yourself and family online are becoming harder to find .

connor bogues died after the greenhill hit rocks and sank the words are spoken quietly and modestly as he sits on a grass bank next to the river bann in portadown .
" these people have done everything they possibly could to bring my brother back and now i want to do the same , give hope to other families who may need it in the future " .
at 18 , barry bogues is a happy-go-lucky young man , with a bright smile .
this week , the brother of the missing ardglass fisherman connor bogues , 25 , completed his open water diving certificate .
it is something that will enable him to dive alongside the members of the boyne rescue and recovery service .
last january , his oldest brother was one of three men on board the greenhill , which hit rocks and sank off the coast of ardglass .
the skipper survived and was treated for hypothermia and the body of the other crewman , donal gibson , was later recovered .
the searches for connor 's body were carried out mostly by the local community as well as divers from the boyne rescue and recovery service .
the body of mr bogues has still not been found last february , relatives of connor bogues said they felt let down by the authorities , including the police .
despite freezing conditions , stormy seas and poor visibility , volunteers from the boyne rescue and recovery service continued to give up their free time to search for the body of connor bogues .
the group is formed of volunteer divers from across the island who come from all walks of life .
in january 2005 they also helped with the search for the killough teenager jordan murdoch .
but last week , after more than 500 dives and 200 hours spent combing the sea bed , the boyne rescue team was forced to call off the search .
" it is the first time in the history of the organisation that we 've had to walk away from a search before a loved one is returned to their family , " thomas daly , vice-chairperson of the boyne rescue said .
hurt " going to his family and saying sorry was the hardest thing many of us have had to do .
it hurt and to be honest it still really hurts . "
this weekend , the boyne rescue and recovery will officially extend its northern ireland operation by partially amalgamating services with dive ni , based in portadown .
since the ardglass tragedy , some 20 divers from northern ireland have joined the group .
" we 've always worked across the island .
but the extension of the network will enable us to react quicker and more efficiently " , says thomas daly .
barry bogues during his diving training in the meantime , the group has warmly welcomed barry bogues as a new member .
" barry is a confident and focused diver .
but he also has another advantage " , says dave freeburn , the portadown-based diving officer who put him through his training .
" because of the loss of his brother , he can understand the emotional side of what people we work with are going through and that in itself is something which is invaluable " .
meanwhile , the family says they have not given hope that the sea will one day return connor 's body and have thanked the communities in ardglass and ballynahinch for their support .
a special tribute weekend is to be paid to the two fishermen who lost their lives on saturday , 10 june in the pleasure gardens in portadown .

this week , the brother of the missing ardglass fisherman connor bogues , 25 , completed his open water diving certificate .
it is something that will enable him to dive alongside the members of the boyne rescue and recovery service .
last january , his oldest brother was one of three men on board the greenhill , which hit rocks and sank off the coast of ardglass .
the skipper survived and was treated for hypothermia and the body of the other crewman , donal gibson , was later recovered .
the searches for connor 's body were carried out mostly by the local community as well as divers from the boyne rescue and recovery service .
the body of mr bogues has still not been found last february , relatives of connor bogues said they felt let down by the authorities , including the police .
despite freezing conditions , stormy seas and poor visibility , volunteers from the boyne rescue and recovery service continued to give up their free time to search for the body of connor bogues .
the group is formed of volunteer divers from across the island who come from all walks of life .
in january 2005 they also helped with the search for the killough teenager jordan murdoch .
but last week , after more than 500 dives and 200 hours spent combing the sea bed , the boyne rescue team was forced to call off the search .
" it is the first time in the history of the organisation that we 've had to walk away from a search before a loved one is returned to their family , " thomas daly , vice-chairperson of the boyne rescue said .
hurt " going to his family and saying sorry was the hardest thing many of us have had to do .
it hurt and to be honest it still really hurts . "
this weekend , the boyne rescue and recovery will officially extend its northern ireland operation by partially amalgamating services with dive ni , based in portadown .
since the ardglass tragedy , some 20 divers from northern ireland have joined the group .
" we 've always worked across the island .
but the extension of the network will enable us to react quicker and more efficiently " , says thomas daly .
barry bogues during his diving training in the meantime , the group has warmly welcomed barry bogues as a new member .
" barry is a confident and focused diver .
but he also has another advantage " , says dave freeburn , the portadown-based diving officer who put him through his training .
" because of the loss of his brother , he can understand the emotional side of what people we work with are going through and that in itself is something which is invaluable " .
meanwhile , the family says they have not given hope that the sea will one day return connor 's body and have thanked the communities in ardglass and ballynahinch for their support .
a special tribute weekend is to be paid to the two fishermen who lost their lives on saturday , 10 june in the pleasure gardens in portadown .
