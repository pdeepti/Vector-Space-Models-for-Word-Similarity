with her new book , josiane kruger has broken the silence . while growing up in a village in eastern france , josiane kruger always felt a bit different from the other children .
she didn ’ t have a father at home , only a mother and grandmother .
in her autobiography , which was released thursday in france , kruger recalls when her schoolmates called her a " boche " - the french swear word for a german . finally kruger 's grandmother told her the truth : her father had been a german soldier .
before her birth , he was transferred from france to the russian front and had not been heard from since . " my grandmother often told me what a lovely couple my parents were and how nice and good-looking my father was , " said kruger , 56 years after learning the truth about her father .
" i could n't understand why i should be ashamed of him . " nevertheless , for the majority of kruger 's village and for much of france , her father was a member of the occupying forces . covering up a " mistake " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " born of forbidden love " by josiane kruger was released this week in france at that time , the vichy regime instituted the right to anonymous birth as a way of implicitly encouraging french women to cover up their " misconduct " with german soldiers .
their babies could be given up for adoption immediately after they were born and never learned the names of their birth parents . after the war ended , anger grew in france over the occupation .
collaborators became targets of revenge , including those french women who had had relationships with germans .
they were bullied , their hair was shorn , they were driven naked through villages and forced to turn their children over to orphanages . though kruger and her mother were not made to endure this treatment , she suffered in other ways : " during my youth , i lacked everything , especially love and recognition . " she was 14 when she discovered her father 's address and secretly wrote him a letter .
after visiting for three days , he disappeared from her life again , this time for good . mijo panier , whom kruger met and befriended while doing research for her book , first met her german father at the age of 62 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : allied troops successfull invaded the normandy coast on june 6 , 1944 " this picture of me and my father is the most beautiful picture i have , " she said , holding up the photograph .
" everyone says we look alike and i 'm most proud of that . " a rare happy ending through kruger only saw her father once , his wife and two sons have become like family to her .
most stories of other wartime children do n't have such a happy ending .
that the adult children have started searching for their lost fathers is only a recent development . four years ago , a television documentary brought the topic of " war children " into the public eye and triggered an avalanche of inquiries at the wehrmacht archive in berlin . kruger , panier and more than 170 other wartime children have gotten together and organized a kind of support group for people with similar histories called l 'amicale nationale des enfants de la guerre .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder -lrb- r -rrb- was invited to the celebration of the 60th anniversary of normandy " i often get telephone calls from people who tell me quietly that they belong to this group but do n't want their families to find out , " said kruger .
" they 're afraid of being rejected . " on the 60th anniversary of the d-day invasion of normandy , kruger wrote to claude chirac , french president jacques chirac 's daughter and pr manager , asking her to take advantage of the occasion to rehabilitate the enfants maudits or " cursed children " of the war . it was in that year , 2004 , gerhard schröder became the first german chancellor to be invited to the anniversary celebration of the allied landing in normandy , a symbolic step in french-german reconciliation . taboo topic contradicts national legend an answer never came from chirac .
kruger suspects that the existence of the wartime children is seen as a threat to the national legend that all french citizens fought against the germans during the war . " our parents are accused of making a serious mistake , " she said .
" that 's nonsense - they loved each other and that 's all .

that 's what drives him to produce quality broadcasting aimed at germany 's turkish community . a station id jingle emanates from the big-screen tv in the entrance of the otherwise quiet , container-like building that is home to kanal avrupa , or " channel europe . "
it 's the summer break , but despite the lull , seran sargur is a busy man . the 27-year-old is the co-founder of europe 's first german-turkish tv station , a business idea that was fuelled by sargur 's first-hand experience as the son of turkish immigrants in germany .
he seems as if he is constantly juggling several tasks simultaneously .
with his goatee , gelled hair and corduroy jacket , you could easily mistake him for a vj at a music channel .
but with kanal avrupa , sargur is pursuing loftier goals . " i like to think of the channel as the last step in the german integration or immigration story , " sargur said .
" before we came on the scene , german turks had almost everything - their own businesses , their own athletes and their own newspaper .
the only thing that was missing was a tv channel . " that changed in january 2005 when kanal avrupa began broadcasting around the clock via satellite .
it reaches turkish-speaking viewers in europe , turkey and the middle east , although its focus remains the turkish community in germany . unique vision that 's important to sargur , because he does n't want kanal avrupa to be lumped in with other turkish media that can be seen in germany , but have nothing to do with life in germany .
while 90 percent of the shows are currently produced in turkish , in the long term , half of the channel 's offerings will be in german . " our vision is to make people aware that while they may live in a different country , that 's where their home is now , and they can continue to live out their culture in this country , " sargur said .

he knows he 'll need his turkish passport to realize his future plans . " my goal is to one day make it into the turkish parliament , " sargur said .
" i think that , in 20 years , turkey wo n't have made much progress when it comes to joining europe , but that dialogue with the turks will be very important .

that 's what drives him to produce quality broadcasting aimed at germany 's turkish community . a station id jingle emanates from the big-screen tv in the entrance of the otherwise quiet , container-like building that is home to kanal avrupa , or " channel europe . "
it 's the summer break , but despite the lull , seran sargur is a busy man . the 27-year-old is the co-founder of europe 's first german-turkish tv station , a business idea that was fuelled by sargur 's first-hand experience as the son of turkish immigrants in germany .
he seems as if he is constantly juggling several tasks simultaneously .
with his goatee , gelled hair and corduroy jacket , you could easily mistake him for a vj at a music channel .
but with kanal avrupa , sargur is pursuing loftier goals . " i like to think of the channel as the last step in the german integration or immigration story , " sargur said .
" before we came on the scene , german turks had almost everything - their own businesses , their own athletes and their own newspaper .
the only thing that was missing was a tv channel . " that changed in january 2005 when kanal avrupa began broadcasting around the clock via satellite .
it reaches turkish-speaking viewers in europe , turkey and the middle east , although its focus remains the turkish community in germany . unique vision that 's important to sargur , because he does n't want kanal avrupa to be lumped in with other turkish media that can be seen in germany , but have nothing to do with life in germany .
while 90 percent of the shows are currently produced in turkish , in the long term , half of the channel 's offerings will be in german . " our vision is to make people aware that while they may live in a different country , that 's where their home is now , and they can continue to live out their culture in this country , " sargur said .
" i do n't think other turkish broadcasters have this same vision . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sargur plans to offer german for turkish housewives via the channel aside from turkish series and pop music , kanal avrupa 's line-up also includes numerous shows dealing with issues typically faced by turks who live abroad .
take " avrupaca , " for example .
it means " european " and is a talk show in which young german turks discuss socio-political topics . " we 're preparing for the new season now , and we especially want to do more educational shows , " sargur said .
" we 'll be offering german courses for housewives .
i think television is a great medium to teach people something , and the first priority for us is the german language . " political ambitions as much as german politics and integration drive him , seran sargur is one of the few people working at kanal avrupa who 's kept his turkish citizenship , and with good reason .
he knows he 'll need his turkish passport to realize his future plans . " my goal is to one day make it into the turkish parliament , " sargur said .
" i think that , in 20 years , turkey wo n't have made much progress when it comes to joining europe , but that dialogue with the turks will be very important .
and i think a discussion between chancellor merkel and myself would be much more productive than a discussion with -lrb- turkish prime minister -rrb- erdogan .

with her new book , josiane kruger has broken the silence . while growing up in a village in eastern france , josiane kruger always felt a bit different from the other children .
she didn ’ t have a father at home , only a mother and grandmother .
in her autobiography , which was released thursday in france , kruger recalls when her schoolmates called her a " boche " - the french swear word for a german . finally kruger 's grandmother told her the truth : her father had been a german soldier .
before her birth , he was transferred from france to the russian front and had not been heard from since . " my grandmother often told me what a lovely couple my parents were and how nice and good-looking my father was , " said kruger , 56 years after learning the truth about her father .
" i could n't understand why i should be ashamed of him . " nevertheless , for the majority of kruger 's village and for much of france , her father was a member of the occupying forces . covering up a " mistake " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " born of forbidden love " by josiane kruger was released this week in france at that time , the vichy regime instituted the right to anonymous birth as a way of implicitly encouraging french women to cover up their " misconduct " with german soldiers .
their babies could be given up for adoption immediately after they were born and never learned the names of their birth parents . after the war ended , anger grew in france over the occupation .
collaborators became targets of revenge , including those french women who had had relationships with germans .
they were bullied , their hair was shorn , they were driven naked through villages and forced to turn their children over to orphanages . though kruger and her mother were not made to endure this treatment , she suffered in other ways : " during my youth , i lacked everything , especially love and recognition . " she was 14 when she discovered her father 's address and secretly wrote him a letter .
after visiting for three days , he disappeared from her life again , this time for good . mijo panier , whom kruger met and befriended while doing research for her book , first met her german father at the age of 62 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : allied troops successfull invaded the normandy coast on june 6 , 1944 " this picture of me and my father is the most beautiful picture i have , " she said , holding up the photograph .
" everyone says we look alike and i 'm most proud of that . " a rare happy ending through kruger only saw her father once , his wife and two sons have become like family to her .
most stories of other wartime children do n't have such a happy ending .
that the adult children have started searching for their lost fathers is only a recent development . four years ago , a television documentary brought the topic of " war children " into the public eye and triggered an avalanche of inquiries at the wehrmacht archive in berlin . kruger , panier and more than 170 other wartime children have gotten together and organized a kind of support group for people with similar histories called l 'amicale nationale des enfants de la guerre .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder -lrb- r -rrb- was invited to the celebration of the 60th anniversary of normandy " i often get telephone calls from people who tell me quietly that they belong to this group but do n't want their families to find out , " said kruger .
" they 're afraid of being rejected . " on the 60th anniversary of the d-day invasion of normandy , kruger wrote to claude chirac , french president jacques chirac 's daughter and pr manager , asking her to take advantage of the occasion to rehabilitate the enfants maudits or " cursed children " of the war . it was in that year , 2004 , gerhard schröder became the first german chancellor to be invited to the anniversary celebration of the allied landing in normandy , a symbolic step in french-german reconciliation . taboo topic contradicts national legend an answer never came from chirac .
kruger suspects that the existence of the wartime children is seen as a threat to the national legend that all french citizens fought against the germans during the war . " our parents are accused of making a serious mistake , " she said .
" that 's nonsense - they loved each other and that 's all .

in her autobiography , which was released thursday in france , kruger recalls when her schoolmates called her a " boche " - the french swear word for a german . finally kruger 's grandmother told her the truth : her father had been a german soldier .
before her birth , he was transferred from france to the russian front and had not been heard from since . " my grandmother often told me what a lovely couple my parents were and how nice and good-looking my father was , " said kruger , 56 years after learning the truth about her father .
" i could n't understand why i should be ashamed of him . " nevertheless , for the majority of kruger 's village and for much of france , her father was a member of the occupying forces . covering up a " mistake " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " born of forbidden love " by josiane kruger was released this week in france at that time , the vichy regime instituted the right to anonymous birth as a way of implicitly encouraging french women to cover up their " misconduct " with german soldiers .
their babies could be given up for adoption immediately after they were born and never learned the names of their birth parents . after the war ended , anger grew in france over the occupation .
collaborators became targets of revenge , including those french women who had had relationships with germans .
they were bullied , their hair was shorn , they were driven naked through villages and forced to turn their children over to orphanages . though kruger and her mother were not made to endure this treatment , she suffered in other ways : " during my youth , i lacked everything , especially love and recognition . " she was 14 when she discovered her father 's address and secretly wrote him a letter .
after visiting for three days , he disappeared from her life again , this time for good . mijo panier , whom kruger met and befriended while doing research for her book , first met her german father at the age of 62 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : allied troops successfull invaded the normandy coast on june 6 , 1944 " this picture of me and my father is the most beautiful picture i have , " she said , holding up the photograph .
" everyone says we look alike and i 'm most proud of that . " a rare happy ending through kruger only saw her father once , his wife and two sons have become like family to her .
most stories of other wartime children do n't have such a happy ending .
that the adult children have started searching for their lost fathers is only a recent development . four years ago , a television documentary brought the topic of " war children " into the public eye and triggered an avalanche of inquiries at the wehrmacht archive in berlin . kruger , panier and more than 170 other wartime children have gotten together and organized a kind of support group for people with similar histories called l 'amicale nationale des enfants de la guerre .

" on the 60th anniversary of the d-day invasion of normandy , kruger wrote to claude chirac , french president jacques chirac 's daughter and pr manager , asking her to take advantage of the occasion to rehabilitate the enfants maudits or " cursed children " of the war . it was in that year , 2004 , gerhard schröder became the first german chancellor to be invited to the anniversary celebration of the allied landing in normandy , a symbolic step in french-german reconciliation . taboo topic contradicts national legend an answer never came from chirac .
kruger suspects that the existence of the wartime children is seen as a threat to the national legend that all french citizens fought against the germans during the war . " our parents are accused of making a serious mistake , " she said .

that 's what drives him to produce quality broadcasting aimed at germany 's turkish community . a station id jingle emanates from the big-screen tv in the entrance of the otherwise quiet , container-like building that is home to kanal avrupa , or " channel europe . "
it 's the summer break , but despite the lull , seran sargur is a busy man . the 27-year-old is the co-founder of europe 's first german-turkish tv station , a business idea that was fuelled by sargur 's first-hand experience as the son of turkish immigrants in germany .
he seems as if he is constantly juggling several tasks simultaneously .
with his goatee , gelled hair and corduroy jacket , you could easily mistake him for a vj at a music channel .
but with kanal avrupa , sargur is pursuing loftier goals . " i like to think of the channel as the last step in the german integration or immigration story , " sargur said .
" before we came on the scene , german turks had almost everything - their own businesses , their own athletes and their own newspaper .
the only thing that was missing was a tv channel . " that changed in january 2005 when kanal avrupa began broadcasting around the clock via satellite .
it reaches turkish-speaking viewers in europe , turkey and the middle east , although its focus remains the turkish community in germany . unique vision that 's important to sargur , because he does n't want kanal avrupa to be lumped in with other turkish media that can be seen in germany , but have nothing to do with life in germany .
while 90 percent of the shows are currently produced in turkish , in the long term , half of the channel 's offerings will be in german . " our vision is to make people aware that while they may live in a different country , that 's where their home is now , and they can continue to live out their culture in this country , " sargur said .
" i do n't think other turkish broadcasters have this same vision . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sargur plans to offer german for turkish housewives via the channel aside from turkish series and pop music , kanal avrupa 's line-up also includes numerous shows dealing with issues typically faced by turks who live abroad .
take " avrupaca , " for example .
it means " european " and is a talk show in which young german turks discuss socio-political topics . " we 're preparing for the new season now , and we especially want to do more educational shows , " sargur said .
" we 'll be offering german courses for housewives .
i think television is a great medium to teach people something , and the first priority for us is the german language . " political ambitions as much as german politics and integration drive him , seran sargur is one of the few people working at kanal avrupa who 's kept his turkish citizenship , and with good reason .
he knows he 'll need his turkish passport to realize his future plans . " my goal is to one day make it into the turkish parliament , " sargur said .
" i think that , in 20 years , turkey wo n't have made much progress when it comes to joining europe , but that dialogue with the turks will be very important .

" there were already efforts made under the red-green government to win kurnaz 's freedom , " he told reporters on the sidelines of a social democratic party event , referring to the previous socialist-green administration . kurnaz 's lawyers allege that the schröder government received an offer by the us administration in 2002 , just months after kurnaz 's arrest in pakistan and transfer to guantanamo , to return him to germany but refused due to security concerns . calls for investigation the liberal opposition free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- accused the former government of negligence .

that 's what drives him to produce quality broadcasting aimed at germany 's turkish community . a station id jingle emanates from the big-screen tv in the entrance of the otherwise quiet , container-like building that is home to kanal avrupa , or " channel europe . "
it 's the summer break , but despite the lull , seran sargur is a busy man . the 27-year-old is the co-founder of europe 's first german-turkish tv station , a business idea that was fuelled by sargur 's first-hand experience as the son of turkish immigrants in germany .
he seems as if he is constantly juggling several tasks simultaneously .
with his goatee , gelled hair and corduroy jacket , you could easily mistake him for a vj at a music channel .
but with kanal avrupa , sargur is pursuing loftier goals . " i like to think of the channel as the last step in the german integration or immigration story , " sargur said .
" before we came on the scene , german turks had almost everything - their own businesses , their own athletes and their own newspaper .
the only thing that was missing was a tv channel . " that changed in january 2005 when kanal avrupa began broadcasting around the clock via satellite .
it reaches turkish-speaking viewers in europe , turkey and the middle east , although its focus remains the turkish community in germany . unique vision that 's important to sargur , because he does n't want kanal avrupa to be lumped in with other turkish media that can be seen in germany , but have nothing to do with life in germany .
while 90 percent of the shows are currently produced in turkish , in the long term , half of the channel 's offerings will be in german . " our vision is to make people aware that while they may live in a different country , that 's where their home is now , and they can continue to live out their culture in this country , " sargur said .
" i do n't think other turkish broadcasters have this same vision . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sargur plans to offer german for turkish housewives via the channel aside from turkish series and pop music , kanal avrupa 's line-up also includes numerous shows dealing with issues typically faced by turks who live abroad .
take " avrupaca , " for example .
it means " european " and is a talk show in which young german turks discuss socio-political topics . " we 're preparing for the new season now , and we especially want to do more educational shows , " sargur said .
" we 'll be offering german courses for housewives .
i think television is a great medium to teach people something , and the first priority for us is the german language . " political ambitions as much as german politics and integration drive him , seran sargur is one of the few people working at kanal avrupa who 's kept his turkish citizenship , and with good reason .
he knows he 'll need his turkish passport to realize his future plans . " my goal is to one day make it into the turkish parliament , " sargur said .
" i think that , in 20 years , turkey wo n't have made much progress when it comes to joining europe , but that dialogue with the turks will be very important .

with her new book , josiane kruger has broken the silence . while growing up in a village in eastern france , josiane kruger always felt a bit different from the other children .
she didn ’ t have a father at home , only a mother and grandmother .
in her autobiography , which was released thursday in france , kruger recalls when her schoolmates called her a " boche " - the french swear word for a german . finally kruger 's grandmother told her the truth : her father had been a german soldier .
before her birth , he was transferred from france to the russian front and had not been heard from since . " my grandmother often told me what a lovely couple my parents were and how nice and good-looking my father was , " said kruger , 56 years after learning the truth about her father .
" i could n't understand why i should be ashamed of him . " nevertheless , for the majority of kruger 's village and for much of france , her father was a member of the occupying forces . covering up a " mistake " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " born of forbidden love " by josiane kruger was released this week in france at that time , the vichy regime instituted the right to anonymous birth as a way of implicitly encouraging french women to cover up their " misconduct " with german soldiers .
their babies could be given up for adoption immediately after they were born and never learned the names of their birth parents . after the war ended , anger grew in france over the occupation .
collaborators became targets of revenge , including those french women who had had relationships with germans .
they were bullied , their hair was shorn , they were driven naked through villages and forced to turn their children over to orphanages . though kruger and her mother were not made to endure this treatment , she suffered in other ways : " during my youth , i lacked everything , especially love and recognition . " she was 14 when she discovered her father 's address and secretly wrote him a letter .
after visiting for three days , he disappeared from her life again , this time for good . mijo panier , whom kruger met and befriended while doing research for her book , first met her german father at the age of 62 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : allied troops successfull invaded the normandy coast on june 6 , 1944 " this picture of me and my father is the most beautiful picture i have , " she said , holding up the photograph .
" everyone says we look alike and i 'm most proud of that . " a rare happy ending through kruger only saw her father once , his wife and two sons have become like family to her .
most stories of other wartime children do n't have such a happy ending .
that the adult children have started searching for their lost fathers is only a recent development . four years ago , a television documentary brought the topic of " war children " into the public eye and triggered an avalanche of inquiries at the wehrmacht archive in berlin . kruger , panier and more than 170 other wartime children have gotten together and organized a kind of support group for people with similar histories called l 'amicale nationale des enfants de la guerre .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder -lrb- r -rrb- was invited to the celebration of the 60th anniversary of normandy " i often get telephone calls from people who tell me quietly that they belong to this group but do n't want their families to find out , " said kruger .
" they 're afraid of being rejected . " on the 60th anniversary of the d-day invasion of normandy , kruger wrote to claude chirac , french president jacques chirac 's daughter and pr manager , asking her to take advantage of the occasion to rehabilitate the enfants maudits or " cursed children " of the war . it was in that year , 2004 , gerhard schröder became the first german chancellor to be invited to the anniversary celebration of the allied landing in normandy , a symbolic step in french-german reconciliation . taboo topic contradicts national legend an answer never came from chirac .
kruger suspects that the existence of the wartime children is seen as a threat to the national legend that all french citizens fought against the germans during the war . " our parents are accused of making a serious mistake , " she said .

" there were already efforts made under the red-green government to win kurnaz 's freedom , " he told reporters on the sidelines of a social democratic party event , referring to the previous socialist-green administration . kurnaz 's lawyers allege that the schröder government received an offer by the us administration in 2002 , just months after kurnaz 's arrest in pakistan and transfer to guantanamo , to return him to germany but refused due to security concerns . calls for investigation the liberal opposition free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- accused the former government of negligence .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 27.08.2006 the forgotten children of german-occupied france großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taboos remain more than 60 years after france was liberated from nazi occupation some 200,000 children of french mothers and occupying german soldiers are still a taboo topic , despite years of reconciliation efforts between the two countries .
with her new book , josiane kruger has broken the silence . while growing up in a village in eastern france , josiane kruger always felt a bit different from the other children .
she didn ’ t have a father at home , only a mother and grandmother .
in her autobiography , which was released thursday in france , kruger recalls when her schoolmates called her a " boche " - the french swear word for a german . finally kruger 's grandmother told her the truth : her father had been a german soldier .
before her birth , he was transferred from france to the russian front and had not been heard from since . " my grandmother often told me what a lovely couple my parents were and how nice and good-looking my father was , " said kruger , 56 years after learning the truth about her father .
" i could n't understand why i should be ashamed of him . " nevertheless , for the majority of kruger 's village and for much of france , her father was a member of the occupying forces . covering up a " mistake " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " born of forbidden love " by josiane kruger was released this week in france at that time , the vichy regime instituted the right to anonymous birth as a way of implicitly encouraging french women to cover up their " misconduct " with german soldiers .
their babies could be given up for adoption immediately after they were born and never learned the names of their birth parents . after the war ended , anger grew in france over the occupation .
collaborators became targets of revenge , including those french women who had had relationships with germans .
they were bullied , their hair was shorn , they were driven naked through villages and forced to turn their children over to orphanages . though kruger and her mother were not made to endure this treatment , she suffered in other ways : " during my youth , i lacked everything , especially love and recognition . " she was 14 when she discovered her father 's address and secretly wrote him a letter .
after visiting for three days , he disappeared from her life again , this time for good . mijo panier , whom kruger met and befriended while doing research for her book , first met her german father at the age of 62 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : allied troops successfull invaded the normandy coast on june 6 , 1944 " this picture of me and my father is the most beautiful picture i have , " she said , holding up the photograph .
" everyone says we look alike and i 'm most proud of that . " a rare happy ending through kruger only saw her father once , his wife and two sons have become like family to her .
most stories of other wartime children do n't have such a happy ending .
that the adult children have started searching for their lost fathers is only a recent development . four years ago , a television documentary brought the topic of " war children " into the public eye and triggered an avalanche of inquiries at the wehrmacht archive in berlin . kruger , panier and more than 170 other wartime children have gotten together and organized a kind of support group for people with similar histories called l 'amicale nationale des enfants de la guerre .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder -lrb- r -rrb- was invited to the celebration of the 60th anniversary of normandy " i often get telephone calls from people who tell me quietly that they belong to this group but do n't want their families to find out , " said kruger .
" they 're afraid of being rejected . " on the 60th anniversary of the d-day invasion of normandy , kruger wrote to claude chirac , french president jacques chirac 's daughter and pr manager , asking her to take advantage of the occasion to rehabilitate the enfants maudits or " cursed children " of the war . it was in that year , 2004 , gerhard schröder became the first german chancellor to be invited to the anniversary celebration of the allied landing in normandy , a symbolic step in french-german reconciliation . taboo topic contradicts national legend an answer never came from chirac .
kruger suspects that the existence of the wartime children is seen as a threat to the national legend that all french citizens fought against the germans during the war . " our parents are accused of making a serious mistake , " she said .
" that 's nonsense - they loved each other and that 's all .
i think it 's wonderful that there were still love stories even during the war .

with her new book , josiane kruger has broken the silence . while growing up in a village in eastern france , josiane kruger always felt a bit different from the other children .
she didn ’ t have a father at home , only a mother and grandmother .
in her autobiography , which was released thursday in france , kruger recalls when her schoolmates called her a " boche " - the french swear word for a german . finally kruger 's grandmother told her the truth : her father had been a german soldier .
before her birth , he was transferred from france to the russian front and had not been heard from since . " my grandmother often told me what a lovely couple my parents were and how nice and good-looking my father was , " said kruger , 56 years after learning the truth about her father .
" i could n't understand why i should be ashamed of him . " nevertheless , for the majority of kruger 's village and for much of france , her father was a member of the occupying forces . covering up a " mistake " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " born of forbidden love " by josiane kruger was released this week in france at that time , the vichy regime instituted the right to anonymous birth as a way of implicitly encouraging french women to cover up their " misconduct " with german soldiers .
their babies could be given up for adoption immediately after they were born and never learned the names of their birth parents . after the war ended , anger grew in france over the occupation .
collaborators became targets of revenge , including those french women who had had relationships with germans .
they were bullied , their hair was shorn , they were driven naked through villages and forced to turn their children over to orphanages . though kruger and her mother were not made to endure this treatment , she suffered in other ways : " during my youth , i lacked everything , especially love and recognition . " she was 14 when she discovered her father 's address and secretly wrote him a letter .
after visiting for three days , he disappeared from her life again , this time for good . mijo panier , whom kruger met and befriended while doing research for her book , first met her german father at the age of 62 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : allied troops successfull invaded the normandy coast on june 6 , 1944 " this picture of me and my father is the most beautiful picture i have , " she said , holding up the photograph .
" everyone says we look alike and i 'm most proud of that . " a rare happy ending through kruger only saw her father once , his wife and two sons have become like family to her .
most stories of other wartime children do n't have such a happy ending .
that the adult children have started searching for their lost fathers is only a recent development . four years ago , a television documentary brought the topic of " war children " into the public eye and triggered an avalanche of inquiries at the wehrmacht archive in berlin . kruger , panier and more than 170 other wartime children have gotten together and organized a kind of support group for people with similar histories called l 'amicale nationale des enfants de la guerre .

" they 're afraid of being rejected . " on the 60th anniversary of the d-day invasion of normandy , kruger wrote to claude chirac , french president jacques chirac 's daughter and pr manager , asking her to take advantage of the occasion to rehabilitate the enfants maudits or " cursed children " of the war . it was in that year , 2004 , gerhard schröder became the first german chancellor to be invited to the anniversary celebration of the allied landing in normandy , a symbolic step in french-german reconciliation . taboo topic contradicts national legend an answer never came from chirac .
kruger suspects that the existence of the wartime children is seen as a threat to the national legend that all french citizens fought against the germans during the war . " our parents are accused of making a serious mistake , " she said .
" that 's nonsense - they loved each other and that 's all .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 27.08.2006 the forgotten children of german-occupied france großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taboos remain more than 60 years after france was liberated from nazi occupation some 200,000 children of french mothers and occupying german soldiers are still a taboo topic , despite years of reconciliation efforts between the two countries .
with her new book , josiane kruger has broken the silence . while growing up in a village in eastern france , josiane kruger always felt a bit different from the other children .
she didn ’ t have a father at home , only a mother and grandmother .
in her autobiography , which was released thursday in france , kruger recalls when her schoolmates called her a " boche " - the french swear word for a german . finally kruger 's grandmother told her the truth : her father had been a german soldier .
before her birth , he was transferred from france to the russian front and had not been heard from since . " my grandmother often told me what a lovely couple my parents were and how nice and good-looking my father was , " said kruger , 56 years after learning the truth about her father .
" i could n't understand why i should be ashamed of him . " nevertheless , for the majority of kruger 's village and for much of france , her father was a member of the occupying forces . covering up a " mistake " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " born of forbidden love " by josiane kruger was released this week in france at that time , the vichy regime instituted the right to anonymous birth as a way of implicitly encouraging french women to cover up their " misconduct " with german soldiers .
their babies could be given up for adoption immediately after they were born and never learned the names of their birth parents . after the war ended , anger grew in france over the occupation .
collaborators became targets of revenge , including those french women who had had relationships with germans .
they were bullied , their hair was shorn , they were driven naked through villages and forced to turn their children over to orphanages . though kruger and her mother were not made to endure this treatment , she suffered in other ways : " during my youth , i lacked everything , especially love and recognition . " she was 14 when she discovered her father 's address and secretly wrote him a letter .
after visiting for three days , he disappeared from her life again , this time for good . mijo panier , whom kruger met and befriended while doing research for her book , first met her german father at the age of 62 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : allied troops successfull invaded the normandy coast on june 6 , 1944 " this picture of me and my father is the most beautiful picture i have , " she said , holding up the photograph .
" everyone says we look alike and i 'm most proud of that . " a rare happy ending through kruger only saw her father once , his wife and two sons have become like family to her .
most stories of other wartime children do n't have such a happy ending .
that the adult children have started searching for their lost fathers is only a recent development . four years ago , a television documentary brought the topic of " war children " into the public eye and triggered an avalanche of inquiries at the wehrmacht archive in berlin . kruger , panier and more than 170 other wartime children have gotten together and organized a kind of support group for people with similar histories called l 'amicale nationale des enfants de la guerre .

that 's what drives him to produce quality broadcasting aimed at germany 's turkish community . a station id jingle emanates from the big-screen tv in the entrance of the otherwise quiet , container-like building that is home to kanal avrupa , or " channel europe . "
it 's the summer break , but despite the lull , seran sargur is a busy man . the 27-year-old is the co-founder of europe 's first german-turkish tv station , a business idea that was fuelled by sargur 's first-hand experience as the son of turkish immigrants in germany .
he seems as if he is constantly juggling several tasks simultaneously .
with his goatee , gelled hair and corduroy jacket , you could easily mistake him for a vj at a music channel .
but with kanal avrupa , sargur is pursuing loftier goals . " i like to think of the channel as the last step in the german integration or immigration story , " sargur said .
" before we came on the scene , german turks had almost everything - their own businesses , their own athletes and their own newspaper .
the only thing that was missing was a tv channel . " that changed in january 2005 when kanal avrupa began broadcasting around the clock via satellite .
it reaches turkish-speaking viewers in europe , turkey and the middle east , although its focus remains the turkish community in germany . unique vision that 's important to sargur , because he does n't want kanal avrupa to be lumped in with other turkish media that can be seen in germany , but have nothing to do with life in germany .
while 90 percent of the shows are currently produced in turkish , in the long term , half of the channel 's offerings will be in german . " our vision is to make people aware that while they may live in a different country , that 's where their home is now , and they can continue to live out their culture in this country , " sargur said .
" i do n't think other turkish broadcasters have this same vision . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sargur plans to offer german for turkish housewives via the channel aside from turkish series and pop music , kanal avrupa 's line-up also includes numerous shows dealing with issues typically faced by turks who live abroad .
take " avrupaca , " for example .
it means " european " and is a talk show in which young german turks discuss socio-political topics . " we 're preparing for the new season now , and we especially want to do more educational shows , " sargur said .
" we 'll be offering german courses for housewives .
i think television is a great medium to teach people something , and the first priority for us is the german language . " political ambitions as much as german politics and integration drive him , seran sargur is one of the few people working at kanal avrupa who 's kept his turkish citizenship , and with good reason .
he knows he 'll need his turkish passport to realize his future plans . " my goal is to one day make it into the turkish parliament , " sargur said .
" i think that , in 20 years , turkey wo n't have made much progress when it comes to joining europe , but that dialogue with the turks will be very important .
and i think a discussion between chancellor merkel and myself would be much more productive than a discussion with -lrb- turkish prime minister -rrb- erdogan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 27.08.2006 making television for germany 's turks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kanal avrupa tackles integration issues that affect turks in germany as the son of turkish immigrants to germany , seran sargur has learned first hand about integration .
that 's what drives him to produce quality broadcasting aimed at germany 's turkish community . a station id jingle emanates from the big-screen tv in the entrance of the otherwise quiet , container-like building that is home to kanal avrupa , or " channel europe . "
it 's the summer break , but despite the lull , seran sargur is a busy man . the 27-year-old is the co-founder of europe 's first german-turkish tv station , a business idea that was fuelled by sargur 's first-hand experience as the son of turkish immigrants in germany .
he seems as if he is constantly juggling several tasks simultaneously .
with his goatee , gelled hair and corduroy jacket , you could easily mistake him for a vj at a music channel .
but with kanal avrupa , sargur is pursuing loftier goals . " i like to think of the channel as the last step in the german integration or immigration story , " sargur said .
" before we came on the scene , german turks had almost everything - their own businesses , their own athletes and their own newspaper .
the only thing that was missing was a tv channel . " that changed in january 2005 when kanal avrupa began broadcasting around the clock via satellite .
it reaches turkish-speaking viewers in europe , turkey and the middle east , although its focus remains the turkish community in germany . unique vision that 's important to sargur , because he does n't want kanal avrupa to be lumped in with other turkish media that can be seen in germany , but have nothing to do with life in germany .
while 90 percent of the shows are currently produced in turkish , in the long term , half of the channel 's offerings will be in german . " our vision is to make people aware that while they may live in a different country , that 's where their home is now , and they can continue to live out their culture in this country , " sargur said .
" i do n't think other turkish broadcasters have this same vision . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sargur plans to offer german for turkish housewives via the channel aside from turkish series and pop music , kanal avrupa 's line-up also includes numerous shows dealing with issues typically faced by turks who live abroad .
take " avrupaca , " for example .
it means " european " and is a talk show in which young german turks discuss socio-political topics . " we 're preparing for the new season now , and we especially want to do more educational shows , " sargur said .
" we 'll be offering german courses for housewives .
i think television is a great medium to teach people something , and the first priority for us is the german language . " political ambitions as much as german politics and integration drive him , seran sargur is one of the few people working at kanal avrupa who 's kept his turkish citizenship , and with good reason .
he knows he 'll need his turkish passport to realize his future plans . " my goal is to one day make it into the turkish parliament , " sargur said .
" i think that , in 20 years , turkey wo n't have made much progress when it comes to joining europe , but that dialogue with the turks will be very important .
and i think a discussion between chancellor merkel and myself would be much more productive than a discussion with -lrb- turkish prime minister -rrb- erdogan .

with her new book , josiane kruger has broken the silence . while growing up in a village in eastern france , josiane kruger always felt a bit different from the other children .
she didn ’ t have a father at home , only a mother and grandmother .
in her autobiography , which was released thursday in france , kruger recalls when her schoolmates called her a " boche " - the french swear word for a german . finally kruger 's grandmother told her the truth : her father had been a german soldier .
before her birth , he was transferred from france to the russian front and had not been heard from since . " my grandmother often told me what a lovely couple my parents were and how nice and good-looking my father was , " said kruger , 56 years after learning the truth about her father .
" i could n't understand why i should be ashamed of him . " nevertheless , for the majority of kruger 's village and for much of france , her father was a member of the occupying forces . covering up a " mistake " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " born of forbidden love " by josiane kruger was released this week in france at that time , the vichy regime instituted the right to anonymous birth as a way of implicitly encouraging french women to cover up their " misconduct " with german soldiers .
their babies could be given up for adoption immediately after they were born and never learned the names of their birth parents . after the war ended , anger grew in france over the occupation .
collaborators became targets of revenge , including those french women who had had relationships with germans .
they were bullied , their hair was shorn , they were driven naked through villages and forced to turn their children over to orphanages . though kruger and her mother were not made to endure this treatment , she suffered in other ways : " during my youth , i lacked everything , especially love and recognition . " she was 14 when she discovered her father 's address and secretly wrote him a letter .
after visiting for three days , he disappeared from her life again , this time for good . mijo panier , whom kruger met and befriended while doing research for her book , first met her german father at the age of 62 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : allied troops successfull invaded the normandy coast on june 6 , 1944 " this picture of me and my father is the most beautiful picture i have , " she said , holding up the photograph .

most stories of other wartime children do n't have such a happy ending .
that the adult children have started searching for their lost fathers is only a recent development . four years ago , a television documentary brought the topic of " war children " into the public eye and triggered an avalanche of inquiries at the wehrmacht archive in berlin . kruger , panier and more than 170 other wartime children have gotten together and organized a kind of support group for people with similar histories called l 'amicale nationale des enfants de la guerre .

kruger suspects that the existence of the wartime children is seen as a threat to the national legend that all french citizens fought against the germans during the war . " our parents are accused of making a serious mistake , " she said .

with her new book , josiane kruger has broken the silence . while growing up in a village in eastern france , josiane kruger always felt a bit different from the other children .
she didn ’ t have a father at home , only a mother and grandmother .
in her autobiography , which was released thursday in france , kruger recalls when her schoolmates called her a " boche " - the french swear word for a german . finally kruger 's grandmother told her the truth : her father had been a german soldier .
before her birth , he was transferred from france to the russian front and had not been heard from since . " my grandmother often told me what a lovely couple my parents were and how nice and good-looking my father was , " said kruger , 56 years after learning the truth about her father .
" i could n't understand why i should be ashamed of him . " nevertheless , for the majority of kruger 's village and for much of france , her father was a member of the occupying forces . covering up a " mistake " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " born of forbidden love " by josiane kruger was released this week in france at that time , the vichy regime instituted the right to anonymous birth as a way of implicitly encouraging french women to cover up their " misconduct " with german soldiers .
their babies could be given up for adoption immediately after they were born and never learned the names of their birth parents . after the war ended , anger grew in france over the occupation .
collaborators became targets of revenge , including those french women who had had relationships with germans .
they were bullied , their hair was shorn , they were driven naked through villages and forced to turn their children over to orphanages . though kruger and her mother were not made to endure this treatment , she suffered in other ways : " during my youth , i lacked everything , especially love and recognition . " she was 14 when she discovered her father 's address and secretly wrote him a letter .

but with kanal avrupa , sargur is pursuing loftier goals . " i like to think of the channel as the last step in the german integration or immigration story , " sargur said .
" before we came on the scene , german turks had almost everything - their own businesses , their own athletes and their own newspaper .
the only thing that was missing was a tv channel . " that changed in january 2005 when kanal avrupa began broadcasting around the clock via satellite .
it reaches turkish-speaking viewers in europe , turkey and the middle east , although its focus remains the turkish community in germany . unique vision that 's important to sargur , because he does n't want kanal avrupa to be lumped in with other turkish media that can be seen in germany , but have nothing to do with life in germany .
while 90 percent of the shows are currently produced in turkish , in the long term , half of the channel 's offerings will be in german . " our vision is to make people aware that while they may live in a different country , that 's where their home is now , and they can continue to live out their culture in this country , " sargur said .
" i do n't think other turkish broadcasters have this same vision . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sargur plans to offer german for turkish housewives via the channel aside from turkish series and pop music , kanal avrupa 's line-up also includes numerous shows dealing with issues typically faced by turks who live abroad .
take " avrupaca , " for example .
it means " european " and is a talk show in which young german turks discuss socio-political topics . " we 're preparing for the new season now , and we especially want to do more educational shows , " sargur said .
" we 'll be offering german courses for housewives .
i think television is a great medium to teach people something , and the first priority for us is the german language . " political ambitions as much as german politics and integration drive him , seran sargur is one of the few people working at kanal avrupa who 's kept his turkish citizenship , and with good reason .
he knows he 'll need his turkish passport to realize his future plans . " my goal is to one day make it into the turkish parliament , " sargur said .
" i think that , in 20 years , turkey wo n't have made much progress when it comes to joining europe , but that dialogue with the turks will be very important .
and i think a discussion between chancellor merkel and myself would be much more productive than a discussion with -lrb- turkish prime minister -rrb- erdogan .

that 's what drives him to produce quality broadcasting aimed at germany 's turkish community . a station id jingle emanates from the big-screen tv in the entrance of the otherwise quiet , container-like building that is home to kanal avrupa , or " channel europe . "
it 's the summer break , but despite the lull , seran sargur is a busy man . the 27-year-old is the co-founder of europe 's first german-turkish tv station , a business idea that was fuelled by sargur 's first-hand experience as the son of turkish immigrants in germany .
he seems as if he is constantly juggling several tasks simultaneously .
with his goatee , gelled hair and corduroy jacket , you could easily mistake him for a vj at a music channel .
but with kanal avrupa , sargur is pursuing loftier goals . " i like to think of the channel as the last step in the german integration or immigration story , " sargur said .
" before we came on the scene , german turks had almost everything - their own businesses , their own athletes and their own newspaper .
the only thing that was missing was a tv channel . " that changed in january 2005 when kanal avrupa began broadcasting around the clock via satellite .
it reaches turkish-speaking viewers in europe , turkey and the middle east , although its focus remains the turkish community in germany . unique vision that 's important to sargur , because he does n't want kanal avrupa to be lumped in with other turkish media that can be seen in germany , but have nothing to do with life in germany .
while 90 percent of the shows are currently produced in turkish , in the long term , half of the channel 's offerings will be in german . " our vision is to make people aware that while they may live in a different country , that 's where their home is now , and they can continue to live out their culture in this country , " sargur said .
" i do n't think other turkish broadcasters have this same vision . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sargur plans to offer german for turkish housewives via the channel aside from turkish series and pop music , kanal avrupa 's line-up also includes numerous shows dealing with issues typically faced by turks who live abroad .
take " avrupaca , " for example .
it means " european " and is a talk show in which young german turks discuss socio-political topics . " we 're preparing for the new season now , and we especially want to do more educational shows , " sargur said .
" we 'll be offering german courses for housewives .
i think television is a great medium to teach people something , and the first priority for us is the german language . " political ambitions as much as german politics and integration drive him , seran sargur is one of the few people working at kanal avrupa who 's kept his turkish citizenship , and with good reason .
he knows he 'll need his turkish passport to realize his future plans . " my goal is to one day make it into the turkish parliament , " sargur said .
" i think that , in 20 years , turkey wo n't have made much progress when it comes to joining europe , but that dialogue with the turks will be very important .
and i think a discussion between chancellor merkel and myself would be much more productive than a discussion with -lrb- turkish prime minister -rrb- erdogan .

with her new book , josiane kruger has broken the silence . while growing up in a village in eastern france , josiane kruger always felt a bit different from the other children .
she didn ’ t have a father at home , only a mother and grandmother .
in her autobiography , which was released thursday in france , kruger recalls when her schoolmates called her a " boche " - the french swear word for a german . finally kruger 's grandmother told her the truth : her father had been a german soldier .
before her birth , he was transferred from france to the russian front and had not been heard from since . " my grandmother often told me what a lovely couple my parents were and how nice and good-looking my father was , " said kruger , 56 years after learning the truth about her father .
" i could n't understand why i should be ashamed of him . " nevertheless , for the majority of kruger 's village and for much of france , her father was a member of the occupying forces . covering up a " mistake " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " born of forbidden love " by josiane kruger was released this week in france at that time , the vichy regime instituted the right to anonymous birth as a way of implicitly encouraging french women to cover up their " misconduct " with german soldiers .
their babies could be given up for adoption immediately after they were born and never learned the names of their birth parents . after the war ended , anger grew in france over the occupation .
collaborators became targets of revenge , including those french women who had had relationships with germans .
they were bullied , their hair was shorn , they were driven naked through villages and forced to turn their children over to orphanages . though kruger and her mother were not made to endure this treatment , she suffered in other ways : " during my youth , i lacked everything , especially love and recognition . " she was 14 when she discovered her father 's address and secretly wrote him a letter .
after visiting for three days , he disappeared from her life again , this time for good . mijo panier , whom kruger met and befriended while doing research for her book , first met her german father at the age of 62 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : allied troops successfull invaded the normandy coast on june 6 , 1944 " this picture of me and my father is the most beautiful picture i have , " she said , holding up the photograph .
" everyone says we look alike and i 'm most proud of that . " a rare happy ending through kruger only saw her father once , his wife and two sons have become like family to her .
most stories of other wartime children do n't have such a happy ending .
that the adult children have started searching for their lost fathers is only a recent development . four years ago , a television documentary brought the topic of " war children " into the public eye and triggered an avalanche of inquiries at the wehrmacht archive in berlin . kruger , panier and more than 170 other wartime children have gotten together and organized a kind of support group for people with similar histories called l 'amicale nationale des enfants de la guerre .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder -lrb- r -rrb- was invited to the celebration of the 60th anniversary of normandy " i often get telephone calls from people who tell me quietly that they belong to this group but do n't want their families to find out , " said kruger .
" they 're afraid of being rejected .

kruger suspects that the existence of the wartime children is seen as a threat to the national legend that all french citizens fought against the germans during the war . " our parents are accused of making a serious mistake , " she said .

that 's what drives him to produce quality broadcasting aimed at germany 's turkish community . a station id jingle emanates from the big-screen tv in the entrance of the otherwise quiet , container-like building that is home to kanal avrupa , or " channel europe . "
it 's the summer break , but despite the lull , seran sargur is a busy man . the 27-year-old is the co-founder of europe 's first german-turkish tv station , a business idea that was fuelled by sargur 's first-hand experience as the son of turkish immigrants in germany .
he seems as if he is constantly juggling several tasks simultaneously .

but with kanal avrupa , sargur is pursuing loftier goals . " i like to think of the channel as the last step in the german integration or immigration story , " sargur said .
" before we came on the scene , german turks had almost everything - their own businesses , their own athletes and their own newspaper .
the only thing that was missing was a tv channel . " that changed in january 2005 when kanal avrupa began broadcasting around the clock via satellite .
it reaches turkish-speaking viewers in europe , turkey and the middle east , although its focus remains the turkish community in germany . unique vision that 's important to sargur , because he does n't want kanal avrupa to be lumped in with other turkish media that can be seen in germany , but have nothing to do with life in germany .
while 90 percent of the shows are currently produced in turkish , in the long term , half of the channel 's offerings will be in german . " our vision is to make people aware that while they may live in a different country , that 's where their home is now , and they can continue to live out their culture in this country , " sargur said .
" i do n't think other turkish broadcasters have this same vision . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sargur plans to offer german for turkish housewives via the channel aside from turkish series and pop music , kanal avrupa 's line-up also includes numerous shows dealing with issues typically faced by turks who live abroad .
take " avrupaca , " for example .
it means " european " and is a talk show in which young german turks discuss socio-political topics . " we 're preparing for the new season now , and we especially want to do more educational shows , " sargur said .
" we 'll be offering german courses for housewives .
i think television is a great medium to teach people something , and the first priority for us is the german language . " political ambitions as much as german politics and integration drive him , seran sargur is one of the few people working at kanal avrupa who 's kept his turkish citizenship , and with good reason .
he knows he 'll need his turkish passport to realize his future plans . " my goal is to one day make it into the turkish parliament , " sargur said .
" i think that , in 20 years , turkey wo n't have made much progress when it comes to joining europe , but that dialogue with the turks will be very important .

with her new book , josiane kruger has broken the silence . while growing up in a village in eastern france , josiane kruger always felt a bit different from the other children .
she didn ’ t have a father at home , only a mother and grandmother .
in her autobiography , which was released thursday in france , kruger recalls when her schoolmates called her a " boche " - the french swear word for a german . finally kruger 's grandmother told her the truth : her father had been a german soldier .
before her birth , he was transferred from france to the russian front and had not been heard from since . " my grandmother often told me what a lovely couple my parents were and how nice and good-looking my father was , " said kruger , 56 years after learning the truth about her father .
" i could n't understand why i should be ashamed of him . " nevertheless , for the majority of kruger 's village and for much of france , her father was a member of the occupying forces . covering up a " mistake " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " born of forbidden love " by josiane kruger was released this week in france at that time , the vichy regime instituted the right to anonymous birth as a way of implicitly encouraging french women to cover up their " misconduct " with german soldiers .
their babies could be given up for adoption immediately after they were born and never learned the names of their birth parents . after the war ended , anger grew in france over the occupation .
collaborators became targets of revenge , including those french women who had had relationships with germans .

" she was 14 when she discovered her father 's address and secretly wrote him a letter .

" everyone says we look alike and i 'm most proud of that . " a rare happy ending through kruger only saw her father once , his wife and two sons have become like family to her .
most stories of other wartime children do n't have such a happy ending .
that the adult children have started searching for their lost fathers is only a recent development . four years ago , a television documentary brought the topic of " war children " into the public eye and triggered an avalanche of inquiries at the wehrmacht archive in berlin . kruger , panier and more than 170 other wartime children have gotten together and organized a kind of support group for people with similar histories called l 'amicale nationale des enfants de la guerre .

with her new book , josiane kruger has broken the silence . while growing up in a village in eastern france , josiane kruger always felt a bit different from the other children .
she didn ’ t have a father at home , only a mother and grandmother .
in her autobiography , which was released thursday in france , kruger recalls when her schoolmates called her a " boche " - the french swear word for a german . finally kruger 's grandmother told her the truth : her father had been a german soldier .
before her birth , he was transferred from france to the russian front and had not been heard from since . " my grandmother often told me what a lovely couple my parents were and how nice and good-looking my father was , " said kruger , 56 years after learning the truth about her father .
" i could n't understand why i should be ashamed of him . " nevertheless , for the majority of kruger 's village and for much of france , her father was a member of the occupying forces . covering up a " mistake " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " born of forbidden love " by josiane kruger was released this week in france at that time , the vichy regime instituted the right to anonymous birth as a way of implicitly encouraging french women to cover up their " misconduct " with german soldiers .
their babies could be given up for adoption immediately after they were born and never learned the names of their birth parents . after the war ended , anger grew in france over the occupation .
collaborators became targets of revenge , including those french women who had had relationships with germans .
they were bullied , their hair was shorn , they were driven naked through villages and forced to turn their children over to orphanages . though kruger and her mother were not made to endure this treatment , she suffered in other ways : " during my youth , i lacked everything , especially love and recognition . " she was 14 when she discovered her father 's address and secretly wrote him a letter .
after visiting for three days , he disappeared from her life again , this time for good . mijo panier , whom kruger met and befriended while doing research for her book , first met her german father at the age of 62 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : allied troops successfull invaded the normandy coast on june 6 , 1944 " this picture of me and my father is the most beautiful picture i have , " she said , holding up the photograph .
" everyone says we look alike and i 'm most proud of that . " a rare happy ending through kruger only saw her father once , his wife and two sons have become like family to her .
most stories of other wartime children do n't have such a happy ending .
that the adult children have started searching for their lost fathers is only a recent development . four years ago , a television documentary brought the topic of " war children " into the public eye and triggered an avalanche of inquiries at the wehrmacht archive in berlin . kruger , panier and more than 170 other wartime children have gotten together and organized a kind of support group for people with similar histories called l 'amicale nationale des enfants de la guerre .

" they 're afraid of being rejected . " on the 60th anniversary of the d-day invasion of normandy , kruger wrote to claude chirac , french president jacques chirac 's daughter and pr manager , asking her to take advantage of the occasion to rehabilitate the enfants maudits or " cursed children " of the war . it was in that year , 2004 , gerhard schröder became the first german chancellor to be invited to the anniversary celebration of the allied landing in normandy , a symbolic step in french-german reconciliation . taboo topic contradicts national legend an answer never came from chirac .
kruger suspects that the existence of the wartime children is seen as a threat to the national legend that all french citizens fought against the germans during the war . " our parents are accused of making a serious mistake , " she said .

the institute for public policy research said a " pay as you throw " system was the only way to improve the uk 's poor recycling record .
the uk recycled or composted only 18 % of waste in 2003-04 , ippr figures show .
meanwhile , the mail on sunday reports 500,000 bins in england have been given " bugs " to record homes ' waste habits .
the newspaper says the devices carry a unique serial number which can be scanned when the bin is tipped into a refuse lorry and that some lorries carry weighing equipment .
it has raised suspicions some local authorities are planning to charge residents for the weight of rubbish collected , the paper says .
the ippr says the uk has one of the worst recycling rates in europe , with only greece and portugal doing worse .
' tax rises ' the " pay as you throw " system is also backed by the local government association -lrb- lga -rrb- which has warned that council tax bills will have to rise if councils have to pay big eu fines because of poor recycling rates .
england 's top five recycling councils st edmundsbury : 50.64 % forest heath : 48.59 % south cambs : 46.80 % lichfield : 46.35 % harborough : 46 % source : ippr the lga said councils faced fines of up to £ 150 per tonne of rubbish if they failed to meet targets under the eu landfill directive .
ippr director nick pearce said that for the new system to be fair , rubbish collection would have to be removed from the council tax .
" the government should give local authorities powers to charge for collecting non-recyclable waste , " he said .
" our european neighbours have shown that where charges are commonplace , recycling rates will rise . "
the ippr figures showed big differences between the recycling rates of local authorities in england .
england 's bottom five recycling councils newham : 6.23 % tower hamlets : 7.35 % liverpool : 7.63 % high peak : 9.82 % wirral : 9.93 % source : ippr st edmundsbury , in west suffolk , fared best , recycling 50.64 % of its waste .
newham , in london , fared worst , recycling only 6.23 % of waste .
lga chairman sandy bruce lockhart called for a " radical overhaul " to stop council tax rises and help the environment .
" for decades people have been used to being able to throw their rubbish away without worrying about the consequences .
those days are now over , " he said .
drastic action julie hill , of the green alliance , said it would be a positive step to charge people for the amount of non-recyclable waste they produced , and the amount would not be punitive .
" we see it completely the other way around , it 's a positive signal , " she told bbc radio five live .
waste recycled in eu netherlands : 65 % austria : 59 % germany : 58 % belgium : 52 % sweden : 41 % denmark : 41 % luxembourg : 36 % spain : 35 % ireland : 31 % italy : 29 % finland : 28 % france : 28 % uk : 18 % greece : 8 % portugal : 3 % source : ippr " the proposition is that the fee for waste disposal would come out of council tax and instead you would pay for the waste that 's left over from your recycling , so the more you manage to recycle , the less you 'd pay . "

the institute for public policy research said a " pay as you throw " system was the only way to improve the uk 's poor recycling record .
the uk recycled or composted only 18 % of waste in 2003-04 , ippr figures show .
meanwhile , the mail on sunday reports 500,000 bins in england have been given " bugs " to record homes ' waste habits .
the newspaper says the devices carry a unique serial number which can be scanned when the bin is tipped into a refuse lorry and that some lorries carry weighing equipment .
it has raised suspicions some local authorities are planning to charge residents for the weight of rubbish collected , the paper says .
the ippr says the uk has one of the worst recycling rates in europe , with only greece and portugal doing worse .
' tax rises ' the " pay as you throw " system is also backed by the local government association -lrb- lga -rrb- which has warned that council tax bills will have to rise if councils have to pay big eu fines because of poor recycling rates .
england 's top five recycling councils st edmundsbury : 50.64 % forest heath : 48.59 % south cambs : 46.80 % lichfield : 46.35 % harborough : 46 % source : ippr the lga said councils faced fines of up to £ 150 per tonne of rubbish if they failed to meet targets under the eu landfill directive .
ippr director nick pearce said that for the new system to be fair , rubbish collection would have to be removed from the council tax .
" the government should give local authorities powers to charge for collecting non-recyclable waste , " he said .
" our european neighbours have shown that where charges are commonplace , recycling rates will rise . "
the ippr figures showed big differences between the recycling rates of local authorities in england .
england 's bottom five recycling councils newham : 6.23 % tower hamlets : 7.35 % liverpool : 7.63 % high peak : 9.82 % wirral : 9.93 % source : ippr st edmundsbury , in west suffolk , fared best , recycling 50.64 % of its waste .
newham , in london , fared worst , recycling only 6.23 % of waste .
lga chairman sandy bruce lockhart called for a " radical overhaul " to stop council tax rises and help the environment .
" for decades people have been used to being able to throw their rubbish away without worrying about the consequences .
those days are now over , " he said .
drastic action julie hill , of the green alliance , said it would be a positive step to charge people for the amount of non-recyclable waste they produced , and the amount would not be punitive .
" we see it completely the other way around , it 's a positive signal , " she told bbc radio five live .
waste recycled in eu netherlands : 65 % austria : 59 % germany : 58 % belgium : 52 % sweden : 41 % denmark : 41 % luxembourg : 36 % spain : 35 % ireland : 31 % italy : 29 % finland : 28 % france : 28 % uk : 18 % greece : 8 % portugal : 3 % source : ippr " the proposition is that the fee for waste disposal would come out of council tax and instead you would pay for the waste that 's left over from your recycling , so the more you manage to recycle , the less you 'd pay . "
she said that studies in other countries had shown that it could have net benefits to householders .
" so i think that 's a much more rewarding way of going about it than say , for instance , compulsory recycling and the threat of penalties . "
paul bettison , chairman of the local government association 's environmental board , said that drastic action of some sort was needed .

pollution levels have risen and air quality has deteriorated , the report found .
this comes despite a pledge by the authorities to clean up the air .
in the latest incident , a reservoir serving 100,000 people in north-west china was polluted by a chemical spill .
china has some of the world 's most polluted cities and rivers .
the pollution inspection report to the standing committee of parliament found that 25.5 million tonnes of sulphur dioxide were spewed out , mainly from the country 's coal-burning factories last year - up 27 % from 2000 .
emissions of sulphur dioxide - the chemical that causes acid rain - were double the safe level , the report said .
in some areas , rainfall was 100 % acid rain , it added .
" increased sulphur dioxide emissions meant that one-third of china 's territory was affected by acid rain , posing a major threat to soil and food safety , " sheng huaren of the standing committee , was quoted by state media as saying .
caustic soda local governments were accused of overlooking environmental regulations in the rush for economic development .
" it is especially worrying that most local governments base economic growth on energy consuming industries , disregarding the environment 's capacity to sustain industrial expansion , " mr sheng said .
his report echoes the findings from the state environmental protection administration -lrb- sepa -rrb- released earlier this month .
in july , china announced it planned to spend 1.4 trillion yuan -lrb- $ 175bn -rrb- over the next five years on protecting its environment .
the sum - equivalent to 1.5 % of china 's annual economic output - will be used to improve water quality , and cut air and land pollution and soil erosion .
meanwhile , water supplies to the city of hancheng in shaanxi province were due to resume on sunday , following an emergency when a nearby reservoir was polluted with 25 tonnes of caustic soda .
officials brought in 10 tonnes of hydrochloric acid to neutralise the caustic soda , which was being carried by a tanker that fell into the xuefeng reservoir on friday , killing one person .

us drama the west wing , which finished this year after seven series and more than 50 emmy nominations , was held in high regard by television critics .
but despite praise from columnists and commentators , its complicated political storylines and snappy dialogue between brilliant yet flawed characters did not translate into huge ratings .
creator aaron sorkin left the show after four seasons , dogged by revelations about his private life , including time in a drug rehabilitation clinic .
now he is returning with studio 60 on the sunset strip , a comic drama set behind the scenes of a late-night entertainment show similar to saturday night live .
the first episode contains some classic sorkin moments .
tribute to tv there are plenty of witty lines and a promising ensemble cast led by bradley whitford , who was josh in the west wing , and matthew perry , best known as chandler from friends .
they play scriptwriters who made their name on studio 60 and are called back , four years later , to salvage the failing programme .
" it begins with a rant against contemporary television but really ends with a tribute to the legacy of television , " sorkin explained in a satellite link-up from los angeles as part of the edinburgh tv festival .
" matthew perry 's character says : ' this is a great studio with a wonderful history , and i feel privileged to be there . '
the west wing carried on after sorkin 's departure " they 're committed to each other , they 're committed to this show , and we get to examine them and their lives . "
perry 's character has the best lines in the opener , constantly making fun of the fact he is heavily drugged on painkillers following back surgery .
he is desperately trying to avoid his ex-girlfriend , who works on the show , and inadvertently reveals to the entire backroom staff that whitford 's character is a drug user .
sorkin says there are " autobiographical elements " in some of the storylines - perry has previously been treated for addiction to alcohol and prescription drugs , for instance .
but although it begins with " characters that are based on actual people " , he says , " by page four , it 's spun off into fiction " .
sorkin 's reputation means nbc , which is screening studio 60 in the us , is counting on him to deliver ratings success .
' beautifully made ' but thomas schlamme , who is another executive producer on studio 60 and also worked with sorkin on the west wing , says the pressure is " unfortunate " .
" there needs to be a little more patience with american television , a little bit of allowing the thing to grow .
" some of the greatest shows on american television , from seinfeld to cheers , were shows that were slightly rating deficient at the very beginning and it took a year or more .
" you hope that the new regimes of a lot of these networks will realise that 's sort of the way , and the best shows can rise to the top . "
so will studio 60 have wide appeal in the uk ?
sadly for sorkin , critics already have their doubts .
sorkin and thomas schlamme were interviewed via satellite boyd hilton , tv editor of heat magazine , loves what he has seen of the show .
" i was just amazed at the daring of it , that it starts with this guy ranting about how awful american tv is and how terrible reality tv is , " he told the bbc news website .
" it 's beautifully made , it looks fantastic , it 's got great dialogue , incredible characters and acting .
it just seems on a whole other level to most other shows . "
but cultural commentator mark lawson is not so optimistic .
" the west wing never got more than a million viewers in britain and by the end was down to a few hundred thousand , or perhaps even a few hundred .
" the subjects -lsb- sorkin -rsb- chose - politics and television - play to small audiences in britain , and i suspect this will too . "
he added : " i think it 's a remarkable piece of writing and production but i 'd be amazed if it found a big audience in britain . "
nbc will discover the audience reaction shortly , as it premieres the show on 18 september .
however , viewers in the uk must wait until " the new year " , according to channel 4 , which will screen studio 60 on its main network and digital offshoot more4 .

but although it begins with " characters that are based on actual people " , he says , " by page four , it 's spun off into fiction " .
sorkin 's reputation means nbc , which is screening studio 60 in the us , is counting on him to deliver ratings success .
' beautifully made ' but thomas schlamme , who is another executive producer on studio 60 and also worked with sorkin on the west wing , says the pressure is " unfortunate " .
" there needs to be a little more patience with american television , a little bit of allowing the thing to grow .
" some of the greatest shows on american television , from seinfeld to cheers , were shows that were slightly rating deficient at the very beginning and it took a year or more .
" you hope that the new regimes of a lot of these networks will realise that 's sort of the way , and the best shows can rise to the top . "
so will studio 60 have wide appeal in the uk ?
sadly for sorkin , critics already have their doubts .
sorkin and thomas schlamme were interviewed via satellite boyd hilton , tv editor of heat magazine , loves what he has seen of the show .
" i was just amazed at the daring of it , that it starts with this guy ranting about how awful american tv is and how terrible reality tv is , " he told the bbc news website .
" it 's beautifully made , it looks fantastic , it 's got great dialogue , incredible characters and acting .
it just seems on a whole other level to most other shows . "
but cultural commentator mark lawson is not so optimistic .
" the west wing never got more than a million viewers in britain and by the end was down to a few hundred thousand , or perhaps even a few hundred .
" the subjects -lsb- sorkin -rsb- chose - politics and television - play to small audiences in britain , and i suspect this will too . "
he added : " i think it 's a remarkable piece of writing and production but i 'd be amazed if it found a big audience in britain . "
nbc will discover the audience reaction shortly , as it premieres the show on 18 september .
however , viewers in the uk must wait until " the new year " , according to channel 4 , which will screen studio 60 on its main network and digital offshoot more4 .

us drama the west wing , which finished this year after seven series and more than 50 emmy nominations , was held in high regard by television critics .
but despite praise from columnists and commentators , its complicated political storylines and snappy dialogue between brilliant yet flawed characters did not translate into huge ratings .
creator aaron sorkin left the show after four seasons , dogged by revelations about his private life , including time in a drug rehabilitation clinic .
now he is returning with studio 60 on the sunset strip , a comic drama set behind the scenes of a late-night entertainment show similar to saturday night live .
the first episode contains some classic sorkin moments .
tribute to tv there are plenty of witty lines and a promising ensemble cast led by bradley whitford , who was josh in the west wing , and matthew perry , best known as chandler from friends .
they play scriptwriters who made their name on studio 60 and are called back , four years later , to salvage the failing programme .
" it begins with a rant against contemporary television but really ends with a tribute to the legacy of television , " sorkin explained in a satellite link-up from los angeles as part of the edinburgh tv festival .
" matthew perry 's character says : ' this is a great studio with a wonderful history , and i feel privileged to be there . '
the west wing carried on after sorkin 's departure " they 're committed to each other , they 're committed to this show , and we get to examine them and their lives . "
perry 's character has the best lines in the opener , constantly making fun of the fact he is heavily drugged on painkillers following back surgery .
he is desperately trying to avoid his ex-girlfriend , who works on the show , and inadvertently reveals to the entire backroom staff that whitford 's character is a drug user .
sorkin says there are " autobiographical elements " in some of the storylines - perry has previously been treated for addiction to alcohol and prescription drugs , for instance .
but although it begins with " characters that are based on actual people " , he says , " by page four , it 's spun off into fiction " .

the 18-year-old was greeted by hundreds of people in blaenau ffestiniog on saturday , including many seeking an autograph from the newly-famous youth .
dozens of neighbours and friends cheered as he entered his home .
in the evening , despite admitting to having a cold , he attended a party in the town 's rugby club in his honour .
former head boy glyn became one of the best advocates for the welsh language in recent times during his 13-week stay in the house , sharing many conversations in his native tongue with fellow welsh housemate imogen thomas , from llanelli .
he made it to the very last night of the contest but was beaten to the £ 100,00 prize by pete bennett , 24 , whose tourette 's syndrome causes him to swear involuntarily . "
i am just a normal lad from a normal town and i wo n't change " glyn wise glyn spent saturday evening catching up with school friends at the party , which was organised by bbc radio cymru .
speaking afterwards , he said : " i am tired and i 've got a cold and all i want to do is go to bed but i 'm home and it 's an amazing feeling . "
he added : " i am just a normal lad from a normal town and i wo n't change . "
glyn is staying at home until tuesday before heading back to london for more tv engagements and personal appearances .
he announced after leaving the show that he was going to take a gap year rather than go straight to bangor university where he has a place to study welsh .
he has a number of promotional jobs lined up between now and november , but has said previously he would " love to do anything " he could to promote the welsh language .
in an interview with the bbc last week , glyn said he was not famous - " all i 've done is be on reality tv " - and just felt as if " i 'm glyn " .
