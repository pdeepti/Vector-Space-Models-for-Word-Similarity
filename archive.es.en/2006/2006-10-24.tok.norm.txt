but that does n't mean the issue is settled . the law would have allowed germany 's federal government to sell off up to 74.9 percent of the state-owned german flight security company , the dfs .
the organization employs some 5,300 people , including 1,800 air-traffic controllers . in withholding his signature from the law , which was passed by a wide parliamentary majority and with support from opposition political parties , köhler said the german constitution required the federal government to retain sovereignty over matters of public security . it was the first time that köhler has declared legislation passed by germany 's two parliamentary bodies , the bundestag and the bundesrat , unconstitutional .
a largely ceremonial position , the german president generally stays out of daily political discussions but is required to sign laws before the can take effect . state duty or single european sky bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler says the law is simply unconstiutional opponents of the law welcomed köhler 's move . " the president has reached a landmark decision , " said peter heesen , the head of the german civil servants association , which represents many of the dfs 's employees .
" it 's an important contribution to the debate about what the state 's sovereign duties are and must continue to be in the future . " hans-rudolf wöhrl , the owner of small german carrier ltu airlines , also said he thought köhler made the right choice .
the sale , he said , " would have been tantamount to a hike in fees since a private investor would have demanded a profit . " but proponents of the law , while saying they understood köhler 's reasoning , continued to argue for the benefits of privatization .
the german government maintains that the sale is essential in efforts to create a " single european sky , " eradicating the national borders that complicate air traffic control in europe . lufthansa spokesman stefan schaffrath said privatization would allow for the start of a system of incentives that would improve air traffic control performance .
schaffrath said he hoped the constitution would be changed , pointing out that köhler himself had mentioned that possibility in his decision . conservative air safety expert norbert königshofen said the government would now examine a variety of options , including the sale of a smaller percentage of the dfs .
for now , air traffic control remains in public hands , but it could still be privatized in the future . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german rail workers ' warning strike causing delays in the midst of a privatization dispute with the government , german rail workers walked off their jobs on friday morning , causing transportation delays in three states .

more than 40 german intellectuals and politicians accepted the invitation by the president of the german parliament norbert lammert to contribute to a book on what constitutes germany 's " leading culture . " " i do n't have the ambition to have a new canon developed , nor do i want to amend the rights stipulated by our constitution , " lammert said .
" but there can be no reasonable doubt that we need at least an understanding of the points that keep our society together and that are propelled by our constitution . " lammert 's recently published anthology - entitled " constitution , patriotism , leading culture .
what holds our society together " - presents a wide range of opinions on the topic of germany 's defining cultural values . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lammert believes , for example , that german should be declared official language in the constitution " leitkultur , " or leading culture , is a peculiarly german term .
some see in it an overarching term for a democratic culture of openness and tolerance , while others take it to be no more than a sign of elitism and narrow-minded belief in the superiority of one culture over another . " i grew up in this country with rights of freedom , civil rights and , when all is said and done , i am a constitutional patriot , " said seyran ates , a lawyer who was born in istanbul but has lived in germany since the age of nine . " that 's what i am fighting for .
and that 's why i have no problem with the phrase ' leading culture . '
i do n't define it the way some people do as the culture , which is imposed upon me by the germans , because i also contribute to this society . " integration troubles for ates , like for many others , the crucial problem in this cultural debate is the question of germany 's failure to develop a binding integration concept for its immigrant citizens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seyran ates believes germany needs a better integration policy " the german state must rise up to the responsibility of finally starting with a reasonable and serious integration policy , " ates said . according to green party politician claudia roth , a democratic society must offer participatory mechanisms to all its citizens . " muslims need legitimate constitutional structures , which make them capable of acting in a democratic process , " roth said . some of the book 's contributors , however , do not believe that the state can do everything . " we have to be sober about the fact that the state 's ability to act is limited , " said cardinal karl lehmann , chairman of the german bishops ' conference .
" the state has to rely on value-creating contributions from many groups of citizens . " an unfortunate term the very idea of german " leitkultur " is problematic for some because of the country 's fatal experience with national socialism . " calling something ' german leading culture ' has a bitter taste for our neighbors , " said actor mario adorf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for wim wenders the more pressing question is that of germany within europe german film director wim wenders described the concept of " leitkultur " as " very unfortunate " and the whole debate as " belated . "
it would be much more urgent to deal with the question of european identity , because that is the question that will preoccupy the german society much more in the future , according to wenders . a necessary debate others , however , believe that a debate on what constitutes a defining culture is absolutely necessary in the spirit of an open and honest dialogue between different cultures , and despite horrifying phenomena such as honor killings and forced marriages which occur in some segments of germany 's immigrant communities . " all that is part of a different culture , which one should be at least curious about , " said adolf muschg , who teaches german literature at the university of zurich . " we should ask ourselves : ' where does all that come from ? '
by doing that we serve again our cognitive faculty and our imagination , and we are then also ready to say : ' this is where we stop , this is where we 're drawing the line , " he said . " i believe that a civilized society does not necessarily need a leading culture : it is already one , " muschg said . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de defining a common culture - does germany need to ?

more than 40 german intellectuals and politicians accepted the invitation by the president of the german parliament norbert lammert to contribute to a book on what constitutes germany 's " leading culture . " " i do n't have the ambition to have a new canon developed , nor do i want to amend the rights stipulated by our constitution , " lammert said .

some see in it an overarching term for a democratic culture of openness and tolerance , while others take it to be no more than a sign of elitism and narrow-minded belief in the superiority of one culture over another . " i grew up in this country with rights of freedom , civil rights and , when all is said and done , i am a constitutional patriot , " said seyran ates , a lawyer who was born in istanbul but has lived in germany since the age of nine .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 24.10.2006 recycling scam pops the lid off deposit debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a couple hundred cases left three german thieves devised a plan to make a massive return on a moderate investment , by turning in 150,000 plastic bottles for deposit .
their scam begs the question : is n't it easier to get a job ? the plan was a simple one , demanding more criminal energy than brainpower : first , manufacture plastic bottles cheaply in eastern europe and slap a fake bar code on them .
then trek the bottles into germany , where they fetch 25 euro cents -lrb- 31 us cents -rrb- apiece .
easier then printing money ?
almost .
in germany , empties can be brought to grocery or beverage stores , where they are slipped through modern machines that read the bar code , compute the value of the returns , and spit out a receipt for payment , to be picked up at the nearest cash register .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a couple hundred cases left three hardworking thieves decided to try doing just such large-scale recycling for a living in september .
they brought 150,000 ersatz grape soda bottles , made for a few cents each in lithuania , to the eastern german state of schleswig-holstein and started trying to cash in .
not according to plan but - as happens in most simple criminal plans - things went astray .
though the trio did n't wind up getting sent through a scanning machine , cartoon style ; only to pop out of the other end of a bottle conveyor , tied at the wrists and ankles with plastic six-pack rings , they did get caught before they could turn in all their empties .
the prosecuting attorney said that , had they pulled off their plan , the three men stood to clear more than 30,000 euros -lrb- $ 38,000 -rrb- .
the story set off a new round of debate over germany 's system of deposit fees .
high deposits too tempting ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scavenging for bottles pays better in germany than many other countries some argue that the 25 cent deposit is simply too high , and that such large potential sums attract scam artists and thieves .
for businesses , they say , the bottle-return situation is one big pain in the pop-top : they spent 1.5 billion euros on automated bottle-exchange machines , and operating costs are around 500 million euros a year .
currently , germany has begun using security marks on deposits that are supposed to prevent illegal returns like the schleswig-holstein scam .
but even though the system was set to go into place on oct .
1 , plenty of automated deposit machines have yet to be set up to spit out faked bottles , according to the industry newsletter lebensmittel zeitung -lrb- food industry news -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fifa and coca-cola on collision course over plastic bottles germany has done much to promote the coming world cup 's environmental aspects but its " green goal " initiative may be under threat by main sponsor coca-cola 's plan to sell plastic bottles at the tournament .

" both sides benefit from openness , " eu trade commissioner peter mandelson said in a statement .
" but china 's growing trade muscle means growing expectations .
china must fulfill its wto obligations and commit to trading fairly . " the eu is unhappy about high chinese tariffs on products like textiles and leather goods .
it also complains that beijing unfairly privileges chinese firms when it comes to contracts for automobiles , steel , semiconductors and ships .
in addition the bloc is seeking an end to rules requiring eu companies to set up joint ventures with chinese partners and wants restrictions on european investments in certain industries lifted . " there is a growing risk the eu-china trading relationship will not be seen as genuinely reciprocal , " the policy paper said .
the bloc , however , added that it preferred to resolve its differences with beijing by negotiation . chance for talks in november bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandelson will try to pursuade china to open up markets mandelson , who is due to visit china next month , commissioned the paper .
additional talks in january are scheduled to focus on a new partnership pact between brussels and beijing , but mandelson said he would also raise the worries expressed in the paper with his chinese hosts during his visit . " too often europe 's businesses meet a chinese wall rather than an open door , " mandelson said at a conference on eu-china trade and investment relations in july . trade between the eu and china more than doubled between 2000 and 2005 .
and as european workers face increasing low-wage competition , eu politicians are coming under more and more pressure to ensure a level playing field . " china must show that it is committed to embracing globalization as a two-way street , " the eu paper said . it is unusual for the eu to threaten china in this way , but it is perhaps brussels ' only option .
attempts to protect the european market with tariffs have foundered on european consumers ' desire for inexpensive chinese goods .
in september , mandelson filed the eu 's first-ever complaint , aimed at a levy on automobile parts , against china with the wto . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " china is going to overtake germany in the next few years " former german chancellor helmut schmidt will hold talks with chinese premier wen jiabao during a summit in hamburg .

denmark , which led the pack last year , sank to 19th place because of threats against the authors of danish cartoons spoofing the prophet mohammed . meanwhile , limitations of civil rights in the name of " the war on terror " eroded press freedom in the us and russia , rsf said .

bolivia made it into the top 20 for the first time , putting it now above germany .
it got the best ranking of all poor countries : " press freedom is respected there exactly as much as in canada or austria , " the report said . reporters without borders uses 50 criteria to establish the rankings , among them the extent of violence against journalists as well as the country 's judicial context .

" both sides benefit from openness , " eu trade commissioner peter mandelson said in a statement .
" but china 's growing trade muscle means growing expectations .
china must fulfill its wto obligations and commit to trading fairly . " the eu is unhappy about high chinese tariffs on products like textiles and leather goods .
it also complains that beijing unfairly privileges chinese firms when it comes to contracts for automobiles , steel , semiconductors and ships .
in addition the bloc is seeking an end to rules requiring eu companies to set up joint ventures with chinese partners and wants restrictions on european investments in certain industries lifted . " there is a growing risk the eu-china trading relationship will not be seen as genuinely reciprocal , " the policy paper said .
the bloc , however , added that it preferred to resolve its differences with beijing by negotiation . chance for talks in november bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandelson will try to pursuade china to open up markets mandelson , who is due to visit china next month , commissioned the paper .
additional talks in january are scheduled to focus on a new partnership pact between brussels and beijing , but mandelson said he would also raise the worries expressed in the paper with his chinese hosts during his visit . " too often europe 's businesses meet a chinese wall rather than an open door , " mandelson said at a conference on eu-china trade and investment relations in july . trade between the eu and china more than doubled between 2000 and 2005 .
and as european workers face increasing low-wage competition , eu politicians are coming under more and more pressure to ensure a level playing field . " china must show that it is committed to embracing globalization as a two-way street , " the eu paper said . it is unusual for the eu to threaten china in this way , but it is perhaps brussels ' only option .
attempts to protect the european market with tariffs have foundered on european consumers ' desire for inexpensive chinese goods .
in september , mandelson filed the eu 's first-ever complaint , aimed at a levy on automobile parts , against china with the wto . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " china is going to overtake germany in the next few years " former german chancellor helmut schmidt will hold talks with chinese premier wen jiabao during a summit in hamburg .

but that does n't mean the issue is settled . the law would have allowed germany 's federal government to sell off up to 74.9 percent of the state-owned german flight security company , the dfs .
the organization employs some 5,300 people , including 1,800 air-traffic controllers . in withholding his signature from the law , which was passed by a wide parliamentary majority and with support from opposition political parties , köhler said the german constitution required the federal government to retain sovereignty over matters of public security . it was the first time that köhler has declared legislation passed by germany 's two parliamentary bodies , the bundestag and the bundesrat , unconstitutional .

the german government maintains that the sale is essential in efforts to create a " single european sky , " eradicating the national borders that complicate air traffic control in europe . lufthansa spokesman stefan schaffrath said privatization would allow for the start of a system of incentives that would improve air traffic control performance .
schaffrath said he hoped the constitution would be changed , pointing out that köhler himself had mentioned that possibility in his decision . conservative air safety expert norbert königshofen said the government would now examine a variety of options , including the sale of a smaller percentage of the dfs .

but that does n't mean the issue is settled . the law would have allowed germany 's federal government to sell off up to 74.9 percent of the state-owned german flight security company , the dfs .
the organization employs some 5,300 people , including 1,800 air-traffic controllers . in withholding his signature from the law , which was passed by a wide parliamentary majority and with support from opposition political parties , köhler said the german constitution required the federal government to retain sovereignty over matters of public security . it was the first time that köhler has declared legislation passed by germany 's two parliamentary bodies , the bundestag and the bundesrat , unconstitutional .
a largely ceremonial position , the german president generally stays out of daily political discussions but is required to sign laws before the can take effect . state duty or single european sky bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler says the law is simply unconstiutional opponents of the law welcomed köhler 's move . " the president has reached a landmark decision , " said peter heesen , the head of the german civil servants association , which represents many of the dfs 's employees .
" it 's an important contribution to the debate about what the state 's sovereign duties are and must continue to be in the future . " hans-rudolf wöhrl , the owner of small german carrier ltu airlines , also said he thought köhler made the right choice .
the sale , he said , " would have been tantamount to a hike in fees since a private investor would have demanded a profit . " but proponents of the law , while saying they understood köhler 's reasoning , continued to argue for the benefits of privatization .
the german government maintains that the sale is essential in efforts to create a " single european sky , " eradicating the national borders that complicate air traffic control in europe . lufthansa spokesman stefan schaffrath said privatization would allow for the start of a system of incentives that would improve air traffic control performance .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.10.2006 schröder 's memoirs anger some , bore many großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2005 , schröder was chancellor - now he 's an author trade union leaders and conservatives may be irritated by excerpts from the former chancellor 's memoirs , but the german press says by and large there 's little to get excited about . when gerhard schröder officially launches his 544-page volume of memoirs , entitled decisions : my life in politics , at the social democrats ' berlin headquarters on thursday , he 'll be introduced by luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker .
the choice of a foreign leader - and a conservative - for this role speaks volumes about the former chancellor 's uneasy relationship with the party he used to lead .
and to judge from initial reactions to what he 's written , decisions is unlikely to make him many new friends . as the pr machine gears up to promote the book , union leaders and some conservative politicians have taken exception to some of schröder 's opinions .
but critics say decisions merely reinforces schröder 's previous image as a pragmatic , media-savvy strategist who lacked grand visions - and whose tendency toward arrogance led to his political defeat . enemies on the left and the right bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder 's most popular decision was against the iraq war in excerpts from the book , pre-published simultaneously in germany 's most respected weekly news magazine and its largest tabloid daily , schröder said resistance from unions to his agenda 2010 reform program helped doom his re-election campaign in 2005 .
predictably , that has n't sat well with the social democrats ' traditional political allies on the left . the head of germany 's trade unions association , michael sommer was n't long in shooting back . " gerhard schröder should note the fact that he lost 10 elections with his policies , " sommer said .
" that 's why he 's no longer chancellor . " meanwhile , conservatives are piqued at remarks schröder made in interviews , in which he criticized his successor in office , the christian democratic union 's angela merkel , for showing weak leadership . " i think the criticism is wrong and also ignoble of him , " retorted the conservative state premier of baden-württemberg , günther oettinger .
" we had plenty of his authoritarian style and it did n't produce any results . " given the wide-spread opposition in germany to the american-led war in iraq , the most popular parts of the book will probably be those in which schröder criticizes us president george w. bush 's religiosity .
schröder 's decision not to support the iraq war is indeed likely to go down as his most positively viewed political legacy . yawns from the german press bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder now has a lucrative post with a russian gas giant for the most part , the german media , including a number of regional newspapers , are n't buying the hype surrounding decisions .
the daily kieler nachrichten commented , " much of this is trivial , the self-reflections of an aging man who is having difficulty dealing with the loss of power . " the westfälischer anzeiger concurred : " a man of power , who was already thoroughly vain during his time in office , has shed some lucrative tears over a purportedly better era .
that can be informative and entertaining , but it 's no reason to get angry or mourn along with him . " hanover 's neue presse drew a parallel between the shortcomings of schröder memoirs and his failings as chancellor .
" he 's certainly allowed to settle some old accounts .
but if he had anything wise to say about the future direction of the republic , he 'd still be in power . " the neue osnabrücker zeitung agreed : " schröder failed because of his own flaws and what he neglected to do .
he squandered years in office with pragmatic , but directionless politics . " schröder wrote his memoirs in less than a year , record time for an ex-chancellor , and while the consensus may be that they generate little heat and even less light , he 's unlikely to be too bothered .
the german branch of the on-line bookseller amazon says schröder 's decisions currently tops its list of advance-ordered books . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " divine guidance has no place in western politics " gerhard schröder is publishing his memoirs this week and many dw readers agreed with the former german chancellor 's criticism of us president bush 's religious approach to politics .
-lrb- 23.10.2006 -rrb- germany 's government and unions clash over reform process the german government and the country 's trade unions are accusing each other of hindering the reform process .
a truce seems unlikely with the cabinet set to approve parts of a highly controversial health bill this week .

" sporadic alcohol excesses , under-age consumption and drunk driving are real public health problems in europe , especially among young people , " eu health commissioner marko kyprianou told journalists on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kyprianou said he sees alcoholism as a threat to public health " the commission is not aiming at moderate alcohol consumption , " he said . the eu remains the heaviest drinking region in the world , with 55 million adults estimated to drink at harmful levels . " binge drinking is the big problem of the european union , " kyprianou said .
" overall , there are fewer people who drink , but those who drink , drink more . " taking into account europe 's wide cultural differences when it comes to alcohol , the eu 's executive arm listed a number of areas of concern and laid out a strategy to target them through to 2012 . " harmful and hazardous alcohol consumption is a key health determinant and one of the main causes of premature death and avoidable disease , " the commission said in its document . " young people in the eu are particularly at risk , as over 10 percent of female mortality and around 25 percent of male mortality in the 15-29 age group is related to hazardous alcohol consumption , " it said .
" the proportion of youth and young adults with harmful and hazardous consumption patterns has increased in many member states over the last 10 years . " watered-down ambitions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there will be no eu-wide warning labels for alcoholic beverages the document called on the alcohol beverage and retail industry to ensure that alcoholic drinks are consumed responsibly , particularly by young people , for example by reducing " two-drinks-for-one " offers . it placed a premium on education , noting that lifestyle choices at a young age have a widespread affect on health as an adult , and urged a better use of media awareness campaigns . but the document was a watered-down version of the commission 's ambitions in 2004 .
it also stepped back from recommendations made in a study it paid for that urged eu countries to put warning labels on bottles containing alcohol . " i am surprised by the aggressiveness with which one part of the alcohol industry lobbied against our strategy , " kyprianou said . proposal not concrete enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people are especially affected by rampant alcoholism the commission now suggests that the eu " explore " whether it would be useful to come up with a common approach " to provide adequate consumer information . " " there 's nothing left in it but air , " said german parliamentarian and consumer protection expert dagmar roth-behrend . " once again , the commission has wasted a lot of work , a lot of money and a lot of time to come up with a document that has nothing concrete in it , " she said at the european parliament in strasbourg . the strategy communication document made no attempt to explain what it meant by " hazardous alcohol consumption " nor did it say how many glasses of a beverage would constitute too many . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de good news for pilsner fans in germany as germany grapples with the challenges of reforming the country 's health care , welfare , educational systems and tax code , finance minister peer steinbrück apparently knows where the priorities really lie .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 24.10.2006 recycling scam pops the lid off deposit debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a couple hundred cases left three german thieves devised a plan to make a massive return on a moderate investment , by turning in 150,000 plastic bottles for deposit .
their scam begs the question : is n't it easier to get a job ? the plan was a simple one , demanding more criminal energy than brainpower : first , manufacture plastic bottles cheaply in eastern europe and slap a fake bar code on them .
then trek the bottles into germany , where they fetch 25 euro cents -lrb- 31 us cents -rrb- apiece .
easier then printing money ?
almost .
in germany , empties can be brought to grocery or beverage stores , where they are slipped through modern machines that read the bar code , compute the value of the returns , and spit out a receipt for payment , to be picked up at the nearest cash register .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a couple hundred cases left three hardworking thieves decided to try doing just such large-scale recycling for a living in september .
they brought 150,000 ersatz grape soda bottles , made for a few cents each in lithuania , to the eastern german state of schleswig-holstein and started trying to cash in .
not according to plan but - as happens in most simple criminal plans - things went astray .
though the trio did n't wind up getting sent through a scanning machine , cartoon style ; only to pop out of the other end of a bottle conveyor , tied at the wrists and ankles with plastic six-pack rings , they did get caught before they could turn in all their empties .
the prosecuting attorney said that , had they pulled off their plan , the three men stood to clear more than 30,000 euros -lrb- $ 38,000 -rrb- .
the story set off a new round of debate over germany 's system of deposit fees .
high deposits too tempting ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scavenging for bottles pays better in germany than many other countries some argue that the 25 cent deposit is simply too high , and that such large potential sums attract scam artists and thieves .
for businesses , they say , the bottle-return situation is one big pain in the pop-top : they spent 1.5 billion euros on automated bottle-exchange machines , and operating costs are around 500 million euros a year .
currently , germany has begun using security marks on deposits that are supposed to prevent illegal returns like the schleswig-holstein scam .
but even though the system was set to go into place on oct .
1 , plenty of automated deposit machines have yet to be set up to spit out faked bottles , according to the industry newsletter lebensmittel zeitung -lrb- food industry news -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fifa and coca-cola on collision course over plastic bottles germany has done much to promote the coming world cup 's environmental aspects but its " green goal " initiative may be under threat by main sponsor coca-cola 's plan to sell plastic bottles at the tournament .
-lrb- 21.11.2005 -rrb- germany starts chipping away at mountain of electronic junk as of friday , germans could no longer just throw their old phones , computers or coffee makers in the trashcan out back .
a new recycling system for electronics has been kicked off and manufacturers are getting the bill .
-lrb- 30.03.2006 -rrb- clouds over coke in germany last year was rough for coca-cola in germany : the company 's market share dropped significantly , largely because officials refused to change the shape of coke bottles .

more than 40 german intellectuals and politicians accepted the invitation by the president of the german parliament norbert lammert to contribute to a book on what constitutes germany 's " leading culture . " " i do n't have the ambition to have a new canon developed , nor do i want to amend the rights stipulated by our constitution , " lammert said .
" but there can be no reasonable doubt that we need at least an understanding of the points that keep our society together and that are propelled by our constitution . " lammert 's recently published anthology - entitled " constitution , patriotism , leading culture .
what holds our society together " - presents a wide range of opinions on the topic of germany 's defining cultural values . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lammert believes , for example , that german should be declared official language in the constitution " leitkultur , " or leading culture , is a peculiarly german term .
some see in it an overarching term for a democratic culture of openness and tolerance , while others take it to be no more than a sign of elitism and narrow-minded belief in the superiority of one culture over another . " i grew up in this country with rights of freedom , civil rights and , when all is said and done , i am a constitutional patriot , " said seyran ates , a lawyer who was born in istanbul but has lived in germany since the age of nine . " that 's what i am fighting for .
and that 's why i have no problem with the phrase ' leading culture . '
i do n't define it the way some people do as the culture , which is imposed upon me by the germans , because i also contribute to this society . " integration troubles for ates , like for many others , the crucial problem in this cultural debate is the question of germany 's failure to develop a binding integration concept for its immigrant citizens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seyran ates believes germany needs a better integration policy " the german state must rise up to the responsibility of finally starting with a reasonable and serious integration policy , " ates said . according to green party politician claudia roth , a democratic society must offer participatory mechanisms to all its citizens . " muslims need legitimate constitutional structures , which make them capable of acting in a democratic process , " roth said . some of the book 's contributors , however , do not believe that the state can do everything . " we have to be sober about the fact that the state 's ability to act is limited , " said cardinal karl lehmann , chairman of the german bishops ' conference .
" the state has to rely on value-creating contributions from many groups of citizens . " an unfortunate term the very idea of german " leitkultur " is problematic for some because of the country 's fatal experience with national socialism . " calling something ' german leading culture ' has a bitter taste for our neighbors , " said actor mario adorf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for wim wenders the more pressing question is that of germany within europe german film director wim wenders described the concept of " leitkultur " as " very unfortunate " and the whole debate as " belated . "
it would be much more urgent to deal with the question of european identity , because that is the question that will preoccupy the german society much more in the future , according to wenders . a necessary debate others , however , believe that a debate on what constitutes a defining culture is absolutely necessary in the spirit of an open and honest dialogue between different cultures , and despite horrifying phenomena such as honor killings and forced marriages which occur in some segments of germany 's immigrant communities . " all that is part of a different culture , which one should be at least curious about , " said adolf muschg , who teaches german literature at the university of zurich . " we should ask ourselves : ' where does all that come from ? '
by doing that we serve again our cognitive faculty and our imagination , and we are then also ready to say : ' this is where we stop , this is where we 're drawing the line , " he said . " i believe that a civilized society does not necessarily need a leading culture : it is already one , " muschg said . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de defining a common culture - does germany need to ?
the divisive debate over a " leitkultur , " or predominant culture , has broken out in germany again .
conservatives tend to think defining the culture is important ; many on the left think it 's an attack on minorities .
-lrb- 07.11.2005 -rrb- let 's talk about " leitkultur " leading christian democrat and newly appointed parliamentary president norbert lammert says it 's time the nation took a new look at the issue of a german " leitkultur , " or leading culture .

but that does n't mean the issue is settled . the law would have allowed germany 's federal government to sell off up to 74.9 percent of the state-owned german flight security company , the dfs .
the organization employs some 5,300 people , including 1,800 air-traffic controllers . in withholding his signature from the law , which was passed by a wide parliamentary majority and with support from opposition political parties , köhler said the german constitution required the federal government to retain sovereignty over matters of public security . it was the first time that köhler has declared legislation passed by germany 's two parliamentary bodies , the bundestag and the bundesrat , unconstitutional .
a largely ceremonial position , the german president generally stays out of daily political discussions but is required to sign laws before the can take effect . state duty or single european sky bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler says the law is simply unconstiutional opponents of the law welcomed köhler 's move . " the president has reached a landmark decision , " said peter heesen , the head of the german civil servants association , which represents many of the dfs 's employees .
" it 's an important contribution to the debate about what the state 's sovereign duties are and must continue to be in the future . " hans-rudolf wöhrl , the owner of small german carrier ltu airlines , also said he thought köhler made the right choice .
the sale , he said , " would have been tantamount to a hike in fees since a private investor would have demanded a profit . " but proponents of the law , while saying they understood köhler 's reasoning , continued to argue for the benefits of privatization .
the german government maintains that the sale is essential in efforts to create a " single european sky , " eradicating the national borders that complicate air traffic control in europe . lufthansa spokesman stefan schaffrath said privatization would allow for the start of a system of incentives that would improve air traffic control performance .
schaffrath said he hoped the constitution would be changed , pointing out that köhler himself had mentioned that possibility in his decision . conservative air safety expert norbert königshofen said the government would now examine a variety of options , including the sale of a smaller percentage of the dfs .

the choice of a foreign leader - and a conservative - for this role speaks volumes about the former chancellor 's uneasy relationship with the party he used to lead .
and to judge from initial reactions to what he 's written , decisions is unlikely to make him many new friends . as the pr machine gears up to promote the book , union leaders and some conservative politicians have taken exception to some of schröder 's opinions .

" i think the criticism is wrong and also ignoble of him , " retorted the conservative state premier of baden-württemberg , günther oettinger .
" we had plenty of his authoritarian style and it did n't produce any results . " given the wide-spread opposition in germany to the american-led war in iraq , the most popular parts of the book will probably be those in which schröder criticizes us president george w. bush 's religiosity .
schröder 's decision not to support the iraq war is indeed likely to go down as his most positively viewed political legacy . yawns from the german press bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder now has a lucrative post with a russian gas giant for the most part , the german media , including a number of regional newspapers , are n't buying the hype surrounding decisions .

that can be informative and entertaining , but it 's no reason to get angry or mourn along with him . " hanover 's neue presse drew a parallel between the shortcomings of schröder memoirs and his failings as chancellor .
" he 's certainly allowed to settle some old accounts .

" both sides benefit from openness , " eu trade commissioner peter mandelson said in a statement .
" but china 's growing trade muscle means growing expectations .
china must fulfill its wto obligations and commit to trading fairly . " the eu is unhappy about high chinese tariffs on products like textiles and leather goods .
it also complains that beijing unfairly privileges chinese firms when it comes to contracts for automobiles , steel , semiconductors and ships .
in addition the bloc is seeking an end to rules requiring eu companies to set up joint ventures with chinese partners and wants restrictions on european investments in certain industries lifted . " there is a growing risk the eu-china trading relationship will not be seen as genuinely reciprocal , " the policy paper said .
the bloc , however , added that it preferred to resolve its differences with beijing by negotiation . chance for talks in november bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandelson will try to pursuade china to open up markets mandelson , who is due to visit china next month , commissioned the paper .
additional talks in january are scheduled to focus on a new partnership pact between brussels and beijing , but mandelson said he would also raise the worries expressed in the paper with his chinese hosts during his visit . " too often europe 's businesses meet a chinese wall rather than an open door , " mandelson said at a conference on eu-china trade and investment relations in july . trade between the eu and china more than doubled between 2000 and 2005 .
and as european workers face increasing low-wage competition , eu politicians are coming under more and more pressure to ensure a level playing field . " china must show that it is committed to embracing globalization as a two-way street , " the eu paper said . it is unusual for the eu to threaten china in this way , but it is perhaps brussels ' only option .
attempts to protect the european market with tariffs have foundered on european consumers ' desire for inexpensive chinese goods .
in september , mandelson filed the eu 's first-ever complaint , aimed at a levy on automobile parts , against china with the wto . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " china is going to overtake germany in the next few years " former german chancellor helmut schmidt will hold talks with chinese premier wen jiabao during a summit in hamburg .

more than 40 german intellectuals and politicians accepted the invitation by the president of the german parliament norbert lammert to contribute to a book on what constitutes germany 's " leading culture . " " i do n't have the ambition to have a new canon developed , nor do i want to amend the rights stipulated by our constitution , " lammert said .
" but there can be no reasonable doubt that we need at least an understanding of the points that keep our society together and that are propelled by our constitution . " lammert 's recently published anthology - entitled " constitution , patriotism , leading culture .
what holds our society together " - presents a wide range of opinions on the topic of germany 's defining cultural values . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lammert believes , for example , that german should be declared official language in the constitution " leitkultur , " or leading culture , is a peculiarly german term .
some see in it an overarching term for a democratic culture of openness and tolerance , while others take it to be no more than a sign of elitism and narrow-minded belief in the superiority of one culture over another . " i grew up in this country with rights of freedom , civil rights and , when all is said and done , i am a constitutional patriot , " said seyran ates , a lawyer who was born in istanbul but has lived in germany since the age of nine . " that 's what i am fighting for .

i do n't define it the way some people do as the culture , which is imposed upon me by the germans , because i also contribute to this society . " integration troubles for ates , like for many others , the crucial problem in this cultural debate is the question of germany 's failure to develop a binding integration concept for its immigrant citizens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seyran ates believes germany needs a better integration policy " the german state must rise up to the responsibility of finally starting with a reasonable and serious integration policy , " ates said . according to green party politician claudia roth , a democratic society must offer participatory mechanisms to all its citizens . " muslims need legitimate constitutional structures , which make them capable of acting in a democratic process , " roth said . some of the book 's contributors , however , do not believe that the state can do everything . " we have to be sober about the fact that the state 's ability to act is limited , " said cardinal karl lehmann , chairman of the german bishops ' conference .
" the state has to rely on value-creating contributions from many groups of citizens . " an unfortunate term the very idea of german " leitkultur " is problematic for some because of the country 's fatal experience with national socialism . " calling something ' german leading culture ' has a bitter taste for our neighbors , " said actor mario adorf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for wim wenders the more pressing question is that of germany within europe german film director wim wenders described the concept of " leitkultur " as " very unfortunate " and the whole debate as " belated . "
it would be much more urgent to deal with the question of european identity , because that is the question that will preoccupy the german society much more in the future , according to wenders . a necessary debate others , however , believe that a debate on what constitutes a defining culture is absolutely necessary in the spirit of an open and honest dialogue between different cultures , and despite horrifying phenomena such as honor killings and forced marriages which occur in some segments of germany 's immigrant communities . " all that is part of a different culture , which one should be at least curious about , " said adolf muschg , who teaches german literature at the university of zurich . " we should ask ourselves : ' where does all that come from ? '
by doing that we serve again our cognitive faculty and our imagination , and we are then also ready to say : ' this is where we stop , this is where we 're drawing the line , " he said .

but that does n't mean the issue is settled . the law would have allowed germany 's federal government to sell off up to 74.9 percent of the state-owned german flight security company , the dfs .
the organization employs some 5,300 people , including 1,800 air-traffic controllers . in withholding his signature from the law , which was passed by a wide parliamentary majority and with support from opposition political parties , köhler said the german constitution required the federal government to retain sovereignty over matters of public security . it was the first time that köhler has declared legislation passed by germany 's two parliamentary bodies , the bundestag and the bundesrat , unconstitutional .

" it 's an important contribution to the debate about what the state 's sovereign duties are and must continue to be in the future . " hans-rudolf wöhrl , the owner of small german carrier ltu airlines , also said he thought köhler made the right choice .
the sale , he said , " would have been tantamount to a hike in fees since a private investor would have demanded a profit . " but proponents of the law , while saying they understood köhler 's reasoning , continued to argue for the benefits of privatization .
the german government maintains that the sale is essential in efforts to create a " single european sky , " eradicating the national borders that complicate air traffic control in europe . lufthansa spokesman stefan schaffrath said privatization would allow for the start of a system of incentives that would improve air traffic control performance .
schaffrath said he hoped the constitution would be changed , pointing out that köhler himself had mentioned that possibility in his decision . conservative air safety expert norbert königshofen said the government would now examine a variety of options , including the sale of a smaller percentage of the dfs .

" both sides benefit from openness , " eu trade commissioner peter mandelson said in a statement .
" but china 's growing trade muscle means growing expectations .
china must fulfill its wto obligations and commit to trading fairly . " the eu is unhappy about high chinese tariffs on products like textiles and leather goods .
it also complains that beijing unfairly privileges chinese firms when it comes to contracts for automobiles , steel , semiconductors and ships .
in addition the bloc is seeking an end to rules requiring eu companies to set up joint ventures with chinese partners and wants restrictions on european investments in certain industries lifted . " there is a growing risk the eu-china trading relationship will not be seen as genuinely reciprocal , " the policy paper said .
the bloc , however , added that it preferred to resolve its differences with beijing by negotiation . chance for talks in november bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandelson will try to pursuade china to open up markets mandelson , who is due to visit china next month , commissioned the paper .
additional talks in january are scheduled to focus on a new partnership pact between brussels and beijing , but mandelson said he would also raise the worries expressed in the paper with his chinese hosts during his visit . " too often europe 's businesses meet a chinese wall rather than an open door , " mandelson said at a conference on eu-china trade and investment relations in july . trade between the eu and china more than doubled between 2000 and 2005 .
and as european workers face increasing low-wage competition , eu politicians are coming under more and more pressure to ensure a level playing field . " china must show that it is committed to embracing globalization as a two-way street , " the eu paper said . it is unusual for the eu to threaten china in this way , but it is perhaps brussels ' only option .
attempts to protect the european market with tariffs have foundered on european consumers ' desire for inexpensive chinese goods .
in september , mandelson filed the eu 's first-ever complaint , aimed at a levy on automobile parts , against china with the wto . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " china is going to overtake germany in the next few years " former german chancellor helmut schmidt will hold talks with chinese premier wen jiabao during a summit in hamburg .

" sporadic alcohol excesses , under-age consumption and drunk driving are real public health problems in europe , especially among young people , " eu health commissioner marko kyprianou told journalists on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kyprianou said he sees alcoholism as a threat to public health " the commission is not aiming at moderate alcohol consumption , " he said . the eu remains the heaviest drinking region in the world , with 55 million adults estimated to drink at harmful levels . " binge drinking is the big problem of the european union , " kyprianou said .
" overall , there are fewer people who drink , but those who drink , drink more . " taking into account europe 's wide cultural differences when it comes to alcohol , the eu 's executive arm listed a number of areas of concern and laid out a strategy to target them through to 2012 . " harmful and hazardous alcohol consumption is a key health determinant and one of the main causes of premature death and avoidable disease , " the commission said in its document . " young people in the eu are particularly at risk , as over 10 percent of female mortality and around 25 percent of male mortality in the 15-29 age group is related to hazardous alcohol consumption , " it said .
" the proportion of youth and young adults with harmful and hazardous consumption patterns has increased in many member states over the last 10 years . " watered-down ambitions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there will be no eu-wide warning labels for alcoholic beverages the document called on the alcohol beverage and retail industry to ensure that alcoholic drinks are consumed responsibly , particularly by young people , for example by reducing " two-drinks-for-one " offers . it placed a premium on education , noting that lifestyle choices at a young age have a widespread affect on health as an adult , and urged a better use of media awareness campaigns . but the document was a watered-down version of the commission 's ambitions in 2004 .
it also stepped back from recommendations made in a study it paid for that urged eu countries to put warning labels on bottles containing alcohol . " i am surprised by the aggressiveness with which one part of the alcohol industry lobbied against our strategy , " kyprianou said . proposal not concrete enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people are especially affected by rampant alcoholism the commission now suggests that the eu " explore " whether it would be useful to come up with a common approach " to provide adequate consumer information . " " there 's nothing left in it but air , " said german parliamentarian and consumer protection expert dagmar roth-behrend . " once again , the commission has wasted a lot of work , a lot of money and a lot of time to come up with a document that has nothing concrete in it , " she said at the european parliament in strasbourg . the strategy communication document made no attempt to explain what it meant by " hazardous alcohol consumption " nor did it say how many glasses of a beverage would constitute too many . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de good news for pilsner fans in germany as germany grapples with the challenges of reforming the country 's health care , welfare , educational systems and tax code , finance minister peer steinbrück apparently knows where the priorities really lie .

however , when it comes to altering laws regarding foreigners , the socials democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- - who were forced into a grand coalition government last year - seem to be on a decisive path . over the next few weeks , the spd and cdu are expected to draft a bill that would tighten entry regulations for foreign students and implement eu directives on asylum and residency rights . " i 'm confident that we 'll come to a viable agreement soon , " dieter wiefelspütz , spokesperson on domestic issues for the spd , told the online version of germany 's der spiegel news magazine . foreign students eyeing germany as a possible place to study may now think twice now , said christiane wille , an advisor at the university of cologne 's international relations office . " if students have to wait too long to get their visas to study here , they miss the enrollment date for classes and then have to postpone their studies by a semester , " wille said . some students are already having difficulty getting their studies started .
muslim students have frequently had to wait longer for their visas to study in germany as more intense checks have occurred since the sept .
11 terrorist attacks in the us , wille said . visas expire after one year instead of two bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of foreign students seek the hallowed halls of german universities each year a working group of experts on domestic issues - four each from the spd and the cdu - have apparently already fleshed out the tougher regulations , including stricter background checks for foreign students . but wille said she doubted the efficiency of prolonged looks into the pasts of students who have proved their academic abilities . " students who are accepted by our university already must prove their accomplishments when they apply , " she said .
" they are generally very qualified , otherwise they would n't be accepted in the first place . " new restrictions would also limit study visas to one year from the current two , and germany 's nearly 250,000 foreign students would have to report more regularly to local government offices . however , wille said the limitation from two years to one wo n't change the situation much since most of the nearly 6,000 foreign students at the university of cologne only have one-year visas anyway , with students who wish to stay longer needing to extend their visas . that 's because a foreign student must show proof of a 7,000 euro -lrb- $ 8,700 -rrb- deposit on a bank account for each year of study in germany and " few students have 14,000 euros on a bank account , " wille said . other new regulations would see more thorough checks of guarantors or sponsors in germany for foreign students in their visa applications . " we want to make it legally possible to investigate those people vouching for foreign students here , " wolfgang bosbach , deputy parliamentary group leader of the cdu , told german public broadcaster ard . security vs. civil rights some of the proposed restrictions stem largely from failed terrorist attacks on two german trains in july .
two suspects were arrested in connection with the failed attempts , one of them was a 21-year-old lebanese man who had been studying in germany . the two men who vouched for the lebanese student apparently were not investigated by officials providing visas , though police already had their eye on the two . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " foreign students seek out very specific courses of study at german universities " jutta graf , a spokeswoman on migration policies for the opposition green parliamentary party , said the attempted bomb attacks make the wish for more thorough investigations of foreign students ' guarantors understandable , but added that there is a fine line between anti-terror measures and the right to freedom and privacy . " collecting more data is not necessarily the answer , " said graf . since police were already suspicious of the two people vouching for the lebanese student in germany , that information should have been passed on , graf said . " communication is key and more cooperation between agencies is necessary , " she added . keeping foreign students coming tougher immigration laws will deter potential foreign students from studying here , graf said , and pointed to a general sense of mistrust toward foreign nationals in germany . " it must remain clear that germany wants young students from abroad , " volker beck , head of the green parliamentary group , said recently .
" this is decisive for germany as an academic center . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : studying abroad is for some the chance of a lifetime the spd 's dieter wiefelspütz told spiegel online that while germany " should remain an open and cosmopolitan nation , security is essential . " german universities have a good reputation abroad and foreign students come to germany for specific courses of study .
" while i can understand anti-terror measures , " wille said , " it would be a shame to deter qualified students from coming here . " not only students affected by new laws tougher immigration laws are not only to affect students .
the coalition government has revoked plans to ease gaining residency status in germany for highly qualified academics and scientists and is considering limitations for husbands and wives who wish to join their foreign spouses in germany . the german government is in a hurry to get the tougher immigration laws passed after a deadline for installing eight european union directives on immigration expired on oct .

" sporadic alcohol excesses , under-age consumption and drunk driving are real public health problems in europe , especially among young people , " eu health commissioner marko kyprianou told journalists on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kyprianou said he sees alcoholism as a threat to public health " the commission is not aiming at moderate alcohol consumption , " he said . the eu remains the heaviest drinking region in the world , with 55 million adults estimated to drink at harmful levels . " binge drinking is the big problem of the european union , " kyprianou said .
" overall , there are fewer people who drink , but those who drink , drink more . " taking into account europe 's wide cultural differences when it comes to alcohol , the eu 's executive arm listed a number of areas of concern and laid out a strategy to target them through to 2012 . " harmful and hazardous alcohol consumption is a key health determinant and one of the main causes of premature death and avoidable disease , " the commission said in its document . " young people in the eu are particularly at risk , as over 10 percent of female mortality and around 25 percent of male mortality in the 15-29 age group is related to hazardous alcohol consumption , " it said .
" the proportion of youth and young adults with harmful and hazardous consumption patterns has increased in many member states over the last 10 years . " watered-down ambitions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there will be no eu-wide warning labels for alcoholic beverages the document called on the alcohol beverage and retail industry to ensure that alcoholic drinks are consumed responsibly , particularly by young people , for example by reducing " two-drinks-for-one " offers . it placed a premium on education , noting that lifestyle choices at a young age have a widespread affect on health as an adult , and urged a better use of media awareness campaigns . but the document was a watered-down version of the commission 's ambitions in 2004 .
it also stepped back from recommendations made in a study it paid for that urged eu countries to put warning labels on bottles containing alcohol . " i am surprised by the aggressiveness with which one part of the alcohol industry lobbied against our strategy , " kyprianou said . proposal not concrete enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people are especially affected by rampant alcoholism the commission now suggests that the eu " explore " whether it would be useful to come up with a common approach " to provide adequate consumer information . " " there 's nothing left in it but air , " said german parliamentarian and consumer protection expert dagmar roth-behrend . " once again , the commission has wasted a lot of work , a lot of money and a lot of time to come up with a document that has nothing concrete in it , " she said at the european parliament in strasbourg . the strategy communication document made no attempt to explain what it meant by " hazardous alcohol consumption " nor did it say how many glasses of a beverage would constitute too many . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de good news for pilsner fans in germany as germany grapples with the challenges of reforming the country 's health care , welfare , educational systems and tax code , finance minister peer steinbrück apparently knows where the priorities really lie .

" sporadic alcohol excesses , under-age consumption and drunk driving are real public health problems in europe , especially among young people , " eu health commissioner marko kyprianou told journalists on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kyprianou said he sees alcoholism as a threat to public health " the commission is not aiming at moderate alcohol consumption , " he said . the eu remains the heaviest drinking region in the world , with 55 million adults estimated to drink at harmful levels . " binge drinking is the big problem of the european union , " kyprianou said .
" overall , there are fewer people who drink , but those who drink , drink more . " taking into account europe 's wide cultural differences when it comes to alcohol , the eu 's executive arm listed a number of areas of concern and laid out a strategy to target them through to 2012 . " harmful and hazardous alcohol consumption is a key health determinant and one of the main causes of premature death and avoidable disease , " the commission said in its document . " young people in the eu are particularly at risk , as over 10 percent of female mortality and around 25 percent of male mortality in the 15-29 age group is related to hazardous alcohol consumption , " it said .
" the proportion of youth and young adults with harmful and hazardous consumption patterns has increased in many member states over the last 10 years . " watered-down ambitions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there will be no eu-wide warning labels for alcoholic beverages the document called on the alcohol beverage and retail industry to ensure that alcoholic drinks are consumed responsibly , particularly by young people , for example by reducing " two-drinks-for-one " offers . it placed a premium on education , noting that lifestyle choices at a young age have a widespread affect on health as an adult , and urged a better use of media awareness campaigns . but the document was a watered-down version of the commission 's ambitions in 2004 .
it also stepped back from recommendations made in a study it paid for that urged eu countries to put warning labels on bottles containing alcohol . " i am surprised by the aggressiveness with which one part of the alcohol industry lobbied against our strategy , " kyprianou said . proposal not concrete enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people are especially affected by rampant alcoholism the commission now suggests that the eu " explore " whether it would be useful to come up with a common approach " to provide adequate consumer information . " " there 's nothing left in it but air , " said german parliamentarian and consumer protection expert dagmar roth-behrend . " once again , the commission has wasted a lot of work , a lot of money and a lot of time to come up with a document that has nothing concrete in it , " she said at the european parliament in strasbourg . the strategy communication document made no attempt to explain what it meant by " hazardous alcohol consumption " nor did it say how many glasses of a beverage would constitute too many . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de good news for pilsner fans in germany as germany grapples with the challenges of reforming the country 's health care , welfare , educational systems and tax code , finance minister peer steinbrück apparently knows where the priorities really lie .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.10.2006 schröder 's memoirs anger some , bore many großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2005 , schröder was chancellor - now he 's an author trade union leaders and conservatives may be irritated by excerpts from the former chancellor 's memoirs , but the german press says by and large there 's little to get excited about . when gerhard schröder officially launches his 544-page volume of memoirs , entitled decisions : my life in politics , at the social democrats ' berlin headquarters on thursday , he 'll be introduced by luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker .
the choice of a foreign leader - and a conservative - for this role speaks volumes about the former chancellor 's uneasy relationship with the party he used to lead .
and to judge from initial reactions to what he 's written , decisions is unlikely to make him many new friends . as the pr machine gears up to promote the book , union leaders and some conservative politicians have taken exception to some of schröder 's opinions .
but critics say decisions merely reinforces schröder 's previous image as a pragmatic , media-savvy strategist who lacked grand visions - and whose tendency toward arrogance led to his political defeat . enemies on the left and the right bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder 's most popular decision was against the iraq war in excerpts from the book , pre-published simultaneously in germany 's most respected weekly news magazine and its largest tabloid daily , schröder said resistance from unions to his agenda 2010 reform program helped doom his re-election campaign in 2005 .
predictably , that has n't sat well with the social democrats ' traditional political allies on the left . the head of germany 's trade unions association , michael sommer was n't long in shooting back . " gerhard schröder should note the fact that he lost 10 elections with his policies , " sommer said .
" that 's why he 's no longer chancellor . " meanwhile , conservatives are piqued at remarks schröder made in interviews , in which he criticized his successor in office , the christian democratic union 's angela merkel , for showing weak leadership . " i think the criticism is wrong and also ignoble of him , " retorted the conservative state premier of baden-württemberg , günther oettinger .
" we had plenty of his authoritarian style and it did n't produce any results . " given the wide-spread opposition in germany to the american-led war in iraq , the most popular parts of the book will probably be those in which schröder criticizes us president george w. bush 's religiosity .
schröder 's decision not to support the iraq war is indeed likely to go down as his most positively viewed political legacy . yawns from the german press bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder now has a lucrative post with a russian gas giant for the most part , the german media , including a number of regional newspapers , are n't buying the hype surrounding decisions .
the daily kieler nachrichten commented , " much of this is trivial , the self-reflections of an aging man who is having difficulty dealing with the loss of power . " the westfälischer anzeiger concurred : " a man of power , who was already thoroughly vain during his time in office , has shed some lucrative tears over a purportedly better era .
that can be informative and entertaining , but it 's no reason to get angry or mourn along with him . " hanover 's neue presse drew a parallel between the shortcomings of schröder memoirs and his failings as chancellor .
" he 's certainly allowed to settle some old accounts .
but if he had anything wise to say about the future direction of the republic , he 'd still be in power . " the neue osnabrücker zeitung agreed : " schröder failed because of his own flaws and what he neglected to do .
he squandered years in office with pragmatic , but directionless politics . " schröder wrote his memoirs in less than a year , record time for an ex-chancellor , and while the consensus may be that they generate little heat and even less light , he 's unlikely to be too bothered .

" both sides benefit from openness , " eu trade commissioner peter mandelson said in a statement .
" but china 's growing trade muscle means growing expectations .
china must fulfill its wto obligations and commit to trading fairly . " the eu is unhappy about high chinese tariffs on products like textiles and leather goods .
it also complains that beijing unfairly privileges chinese firms when it comes to contracts for automobiles , steel , semiconductors and ships .
in addition the bloc is seeking an end to rules requiring eu companies to set up joint ventures with chinese partners and wants restrictions on european investments in certain industries lifted . " there is a growing risk the eu-china trading relationship will not be seen as genuinely reciprocal , " the policy paper said .
the bloc , however , added that it preferred to resolve its differences with beijing by negotiation . chance for talks in november bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandelson will try to pursuade china to open up markets mandelson , who is due to visit china next month , commissioned the paper .
additional talks in january are scheduled to focus on a new partnership pact between brussels and beijing , but mandelson said he would also raise the worries expressed in the paper with his chinese hosts during his visit . " too often europe 's businesses meet a chinese wall rather than an open door , " mandelson said at a conference on eu-china trade and investment relations in july . trade between the eu and china more than doubled between 2000 and 2005 .
and as european workers face increasing low-wage competition , eu politicians are coming under more and more pressure to ensure a level playing field . " china must show that it is committed to embracing globalization as a two-way street , " the eu paper said . it is unusual for the eu to threaten china in this way , but it is perhaps brussels ' only option .
attempts to protect the european market with tariffs have foundered on european consumers ' desire for inexpensive chinese goods .
in september , mandelson filed the eu 's first-ever complaint , aimed at a levy on automobile parts , against china with the wto . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " china is going to overtake germany in the next few years " former german chancellor helmut schmidt will hold talks with chinese premier wen jiabao during a summit in hamburg .

more than 40 german intellectuals and politicians accepted the invitation by the president of the german parliament norbert lammert to contribute to a book on what constitutes germany 's " leading culture . " " i do n't have the ambition to have a new canon developed , nor do i want to amend the rights stipulated by our constitution , " lammert said .
" but there can be no reasonable doubt that we need at least an understanding of the points that keep our society together and that are propelled by our constitution . " lammert 's recently published anthology - entitled " constitution , patriotism , leading culture .
what holds our society together " - presents a wide range of opinions on the topic of germany 's defining cultural values . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lammert believes , for example , that german should be declared official language in the constitution " leitkultur , " or leading culture , is a peculiarly german term .
some see in it an overarching term for a democratic culture of openness and tolerance , while others take it to be no more than a sign of elitism and narrow-minded belief in the superiority of one culture over another . " i grew up in this country with rights of freedom , civil rights and , when all is said and done , i am a constitutional patriot , " said seyran ates , a lawyer who was born in istanbul but has lived in germany since the age of nine . " that 's what i am fighting for .
and that 's why i have no problem with the phrase ' leading culture . '
i do n't define it the way some people do as the culture , which is imposed upon me by the germans , because i also contribute to this society . " integration troubles for ates , like for many others , the crucial problem in this cultural debate is the question of germany 's failure to develop a binding integration concept for its immigrant citizens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seyran ates believes germany needs a better integration policy " the german state must rise up to the responsibility of finally starting with a reasonable and serious integration policy , " ates said . according to green party politician claudia roth , a democratic society must offer participatory mechanisms to all its citizens . " muslims need legitimate constitutional structures , which make them capable of acting in a democratic process , " roth said . some of the book 's contributors , however , do not believe that the state can do everything . " we have to be sober about the fact that the state 's ability to act is limited , " said cardinal karl lehmann , chairman of the german bishops ' conference .
" the state has to rely on value-creating contributions from many groups of citizens . " an unfortunate term the very idea of german " leitkultur " is problematic for some because of the country 's fatal experience with national socialism . " calling something ' german leading culture ' has a bitter taste for our neighbors , " said actor mario adorf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for wim wenders the more pressing question is that of germany within europe german film director wim wenders described the concept of " leitkultur " as " very unfortunate " and the whole debate as " belated . "
it would be much more urgent to deal with the question of european identity , because that is the question that will preoccupy the german society much more in the future , according to wenders . a necessary debate others , however , believe that a debate on what constitutes a defining culture is absolutely necessary in the spirit of an open and honest dialogue between different cultures , and despite horrifying phenomena such as honor killings and forced marriages which occur in some segments of germany 's immigrant communities . " all that is part of a different culture , which one should be at least curious about , " said adolf muschg , who teaches german literature at the university of zurich . " we should ask ourselves : ' where does all that come from ? '
by doing that we serve again our cognitive faculty and our imagination , and we are then also ready to say : ' this is where we stop , this is where we 're drawing the line , " he said . " i believe that a civilized society does not necessarily need a leading culture : it is already one , " muschg said . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de defining a common culture - does germany need to ?
the divisive debate over a " leitkultur , " or predominant culture , has broken out in germany again .

the choice of a foreign leader - and a conservative - for this role speaks volumes about the former chancellor 's uneasy relationship with the party he used to lead .
and to judge from initial reactions to what he 's written , decisions is unlikely to make him many new friends . as the pr machine gears up to promote the book , union leaders and some conservative politicians have taken exception to some of schröder 's opinions .
but critics say decisions merely reinforces schröder 's previous image as a pragmatic , media-savvy strategist who lacked grand visions - and whose tendency toward arrogance led to his political defeat . enemies on the left and the right bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder 's most popular decision was against the iraq war in excerpts from the book , pre-published simultaneously in germany 's most respected weekly news magazine and its largest tabloid daily , schröder said resistance from unions to his agenda 2010 reform program helped doom his re-election campaign in 2005 .
predictably , that has n't sat well with the social democrats ' traditional political allies on the left . the head of germany 's trade unions association , michael sommer was n't long in shooting back . " gerhard schröder should note the fact that he lost 10 elections with his policies , " sommer said .
" that 's why he 's no longer chancellor . " meanwhile , conservatives are piqued at remarks schröder made in interviews , in which he criticized his successor in office , the christian democratic union 's angela merkel , for showing weak leadership . " i think the criticism is wrong and also ignoble of him , " retorted the conservative state premier of baden-württemberg , günther oettinger .
" we had plenty of his authoritarian style and it did n't produce any results . " given the wide-spread opposition in germany to the american-led war in iraq , the most popular parts of the book will probably be those in which schröder criticizes us president george w. bush 's religiosity .
schröder 's decision not to support the iraq war is indeed likely to go down as his most positively viewed political legacy . yawns from the german press bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder now has a lucrative post with a russian gas giant for the most part , the german media , including a number of regional newspapers , are n't buying the hype surrounding decisions .
the daily kieler nachrichten commented , " much of this is trivial , the self-reflections of an aging man who is having difficulty dealing with the loss of power . " the westfälischer anzeiger concurred : " a man of power , who was already thoroughly vain during his time in office , has shed some lucrative tears over a purportedly better era .
that can be informative and entertaining , but it 's no reason to get angry or mourn along with him . " hanover 's neue presse drew a parallel between the shortcomings of schröder memoirs and his failings as chancellor .
" he 's certainly allowed to settle some old accounts .
but if he had anything wise to say about the future direction of the republic , he 'd still be in power . " the neue osnabrücker zeitung agreed : " schröder failed because of his own flaws and what he neglected to do .
he squandered years in office with pragmatic , but directionless politics . " schröder wrote his memoirs in less than a year , record time for an ex-chancellor , and while the consensus may be that they generate little heat and even less light , he 's unlikely to be too bothered .

but that does n't mean the issue is settled . the law would have allowed germany 's federal government to sell off up to 74.9 percent of the state-owned german flight security company , the dfs .
the organization employs some 5,300 people , including 1,800 air-traffic controllers . in withholding his signature from the law , which was passed by a wide parliamentary majority and with support from opposition political parties , köhler said the german constitution required the federal government to retain sovereignty over matters of public security . it was the first time that köhler has declared legislation passed by germany 's two parliamentary bodies , the bundestag and the bundesrat , unconstitutional .

" it 's an important contribution to the debate about what the state 's sovereign duties are and must continue to be in the future . " hans-rudolf wöhrl , the owner of small german carrier ltu airlines , also said he thought köhler made the right choice .
the sale , he said , " would have been tantamount to a hike in fees since a private investor would have demanded a profit . " but proponents of the law , while saying they understood köhler 's reasoning , continued to argue for the benefits of privatization .
the german government maintains that the sale is essential in efforts to create a " single european sky , " eradicating the national borders that complicate air traffic control in europe . lufthansa spokesman stefan schaffrath said privatization would allow for the start of a system of incentives that would improve air traffic control performance .
schaffrath said he hoped the constitution would be changed , pointing out that köhler himself had mentioned that possibility in his decision . conservative air safety expert norbert königshofen said the government would now examine a variety of options , including the sale of a smaller percentage of the dfs .

" both sides benefit from openness , " eu trade commissioner peter mandelson said in a statement .
" but china 's growing trade muscle means growing expectations .
china must fulfill its wto obligations and commit to trading fairly . " the eu is unhappy about high chinese tariffs on products like textiles and leather goods .
it also complains that beijing unfairly privileges chinese firms when it comes to contracts for automobiles , steel , semiconductors and ships .
in addition the bloc is seeking an end to rules requiring eu companies to set up joint ventures with chinese partners and wants restrictions on european investments in certain industries lifted . " there is a growing risk the eu-china trading relationship will not be seen as genuinely reciprocal , " the policy paper said .
the bloc , however , added that it preferred to resolve its differences with beijing by negotiation . chance for talks in november bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandelson will try to pursuade china to open up markets mandelson , who is due to visit china next month , commissioned the paper .
additional talks in january are scheduled to focus on a new partnership pact between brussels and beijing , but mandelson said he would also raise the worries expressed in the paper with his chinese hosts during his visit . " too often europe 's businesses meet a chinese wall rather than an open door , " mandelson said at a conference on eu-china trade and investment relations in july . trade between the eu and china more than doubled between 2000 and 2005 .
and as european workers face increasing low-wage competition , eu politicians are coming under more and more pressure to ensure a level playing field . " china must show that it is committed to embracing globalization as a two-way street , " the eu paper said . it is unusual for the eu to threaten china in this way , but it is perhaps brussels ' only option .
attempts to protect the european market with tariffs have foundered on european consumers ' desire for inexpensive chinese goods .
in september , mandelson filed the eu 's first-ever complaint , aimed at a levy on automobile parts , against china with the wto . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " china is going to overtake germany in the next few years " former german chancellor helmut schmidt will hold talks with chinese premier wen jiabao during a summit in hamburg .

but that does n't mean the issue is settled . the law would have allowed germany 's federal government to sell off up to 74.9 percent of the state-owned german flight security company , the dfs .
the organization employs some 5,300 people , including 1,800 air-traffic controllers . in withholding his signature from the law , which was passed by a wide parliamentary majority and with support from opposition political parties , köhler said the german constitution required the federal government to retain sovereignty over matters of public security . it was the first time that köhler has declared legislation passed by germany 's two parliamentary bodies , the bundestag and the bundesrat , unconstitutional .
a largely ceremonial position , the german president generally stays out of daily political discussions but is required to sign laws before the can take effect . state duty or single european sky bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler says the law is simply unconstiutional opponents of the law welcomed köhler 's move . " the president has reached a landmark decision , " said peter heesen , the head of the german civil servants association , which represents many of the dfs 's employees .
" it 's an important contribution to the debate about what the state 's sovereign duties are and must continue to be in the future . " hans-rudolf wöhrl , the owner of small german carrier ltu airlines , also said he thought köhler made the right choice .
the sale , he said , " would have been tantamount to a hike in fees since a private investor would have demanded a profit . " but proponents of the law , while saying they understood köhler 's reasoning , continued to argue for the benefits of privatization .
the german government maintains that the sale is essential in efforts to create a " single european sky , " eradicating the national borders that complicate air traffic control in europe . lufthansa spokesman stefan schaffrath said privatization would allow for the start of a system of incentives that would improve air traffic control performance .
schaffrath said he hoped the constitution would be changed , pointing out that köhler himself had mentioned that possibility in his decision . conservative air safety expert norbert königshofen said the government would now examine a variety of options , including the sale of a smaller percentage of the dfs .
for now , air traffic control remains in public hands , but it could still be privatized in the future . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german rail workers ' warning strike causing delays in the midst of a privatization dispute with the government , german rail workers walked off their jobs on friday morning , causing transportation delays in three states .

" sporadic alcohol excesses , under-age consumption and drunk driving are real public health problems in europe , especially among young people , " eu health commissioner marko kyprianou told journalists on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kyprianou said he sees alcoholism as a threat to public health " the commission is not aiming at moderate alcohol consumption , " he said . the eu remains the heaviest drinking region in the world , with 55 million adults estimated to drink at harmful levels . " binge drinking is the big problem of the european union , " kyprianou said .
" overall , there are fewer people who drink , but those who drink , drink more . " taking into account europe 's wide cultural differences when it comes to alcohol , the eu 's executive arm listed a number of areas of concern and laid out a strategy to target them through to 2012 . " harmful and hazardous alcohol consumption is a key health determinant and one of the main causes of premature death and avoidable disease , " the commission said in its document . " young people in the eu are particularly at risk , as over 10 percent of female mortality and around 25 percent of male mortality in the 15-29 age group is related to hazardous alcohol consumption , " it said .
" the proportion of youth and young adults with harmful and hazardous consumption patterns has increased in many member states over the last 10 years . " watered-down ambitions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there will be no eu-wide warning labels for alcoholic beverages the document called on the alcohol beverage and retail industry to ensure that alcoholic drinks are consumed responsibly , particularly by young people , for example by reducing " two-drinks-for-one " offers . it placed a premium on education , noting that lifestyle choices at a young age have a widespread affect on health as an adult , and urged a better use of media awareness campaigns . but the document was a watered-down version of the commission 's ambitions in 2004 .
it also stepped back from recommendations made in a study it paid for that urged eu countries to put warning labels on bottles containing alcohol . " i am surprised by the aggressiveness with which one part of the alcohol industry lobbied against our strategy , " kyprianou said . proposal not concrete enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people are especially affected by rampant alcoholism the commission now suggests that the eu " explore " whether it would be useful to come up with a common approach " to provide adequate consumer information . " " there 's nothing left in it but air , " said german parliamentarian and consumer protection expert dagmar roth-behrend . " once again , the commission has wasted a lot of work , a lot of money and a lot of time to come up with a document that has nothing concrete in it , " she said at the european parliament in strasbourg . the strategy communication document made no attempt to explain what it meant by " hazardous alcohol consumption " nor did it say how many glasses of a beverage would constitute too many . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de good news for pilsner fans in germany as germany grapples with the challenges of reforming the country 's health care , welfare , educational systems and tax code , finance minister peer steinbrück apparently knows where the priorities really lie .

" sporadic alcohol excesses , under-age consumption and drunk driving are real public health problems in europe , especially among young people , " eu health commissioner marko kyprianou told journalists on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kyprianou said he sees alcoholism as a threat to public health " the commission is not aiming at moderate alcohol consumption , " he said . the eu remains the heaviest drinking region in the world , with 55 million adults estimated to drink at harmful levels . " binge drinking is the big problem of the european union , " kyprianou said .
" overall , there are fewer people who drink , but those who drink , drink more . " taking into account europe 's wide cultural differences when it comes to alcohol , the eu 's executive arm listed a number of areas of concern and laid out a strategy to target them through to 2012 . " harmful and hazardous alcohol consumption is a key health determinant and one of the main causes of premature death and avoidable disease , " the commission said in its document . " young people in the eu are particularly at risk , as over 10 percent of female mortality and around 25 percent of male mortality in the 15-29 age group is related to hazardous alcohol consumption , " it said .
" the proportion of youth and young adults with harmful and hazardous consumption patterns has increased in many member states over the last 10 years . " watered-down ambitions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there will be no eu-wide warning labels for alcoholic beverages the document called on the alcohol beverage and retail industry to ensure that alcoholic drinks are consumed responsibly , particularly by young people , for example by reducing " two-drinks-for-one " offers . it placed a premium on education , noting that lifestyle choices at a young age have a widespread affect on health as an adult , and urged a better use of media awareness campaigns . but the document was a watered-down version of the commission 's ambitions in 2004 .
it also stepped back from recommendations made in a study it paid for that urged eu countries to put warning labels on bottles containing alcohol . " i am surprised by the aggressiveness with which one part of the alcohol industry lobbied against our strategy , " kyprianou said . proposal not concrete enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people are especially affected by rampant alcoholism the commission now suggests that the eu " explore " whether it would be useful to come up with a common approach " to provide adequate consumer information . " " there 's nothing left in it but air , " said german parliamentarian and consumer protection expert dagmar roth-behrend . " once again , the commission has wasted a lot of work , a lot of money and a lot of time to come up with a document that has nothing concrete in it , " she said at the european parliament in strasbourg . the strategy communication document made no attempt to explain what it meant by " hazardous alcohol consumption " nor did it say how many glasses of a beverage would constitute too many . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de good news for pilsner fans in germany as germany grapples with the challenges of reforming the country 's health care , welfare , educational systems and tax code , finance minister peer steinbrück apparently knows where the priorities really lie .

more than 40 german intellectuals and politicians accepted the invitation by the president of the german parliament norbert lammert to contribute to a book on what constitutes germany 's " leading culture . " " i do n't have the ambition to have a new canon developed , nor do i want to amend the rights stipulated by our constitution , " lammert said .
" but there can be no reasonable doubt that we need at least an understanding of the points that keep our society together and that are propelled by our constitution . " lammert 's recently published anthology - entitled " constitution , patriotism , leading culture .
what holds our society together " - presents a wide range of opinions on the topic of germany 's defining cultural values . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lammert believes , for example , that german should be declared official language in the constitution " leitkultur , " or leading culture , is a peculiarly german term .
some see in it an overarching term for a democratic culture of openness and tolerance , while others take it to be no more than a sign of elitism and narrow-minded belief in the superiority of one culture over another . " i grew up in this country with rights of freedom , civil rights and , when all is said and done , i am a constitutional patriot , " said seyran ates , a lawyer who was born in istanbul but has lived in germany since the age of nine . " that 's what i am fighting for .
and that 's why i have no problem with the phrase ' leading culture . '
i do n't define it the way some people do as the culture , which is imposed upon me by the germans , because i also contribute to this society . " integration troubles for ates , like for many others , the crucial problem in this cultural debate is the question of germany 's failure to develop a binding integration concept for its immigrant citizens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seyran ates believes germany needs a better integration policy " the german state must rise up to the responsibility of finally starting with a reasonable and serious integration policy , " ates said . according to green party politician claudia roth , a democratic society must offer participatory mechanisms to all its citizens . " muslims need legitimate constitutional structures , which make them capable of acting in a democratic process , " roth said . some of the book 's contributors , however , do not believe that the state can do everything . " we have to be sober about the fact that the state 's ability to act is limited , " said cardinal karl lehmann , chairman of the german bishops ' conference .
" the state has to rely on value-creating contributions from many groups of citizens . " an unfortunate term the very idea of german " leitkultur " is problematic for some because of the country 's fatal experience with national socialism . " calling something ' german leading culture ' has a bitter taste for our neighbors , " said actor mario adorf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for wim wenders the more pressing question is that of germany within europe german film director wim wenders described the concept of " leitkultur " as " very unfortunate " and the whole debate as " belated . "
it would be much more urgent to deal with the question of european identity , because that is the question that will preoccupy the german society much more in the future , according to wenders . a necessary debate others , however , believe that a debate on what constitutes a defining culture is absolutely necessary in the spirit of an open and honest dialogue between different cultures , and despite horrifying phenomena such as honor killings and forced marriages which occur in some segments of germany 's immigrant communities . " all that is part of a different culture , which one should be at least curious about , " said adolf muschg , who teaches german literature at the university of zurich . " we should ask ourselves : ' where does all that come from ? '
by doing that we serve again our cognitive faculty and our imagination , and we are then also ready to say : ' this is where we stop , this is where we 're drawing the line , " he said .

" both sides benefit from openness , " eu trade commissioner peter mandelson said in a statement .
" but china 's growing trade muscle means growing expectations .
china must fulfill its wto obligations and commit to trading fairly . " the eu is unhappy about high chinese tariffs on products like textiles and leather goods .
it also complains that beijing unfairly privileges chinese firms when it comes to contracts for automobiles , steel , semiconductors and ships .
in addition the bloc is seeking an end to rules requiring eu companies to set up joint ventures with chinese partners and wants restrictions on european investments in certain industries lifted . " there is a growing risk the eu-china trading relationship will not be seen as genuinely reciprocal , " the policy paper said .
the bloc , however , added that it preferred to resolve its differences with beijing by negotiation . chance for talks in november bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandelson will try to pursuade china to open up markets mandelson , who is due to visit china next month , commissioned the paper .
additional talks in january are scheduled to focus on a new partnership pact between brussels and beijing , but mandelson said he would also raise the worries expressed in the paper with his chinese hosts during his visit . " too often europe 's businesses meet a chinese wall rather than an open door , " mandelson said at a conference on eu-china trade and investment relations in july . trade between the eu and china more than doubled between 2000 and 2005 .
and as european workers face increasing low-wage competition , eu politicians are coming under more and more pressure to ensure a level playing field . " china must show that it is committed to embracing globalization as a two-way street , " the eu paper said . it is unusual for the eu to threaten china in this way , but it is perhaps brussels ' only option .
attempts to protect the european market with tariffs have foundered on european consumers ' desire for inexpensive chinese goods .
in september , mandelson filed the eu 's first-ever complaint , aimed at a levy on automobile parts , against china with the wto . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " china is going to overtake germany in the next few years " former german chancellor helmut schmidt will hold talks with chinese premier wen jiabao during a summit in hamburg .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 24.10.2006 recycling scam pops the lid off deposit debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a couple hundred cases left three german thieves devised a plan to make a massive return on a moderate investment , by turning in 150,000 plastic bottles for deposit .
their scam begs the question : is n't it easier to get a job ? the plan was a simple one , demanding more criminal energy than brainpower : first , manufacture plastic bottles cheaply in eastern europe and slap a fake bar code on them .
then trek the bottles into germany , where they fetch 25 euro cents -lrb- 31 us cents -rrb- apiece .
easier then printing money ?
almost .
in germany , empties can be brought to grocery or beverage stores , where they are slipped through modern machines that read the bar code , compute the value of the returns , and spit out a receipt for payment , to be picked up at the nearest cash register .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a couple hundred cases left three hardworking thieves decided to try doing just such large-scale recycling for a living in september .
they brought 150,000 ersatz grape soda bottles , made for a few cents each in lithuania , to the eastern german state of schleswig-holstein and started trying to cash in .
not according to plan but - as happens in most simple criminal plans - things went astray .
though the trio did n't wind up getting sent through a scanning machine , cartoon style ; only to pop out of the other end of a bottle conveyor , tied at the wrists and ankles with plastic six-pack rings , they did get caught before they could turn in all their empties .
the prosecuting attorney said that , had they pulled off their plan , the three men stood to clear more than 30,000 euros -lrb- $ 38,000 -rrb- .
the story set off a new round of debate over germany 's system of deposit fees .
high deposits too tempting ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scavenging for bottles pays better in germany than many other countries some argue that the 25 cent deposit is simply too high , and that such large potential sums attract scam artists and thieves .
for businesses , they say , the bottle-return situation is one big pain in the pop-top : they spent 1.5 billion euros on automated bottle-exchange machines , and operating costs are around 500 million euros a year .
currently , germany has begun using security marks on deposits that are supposed to prevent illegal returns like the schleswig-holstein scam .
but even though the system was set to go into place on oct .
1 , plenty of automated deposit machines have yet to be set up to spit out faked bottles , according to the industry newsletter lebensmittel zeitung -lrb- food industry news -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fifa and coca-cola on collision course over plastic bottles germany has done much to promote the coming world cup 's environmental aspects but its " green goal " initiative may be under threat by main sponsor coca-cola 's plan to sell plastic bottles at the tournament .

" both sides benefit from openness , " eu trade commissioner peter mandelson said in a statement .
" but china 's growing trade muscle means growing expectations .
china must fulfill its wto obligations and commit to trading fairly . " the eu is unhappy about high chinese tariffs on products like textiles and leather goods .
it also complains that beijing unfairly privileges chinese firms when it comes to contracts for automobiles , steel , semiconductors and ships .
in addition the bloc is seeking an end to rules requiring eu companies to set up joint ventures with chinese partners and wants restrictions on european investments in certain industries lifted . " there is a growing risk the eu-china trading relationship will not be seen as genuinely reciprocal , " the policy paper said .
the bloc , however , added that it preferred to resolve its differences with beijing by negotiation . chance for talks in november bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandelson will try to pursuade china to open up markets mandelson , who is due to visit china next month , commissioned the paper .
additional talks in january are scheduled to focus on a new partnership pact between brussels and beijing , but mandelson said he would also raise the worries expressed in the paper with his chinese hosts during his visit . " too often europe 's businesses meet a chinese wall rather than an open door , " mandelson said at a conference on eu-china trade and investment relations in july . trade between the eu and china more than doubled between 2000 and 2005 .
and as european workers face increasing low-wage competition , eu politicians are coming under more and more pressure to ensure a level playing field . " china must show that it is committed to embracing globalization as a two-way street , " the eu paper said . it is unusual for the eu to threaten china in this way , but it is perhaps brussels ' only option .
attempts to protect the european market with tariffs have foundered on european consumers ' desire for inexpensive chinese goods .
in september , mandelson filed the eu 's first-ever complaint , aimed at a levy on automobile parts , against china with the wto . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " china is going to overtake germany in the next few years " former german chancellor helmut schmidt will hold talks with chinese premier wen jiabao during a summit in hamburg .

what holds our society together " - presents a wide range of opinions on the topic of germany 's defining cultural values . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lammert believes , for example , that german should be declared official language in the constitution " leitkultur , " or leading culture , is a peculiarly german term .
some see in it an overarching term for a democratic culture of openness and tolerance , while others take it to be no more than a sign of elitism and narrow-minded belief in the superiority of one culture over another . " i grew up in this country with rights of freedom , civil rights and , when all is said and done , i am a constitutional patriot , " said seyran ates , a lawyer who was born in istanbul but has lived in germany since the age of nine . " that 's what i am fighting for .
and that 's why i have no problem with the phrase ' leading culture . '
i do n't define it the way some people do as the culture , which is imposed upon me by the germans , because i also contribute to this society . " integration troubles for ates , like for many others , the crucial problem in this cultural debate is the question of germany 's failure to develop a binding integration concept for its immigrant citizens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seyran ates believes germany needs a better integration policy " the german state must rise up to the responsibility of finally starting with a reasonable and serious integration policy , " ates said . according to green party politician claudia roth , a democratic society must offer participatory mechanisms to all its citizens . " muslims need legitimate constitutional structures , which make them capable of acting in a democratic process , " roth said . some of the book 's contributors , however , do not believe that the state can do everything . " we have to be sober about the fact that the state 's ability to act is limited , " said cardinal karl lehmann , chairman of the german bishops ' conference .
" the state has to rely on value-creating contributions from many groups of citizens . " an unfortunate term the very idea of german " leitkultur " is problematic for some because of the country 's fatal experience with national socialism . " calling something ' german leading culture ' has a bitter taste for our neighbors , " said actor mario adorf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for wim wenders the more pressing question is that of germany within europe german film director wim wenders described the concept of " leitkultur " as " very unfortunate " and the whole debate as " belated . "
it would be much more urgent to deal with the question of european identity , because that is the question that will preoccupy the german society much more in the future , according to wenders . a necessary debate others , however , believe that a debate on what constitutes a defining culture is absolutely necessary in the spirit of an open and honest dialogue between different cultures , and despite horrifying phenomena such as honor killings and forced marriages which occur in some segments of germany 's immigrant communities . " all that is part of a different culture , which one should be at least curious about , " said adolf muschg , who teaches german literature at the university of zurich . " we should ask ourselves : ' where does all that come from ? '
by doing that we serve again our cognitive faculty and our imagination , and we are then also ready to say : ' this is where we stop , this is where we 're drawing the line , " he said . " i believe that a civilized society does not necessarily need a leading culture : it is already one , " muschg said . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de defining a common culture - does germany need to ?
the divisive debate over a " leitkultur , " or predominant culture , has broken out in germany again .
conservatives tend to think defining the culture is important ; many on the left think it 's an attack on minorities .
-lrb- 07.11.2005 -rrb- let 's talk about " leitkultur " leading christian democrat and newly appointed parliamentary president norbert lammert says it 's time the nation took a new look at the issue of a german " leitkultur , " or leading culture .

more than 40 german intellectuals and politicians accepted the invitation by the president of the german parliament norbert lammert to contribute to a book on what constitutes germany 's " leading culture . " " i do n't have the ambition to have a new canon developed , nor do i want to amend the rights stipulated by our constitution , " lammert said .
" but there can be no reasonable doubt that we need at least an understanding of the points that keep our society together and that are propelled by our constitution . " lammert 's recently published anthology - entitled " constitution , patriotism , leading culture .
what holds our society together " - presents a wide range of opinions on the topic of germany 's defining cultural values . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lammert believes , for example , that german should be declared official language in the constitution " leitkultur , " or leading culture , is a peculiarly german term .
some see in it an overarching term for a democratic culture of openness and tolerance , while others take it to be no more than a sign of elitism and narrow-minded belief in the superiority of one culture over another . " i grew up in this country with rights of freedom , civil rights and , when all is said and done , i am a constitutional patriot , " said seyran ates , a lawyer who was born in istanbul but has lived in germany since the age of nine . " that 's what i am fighting for .
and that 's why i have no problem with the phrase ' leading culture . '
i do n't define it the way some people do as the culture , which is imposed upon me by the germans , because i also contribute to this society . " integration troubles for ates , like for many others , the crucial problem in this cultural debate is the question of germany 's failure to develop a binding integration concept for its immigrant citizens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seyran ates believes germany needs a better integration policy " the german state must rise up to the responsibility of finally starting with a reasonable and serious integration policy , " ates said . according to green party politician claudia roth , a democratic society must offer participatory mechanisms to all its citizens . " muslims need legitimate constitutional structures , which make them capable of acting in a democratic process , " roth said . some of the book 's contributors , however , do not believe that the state can do everything . " we have to be sober about the fact that the state 's ability to act is limited , " said cardinal karl lehmann , chairman of the german bishops ' conference .
" the state has to rely on value-creating contributions from many groups of citizens . " an unfortunate term the very idea of german " leitkultur " is problematic for some because of the country 's fatal experience with national socialism . " calling something ' german leading culture ' has a bitter taste for our neighbors , " said actor mario adorf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for wim wenders the more pressing question is that of germany within europe german film director wim wenders described the concept of " leitkultur " as " very unfortunate " and the whole debate as " belated . "
it would be much more urgent to deal with the question of european identity , because that is the question that will preoccupy the german society much more in the future , according to wenders . a necessary debate others , however , believe that a debate on what constitutes a defining culture is absolutely necessary in the spirit of an open and honest dialogue between different cultures , and despite horrifying phenomena such as honor killings and forced marriages which occur in some segments of germany 's immigrant communities . " all that is part of a different culture , which one should be at least curious about , " said adolf muschg , who teaches german literature at the university of zurich . " we should ask ourselves : ' where does all that come from ? '
by doing that we serve again our cognitive faculty and our imagination , and we are then also ready to say : ' this is where we stop , this is where we 're drawing the line , " he said . " i believe that a civilized society does not necessarily need a leading culture : it is already one , " muschg said . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de defining a common culture - does germany need to ?
the divisive debate over a " leitkultur , " or predominant culture , has broken out in germany again .
conservatives tend to think defining the culture is important ; many on the left think it 's an attack on minorities .
-lrb- 07.11.2005 -rrb- let 's talk about " leitkultur " leading christian democrat and newly appointed parliamentary president norbert lammert says it 's time the nation took a new look at the issue of a german " leitkultur , " or leading culture .
others in his party agree .
-lrb- 20.10.2005 -rrb- political and cultural leaders condemn opera cancellation a violent scene with images of the prophet mohammed led berlin 's german opera to take mozart 's " idomeneo " from the schedule .
the move has sparked a fierce debate on the limits of artistic freedom and religious respect .

but that does n't mean the issue is settled . the law would have allowed germany 's federal government to sell off up to 74.9 percent of the state-owned german flight security company , the dfs .
the organization employs some 5,300 people , including 1,800 air-traffic controllers . in withholding his signature from the law , which was passed by a wide parliamentary majority and with support from opposition political parties , köhler said the german constitution required the federal government to retain sovereignty over matters of public security . it was the first time that köhler has declared legislation passed by germany 's two parliamentary bodies , the bundestag and the bundesrat , unconstitutional .
a largely ceremonial position , the german president generally stays out of daily political discussions but is required to sign laws before the can take effect . state duty or single european sky bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler says the law is simply unconstiutional opponents of the law welcomed köhler 's move . " the president has reached a landmark decision , " said peter heesen , the head of the german civil servants association , which represents many of the dfs 's employees .
" it 's an important contribution to the debate about what the state 's sovereign duties are and must continue to be in the future . " hans-rudolf wöhrl , the owner of small german carrier ltu airlines , also said he thought köhler made the right choice .
the sale , he said , " would have been tantamount to a hike in fees since a private investor would have demanded a profit . " but proponents of the law , while saying they understood köhler 's reasoning , continued to argue for the benefits of privatization .
the german government maintains that the sale is essential in efforts to create a " single european sky , " eradicating the national borders that complicate air traffic control in europe . lufthansa spokesman stefan schaffrath said privatization would allow for the start of a system of incentives that would improve air traffic control performance .
schaffrath said he hoped the constitution would be changed , pointing out that köhler himself had mentioned that possibility in his decision . conservative air safety expert norbert königshofen said the government would now examine a variety of options , including the sale of a smaller percentage of the dfs .
for now , air traffic control remains in public hands , but it could still be privatized in the future . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german rail workers ' warning strike causing delays in the midst of a privatization dispute with the government , german rail workers walked off their jobs on friday morning , causing transportation delays in three states .

their scam begs the question : is n't it easier to get a job ? the plan was a simple one , demanding more criminal energy than brainpower : first , manufacture plastic bottles cheaply in eastern europe and slap a fake bar code on them .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.10.2006 schröder 's memoirs anger some , bore many großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2005 , schröder was chancellor - now he 's an author trade union leaders and conservatives may be irritated by excerpts from the former chancellor 's memoirs , but the german press says by and large there 's little to get excited about . when gerhard schröder officially launches his 544-page volume of memoirs , entitled decisions : my life in politics , at the social democrats ' berlin headquarters on thursday , he 'll be introduced by luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker .
the choice of a foreign leader - and a conservative - for this role speaks volumes about the former chancellor 's uneasy relationship with the party he used to lead .
and to judge from initial reactions to what he 's written , decisions is unlikely to make him many new friends . as the pr machine gears up to promote the book , union leaders and some conservative politicians have taken exception to some of schröder 's opinions .
but critics say decisions merely reinforces schröder 's previous image as a pragmatic , media-savvy strategist who lacked grand visions - and whose tendency toward arrogance led to his political defeat . enemies on the left and the right bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder 's most popular decision was against the iraq war in excerpts from the book , pre-published simultaneously in germany 's most respected weekly news magazine and its largest tabloid daily , schröder said resistance from unions to his agenda 2010 reform program helped doom his re-election campaign in 2005 .
predictably , that has n't sat well with the social democrats ' traditional political allies on the left . the head of germany 's trade unions association , michael sommer was n't long in shooting back . " gerhard schröder should note the fact that he lost 10 elections with his policies , " sommer said .
" that 's why he 's no longer chancellor . " meanwhile , conservatives are piqued at remarks schröder made in interviews , in which he criticized his successor in office , the christian democratic union 's angela merkel , for showing weak leadership . " i think the criticism is wrong and also ignoble of him , " retorted the conservative state premier of baden-württemberg , günther oettinger .
" we had plenty of his authoritarian style and it did n't produce any results . " given the wide-spread opposition in germany to the american-led war in iraq , the most popular parts of the book will probably be those in which schröder criticizes us president george w. bush 's religiosity .
schröder 's decision not to support the iraq war is indeed likely to go down as his most positively viewed political legacy . yawns from the german press bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder now has a lucrative post with a russian gas giant for the most part , the german media , including a number of regional newspapers , are n't buying the hype surrounding decisions .
the daily kieler nachrichten commented , " much of this is trivial , the self-reflections of an aging man who is having difficulty dealing with the loss of power . " the westfälischer anzeiger concurred : " a man of power , who was already thoroughly vain during his time in office , has shed some lucrative tears over a purportedly better era .
that can be informative and entertaining , but it 's no reason to get angry or mourn along with him . " hanover 's neue presse drew a parallel between the shortcomings of schröder memoirs and his failings as chancellor .
" he 's certainly allowed to settle some old accounts .
but if he had anything wise to say about the future direction of the republic , he 'd still be in power . " the neue osnabrücker zeitung agreed : " schröder failed because of his own flaws and what he neglected to do .
he squandered years in office with pragmatic , but directionless politics . " schröder wrote his memoirs in less than a year , record time for an ex-chancellor , and while the consensus may be that they generate little heat and even less light , he 's unlikely to be too bothered .
the german branch of the on-line bookseller amazon says schröder 's decisions currently tops its list of advance-ordered books . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " divine guidance has no place in western politics " gerhard schröder is publishing his memoirs this week and many dw readers agreed with the former german chancellor 's criticism of us president bush 's religious approach to politics .

two suspects were arrested in connection with the failed attempts , one of them was a 21-year-old lebanese man who had been studying in germany . the two men who vouched for the lebanese student apparently were not investigated by officials providing visas , though police already had their eye on the two . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " foreign students seek out very specific courses of study at german universities " jutta graf , a spokeswoman on migration policies for the opposition green parliamentary party , said the attempted bomb attacks make the wish for more thorough investigations of foreign students ' guarantors understandable , but added that there is a fine line between anti-terror measures and the right to freedom and privacy . " collecting more data is not necessarily the answer , " said graf . since police were already suspicious of the two people vouching for the lebanese student in germany , that information should have been passed on , graf said . " communication is key and more cooperation between agencies is necessary , " she added . keeping foreign students coming tougher immigration laws will deter potential foreign students from studying here , graf said , and pointed to a general sense of mistrust toward foreign nationals in germany . " it must remain clear that germany wants young students from abroad , " volker beck , head of the green parliamentary group , said recently .
" this is decisive for germany as an academic center . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : studying abroad is for some the chance of a lifetime the spd 's dieter wiefelspütz told spiegel online that while germany " should remain an open and cosmopolitan nation , security is essential . " german universities have a good reputation abroad and foreign students come to germany for specific courses of study .
" while i can understand anti-terror measures , " wille said , " it would be a shame to deter qualified students from coming here . " not only students affected by new laws tougher immigration laws are not only to affect students .
the coalition government has revoked plans to ease gaining residency status in germany for highly qualified academics and scientists and is considering limitations for husbands and wives who wish to join their foreign spouses in germany . the german government is in a hurry to get the tougher immigration laws passed after a deadline for installing eight european union directives on immigration expired on oct .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.10.2006 schröder 's memoirs anger some , bore many großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2005 , schröder was chancellor - now he 's an author trade union leaders and conservatives may be irritated by excerpts from the former chancellor 's memoirs , but the german press says by and large there 's little to get excited about . when gerhard schröder officially launches his 544-page volume of memoirs , entitled decisions : my life in politics , at the social democrats ' berlin headquarters on thursday , he 'll be introduced by luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker .
the choice of a foreign leader - and a conservative - for this role speaks volumes about the former chancellor 's uneasy relationship with the party he used to lead .
and to judge from initial reactions to what he 's written , decisions is unlikely to make him many new friends . as the pr machine gears up to promote the book , union leaders and some conservative politicians have taken exception to some of schröder 's opinions .
but critics say decisions merely reinforces schröder 's previous image as a pragmatic , media-savvy strategist who lacked grand visions - and whose tendency toward arrogance led to his political defeat . enemies on the left and the right bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder 's most popular decision was against the iraq war in excerpts from the book , pre-published simultaneously in germany 's most respected weekly news magazine and its largest tabloid daily , schröder said resistance from unions to his agenda 2010 reform program helped doom his re-election campaign in 2005 .
predictably , that has n't sat well with the social democrats ' traditional political allies on the left . the head of germany 's trade unions association , michael sommer was n't long in shooting back . " gerhard schröder should note the fact that he lost 10 elections with his policies , " sommer said .
" that 's why he 's no longer chancellor . " meanwhile , conservatives are piqued at remarks schröder made in interviews , in which he criticized his successor in office , the christian democratic union 's angela merkel , for showing weak leadership . " i think the criticism is wrong and also ignoble of him , " retorted the conservative state premier of baden-württemberg , günther oettinger .
" we had plenty of his authoritarian style and it did n't produce any results . " given the wide-spread opposition in germany to the american-led war in iraq , the most popular parts of the book will probably be those in which schröder criticizes us president george w. bush 's religiosity .
schröder 's decision not to support the iraq war is indeed likely to go down as his most positively viewed political legacy . yawns from the german press bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder now has a lucrative post with a russian gas giant for the most part , the german media , including a number of regional newspapers , are n't buying the hype surrounding decisions .
the daily kieler nachrichten commented , " much of this is trivial , the self-reflections of an aging man who is having difficulty dealing with the loss of power . " the westfälischer anzeiger concurred : " a man of power , who was already thoroughly vain during his time in office , has shed some lucrative tears over a purportedly better era .
that can be informative and entertaining , but it 's no reason to get angry or mourn along with him . " hanover 's neue presse drew a parallel between the shortcomings of schröder memoirs and his failings as chancellor .
" he 's certainly allowed to settle some old accounts .
but if he had anything wise to say about the future direction of the republic , he 'd still be in power . " the neue osnabrücker zeitung agreed : " schröder failed because of his own flaws and what he neglected to do .
he squandered years in office with pragmatic , but directionless politics . " schröder wrote his memoirs in less than a year , record time for an ex-chancellor , and while the consensus may be that they generate little heat and even less light , he 's unlikely to be too bothered .
the german branch of the on-line bookseller amazon says schröder 's decisions currently tops its list of advance-ordered books . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " divine guidance has no place in western politics " gerhard schröder is publishing his memoirs this week and many dw readers agreed with the former german chancellor 's criticism of us president bush 's religious approach to politics .

but that does n't mean the issue is settled . the law would have allowed germany 's federal government to sell off up to 74.9 percent of the state-owned german flight security company , the dfs .
the organization employs some 5,300 people , including 1,800 air-traffic controllers . in withholding his signature from the law , which was passed by a wide parliamentary majority and with support from opposition political parties , köhler said the german constitution required the federal government to retain sovereignty over matters of public security . it was the first time that köhler has declared legislation passed by germany 's two parliamentary bodies , the bundestag and the bundesrat , unconstitutional .
a largely ceremonial position , the german president generally stays out of daily political discussions but is required to sign laws before the can take effect . state duty or single european sky bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler says the law is simply unconstiutional opponents of the law welcomed köhler 's move .

" it 's an important contribution to the debate about what the state 's sovereign duties are and must continue to be in the future . " hans-rudolf wöhrl , the owner of small german carrier ltu airlines , also said he thought köhler made the right choice .
the sale , he said , " would have been tantamount to a hike in fees since a private investor would have demanded a profit . " but proponents of the law , while saying they understood köhler 's reasoning , continued to argue for the benefits of privatization .
the german government maintains that the sale is essential in efforts to create a " single european sky , " eradicating the national borders that complicate air traffic control in europe . lufthansa spokesman stefan schaffrath said privatization would allow for the start of a system of incentives that would improve air traffic control performance .
schaffrath said he hoped the constitution would be changed , pointing out that köhler himself had mentioned that possibility in his decision . conservative air safety expert norbert königshofen said the government would now examine a variety of options , including the sale of a smaller percentage of the dfs .

the organization employs some 5,300 people , including 1,800 air-traffic controllers . in withholding his signature from the law , which was passed by a wide parliamentary majority and with support from opposition political parties , köhler said the german constitution required the federal government to retain sovereignty over matters of public security . it was the first time that köhler has declared legislation passed by germany 's two parliamentary bodies , the bundestag and the bundesrat , unconstitutional .

the sale , he said , " would have been tantamount to a hike in fees since a private investor would have demanded a profit . " but proponents of the law , while saying they understood köhler 's reasoning , continued to argue for the benefits of privatization .
the german government maintains that the sale is essential in efforts to create a " single european sky , " eradicating the national borders that complicate air traffic control in europe . lufthansa spokesman stefan schaffrath said privatization would allow for the start of a system of incentives that would improve air traffic control performance .
schaffrath said he hoped the constitution would be changed , pointing out that köhler himself had mentioned that possibility in his decision . conservative air safety expert norbert königshofen said the government would now examine a variety of options , including the sale of a smaller percentage of the dfs .

more than 40 german intellectuals and politicians accepted the invitation by the president of the german parliament norbert lammert to contribute to a book on what constitutes germany 's " leading culture . " " i do n't have the ambition to have a new canon developed , nor do i want to amend the rights stipulated by our constitution , " lammert said .
" but there can be no reasonable doubt that we need at least an understanding of the points that keep our society together and that are propelled by our constitution . " lammert 's recently published anthology - entitled " constitution , patriotism , leading culture .
what holds our society together " - presents a wide range of opinions on the topic of germany 's defining cultural values . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lammert believes , for example , that german should be declared official language in the constitution " leitkultur , " or leading culture , is a peculiarly german term .
some see in it an overarching term for a democratic culture of openness and tolerance , while others take it to be no more than a sign of elitism and narrow-minded belief in the superiority of one culture over another . " i grew up in this country with rights of freedom , civil rights and , when all is said and done , i am a constitutional patriot , " said seyran ates , a lawyer who was born in istanbul but has lived in germany since the age of nine . " that 's what i am fighting for .
and that 's why i have no problem with the phrase ' leading culture . '
i do n't define it the way some people do as the culture , which is imposed upon me by the germans , because i also contribute to this society . " integration troubles for ates , like for many others , the crucial problem in this cultural debate is the question of germany 's failure to develop a binding integration concept for its immigrant citizens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seyran ates believes germany needs a better integration policy " the german state must rise up to the responsibility of finally starting with a reasonable and serious integration policy , " ates said . according to green party politician claudia roth , a democratic society must offer participatory mechanisms to all its citizens . " muslims need legitimate constitutional structures , which make them capable of acting in a democratic process , " roth said . some of the book 's contributors , however , do not believe that the state can do everything . " we have to be sober about the fact that the state 's ability to act is limited , " said cardinal karl lehmann , chairman of the german bishops ' conference .
" the state has to rely on value-creating contributions from many groups of citizens . " an unfortunate term the very idea of german " leitkultur " is problematic for some because of the country 's fatal experience with national socialism . " calling something ' german leading culture ' has a bitter taste for our neighbors , " said actor mario adorf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for wim wenders the more pressing question is that of germany within europe german film director wim wenders described the concept of " leitkultur " as " very unfortunate " and the whole debate as " belated . "
it would be much more urgent to deal with the question of european identity , because that is the question that will preoccupy the german society much more in the future , according to wenders . a necessary debate others , however , believe that a debate on what constitutes a defining culture is absolutely necessary in the spirit of an open and honest dialogue between different cultures , and despite horrifying phenomena such as honor killings and forced marriages which occur in some segments of germany 's immigrant communities . " all that is part of a different culture , which one should be at least curious about , " said adolf muschg , who teaches german literature at the university of zurich . " we should ask ourselves : ' where does all that come from ? '
by doing that we serve again our cognitive faculty and our imagination , and we are then also ready to say : ' this is where we stop , this is where we 're drawing the line , " he said . " i believe that a civilized society does not necessarily need a leading culture : it is already one , " muschg said . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de defining a common culture - does germany need to ?

but that does n't mean the issue is settled . the law would have allowed germany 's federal government to sell off up to 74.9 percent of the state-owned german flight security company , the dfs .
the organization employs some 5,300 people , including 1,800 air-traffic controllers . in withholding his signature from the law , which was passed by a wide parliamentary majority and with support from opposition political parties , köhler said the german constitution required the federal government to retain sovereignty over matters of public security . it was the first time that köhler has declared legislation passed by germany 's two parliamentary bodies , the bundestag and the bundesrat , unconstitutional .
a largely ceremonial position , the german president generally stays out of daily political discussions but is required to sign laws before the can take effect . state duty or single european sky bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler says the law is simply unconstiutional opponents of the law welcomed köhler 's move . " the president has reached a landmark decision , " said peter heesen , the head of the german civil servants association , which represents many of the dfs 's employees .
" it 's an important contribution to the debate about what the state 's sovereign duties are and must continue to be in the future . " hans-rudolf wöhrl , the owner of small german carrier ltu airlines , also said he thought köhler made the right choice .
the sale , he said , " would have been tantamount to a hike in fees since a private investor would have demanded a profit . " but proponents of the law , while saying they understood köhler 's reasoning , continued to argue for the benefits of privatization .
the german government maintains that the sale is essential in efforts to create a " single european sky , " eradicating the national borders that complicate air traffic control in europe . lufthansa spokesman stefan schaffrath said privatization would allow for the start of a system of incentives that would improve air traffic control performance .
schaffrath said he hoped the constitution would be changed , pointing out that köhler himself had mentioned that possibility in his decision . conservative air safety expert norbert königshofen said the government would now examine a variety of options , including the sale of a smaller percentage of the dfs .
for now , air traffic control remains in public hands , but it could still be privatized in the future . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german rail workers ' warning strike causing delays in the midst of a privatization dispute with the government , german rail workers walked off their jobs on friday morning , causing transportation delays in three states .

more than 40 german intellectuals and politicians accepted the invitation by the president of the german parliament norbert lammert to contribute to a book on what constitutes germany 's " leading culture . " " i do n't have the ambition to have a new canon developed , nor do i want to amend the rights stipulated by our constitution , " lammert said .
" but there can be no reasonable doubt that we need at least an understanding of the points that keep our society together and that are propelled by our constitution . " lammert 's recently published anthology - entitled " constitution , patriotism , leading culture .
what holds our society together " - presents a wide range of opinions on the topic of germany 's defining cultural values . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lammert believes , for example , that german should be declared official language in the constitution " leitkultur , " or leading culture , is a peculiarly german term .
some see in it an overarching term for a democratic culture of openness and tolerance , while others take it to be no more than a sign of elitism and narrow-minded belief in the superiority of one culture over another . " i grew up in this country with rights of freedom , civil rights and , when all is said and done , i am a constitutional patriot , " said seyran ates , a lawyer who was born in istanbul but has lived in germany since the age of nine . " that 's what i am fighting for .
and that 's why i have no problem with the phrase ' leading culture . '
i do n't define it the way some people do as the culture , which is imposed upon me by the germans , because i also contribute to this society . " integration troubles for ates , like for many others , the crucial problem in this cultural debate is the question of germany 's failure to develop a binding integration concept for its immigrant citizens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seyran ates believes germany needs a better integration policy " the german state must rise up to the responsibility of finally starting with a reasonable and serious integration policy , " ates said . according to green party politician claudia roth , a democratic society must offer participatory mechanisms to all its citizens . " muslims need legitimate constitutional structures , which make them capable of acting in a democratic process , " roth said . some of the book 's contributors , however , do not believe that the state can do everything . " we have to be sober about the fact that the state 's ability to act is limited , " said cardinal karl lehmann , chairman of the german bishops ' conference .
" the state has to rely on value-creating contributions from many groups of citizens . " an unfortunate term the very idea of german " leitkultur " is problematic for some because of the country 's fatal experience with national socialism . " calling something ' german leading culture ' has a bitter taste for our neighbors , " said actor mario adorf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for wim wenders the more pressing question is that of germany within europe german film director wim wenders described the concept of " leitkultur " as " very unfortunate " and the whole debate as " belated . "
it would be much more urgent to deal with the question of european identity , because that is the question that will preoccupy the german society much more in the future , according to wenders . a necessary debate others , however , believe that a debate on what constitutes a defining culture is absolutely necessary in the spirit of an open and honest dialogue between different cultures , and despite horrifying phenomena such as honor killings and forced marriages which occur in some segments of germany 's immigrant communities . " all that is part of a different culture , which one should be at least curious about , " said adolf muschg , who teaches german literature at the university of zurich . " we should ask ourselves : ' where does all that come from ? '
by doing that we serve again our cognitive faculty and our imagination , and we are then also ready to say : ' this is where we stop , this is where we 're drawing the line , " he said . " i believe that a civilized society does not necessarily need a leading culture : it is already one , " muschg said . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de defining a common culture - does germany need to ?
the divisive debate over a " leitkultur , " or predominant culture , has broken out in germany again .
conservatives tend to think defining the culture is important ; many on the left think it 's an attack on minorities .

"
it would be much more urgent to deal with the question of european identity , because that is the question that will preoccupy the german society much more in the future , according to wenders . a necessary debate others , however , believe that a debate on what constitutes a defining culture is absolutely necessary in the spirit of an open and honest dialogue between different cultures , and despite horrifying phenomena such as honor killings and forced marriages which occur in some segments of germany 's immigrant communities . " all that is part of a different culture , which one should be at least curious about , " said adolf muschg , who teaches german literature at the university of zurich . " we should ask ourselves : ' where does all that come from ? '
by doing that we serve again our cognitive faculty and our imagination , and we are then also ready to say : ' this is where we stop , this is where we 're drawing the line , " he said .

" sporadic alcohol excesses , under-age consumption and drunk driving are real public health problems in europe , especially among young people , " eu health commissioner marko kyprianou told journalists on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kyprianou said he sees alcoholism as a threat to public health " the commission is not aiming at moderate alcohol consumption , " he said . the eu remains the heaviest drinking region in the world , with 55 million adults estimated to drink at harmful levels . " binge drinking is the big problem of the european union , " kyprianou said .
" overall , there are fewer people who drink , but those who drink , drink more . " taking into account europe 's wide cultural differences when it comes to alcohol , the eu 's executive arm listed a number of areas of concern and laid out a strategy to target them through to 2012 . " harmful and hazardous alcohol consumption is a key health determinant and one of the main causes of premature death and avoidable disease , " the commission said in its document . " young people in the eu are particularly at risk , as over 10 percent of female mortality and around 25 percent of male mortality in the 15-29 age group is related to hazardous alcohol consumption , " it said .
" the proportion of youth and young adults with harmful and hazardous consumption patterns has increased in many member states over the last 10 years . " watered-down ambitions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there will be no eu-wide warning labels for alcoholic beverages the document called on the alcohol beverage and retail industry to ensure that alcoholic drinks are consumed responsibly , particularly by young people , for example by reducing " two-drinks-for-one " offers . it placed a premium on education , noting that lifestyle choices at a young age have a widespread affect on health as an adult , and urged a better use of media awareness campaigns . but the document was a watered-down version of the commission 's ambitions in 2004 .
it also stepped back from recommendations made in a study it paid for that urged eu countries to put warning labels on bottles containing alcohol . " i am surprised by the aggressiveness with which one part of the alcohol industry lobbied against our strategy , " kyprianou said . proposal not concrete enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people are especially affected by rampant alcoholism the commission now suggests that the eu " explore " whether it would be useful to come up with a common approach " to provide adequate consumer information . " " there 's nothing left in it but air , " said german parliamentarian and consumer protection expert dagmar roth-behrend . " once again , the commission has wasted a lot of work , a lot of money and a lot of time to come up with a document that has nothing concrete in it , " she said at the european parliament in strasbourg . the strategy communication document made no attempt to explain what it meant by " hazardous alcohol consumption " nor did it say how many glasses of a beverage would constitute too many . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de good news for pilsner fans in germany as germany grapples with the challenges of reforming the country 's health care , welfare , educational systems and tax code , finance minister peer steinbrück apparently knows where the priorities really lie .

" sporadic alcohol excesses , under-age consumption and drunk driving are real public health problems in europe , especially among young people , " eu health commissioner marko kyprianou told journalists on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kyprianou said he sees alcoholism as a threat to public health " the commission is not aiming at moderate alcohol consumption , " he said . the eu remains the heaviest drinking region in the world , with 55 million adults estimated to drink at harmful levels . " binge drinking is the big problem of the european union , " kyprianou said .
" overall , there are fewer people who drink , but those who drink , drink more . " taking into account europe 's wide cultural differences when it comes to alcohol , the eu 's executive arm listed a number of areas of concern and laid out a strategy to target them through to 2012 . " harmful and hazardous alcohol consumption is a key health determinant and one of the main causes of premature death and avoidable disease , " the commission said in its document . " young people in the eu are particularly at risk , as over 10 percent of female mortality and around 25 percent of male mortality in the 15-29 age group is related to hazardous alcohol consumption , " it said .
" the proportion of youth and young adults with harmful and hazardous consumption patterns has increased in many member states over the last 10 years . " watered-down ambitions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there will be no eu-wide warning labels for alcoholic beverages the document called on the alcohol beverage and retail industry to ensure that alcoholic drinks are consumed responsibly , particularly by young people , for example by reducing " two-drinks-for-one " offers . it placed a premium on education , noting that lifestyle choices at a young age have a widespread affect on health as an adult , and urged a better use of media awareness campaigns . but the document was a watered-down version of the commission 's ambitions in 2004 .
it also stepped back from recommendations made in a study it paid for that urged eu countries to put warning labels on bottles containing alcohol . " i am surprised by the aggressiveness with which one part of the alcohol industry lobbied against our strategy , " kyprianou said . proposal not concrete enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people are especially affected by rampant alcoholism the commission now suggests that the eu " explore " whether it would be useful to come up with a common approach " to provide adequate consumer information . " " there 's nothing left in it but air , " said german parliamentarian and consumer protection expert dagmar roth-behrend . " once again , the commission has wasted a lot of work , a lot of money and a lot of time to come up with a document that has nothing concrete in it , " she said at the european parliament in strasbourg . the strategy communication document made no attempt to explain what it meant by " hazardous alcohol consumption " nor did it say how many glasses of a beverage would constitute too many . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de good news for pilsner fans in germany as germany grapples with the challenges of reforming the country 's health care , welfare , educational systems and tax code , finance minister peer steinbrück apparently knows where the priorities really lie .

however , when it comes to altering laws regarding foreigners , the socials democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- - who were forced into a grand coalition government last year - seem to be on a decisive path . over the next few weeks , the spd and cdu are expected to draft a bill that would tighten entry regulations for foreign students and implement eu directives on asylum and residency rights . " i 'm confident that we 'll come to a viable agreement soon , " dieter wiefelspütz , spokesperson on domestic issues for the spd , told the online version of germany 's der spiegel news magazine . foreign students eyeing germany as a possible place to study may now think twice now , said christiane wille , an advisor at the university of cologne 's international relations office . " if students have to wait too long to get their visas to study here , they miss the enrollment date for classes and then have to postpone their studies by a semester , " wille said . some students are already having difficulty getting their studies started .
muslim students have frequently had to wait longer for their visas to study in germany as more intense checks have occurred since the sept .
11 terrorist attacks in the us , wille said . visas expire after one year instead of two bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of foreign students seek the hallowed halls of german universities each year a working group of experts on domestic issues - four each from the spd and the cdu - have apparently already fleshed out the tougher regulations , including stricter background checks for foreign students . but wille said she doubted the efficiency of prolonged looks into the pasts of students who have proved their academic abilities . " students who are accepted by our university already must prove their accomplishments when they apply , " she said .
" they are generally very qualified , otherwise they would n't be accepted in the first place . " new restrictions would also limit study visas to one year from the current two , and germany 's nearly 250,000 foreign students would have to report more regularly to local government offices . however , wille said the limitation from two years to one wo n't change the situation much since most of the nearly 6,000 foreign students at the university of cologne only have one-year visas anyway , with students who wish to stay longer needing to extend their visas . that 's because a foreign student must show proof of a 7,000 euro -lrb- $ 8,700 -rrb- deposit on a bank account for each year of study in germany and " few students have 14,000 euros on a bank account , " wille said . other new regulations would see more thorough checks of guarantors or sponsors in germany for foreign students in their visa applications . " we want to make it legally possible to investigate those people vouching for foreign students here , " wolfgang bosbach , deputy parliamentary group leader of the cdu , told german public broadcaster ard . security vs. civil rights some of the proposed restrictions stem largely from failed terrorist attacks on two german trains in july .
two suspects were arrested in connection with the failed attempts , one of them was a 21-year-old lebanese man who had been studying in germany . the two men who vouched for the lebanese student apparently were not investigated by officials providing visas , though police already had their eye on the two . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " foreign students seek out very specific courses of study at german universities " jutta graf , a spokeswoman on migration policies for the opposition green parliamentary party , said the attempted bomb attacks make the wish for more thorough investigations of foreign students ' guarantors understandable , but added that there is a fine line between anti-terror measures and the right to freedom and privacy . " collecting more data is not necessarily the answer , " said graf . since police were already suspicious of the two people vouching for the lebanese student in germany , that information should have been passed on , graf said . " communication is key and more cooperation between agencies is necessary , " she added . keeping foreign students coming tougher immigration laws will deter potential foreign students from studying here , graf said , and pointed to a general sense of mistrust toward foreign nationals in germany . " it must remain clear that germany wants young students from abroad , " volker beck , head of the green parliamentary group , said recently .
" this is decisive for germany as an academic center . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : studying abroad is for some the chance of a lifetime the spd 's dieter wiefelspütz told spiegel online that while germany " should remain an open and cosmopolitan nation , security is essential . " german universities have a good reputation abroad and foreign students come to germany for specific courses of study .
" while i can understand anti-terror measures , " wille said , " it would be a shame to deter qualified students from coming here . " not only students affected by new laws tougher immigration laws are not only to affect students .
the coalition government has revoked plans to ease gaining residency status in germany for highly qualified academics and scientists and is considering limitations for husbands and wives who wish to join their foreign spouses in germany . the german government is in a hurry to get the tougher immigration laws passed after a deadline for installing eight european union directives on immigration expired on oct .

brussels is currently preparing legal action against germany for not implementing the directives , which could result in hefty fines for the delays . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany industry calls for reform of immigration policy the german economy is suffering from a shortage of skilled labor , something business leaders have warned of for years .

but that does n't mean the issue is settled . the law would have allowed germany 's federal government to sell off up to 74.9 percent of the state-owned german flight security company , the dfs .
the organization employs some 5,300 people , including 1,800 air-traffic controllers . in withholding his signature from the law , which was passed by a wide parliamentary majority and with support from opposition political parties , köhler said the german constitution required the federal government to retain sovereignty over matters of public security . it was the first time that köhler has declared legislation passed by germany 's two parliamentary bodies , the bundestag and the bundesrat , unconstitutional .
a largely ceremonial position , the german president generally stays out of daily political discussions but is required to sign laws before the can take effect . state duty or single european sky bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler says the law is simply unconstiutional opponents of the law welcomed köhler 's move . " the president has reached a landmark decision , " said peter heesen , the head of the german civil servants association , which represents many of the dfs 's employees .
" it 's an important contribution to the debate about what the state 's sovereign duties are and must continue to be in the future . " hans-rudolf wöhrl , the owner of small german carrier ltu airlines , also said he thought köhler made the right choice .
the sale , he said , " would have been tantamount to a hike in fees since a private investor would have demanded a profit . " but proponents of the law , while saying they understood köhler 's reasoning , continued to argue for the benefits of privatization .
the german government maintains that the sale is essential in efforts to create a " single european sky , " eradicating the national borders that complicate air traffic control in europe . lufthansa spokesman stefan schaffrath said privatization would allow for the start of a system of incentives that would improve air traffic control performance .
schaffrath said he hoped the constitution would be changed , pointing out that köhler himself had mentioned that possibility in his decision . conservative air safety expert norbert königshofen said the government would now examine a variety of options , including the sale of a smaller percentage of the dfs .
for now , air traffic control remains in public hands , but it could still be privatized in the future . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german rail workers ' warning strike causing delays in the midst of a privatization dispute with the government , german rail workers walked off their jobs on friday morning , causing transportation delays in three states .

their scam begs the question : is n't it easier to get a job ? the plan was a simple one , demanding more criminal energy than brainpower : first , manufacture plastic bottles cheaply in eastern europe and slap a fake bar code on them .
then trek the bottles into germany , where they fetch 25 euro cents -lrb- 31 us cents -rrb- apiece .
easier then printing money ?
almost .
in germany , empties can be brought to grocery or beverage stores , where they are slipped through modern machines that read the bar code , compute the value of the returns , and spit out a receipt for payment , to be picked up at the nearest cash register .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a couple hundred cases left three hardworking thieves decided to try doing just such large-scale recycling for a living in september .
they brought 150,000 ersatz grape soda bottles , made for a few cents each in lithuania , to the eastern german state of schleswig-holstein and started trying to cash in .
not according to plan but - as happens in most simple criminal plans - things went astray .
though the trio did n't wind up getting sent through a scanning machine , cartoon style ; only to pop out of the other end of a bottle conveyor , tied at the wrists and ankles with plastic six-pack rings , they did get caught before they could turn in all their empties .
the prosecuting attorney said that , had they pulled off their plan , the three men stood to clear more than 30,000 euros -lrb- $ 38,000 -rrb- .
the story set off a new round of debate over germany 's system of deposit fees .
high deposits too tempting ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scavenging for bottles pays better in germany than many other countries some argue that the 25 cent deposit is simply too high , and that such large potential sums attract scam artists and thieves .
for businesses , they say , the bottle-return situation is one big pain in the pop-top : they spent 1.5 billion euros on automated bottle-exchange machines , and operating costs are around 500 million euros a year .
currently , germany has begun using security marks on deposits that are supposed to prevent illegal returns like the schleswig-holstein scam .
but even though the system was set to go into place on oct .
1 , plenty of automated deposit machines have yet to be set up to spit out faked bottles , according to the industry newsletter lebensmittel zeitung -lrb- food industry news -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fifa and coca-cola on collision course over plastic bottles germany has done much to promote the coming world cup 's environmental aspects but its " green goal " initiative may be under threat by main sponsor coca-cola 's plan to sell plastic bottles at the tournament .
-lrb- 21.11.2005 -rrb- germany starts chipping away at mountain of electronic junk as of friday , germans could no longer just throw their old phones , computers or coffee makers in the trashcan out back .
a new recycling system for electronics has been kicked off and manufacturers are getting the bill .
-lrb- 30.03.2006 -rrb- clouds over coke in germany last year was rough for coca-cola in germany : the company 's market share dropped significantly , largely because officials refused to change the shape of coke bottles .

but that does n't mean the issue is settled . the law would have allowed germany 's federal government to sell off up to 74.9 percent of the state-owned german flight security company , the dfs .
the organization employs some 5,300 people , including 1,800 air-traffic controllers . in withholding his signature from the law , which was passed by a wide parliamentary majority and with support from opposition political parties , köhler said the german constitution required the federal government to retain sovereignty over matters of public security . it was the first time that köhler has declared legislation passed by germany 's two parliamentary bodies , the bundestag and the bundesrat , unconstitutional .

" it 's an important contribution to the debate about what the state 's sovereign duties are and must continue to be in the future . " hans-rudolf wöhrl , the owner of small german carrier ltu airlines , also said he thought köhler made the right choice .
the sale , he said , " would have been tantamount to a hike in fees since a private investor would have demanded a profit . " but proponents of the law , while saying they understood köhler 's reasoning , continued to argue for the benefits of privatization .
the german government maintains that the sale is essential in efforts to create a " single european sky , " eradicating the national borders that complicate air traffic control in europe . lufthansa spokesman stefan schaffrath said privatization would allow for the start of a system of incentives that would improve air traffic control performance .
schaffrath said he hoped the constitution would be changed , pointing out that köhler himself had mentioned that possibility in his decision . conservative air safety expert norbert königshofen said the government would now examine a variety of options , including the sale of a smaller percentage of the dfs .

more than 40 german intellectuals and politicians accepted the invitation by the president of the german parliament norbert lammert to contribute to a book on what constitutes germany 's " leading culture . " " i do n't have the ambition to have a new canon developed , nor do i want to amend the rights stipulated by our constitution , " lammert said .
" but there can be no reasonable doubt that we need at least an understanding of the points that keep our society together and that are propelled by our constitution . " lammert 's recently published anthology - entitled " constitution , patriotism , leading culture .
what holds our society together " - presents a wide range of opinions on the topic of germany 's defining cultural values . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lammert believes , for example , that german should be declared official language in the constitution " leitkultur , " or leading culture , is a peculiarly german term .
some see in it an overarching term for a democratic culture of openness and tolerance , while others take it to be no more than a sign of elitism and narrow-minded belief in the superiority of one culture over another . " i grew up in this country with rights of freedom , civil rights and , when all is said and done , i am a constitutional patriot , " said seyran ates , a lawyer who was born in istanbul but has lived in germany since the age of nine . " that 's what i am fighting for .

" both sides benefit from openness , " eu trade commissioner peter mandelson said in a statement .
" but china 's growing trade muscle means growing expectations .
china must fulfill its wto obligations and commit to trading fairly . " the eu is unhappy about high chinese tariffs on products like textiles and leather goods .
it also complains that beijing unfairly privileges chinese firms when it comes to contracts for automobiles , steel , semiconductors and ships .
in addition the bloc is seeking an end to rules requiring eu companies to set up joint ventures with chinese partners and wants restrictions on european investments in certain industries lifted . " there is a growing risk the eu-china trading relationship will not be seen as genuinely reciprocal , " the policy paper said .
the bloc , however , added that it preferred to resolve its differences with beijing by negotiation . chance for talks in november bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandelson will try to pursuade china to open up markets mandelson , who is due to visit china next month , commissioned the paper .
additional talks in january are scheduled to focus on a new partnership pact between brussels and beijing , but mandelson said he would also raise the worries expressed in the paper with his chinese hosts during his visit . " too often europe 's businesses meet a chinese wall rather than an open door , " mandelson said at a conference on eu-china trade and investment relations in july . trade between the eu and china more than doubled between 2000 and 2005 .
and as european workers face increasing low-wage competition , eu politicians are coming under more and more pressure to ensure a level playing field . " china must show that it is committed to embracing globalization as a two-way street , " the eu paper said . it is unusual for the eu to threaten china in this way , but it is perhaps brussels ' only option .
attempts to protect the european market with tariffs have foundered on european consumers ' desire for inexpensive chinese goods .
in september , mandelson filed the eu 's first-ever complaint , aimed at a levy on automobile parts , against china with the wto . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " china is going to overtake germany in the next few years " former german chancellor helmut schmidt will hold talks with chinese premier wen jiabao during a summit in hamburg .

the organization employs some 5,300 people , including 1,800 air-traffic controllers . in withholding his signature from the law , which was passed by a wide parliamentary majority and with support from opposition political parties , köhler said the german constitution required the federal government to retain sovereignty over matters of public security . it was the first time that köhler has declared legislation passed by germany 's two parliamentary bodies , the bundestag and the bundesrat , unconstitutional .

the german government maintains that the sale is essential in efforts to create a " single european sky , " eradicating the national borders that complicate air traffic control in europe . lufthansa spokesman stefan schaffrath said privatization would allow for the start of a system of incentives that would improve air traffic control performance .
schaffrath said he hoped the constitution would be changed , pointing out that köhler himself had mentioned that possibility in his decision . conservative air safety expert norbert königshofen said the government would now examine a variety of options , including the sale of a smaller percentage of the dfs .

but that does n't mean the issue is settled . the law would have allowed germany 's federal government to sell off up to 74.9 percent of the state-owned german flight security company , the dfs .
the organization employs some 5,300 people , including 1,800 air-traffic controllers . in withholding his signature from the law , which was passed by a wide parliamentary majority and with support from opposition political parties , köhler said the german constitution required the federal government to retain sovereignty over matters of public security . it was the first time that köhler has declared legislation passed by germany 's two parliamentary bodies , the bundestag and the bundesrat , unconstitutional .
a largely ceremonial position , the german president generally stays out of daily political discussions but is required to sign laws before the can take effect . state duty or single european sky bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler says the law is simply unconstiutional opponents of the law welcomed köhler 's move . " the president has reached a landmark decision , " said peter heesen , the head of the german civil servants association , which represents many of the dfs 's employees .
" it 's an important contribution to the debate about what the state 's sovereign duties are and must continue to be in the future . " hans-rudolf wöhrl , the owner of small german carrier ltu airlines , also said he thought köhler made the right choice .
the sale , he said , " would have been tantamount to a hike in fees since a private investor would have demanded a profit . " but proponents of the law , while saying they understood köhler 's reasoning , continued to argue for the benefits of privatization .
the german government maintains that the sale is essential in efforts to create a " single european sky , " eradicating the national borders that complicate air traffic control in europe . lufthansa spokesman stefan schaffrath said privatization would allow for the start of a system of incentives that would improve air traffic control performance .
schaffrath said he hoped the constitution would be changed , pointing out that köhler himself had mentioned that possibility in his decision . conservative air safety expert norbert königshofen said the government would now examine a variety of options , including the sale of a smaller percentage of the dfs .

the choice of a foreign leader - and a conservative - for this role speaks volumes about the former chancellor 's uneasy relationship with the party he used to lead .
and to judge from initial reactions to what he 's written , decisions is unlikely to make him many new friends . as the pr machine gears up to promote the book , union leaders and some conservative politicians have taken exception to some of schröder 's opinions .

" i think the criticism is wrong and also ignoble of him , " retorted the conservative state premier of baden-württemberg , günther oettinger .
" we had plenty of his authoritarian style and it did n't produce any results . " given the wide-spread opposition in germany to the american-led war in iraq , the most popular parts of the book will probably be those in which schröder criticizes us president george w. bush 's religiosity .
schröder 's decision not to support the iraq war is indeed likely to go down as his most positively viewed political legacy . yawns from the german press bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder now has a lucrative post with a russian gas giant for the most part , the german media , including a number of regional newspapers , are n't buying the hype surrounding decisions .

" both sides benefit from openness , " eu trade commissioner peter mandelson said in a statement .
" but china 's growing trade muscle means growing expectations .
china must fulfill its wto obligations and commit to trading fairly . " the eu is unhappy about high chinese tariffs on products like textiles and leather goods .
it also complains that beijing unfairly privileges chinese firms when it comes to contracts for automobiles , steel , semiconductors and ships .
in addition the bloc is seeking an end to rules requiring eu companies to set up joint ventures with chinese partners and wants restrictions on european investments in certain industries lifted . " there is a growing risk the eu-china trading relationship will not be seen as genuinely reciprocal , " the policy paper said .
the bloc , however , added that it preferred to resolve its differences with beijing by negotiation . chance for talks in november bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandelson will try to pursuade china to open up markets mandelson , who is due to visit china next month , commissioned the paper .
additional talks in january are scheduled to focus on a new partnership pact between brussels and beijing , but mandelson said he would also raise the worries expressed in the paper with his chinese hosts during his visit . " too often europe 's businesses meet a chinese wall rather than an open door , " mandelson said at a conference on eu-china trade and investment relations in july . trade between the eu and china more than doubled between 2000 and 2005 .
and as european workers face increasing low-wage competition , eu politicians are coming under more and more pressure to ensure a level playing field . " china must show that it is committed to embracing globalization as a two-way street , " the eu paper said . it is unusual for the eu to threaten china in this way , but it is perhaps brussels ' only option .
attempts to protect the european market with tariffs have foundered on european consumers ' desire for inexpensive chinese goods .
in september , mandelson filed the eu 's first-ever complaint , aimed at a levy on automobile parts , against china with the wto . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " china is going to overtake germany in the next few years " former german chancellor helmut schmidt will hold talks with chinese premier wen jiabao during a summit in hamburg .

" overall , there are fewer people who drink , but those who drink , drink more .

" young people in the eu are particularly at risk , as over 10 percent of female mortality and around 25 percent of male mortality in the 15-29 age group is related to hazardous alcohol consumption , " it said .

" sporadic alcohol excesses , under-age consumption and drunk driving are real public health problems in europe , especially among young people , " eu health commissioner marko kyprianou told journalists on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kyprianou said he sees alcoholism as a threat to public health " the commission is not aiming at moderate alcohol consumption , " he said . the eu remains the heaviest drinking region in the world , with 55 million adults estimated to drink at harmful levels . " binge drinking is the big problem of the european union , " kyprianou said .
" overall , there are fewer people who drink , but those who drink , drink more . " taking into account europe 's wide cultural differences when it comes to alcohol , the eu 's executive arm listed a number of areas of concern and laid out a strategy to target them through to 2012 . " harmful and hazardous alcohol consumption is a key health determinant and one of the main causes of premature death and avoidable disease , " the commission said in its document . " young people in the eu are particularly at risk , as over 10 percent of female mortality and around 25 percent of male mortality in the 15-29 age group is related to hazardous alcohol consumption , " it said .

however , when it comes to altering laws regarding foreigners , the socials democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- - who were forced into a grand coalition government last year - seem to be on a decisive path . over the next few weeks , the spd and cdu are expected to draft a bill that would tighten entry regulations for foreign students and implement eu directives on asylum and residency rights .

their scam begs the question : is n't it easier to get a job ? the plan was a simple one , demanding more criminal energy than brainpower : first , manufacture plastic bottles cheaply in eastern europe and slap a fake bar code on them .
then trek the bottles into germany , where they fetch 25 euro cents -lrb- 31 us cents -rrb- apiece .
easier then printing money ?
almost .
in germany , empties can be brought to grocery or beverage stores , where they are slipped through modern machines that read the bar code , compute the value of the returns , and spit out a receipt for payment , to be picked up at the nearest cash register .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a couple hundred cases left three hardworking thieves decided to try doing just such large-scale recycling for a living in september .
they brought 150,000 ersatz grape soda bottles , made for a few cents each in lithuania , to the eastern german state of schleswig-holstein and started trying to cash in .
not according to plan but - as happens in most simple criminal plans - things went astray .
though the trio did n't wind up getting sent through a scanning machine , cartoon style ; only to pop out of the other end of a bottle conveyor , tied at the wrists and ankles with plastic six-pack rings , they did get caught before they could turn in all their empties .
the prosecuting attorney said that , had they pulled off their plan , the three men stood to clear more than 30,000 euros -lrb- $ 38,000 -rrb- .
the story set off a new round of debate over germany 's system of deposit fees .
high deposits too tempting ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scavenging for bottles pays better in germany than many other countries some argue that the 25 cent deposit is simply too high , and that such large potential sums attract scam artists and thieves .
for businesses , they say , the bottle-return situation is one big pain in the pop-top : they spent 1.5 billion euros on automated bottle-exchange machines , and operating costs are around 500 million euros a year .
currently , germany has begun using security marks on deposits that are supposed to prevent illegal returns like the schleswig-holstein scam .
but even though the system was set to go into place on oct .
1 , plenty of automated deposit machines have yet to be set up to spit out faked bottles , according to the industry newsletter lebensmittel zeitung -lrb- food industry news -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fifa and coca-cola on collision course over plastic bottles germany has done much to promote the coming world cup 's environmental aspects but its " green goal " initiative may be under threat by main sponsor coca-cola 's plan to sell plastic bottles at the tournament .

more than 40 german intellectuals and politicians accepted the invitation by the president of the german parliament norbert lammert to contribute to a book on what constitutes germany 's " leading culture . " " i do n't have the ambition to have a new canon developed , nor do i want to amend the rights stipulated by our constitution , " lammert said .
" but there can be no reasonable doubt that we need at least an understanding of the points that keep our society together and that are propelled by our constitution . " lammert 's recently published anthology - entitled " constitution , patriotism , leading culture .
what holds our society together " - presents a wide range of opinions on the topic of germany 's defining cultural values . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lammert believes , for example , that german should be declared official language in the constitution " leitkultur , " or leading culture , is a peculiarly german term .
some see in it an overarching term for a democratic culture of openness and tolerance , while others take it to be no more than a sign of elitism and narrow-minded belief in the superiority of one culture over another . " i grew up in this country with rights of freedom , civil rights and , when all is said and done , i am a constitutional patriot , " said seyran ates , a lawyer who was born in istanbul but has lived in germany since the age of nine . " that 's what i am fighting for .
and that 's why i have no problem with the phrase ' leading culture . '
i do n't define it the way some people do as the culture , which is imposed upon me by the germans , because i also contribute to this society . " integration troubles for ates , like for many others , the crucial problem in this cultural debate is the question of germany 's failure to develop a binding integration concept for its immigrant citizens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seyran ates believes germany needs a better integration policy " the german state must rise up to the responsibility of finally starting with a reasonable and serious integration policy , " ates said . according to green party politician claudia roth , a democratic society must offer participatory mechanisms to all its citizens . " muslims need legitimate constitutional structures , which make them capable of acting in a democratic process , " roth said . some of the book 's contributors , however , do not believe that the state can do everything . " we have to be sober about the fact that the state 's ability to act is limited , " said cardinal karl lehmann , chairman of the german bishops ' conference .
" the state has to rely on value-creating contributions from many groups of citizens . " an unfortunate term the very idea of german " leitkultur " is problematic for some because of the country 's fatal experience with national socialism . " calling something ' german leading culture ' has a bitter taste for our neighbors , " said actor mario adorf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for wim wenders the more pressing question is that of germany within europe german film director wim wenders described the concept of " leitkultur " as " very unfortunate " and the whole debate as " belated . "
it would be much more urgent to deal with the question of european identity , because that is the question that will preoccupy the german society much more in the future , according to wenders . a necessary debate others , however , believe that a debate on what constitutes a defining culture is absolutely necessary in the spirit of an open and honest dialogue between different cultures , and despite horrifying phenomena such as honor killings and forced marriages which occur in some segments of germany 's immigrant communities . " all that is part of a different culture , which one should be at least curious about , " said adolf muschg , who teaches german literature at the university of zurich . " we should ask ourselves : ' where does all that come from ? '
by doing that we serve again our cognitive faculty and our imagination , and we are then also ready to say : ' this is where we stop , this is where we 're drawing the line , " he said .

more than 40 german intellectuals and politicians accepted the invitation by the president of the german parliament norbert lammert to contribute to a book on what constitutes germany 's " leading culture . " " i do n't have the ambition to have a new canon developed , nor do i want to amend the rights stipulated by our constitution , " lammert said .
" but there can be no reasonable doubt that we need at least an understanding of the points that keep our society together and that are propelled by our constitution . " lammert 's recently published anthology - entitled " constitution , patriotism , leading culture .

some see in it an overarching term for a democratic culture of openness and tolerance , while others take it to be no more than a sign of elitism and narrow-minded belief in the superiority of one culture over another . " i grew up in this country with rights of freedom , civil rights and , when all is said and done , i am a constitutional patriot , " said seyran ates , a lawyer who was born in istanbul but has lived in germany since the age of nine . " that 's what i am fighting for .

by doing that we serve again our cognitive faculty and our imagination , and we are then also ready to say : ' this is where we stop , this is where we 're drawing the line , " he said .

the choice of a foreign leader - and a conservative - for this role speaks volumes about the former chancellor 's uneasy relationship with the party he used to lead .
and to judge from initial reactions to what he 's written , decisions is unlikely to make him many new friends . as the pr machine gears up to promote the book , union leaders and some conservative politicians have taken exception to some of schröder 's opinions .
but critics say decisions merely reinforces schröder 's previous image as a pragmatic , media-savvy strategist who lacked grand visions - and whose tendency toward arrogance led to his political defeat . enemies on the left and the right bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder 's most popular decision was against the iraq war in excerpts from the book , pre-published simultaneously in germany 's most respected weekly news magazine and its largest tabloid daily , schröder said resistance from unions to his agenda 2010 reform program helped doom his re-election campaign in 2005 .
predictably , that has n't sat well with the social democrats ' traditional political allies on the left . the head of germany 's trade unions association , michael sommer was n't long in shooting back . " gerhard schröder should note the fact that he lost 10 elections with his policies , " sommer said .
" that 's why he 's no longer chancellor . " meanwhile , conservatives are piqued at remarks schröder made in interviews , in which he criticized his successor in office , the christian democratic union 's angela merkel , for showing weak leadership . " i think the criticism is wrong and also ignoble of him , " retorted the conservative state premier of baden-württemberg , günther oettinger .
" we had plenty of his authoritarian style and it did n't produce any results . " given the wide-spread opposition in germany to the american-led war in iraq , the most popular parts of the book will probably be those in which schröder criticizes us president george w. bush 's religiosity .
schröder 's decision not to support the iraq war is indeed likely to go down as his most positively viewed political legacy . yawns from the german press bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder now has a lucrative post with a russian gas giant for the most part , the german media , including a number of regional newspapers , are n't buying the hype surrounding decisions .
the daily kieler nachrichten commented , " much of this is trivial , the self-reflections of an aging man who is having difficulty dealing with the loss of power . " the westfälischer anzeiger concurred : " a man of power , who was already thoroughly vain during his time in office , has shed some lucrative tears over a purportedly better era .
that can be informative and entertaining , but it 's no reason to get angry or mourn along with him . " hanover 's neue presse drew a parallel between the shortcomings of schröder memoirs and his failings as chancellor .
" he 's certainly allowed to settle some old accounts .
but if he had anything wise to say about the future direction of the republic , he 'd still be in power . " the neue osnabrücker zeitung agreed : " schröder failed because of his own flaws and what he neglected to do .
he squandered years in office with pragmatic , but directionless politics . " schröder wrote his memoirs in less than a year , record time for an ex-chancellor , and while the consensus may be that they generate little heat and even less light , he 's unlikely to be too bothered .
the german branch of the on-line bookseller amazon says schröder 's decisions currently tops its list of advance-ordered books . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : " divine guidance has no place in western politics " gerhard schröder is publishing his memoirs this week and many dw readers agreed with the former german chancellor 's criticism of us president bush 's religious approach to politics .
-lrb- 23.10.2006 -rrb- dw-world : germany 's government and unions clash over reform process the german government and the country 's trade unions are accusing each other of hindering the reform process .
a truce seems unlikely with the cabinet set to approve parts of a highly controversial health bill this week .
-lrb- 23.10.2006 -rrb- dw-world : in book , schröder describes worries about bush 's religiosity ahead of the release of his memoirs , gerhard schröder says george bush left a positive impression on him , but the us leader 's constant references to god troubled him .

the north east ambulance service -lrb- neas -rrb- estimates that only seven to 10 % of calls to its control room are genuine , life-threatening emergencies .
as part of a six-month pilot scheme , it is introducing a new system , nhs pathways , to better assess calls and ensure patients get the best care .
it will help staff decide whether a patient really needs an ambulance .
life-threatening cases colin cessford , director of strategy and clinical standards for the neas , said : " there are thousands of cases a year we deal with which do n't require an emergency response .
" but because we ca n't identify many of these callers , we dispatch an ambulance to non-emergencies on a relatively high proportion of occasions .
" this means some individuals are being taken to hospital when they do n't need emergency treatment and ambulances are attending non-emergencies instead of being available for true life-threatening cases . "
clinical assessment last year , neas received more than 250,000 calls and sent ambulances to 190,000 patients , of which 150,000 were taken to hospital .
the new system will help staff decide whether patients would be better off going to a walk-in centre for treatment or if they require an ambulance .
mr cessford added : " this new system will allow us to undertake a more in-depth clinical assessment of these non-emergency cases and refer them to the right health professional who can best treat them . "
john harrison , general manager of northern doctors urgent care -lrb- nduc -rrb- , said : " where the system determines that a 999 ambulance is not required and that the caller needs to speak to a nurse , then the call will be passed to nduc . "

life-threatening cases colin cessford , director of strategy and clinical standards for the neas , said : " there are thousands of cases a year we deal with which do n't require an emergency response .

currently there is no refuge in blaenau gwent and the refuges in newport , monmouthshire , the rhymney valley and torfaen face increasing demand .
carole challingsworth from newport women 's aid said a lack of facilities meant some women were not being helped .
a lack of safe houses means help often involves women moving miles from home .
" we are in desperate need of more refuges , " said ms challingsworth who is involved with the running of newport 's only women 's aid refuge .
" this morning alone , we had to turn away three for refuge .
" the problem of lack of space has been going on or a long time and it 's escalating .
" i do n't know why - maybe more women are deciding they are not putting up with it any more .
" whatever their reason it is very hard not to be able to help when they have taken the brave step of leaving the situation they have been in . "
travel for help the refuge in newport can take up to nine families and is " constantly full " .
because of a lack of facilities , many women trying to access help are offered help in other areas , sometimes miles from their own homes .
" we are having to send women to refuges a really long way away from home and this is n't ideal , " she said .
" two of the cases we had to turn away this morning were requests from other refuges who were full .
" and the other one was a woman who decided to go back home after the only place we could offer her was in mid wales which is a long way from home .
" this lady told me she had never been further than barry and did n't want to go so far away .
" leaving the situation is the hardest part for these women - they are leaving everything behind and many who do leave and think they are going to go to a refuge in their own town or close by , so it is even harder for them .
" we desperately need more refuges to be set up , " she added .
battle her comments were supported by fiona perkins from monmouthshire women 's aid who described the situation as " a constant battle " .
" we are the only refuge for the whole of monmouthshire and very often have to send women to other refuges , sometimes across the border to the forest of dean area , " she explained .
" last year we had 398 requests for help but we could n't help all of those . "

but how close are we to humans version 2.0 , computer-enhanced people ?
ray kurzweil , a renowned american inventor and futurist , supplements his daily diet with a cocktail of 250 pills .
now in his mid-fifties , kurzweil is attempting to extend his life until 2029 .
this is when he believes science will have made two huge breakthroughs ; understanding how the human mind works and the creation of computers that are equal to its power .
if mr kurzweil is right the implications could be profound .
" in 25 years from now ... we will have both the hardware and the software to recreate human intelligence in a machine , " he says .
once computers have the processing power of the human brain it will be possible to enhance our intelligence with silicon implants and even download the contents of our minds to machines , preserving them forever .
mr kurzweil is saying that in just a few decades humans could , in effect , become immortal .
rehashed sci-fi although his vision may sound like rehashed sci-fi fantasy it is based on the closely observed trends in the fields of computer and neuroscience .
as far back as 1964 , gordon moore , a founder of the computer chip firm intel , predicted that computer power would double every year .
moore turned out to be right and his simple idea offers up a staggering statistic , as kurzweil points out : " computers are about a billion times more powerful than they were a quarter century ago and they will become a billon times more powerful than they are today in a quarter century . "
but whilst there may be an almost metronomic predictability about the progress of computers toward kurzweil 's dateline , neuroscience inhabits a far more complex and controversial arena .
in order to unlock the secrets of the human mind , neuroscientists often turn to other species , with some extraordinary results . "
the brain was considered the last frontier , the impenetrable part of us " professor miguel nicolelis at the state university of new york , professor john chapin has come up with a unique interface between animal and machine - a remote control rat .
prof chapin transmits radio signals to electrodes placed in the area of the rat 's brain that controls its whiskers .
when he sends a signal to the right whisker the rat turns right .
if the rat does as asked , chapin rewards it with another signal to its pleasure centre .
rat 's mind bizarre as it sounds , by commanding the rat 's mind , prof chapin hopes to discover the exact function of the different parts of its brain .
professor miguel nicolelis at duke university in north carolina , has taken this paradigm of brain machine interfaces even further .
for the past decade , he has been tapping in to the brains of monkeys by wiring them up to computers and eavesdropping on their thoughts .
prof nicolelis acknowledges how surprisingly fertile this approach has been .
" the brain was considered the last frontier , the impenetrable part of us , and we are just learning that we can actually go in there and read thoughts , " he says .
prof nicolelis has refined his decoding of the mind to such a degree that his monkeys are able to control extraneous devices , such as robotic arms , through thought alone .
' finally freed ' in doing so , prof nicolelis believes they present us with a glimpse of how technology may enhance or even transform us as " the brain is finally freed from the body and it can act upon the world directly " .
this mind reading technology is now appearing in some humans .
following a devastating car accident , 23-year-old erik ramsey was left paralysed form the neck down .
he 's unable to move , talk or eat without assistance , yet his brain remains intact .
now erik is at the centre of an experimental therapy to try and restore his ability to speak by connecting his brain to a computer .
when erik thinks a sound the computer reads erik 's brain activity and turns it in to an actual sound .
to date , erik and the computer are able to make just a few basic sounds , but the hope remains that within a matter of years he will be able to make useful , vocal communication once more .
earlier this year us scientists implanted a sensor in a paralysed man 's brain that has enabled him to control objects by using his thoughts alone .
matthew nagle , 25 at the time of the trial , was left paralysed from the neck down and confined to a wheelchair after a knife attack in 2001 .
he was the first patient to try out the brain sensor .
but rather than offer us hope , another leading computer scientist believes these inroads in to the mind threaten oblivion .
professor hugo de garis is the architect of some of the world 's most complex neural networks - computers that evolve their own intelligence .
now he is deeply conflicted over the future he is helping to create .
prof de garis believes that in a matter of years machine intelligence will supersede our own by a factor of millions .
these so called artilects - short for artificial intellects - will be so powerful that they will appear " almost god-like " .
but prof de garis fears that they may not be quite so benign .
" how will they feel about us - an inferior species ? " he asks before drawing a doom-filled analogy . " ... they may treat us like mosquitoes ; as pests , " and simply wipe us out , he says .

the half-human , half-robot cyborg has long been a vision nurtured by science fiction writers and futurologists .
but how close are we to humans version 2.0 , computer-enhanced people ?
ray kurzweil , a renowned american inventor and futurist , supplements his daily diet with a cocktail of 250 pills .
now in his mid-fifties , kurzweil is attempting to extend his life until 2029 .
this is when he believes science will have made two huge breakthroughs ; understanding how the human mind works and the creation of computers that are equal to its power .
if mr kurzweil is right the implications could be profound .
" in 25 years from now ... we will have both the hardware and the software to recreate human intelligence in a machine , " he says .
once computers have the processing power of the human brain it will be possible to enhance our intelligence with silicon implants and even download the contents of our minds to machines , preserving them forever .
mr kurzweil is saying that in just a few decades humans could , in effect , become immortal .
rehashed sci-fi although his vision may sound like rehashed sci-fi fantasy it is based on the closely observed trends in the fields of computer and neuroscience .
as far back as 1964 , gordon moore , a founder of the computer chip firm intel , predicted that computer power would double every year .
matthew nagle was fitted with a sensor to control objects moore turned out to be right and his simple idea offers up a staggering statistic , as kurzweil points out : " computers are about a billion times more powerful than they were a quarter century ago and they will become a billon times more powerful than they are today in a quarter century . "
but whilst there may be an almost metronomic predictability about the progress of computers toward kurzweil 's dateline , neuroscience inhabits a far more complex and controversial arena .
in order to unlock the secrets of the human mind , neuroscientists often turn to other species , with some extraordinary results .
the brain was considered the last frontier , the impenetrable part of us professor miguel nicolelis at the state university of new york , professor john chapin has come up with a unique interface between animal and machine - a remote control rat .
prof chapin transmits radio signals to electrodes placed in the area of the rat 's brain that controls its whiskers .
when he sends a signal to the right whisker the rat turns right .
if the rat does as asked , chapin rewards it with another signal to its pleasure centre .
rat 's mind bizarre as it sounds , by commanding the rat 's mind , prof chapin hopes to discover the exact function of the different parts of its brain .
professor miguel nicolelis at duke university in north carolina , has taken this paradigm of brain machine interfaces even further .
for the past decade , he has been tapping in to the brains of monkeys by wiring them up to computers and eavesdropping on their thoughts .
prof nicolelis acknowledges how surprisingly fertile this approach has been .
" the brain was considered the last frontier , the impenetrable part of us , and we are just learning that we can actually go in there and read thoughts , " he says .
prof nicolelis has refined his decoding of the mind to such a degree that his monkeys are able to control extraneous devices , such as robotic arms , through thought alone .
' finally freed ' in doing so , prof nicolelis believes they present us with a glimpse of how technology may enhance or even transform us as " the brain is finally freed from the body and it can act upon the world directly " .

following a devastating car accident , 23-year-old erik ramsey was left paralysed form the neck down .
he 's unable to move , talk or eat without assistance , yet his brain remains intact .
now erik is at the centre of an experimental therapy to try and restore his ability to speak by connecting his brain to a computer .
when erik thinks a sound the computer reads erik 's brain activity and turns it in to an actual sound .
to date , erik and the computer are able to make just a few basic sounds , but the hope remains that within a matter of years he will be able to make useful , vocal communication once more .
earlier this year us scientists implanted a sensor in a paralysed man 's brain that has enabled him to control objects by using his thoughts alone .
matthew nagle , 25 at the time of the trial , was left paralysed from the neck down and confined to a wheelchair after a knife attack in 2001 .
he was the first patient to try out the brain sensor .
see how the system works but rather than offer us hope , another leading computer scientist believes these inroads in to the mind threaten oblivion .
professor hugo de garis is the architect of some of the world 's most complex neural networks - computers that evolve their own intelligence .

the half-human , half-robot cyborg has long been a vision nurtured by science fiction writers and futurologists .
but how close are we to humans version 2.0 , computer-enhanced people ?
ray kurzweil , a renowned american inventor and futurist , supplements his daily diet with a cocktail of 250 pills .
now in his mid-fifties , kurzweil is attempting to extend his life until 2029 .
this is when he believes science will have made two huge breakthroughs ; understanding how the human mind works and the creation of computers that are equal to its power .
if mr kurzweil is right the implications could be profound .
" in 25 years from now ... we will have both the hardware and the software to recreate human intelligence in a machine , " he says .
once computers have the processing power of the human brain it will be possible to enhance our intelligence with silicon implants and even download the contents of our minds to machines , preserving them forever .
mr kurzweil is saying that in just a few decades humans could , in effect , become immortal .
rehashed sci-fi although his vision may sound like rehashed sci-fi fantasy it is based on the closely observed trends in the fields of computer and neuroscience .
as far back as 1964 , gordon moore , a founder of the computer chip firm intel , predicted that computer power would double every year .
matthew nagle was fitted with a sensor to control objects moore turned out to be right and his simple idea offers up a staggering statistic , as kurzweil points out : " computers are about a billion times more powerful than they were a quarter century ago and they will become a billon times more powerful than they are today in a quarter century . "
but whilst there may be an almost metronomic predictability about the progress of computers toward kurzweil 's dateline , neuroscience inhabits a far more complex and controversial arena .

the group 's biannual living planet report said the natural world was being degraded " at a rate unprecedented in human history " .
terrestrial species had declined by 31 % between 1970-2003 , the findings showed .
it warned that if demand continued at the current rate , two planets would be needed to meet global demand by 2050 .
the biodiversity loss was a result of resources being consumed faster than the planet could replace them , the authors said .
they added that if the world 's population shared the uk 's lifestyle , three planets would be needed to support their needs .
living planet report the planet 's resources are overused by 25 % per capita the us uses four times the resources of south africa polar bear populations have declined by 30 % in maps and graphics the nations that were shown to have the largest " ecological footprints " were the united arab emirates , the united states and finland .
paul king , wwf director of campaigns , said the world was running up a " serious ecological debt " .
" it is time to make some vital choices to enable people to enjoy a one planet lifestyle , " he said .
" the cities , power plants and homes we build today will either lock society into damaging over-consumption beyond our lifetimes , or begin to propel this and future generations towards sustainable one planet living . "
the report , compiled by the zoological society of london -lrb- zsl -rrb- and the global footprint network , is based on data from two indicators : living planet index - assesses the health of the planet 's ecosystems ecological footprint - measures human demand on the natural world the living planet index tracked the population of 1,313 vertebrate species of fish , amphibians , reptiles , birds and mammals from around the world .
it found that these species had declined by about 30 % since 1970 , suggesting that natural ecosystems were being degraded at an unprecedented rate .
the ecological footprint measured the amount of biologically productive land and water to meet the demand for food , timber , shelter , and absorb the pollution from human activity .
the report concluded that the global footprint exceeded the earth 's biocapacity by 25 % in 2003 , which meant that the earth could no longer keep up with the demands being placed upon it .
the findings echo a study published earlier this month that said the world went into " ecological debt " on 9 october this year .
the study by uk-based think-tank new economics foundation -lrb- nef -rrb- was based on the ecological footprint data compiled by the global footprint network , which also provided the figures for this latest report from the wwf .
' large-scale collapse ' one of the report 's editors , jonathan loh from the zoological society of london , said : " -lsb- it -rsb- is a stark indication of the rapid and ongoing loss of biodiversity worldwide .
" populations of species in terrestrial , marine and freshwater ecosystems have declined by more than 30 % since 1970 , " he added .
" in the tropics the declines are even more dramatic , as natural resources are being intensively exploited for human use . "
the report outlined five scenarios based on the data from the two indicators , ranging from " business as usual " to " transition to a sustainable society " .
under the " business as usual " scenario , the authors projected that to meet the demand for resources in 2050 would be twice as much as what the earth could provide .
have your say " as long as materialism is the new religion i can see no way people will reduce their consumption " salik rafiq , blackburn send us your comments they warned : " at this level of ecological deficit , exhaustion of ecological assets and large-scale ecosystem collapse become increasingly likely . "
to deliver a shift towards a " sustainable society " scenario would require " significant action now " on issues such as energy generation , transport and housing .
the latest living planet report is the sixth in a series of publications which began in 1998 .

see below for more details on when they died and how the toll compares with those of the other coalition countries .
as of october 2006 the iraq coalition casualty count also estimates 365 civilian contractors have been killed in iraq , while according to the international news safety institute , 148 journalists and support staff have died there .
other uk military death tolls iraq -lrb- 1991 -rrb- : 16 dead falklands -lrb- 1982 -rrb- : 255 dead northern ireland -lrb- 1969-1997 -rrb- : 763 dead timeline : uk 's iraq casualties us military toll in iraq iraq body count : war dead there is not a widely accepted equivalent figure for the number of iraqi civilian deaths .
estimates have varied between 10,000 and 100,000 .
the us and uk governments say the chaos in the war-torn country has made it impossible to gain accurate information .
one organisation , the uk-based iraq body count , used media reports as the basis of a dossier that estimated the civilian death toll from march 2003 to march 2005 at 24,865 .
but some critics have questioned the groups ' methods of compiling statistics , and the iraqi government described the dossier as " mistaken " .

even filming inside the baghdad hospital is dangerous and many refuse to show their face on camera .
this includes the doctor , who remains anonymous in his programme : " anyone working for foreigners or as a journalist is targeted , " he told me in london last week .
the nature of the injuries brought into the emergency room have changed over time , from the rocket injuries and bullet wounds related to the 2003 us-led invasion , through the revenge killings in the aftermath of saddam hussein 's fall , to the stabbings of petty crime in the increasingly unstable iraqi capital .
after that came the bombings and the sectarian violence which grew markedly after the attack on a major shia shrine in february this year .
most recently he says , bodies have been dumped in front of the hospital by security forces - between 20 and 40 daily - because the city 's central morgue is full .
the bodies have " their hands tied , their faces are covered , some have been executed by being shot in the head ; some have been beheaded , tortured or disembowelled " .
everyday violence on a day-to-day level , the main problem doctors have deal with is that of ordinary people marching in and demanding immediate care for their wounded relatives , he says .
most iraqis now carry weapons to defend themselves and are not afraid to wave them around to get attention - the " power of the guns " .
this is a place where doctors are routinely threatened , humiliated and insulted .
they have to live with interior ministry forces arriving in the emergency room to demand treatment for their own people .
it is not just iraqi security people who barge into hospitals unannounced .
the doctor speaks of insurgents coming on " special missions " to kidnap sunni patients in retaliation for sectarian attacks against shia civilians .
" shia death squads are hitting back - kidnapping , torturing and killing sunni civilians , " he says .
many senior doctors have been killed , kidnapped or are leaving the country .
this leaves junior doctors in charge , and although new doctors are being trained , the time could come when the iraqi health care system will suffer a complete breakdown , he believes .
the situation got so bad that a few months ago , doctors staged a strike calling for better security inside the hospital and better working conditions .
no records many bodies lie unclaimed for weeks or months . "
we become immune .
everyone is under threat in baghdad " hospitals try to keep records of the dead and injured .
" the hospital has to continually report er admissions to the ministry of health .
typically , nobody does anything with those figures , but every day -lsb- the doctor keeping records -rsb- has to go through the motions .
" we do n't know how many are dying , there are problems with identification and there are too many bodies . "
he finds the controversial recent estimate of 655,000 deaths since the invasion entirely credible .
sometimes , the relatives take the bodies away without getting a death certificate .
the doctor recalls one instance where two children were brought in but died in the hospital .
their father took away the bodies to bury them before a death certificate was issued .
staying put despite the daily dose of horror , the doctor says life is not worse at the er than for anyone else in baghdad .
" we become immune .
everyone is under threat in baghdad . "
but despite the dangers , the doctor is not planning to join the exodus of middle-class professionals .
" people do n't know what is going on in iraq , they ca n't hear the iraqi people screaming .
iraqis need a voice .
making films is a better way of serving my country , of trying to draw people 's attention . "

even filming inside the baghdad hospital is dangerous and many refuse to show their face on camera .
this includes the doctor , who remains anonymous in his programme : " anyone working for foreigners or as a journalist is targeted , " he told me in london last week .
the doctor was given special access to the hospital the nature of the injuries brought into the emergency room have changed over time , from the rocket injuries and bullet wounds related to the 2003 us-led invasion , through the revenge killings in the aftermath of saddam hussein 's fall , to the stabbings of petty crime in the increasingly unstable iraqi capital .
after that came the bombings and the sectarian violence which grew markedly after the attack on a major shia shrine in february this year .
most recently he says , bodies have been dumped in front of the hospital by security forces - between 20 and 40 daily - because the city 's central morgue is full .
the bodies have " their hands tied , their faces are covered , some have been executed by being shot in the head ; some have been beheaded , tortured or disembowelled " .
everyday violence on a day-to-day level , the main problem doctors have deal with is that of ordinary people marching in and demanding immediate care for their wounded relatives , he says .
most iraqis now carry weapons to defend themselves and are not afraid to wave them around to get attention - the " power of the guns " .

doctors at al-yarmouk mostly deal with war wounds they have to live with interior ministry forces arriving in the emergency room to demand treatment for their own people .
it is not just iraqi security people who barge into hospitals unannounced .
the doctor speaks of insurgents coming on " special missions " to kidnap sunni patients in retaliation for sectarian attacks against shia civilians .
" shia death squads are hitting back - kidnapping , torturing and killing sunni civilians , " he says .
many senior doctors have been killed , kidnapped or are leaving the country .
this leaves junior doctors in charge , and although new doctors are being trained , the time could come when the iraqi health care system will suffer a complete breakdown , he believes .

even filming inside the baghdad hospital is dangerous and many refuse to show their face on camera .
this includes the doctor , who remains anonymous in his programme : " anyone working for foreigners or as a journalist is targeted , " he told me in london last week .
the doctor was given special access to the hospital the nature of the injuries brought into the emergency room have changed over time , from the rocket injuries and bullet wounds related to the 2003 us-led invasion , through the revenge killings in the aftermath of saddam hussein 's fall , to the stabbings of petty crime in the increasingly unstable iraqi capital .
after that came the bombings and the sectarian violence which grew markedly after the attack on a major shia shrine in february this year .
most recently he says , bodies have been dumped in front of the hospital by security forces - between 20 and 40 daily - because the city 's central morgue is full .
the bodies have " their hands tied , their faces are covered , some have been executed by being shot in the head ; some have been beheaded , tortured or disembowelled " .
everyday violence on a day-to-day level , the main problem doctors have deal with is that of ordinary people marching in and demanding immediate care for their wounded relatives , he says .
most iraqis now carry weapons to defend themselves and are not afraid to wave them around to get attention - the " power of the guns " .
this is a place where doctors are routinely threatened , humiliated and insulted .
doctors at al-yarmouk mostly deal with war wounds they have to live with interior ministry forces arriving in the emergency room to demand treatment for their own people .
it is not just iraqi security people who barge into hospitals unannounced .
the doctor speaks of insurgents coming on " special missions " to kidnap sunni patients in retaliation for sectarian attacks against shia civilians .
" shia death squads are hitting back - kidnapping , torturing and killing sunni civilians , " he says .
many senior doctors have been killed , kidnapped or are leaving the country .
this leaves junior doctors in charge , and although new doctors are being trained , the time could come when the iraqi health care system will suffer a complete breakdown , he believes .
the situation got so bad that a few months ago , doctors staged a strike calling for better security inside the hospital and better working conditions .
no records many bodies lie unclaimed for weeks or months .
we become immune .
everyone is under threat in baghdad hospitals try to keep records of the dead and injured .
" the hospital has to continually report er admissions to the ministry of health .
typically , nobody does anything with those figures , but every day -lsb- the doctor keeping records -rsb- has to go through the motions .
" we do n't know how many are dying , there are problems with identification and there are too many bodies . "
he finds the controversial recent estimate of 655,000 deaths since the invasion entirely credible .
sometimes , the relatives take the bodies away without getting a death certificate .
the doctor recalls one instance where two children were brought in but died in the hospital .
their father took away the bodies to bury them before a death certificate was issued .
staying put despite the daily dose of horror , the doctor says life is not worse at the er than for anyone else in baghdad .
" we become immune .
everyone is under threat in baghdad . "
but despite the dangers , the doctor is not planning to join the exodus of middle-class professionals .
" people do n't know what is going on in iraq , they ca n't hear the iraqi people screaming .
iraqis need a voice .
making films is a better way of serving my country , of trying to draw people 's attention . "

a smile never seems far away from creasing his face when he recalls his lucky escape in helmand province .
seven others in his platoon were also injured as they fought to secure a roof top vantage point , nicknamed the alamo .
lt martin , from near moira , in northern ireland , was among about 100 soldiers from the regiment to recently return from a two-and-a-half month tour .
sitting in the comfort of the sergeant 's mess at fort george , the officer recalled his near death experience .
i 've still got three pieces of shrapnel left in me - one a centimetre from my heart .
i am very , very lucky lt paul martin minister 's ' thank you ' to troops he was leading his platoon on what had become a regular mission to secure the alamo .
the position gave the royal irish their best position to ward off attacks by the taleban , who were using mortars and rocket propelled grenades -lrb- rpgs -rrb- .
" i do n't remember what it was , either a rpg or a mortar round , on the alamo , " said lt martin .
" i was up there with eight men .
i think it was a mortar round that exploded spraying shrapnel .
" i 've still got three pieces of shrapnel left in me - one a centimetre from my heart .
i am very , very lucky . "
seven others in the platoon were also injured and a number of them still have pieces of the shell in them .
lt martin 's situation was critical because a shrapnel had gone through a lung and it was filling with blood .
artillery fire he was treated by a military surgeon in afghanistan before being airlifted to the uk in a c17 globemaster .
in a hospital in birmingham , he saw just how close he had come to tragedy .
lt martin said : " the surgeons showed me an x-ray of the shrapnel and said ' you 're very , very lucky , well done ' and i said ' no , no thank you ' . "
the intensity of the action in afghanistan was also revealed by corporal alan boyle , 35 , and ranger joe ward , 22 .
cpl boyle said they came under attack from artillery fire as well as rpgs .
he said : " you name it they threw it .
" i think we had 90 fire fights over the two-and-a-half months we were there .
it was nine to 10 times a day . "
corporal alan boyle and ranger joe ward there was relief for the troops after dark as the taleban did not possess night sights .
the deaths of three fellow soldiers during the tour hit the regiment hard .
cpl boyle said : " we were all shocked .
our mates had been killed , but we did n't have time to grieve .
we just got on with the job and hoped that we would have the time later . "
fort george on a sunny autumn morning may have seemed a world away from the troubles in afghanistan for the troops .
the nearest thing to the sound of explosions was the boom of waves on the moray firth , hitting the fortress walls .
outside the sergeant 's mess , lt martin 's face broke into a full blown grin as he spoke of the irony of flying home to northern ireland .
he must first get the all-clear from doctors before undertaking the journey .
they fear the pressures of air travel could finish off the exploded shell 's job .
" i hope i can fly .

to many european citizens , it is a mystery why such a state of affairs has been allowed to continue for so long .
siim kallas : " moderate " chance of a clean bill of health in 2009 the explanation has partly to do with the tough standards of the court of auditors , with the decentralised nature of the european union , and with its lack of democratic accountability - public bewilderment has not always been seen in the eu as a reason for reform .
but the european commission and members of the european parliament also argue that the media have given a slanted picture of the problem .
for while the auditors have found problems with the way the eu spends its money - every year since they first had to provide a declaration of assurance in 1994 - they have also declared the eu accounts to be " reliable " .
this means that the european commission has accurately recorded all transactions , assets and liabilities .
so reports saying that the auditors " refused to sign off the accounts " are misleading .
legality the problems the auditors have exposed have been with the " legality and regularity " of the transactions underlying those accounts .
in other words , they have found evidence that some eu spending has violated regulations and / or contractual conditions .
if i had to operate the eu system , then , because i qualify 13 accounts , i might have to qualify the whole of british central government expenditure uk comptroller and auditor general , sir john bourn this is not the same thing as saying that eu spending programmes are " riddled with fraud " .
in fact , in many cases where errors are found the problems concern the paperwork alone - and the money has been spent exactly as it should have been .
the commission does not deny that fraud occurs , but it says the scale is minute - around 0.09 % of the total budget .
so how worried should we be about the auditors ' complaints ?
this year , the european commission has made unprecedented efforts to calm down the media storm that usually accompanies the auditors ' report , and to rebut some of their criticisms .
one of its chief arguments is that the auditors set the bar at a level far higher than any national government could achieve .
part of the explanation for this is that the eu court of auditors gives just one judgement on the whole of the eu 's spending , instead of judging different areas of activity separately .
the commission quotes evidence given to a house of lords committee earlier this year by the uk 's comptroller and auditor general , sir john bourn , who said there were 500 accounts representing the expenditure of british central government .
he went on : " in the last year , i qualified 13 of the 500 .
if i had to operate the eu system , then , because i qualify 13 accounts , i might have to qualify the whole of british central government expenditure . "
small sample another point made by the european commissioner for administration , audit and anti-fraud , siim kallas , is that the auditors base their report on a relatively small sample of transactions - a few hundred out of millions .
they check these very carefully , and then estimate from the number of flaws they find the likely overall level of errors in spending .
in 2005 the commission recovered more than 2.17bn euros -lrb- £ 1.45bn -rrb- - the court should finally recognise this european commissioner siim kallas the point mr kallas emphasises is that the auditors ignore the fact that the commission often identifies and gets back mis-spent money in subsequent years .
the auditors work on an annual basis , the commission works on a multi-annual basis .
" one will always find errors in individual transactions , in any organisation , but we have effective mechanisms to claw back any undue payments , " he says .
" in 2005 the commission recovered more than 2.17bn euros -lrb- £ 1.45bn -rrb- .
the court should finally recognise this . "
but former british mep terry wynn , who spent years on the european parliament 's budgetary control committee before retiring this summer , makes an even more fundamental criticism of the auditors ' approach .
according to him , it is practically impossible for the spending to be judged " regular and legal " when the auditors base their judgement on a few hundred transactions .
to get below the auditors ' permitted threshold , he says , there can be almost no error at all in the sample .
member states so it is perhaps surprising that the present commission has set itself the goal of getting a completely clean bill of health by the end of its mandate in 2009 -lrb- when the auditors will report on the 2008 accounts -rrb- .
mr kallas , a former estonian prime minister and minister of finance , estimates the chances of success as " moderate " , but says it depends very much on the effort made by member states , which spend more than three-quarters of the eu budget .
the largest budget heading is farm aid , which is gradually being brought under effective control , to the auditors ' satisfaction , by a system called iacs -lrb- integrated administration and control system -rrb- .
to help keep better tabs on the rest of eu spending on the ground , the commission and the european parliament have been calling for an annual declaration by each member state , to confirm that systems to control the spending of eu funds have worked effectively in the year in question .
the idea was that this would be signed by a high-ranking politician , such as the country 's finance minister , but the member states rejected that in december .
nonetheless , the commission appears to believe it is making progress in persuading national capitals to beef up their controls on the spending of eu money - and that is why mr kallas puts the chances of a clean bill of health in 2009 above zero .

to many european citizens , it is a mystery why such a state of affairs has been allowed to continue for so long .
siim kallas : " moderate " chance of a clean bill of health in 2009 the explanation has partly to do with the tough standards of the court of auditors , with the decentralised nature of the european union , and with its lack of democratic accountability - public bewilderment has not always been seen in the eu as a reason for reform .
but the european commission and members of the european parliament also argue that the media have given a slanted picture of the problem .
for while the auditors have found problems with the way the eu spends its money - every year since they first had to provide a declaration of assurance in 1994 - they have also declared the eu accounts to be " reliable " .
this means that the european commission has accurately recorded all transactions , assets and liabilities .
so reports saying that the auditors " refused to sign off the accounts " are misleading .
legality the problems the auditors have exposed have been with the " legality and regularity " of the transactions underlying those accounts .
in other words , they have found evidence that some eu spending has violated regulations and / or contractual conditions .
if i had to operate the eu system , then , because i qualify 13 accounts , i might have to qualify the whole of british central government expenditure uk comptroller and auditor general , sir john bourn this is not the same thing as saying that eu spending programmes are " riddled with fraud " .
in fact , in many cases where errors are found the problems concern the paperwork alone - and the money has been spent exactly as it should have been .
the commission does not deny that fraud occurs , but it says the scale is minute - around 0.09 % of the total budget .
so how worried should we be about the auditors ' complaints ?
this year , the european commission has made unprecedented efforts to calm down the media storm that usually accompanies the auditors ' report , and to rebut some of their criticisms .
one of its chief arguments is that the auditors set the bar at a level far higher than any national government could achieve .
part of the explanation for this is that the eu court of auditors gives just one judgement on the whole of the eu 's spending , instead of judging different areas of activity separately .
the commission quotes evidence given to a house of lords committee earlier this year by the uk 's comptroller and auditor general , sir john bourn , who said there were 500 accounts representing the expenditure of british central government .
he went on : " in the last year , i qualified 13 of the 500 .
if i had to operate the eu system , then , because i qualify 13 accounts , i might have to qualify the whole of british central government expenditure . "
small sample another point made by the european commissioner for administration , audit and anti-fraud , siim kallas , is that the auditors base their report on a relatively small sample of transactions - a few hundred out of millions .
they check these very carefully , and then estimate from the number of flaws they find the likely overall level of errors in spending .
in 2005 the commission recovered more than 2.17bn euros -lrb- £ 1.45bn -rrb- - the court should finally recognise this european commissioner siim kallas the point mr kallas emphasises is that the auditors ignore the fact that the commission often identifies and gets back mis-spent money in subsequent years .
the auditors work on an annual basis , the commission works on a multi-annual basis .
" one will always find errors in individual transactions , in any organisation , but we have effective mechanisms to claw back any undue payments , " he says .
" in 2005 the commission recovered more than 2.17bn euros -lrb- £ 1.45bn -rrb- .
the court should finally recognise this . "
but former british mep terry wynn , who spent years on the european parliament 's budgetary control committee before retiring this summer , makes an even more fundamental criticism of the auditors ' approach .
according to him , it is practically impossible for the spending to be judged " regular and legal " when the auditors base their judgement on a few hundred transactions .
to get below the auditors ' permitted threshold , he says , there can be almost no error at all in the sample .
member states so it is perhaps surprising that the present commission has set itself the goal of getting a completely clean bill of health by the end of its mandate in 2009 -lrb- when the auditors will report on the 2008 accounts -rrb- .
mr kallas , a former estonian prime minister and minister of finance , estimates the chances of success as " moderate " , but says it depends very much on the effort made by member states , which spend more than three-quarters of the eu budget .
the largest budget heading is farm aid , which is gradually being brought under effective control , to the auditors ' satisfaction , by a system called iacs -lrb- integrated administration and control system -rrb- .
to help keep better tabs on the rest of eu spending on the ground , the commission and the european parliament have been calling for an annual declaration by each member state , to confirm that systems to control the spending of eu funds have worked effectively in the year in question .
the idea was that this would be signed by a high-ranking politician , such as the country 's finance minister , but the member states rejected that in december .
nonetheless , the commission appears to believe it is making progress in persuading national capitals to beef up their controls on the spending of eu money - and that is why mr kallas puts the chances of a clean bill of health in 2009 above zero .
