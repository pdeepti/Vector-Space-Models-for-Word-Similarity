while some see the exhibition as an important part of coming to terms with the gdr , others feel that it plays down the brutality of a dictatorship . visiting berlin as a tourist a couple of years ago , peter kenzelmann wanted to explain east germany to his girlfriend .
the ethnologist and political scientist from freiburg in southwestern germany had been to east berlin years ago .
but his partner had not witnessed the atmosphere behind the iron curtain and so the couple searched for a museum that showcased the daily lives of ordinary east germans . " try amsterdam , " officials at berlin 's tourism bureau told them , adding that someone had set up such a museum in the netherlands . flabbergasted , kenzelmann decided to fill the void .
he hired a team of historians and museum managers , began asking people to donate everything east german and found a bank to finance the venture . " i did n't want to become dependent on subsidies - we are a business , " the 36-year-old said on monday , sitting outside his freshly opened ddr , or gdr museum , which is located in the basement of a brand-new hotel and entertainment complex in the heart of former east berlin . ha n ds-o n exhibit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once omnipresent on east german streets , now a museum piece : the trabant kenzelmann and his team want visitors to have a hands-on experience .

both said they enjoyed the exhibition as it helped to rectify the image of eastern germans . " we 've been put down as neandertalers and this shows that we lived like normal people , " fischer said , adding that many east germans were not that affected by the repressive aspects of the communist regime such as the gdr 's secret service , or stasi . joseph spadola , a 23-year-old philosophy student from new york city , agreed that the museum 's emphasis on the mundane was a good thing .

" the action plan provides a very good basis for our further work and cooperation , " finnish foreign minister erkki tuomioja told reporters after the plan was unveiled in brussels by serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica .
finland currently holds the eu presidency . " the plan needs to be developed further and the implemention of the action must begin immediately , " tuomioja added . economically hobbled by the wars that tore the former yugoslavia apart in the 1990s , serbia is desperate to keep alive its hopes of one day joining europe 's rich 25-member club . but the eu froze talks on closer ties with serbia in may , because of the failure of authorities to hand mladic , the former bosnian serb military chief , to the international criminal tribunal for former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- . serbia is hoping to agree a stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- with the eu - typically the first step for balkan states to join the bloc . eu wa n ts results while the eu is aware that the prospect of membership for serbia is a powerful force for stability in a volatile region , union officials have vowed that they should only resume when there are results , not just action plans . eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn , who has supervised the saa talks with belgrade , expressed satisfaction that the plan could lead to mladic 's arrest . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olli rehn " i am glad to see that the action plan contains an unequivocal commitment from the serbian government to arrest ratko mladic and other remaining indictees , " he told reporters .
" a plan can be a means to an end but action is more important than the plan because it realizes the results that matter . " the three-page plan includes a media campaign highlighting the mladic case , security and legal elements , ways to improve cooperation with icty , and evokes the need to amend some specific laws . mladic and the former bosnian serb political leader radovan karadic , who is also wanted for trial , have been on the run since the war in bosnia ended in 1995 .
the fugitive general is being sought for genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity , notably for his role in the massacre of some 8,000 muslim boys and men in the eastern enclave of srebrenica in july that year .
mladic is believed to have been hiding in serbia , but belgrade has denied knowing of his whereabouts and claims that it has a strong political will to arrest him once it tracks him down . " we think this plan is something that will enable serbia to continue the negotiations -lrb- on the saa -rrb- , " said kostunica , who explained that his government would now prepare a " detailed operational plan . " some skepticism german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said he thought it could be " possible " for the talks to resume by the end of the year . however some in the european union are not convinced . asked before seeing the plan whether it could lead mladic 's capture , dutch foreign minister ben bot said : " we will see , they have said it so often .
i have been there on various occasions and each time they say in a week or in 14 days they will catch mladic .

the israeli army has said its offensive to defeat hezbollah could last several weeks .
yet time is running out for international diplomatic intervention .
what role could the european union play in the negotiation process ? the european union 's foreign policy chief javier solana said tuesday he was preparing to head back to the middle east following a weekend trip to lebanon amid the upsurge of violence there . beirut has hosted several leading european politicians in the past few days , including solana and french prime minister dominique de villepin . " in the middle east , you ignite a match and you do not know how the fire will end , " solana told the press after his visit with lebanese government leaders in beirut on sunday .
" that is why we have to stop it with acts of good will by everybody .
the eu is trying to do that . " yet these visits seem more a supportive pat on the back for lebanon than concrete efforts to arbitrate . " the europeans appear to be more immediately concerned with the conflict than the united states is , yet europe 's role to date has been ineffective , " said robert lowe from the international affairs think tank chatham house in london . according to martin beck from the german institute for middle east studies in hamburg , there are significant problems regarding european negotiation efforts . " there still is n't a common european position on the conflict , " beck said .
" european countries have to reach a consensus on this before further action is possible . " germany supporting diplomatic efforts german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said germany was continuing to pursue a diplomatic strategy to calm the situation in the middle east . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister steinmeier is speaking with israeli and arab representatives " the fact that we have n't been successful does n't mean that they are unnecessary , " steinmeier told german television zdf on tuesday .
" we are trying to do everything that is possible . " for the past few days , there have been talks with government representatives from the region to sound out possibilities and interests , he said .
these efforts were being coordinated with the european union . while there have been calls for germany to step in as a mediator in the conflict , it alone can not mediate , said andreas schockenhoff , foreign policy expert of the cdu / csu parliamentary group . " rather , the european union together with russia , the united states and the united nations can try as a quartet to get the conflict parties to the negotiating table , " schockenhoff said . the eu has abandoned its middle east policy beck said the eu should have done more to contribute to the stabilization of the region since hamas won the majority of seats in palestinian elections in january 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas has the majority of support in the palestinian territories " in the past months , europe and the eu did n't understand the need to react properly to the hamas victory , " beck said .
" of course , europe was surprised by the election results as much as everyone else .
but it then proceeded to take on the us and israeli position and give up its own .
there was no independent policy . " since the 1980s , the european union has developed a policy with the main objective of a two-state solution in the middle east . " but the eu forgot its own position and only placed pressure on hamas , but not on israel , " beck said .
" this sent israel the message that not only the united states , but now also the eu stands behind its actions . " washington has backed israel 's right to self-defense and refuses to endorse international calls for an immediate ceasefire between israel and hezbollah . regional support for a ceasefire is necessary " the eu has to find its own position and quickly , " beck said .
even then , though , would european mediation have any potential influence ? " the israelis in part would be reluctant to accept european involvement and less inclined to listen to the europeans , " said lowe .
" and they do n't need to because of their ties to the united states . " lowe said the europeans should play a larger role in mediating the conflict .

the israeli army has said its offensive to defeat hezbollah could last several weeks .
yet time is running out for international diplomatic intervention .
what role could the european union play in the negotiation process ? the european union 's foreign policy chief javier solana said tuesday he was preparing to head back to the middle east following a weekend trip to lebanon amid the upsurge of violence there . beirut has hosted several leading european politicians in the past few days , including solana and french prime minister dominique de villepin . " in the middle east , you ignite a match and you do not know how the fire will end , " solana told the press after his visit with lebanese government leaders in beirut on sunday .
" that is why we have to stop it with acts of good will by everybody .
the eu is trying to do that . " yet these visits seem more a supportive pat on the back for lebanon than concrete efforts to arbitrate . " the europeans appear to be more immediately concerned with the conflict than the united states is , yet europe 's role to date has been ineffective , " said robert lowe from the international affairs think tank chatham house in london . according to martin beck from the german institute for middle east studies in hamburg , there are significant problems regarding european negotiation efforts . " there still is n't a common european position on the conflict , " beck said .
" european countries have to reach a consensus on this before further action is possible . " germany supporting diplomatic efforts german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said germany was continuing to pursue a diplomatic strategy to calm the situation in the middle east . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister steinmeier is speaking with israeli and arab representatives " the fact that we have n't been successful does n't mean that they are unnecessary , " steinmeier told german television zdf on tuesday .
" we are trying to do everything that is possible . " for the past few days , there have been talks with government representatives from the region to sound out possibilities and interests , he said .
these efforts were being coordinated with the european union . while there have been calls for germany to step in as a mediator in the conflict , it alone can not mediate , said andreas schockenhoff , foreign policy expert of the cdu / csu parliamentary group . " rather , the european union together with russia , the united states and the united nations can try as a quartet to get the conflict parties to the negotiating table , " schockenhoff said . the eu has abandoned its middle east policy beck said the eu should have done more to contribute to the stabilization of the region since hamas won the majority of seats in palestinian elections in january 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas has the majority of support in the palestinian territories " in the past months , europe and the eu did n't understand the need to react properly to the hamas victory , " beck said .
" of course , europe was surprised by the election results as much as everyone else .
but it then proceeded to take on the us and israeli position and give up its own .
there was no independent policy . " since the 1980s , the european union has developed a policy with the main objective of a two-state solution in the middle east . " but the eu forgot its own position and only placed pressure on hamas , but not on israel , " beck said .
" this sent israel the message that not only the united states , but now also the eu stands behind its actions . " washington has backed israel 's right to self-defense and refuses to endorse international calls for an immediate ceasefire between israel and hezbollah . regional support for a ceasefire is necessary " the eu has to find its own position and quickly , " beck said .

detlev mehlis , former un inspector , told deutsche welle that iran and syria are definitely playing a role . detlev mehlis , a senior public prosecutor in berlin is a former investigator with the united nations and closely involved in the probe after the assassination of lebanese prime minister rafiq hariri . very familiar with the dynamics and power politics of the region , mehlis is convinced that syria and iran are behind the recent outbreak of violence between israel and lebanon . while he says he has no proof , he insists that the current events would not be happening without explicit approval from syria , especially since the weapons being used by hezbollah in all likelihood came through syria . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : detlev mehlis in his former role as a un investigator " syria is on hezbollah 's side and vice versa , " he said .
" hezbollah would certainly not risk taking the kind of action it has without having syria 's approval . " mehlis thinks that syria , despite its withdrawal under international pressure from lebanon last year , has not given up its desire to bring the country under its control again . that became quite clear during the investigation into the hariri case , he says .
syrian secret agents tried to interfere in the investigation , the syrian justice department got involved and witness were intimidated .
according to him , syria 's attitude toward lebanon has not changed in the slightest . " syria refuses to this day to establish diplomatic relations ; it refuses to recognized a binding demarcation of common borders , " he said .
" for syria , lebanon is nowhere near being an autonomous country . " proxy war ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shiite muslim supporters of the hezbollah group but mehlis dismisses the speculation that hezbollah is conducting a proxy war for iran and syria as precisely that - speculation .
but he says that while such an analysis is premature , it is not a completely misguided conclusion , since syria has an interest in the destabilization of lebanon . formulating a strategy for preventing that very development , however , is difficult .
mehlis does think the idea of sending un troops into southern lebanon is an interesting one .
however , he thinks the peacekeepers ' effectiveness could be limited . the united nations interim force in lebanon -lrb- unifil -rrb- , created in 1978 to confirm israeli withdrawal from lebanon , has had limited success in preventing israel from marching into lebanon or in stopping hezbollah from firing on israel . " the influence of the international community is restricted , " he said .
" the us has a clear influence on israel , that is certain .
iran and syria have real influence over hezbollah .
but whether they can apply enough pressure to stop the assaults , i doubt .
i think it 's unfortunately going to take some time . " hezbollah 's firing of iranian rockets over the last few days with a range of up to 100 kilometers has taken the conflict to a new dimension .
it has cast doubt on security concepts that up to now have been based on the concept of " security zones . "
those might have been effective when the weapons were katyusha rockets with a range of under 20 kilometers .
but when hezbollah rockets can now threaten haifa and other israeli cities , the entire equation is changed . " still , buffer zones would help prevent incidents that have led to this escalation such as the kidnapping of israeli soldiers , " said mehlis . " but what can one do ?

" it 's a new orient , " assessed the paper , " everything has changed since the fall of saddam . "
in just the last few months , the world has witnessed " arafat 's death , israel 's withdrawal from the gaza strip , sharon 's retirement , the developments in iran , syria 's withdrawal from lebanon , growing rivalries between the shiites and sunnis , and the chaos in iraq . "

" " israel has , in fact , the right to defend its territory , " opined serbia 's danas tuesday , but tempered the statement by saying the disproportional military response to the israeli soldier 's abduction indicated alternative motives .
" the hezbollah attack gave israel a legitimate reason to strike back , " asserted the paper .

" one can only hope , " continued the paper , " that the western world , out of its own interests , will now help kick out hezbollah . "

on the other hand , " israel sees the war as an opportunity to change the perception that its withdrawals from lebanon in 2000 and gaza in 2005 were a sign of weakness . "
the paper predicted that an international intervention force would " either be ineffectual or risk turning itself into a target " and that " the best chance of success lies in politics and diplomacy . " the arab and muslim neighbors of palestine and israel have failed , concluded germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , in that they have neglected for many years to make proposals that were capable of " alleviating israel 's general mistrust . "
the paper commented that frustration had built up since israel 's full withdrawal from the gaza strip last summer - a move which , it says , was not rewarded by the other side .

" the action plan provides a very good basis for our further work and cooperation , " finnish foreign minister erkki tuomioja told reporters after the plan was unveiled in brussels by serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica .
finland currently holds the eu presidency . " the plan needs to be developed further and the implemention of the action must begin immediately , " tuomioja added . economically hobbled by the wars that tore the former yugoslavia apart in the 1990s , serbia is desperate to keep alive its hopes of one day joining europe 's rich 25-member club . but the eu froze talks on closer ties with serbia in may , because of the failure of authorities to hand mladic , the former bosnian serb military chief , to the international criminal tribunal for former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- . serbia is hoping to agree a stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- with the eu - typically the first step for balkan states to join the bloc . eu wa n ts results while the eu is aware that the prospect of membership for serbia is a powerful force for stability in a volatile region , union officials have vowed that they should only resume when there are results , not just action plans . eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn , who has supervised the saa talks with belgrade , expressed satisfaction that the plan could lead to mladic 's arrest . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olli rehn " i am glad to see that the action plan contains an unequivocal commitment from the serbian government to arrest ratko mladic and other remaining indictees , " he told reporters .
" a plan can be a means to an end but action is more important than the plan because it realizes the results that matter . " the three-page plan includes a media campaign highlighting the mladic case , security and legal elements , ways to improve cooperation with icty , and evokes the need to amend some specific laws . mladic and the former bosnian serb political leader radovan karadic , who is also wanted for trial , have been on the run since the war in bosnia ended in 1995 .
the fugitive general is being sought for genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity , notably for his role in the massacre of some 8,000 muslim boys and men in the eastern enclave of srebrenica in july that year .
mladic is believed to have been hiding in serbia , but belgrade has denied knowing of his whereabouts and claims that it has a strong political will to arrest him once it tracks him down . " we think this plan is something that will enable serbia to continue the negotiations -lrb- on the saa -rrb- , " said kostunica , who explained that his government would now prepare a " detailed operational plan . " some skepticism german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said he thought it could be " possible " for the talks to resume by the end of the year . however some in the european union are not convinced . asked before seeing the plan whether it could lead mladic 's capture , dutch foreign minister ben bot said : " we will see , they have said it so often .
i have been there on various occasions and each time they say in a week or in 14 days they will catch mladic .
i 'm still waiting . " dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de srebrenica mass trial opens in the hague the trial of seven top bosnian serb military officials opened in the hague on friday .

detlev mehlis , former un inspector , told deutsche welle that iran and syria are definitely playing a role . detlev mehlis , a senior public prosecutor in berlin is a former investigator with the united nations and closely involved in the probe after the assassination of lebanese prime minister rafiq hariri . very familiar with the dynamics and power politics of the region , mehlis is convinced that syria and iran are behind the recent outbreak of violence between israel and lebanon . while he says he has no proof , he insists that the current events would not be happening without explicit approval from syria , especially since the weapons being used by hezbollah in all likelihood came through syria . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : detlev mehlis in his former role as a un investigator " syria is on hezbollah 's side and vice versa , " he said .
" hezbollah would certainly not risk taking the kind of action it has without having syria 's approval . " mehlis thinks that syria , despite its withdrawal under international pressure from lebanon last year , has not given up its desire to bring the country under its control again . that became quite clear during the investigation into the hariri case , he says .
syrian secret agents tried to interfere in the investigation , the syrian justice department got involved and witness were intimidated .
according to him , syria 's attitude toward lebanon has not changed in the slightest . " syria refuses to this day to establish diplomatic relations ; it refuses to recognized a binding demarcation of common borders , " he said .
" for syria , lebanon is nowhere near being an autonomous country . " proxy war ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shiite muslim supporters of the hezbollah group but mehlis dismisses the speculation that hezbollah is conducting a proxy war for iran and syria as precisely that - speculation .
but he says that while such an analysis is premature , it is not a completely misguided conclusion , since syria has an interest in the destabilization of lebanon . formulating a strategy for preventing that very development , however , is difficult .
mehlis does think the idea of sending un troops into southern lebanon is an interesting one .
however , he thinks the peacekeepers ' effectiveness could be limited . the united nations interim force in lebanon -lrb- unifil -rrb- , created in 1978 to confirm israeli withdrawal from lebanon , has had limited success in preventing israel from marching into lebanon or in stopping hezbollah from firing on israel . " the influence of the international community is restricted , " he said .
" the us has a clear influence on israel , that is certain .
iran and syria have real influence over hezbollah .
but whether they can apply enough pressure to stop the assaults , i doubt .
i think it 's unfortunately going to take some time . " hezbollah 's firing of iranian rockets over the last few days with a range of up to 100 kilometers has taken the conflict to a new dimension .
it has cast doubt on security concepts that up to now have been based on the concept of " security zones . "
those might have been effective when the weapons were katyusha rockets with a range of under 20 kilometers .
but when hezbollah rockets can now threaten haifa and other israeli cities , the entire equation is changed . " still , buffer zones would help prevent incidents that have led to this escalation such as the kidnapping of israeli soldiers , " said mehlis . " but what can one do ?

" proxy war ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shiite muslim supporters of the hezbollah group but mehlis dismisses the speculation that hezbollah is conducting a proxy war for iran and syria as precisely that - speculation .
but he says that while such an analysis is premature , it is not a completely misguided conclusion , since syria has an interest in the destabilization of lebanon . formulating a strategy for preventing that very development , however , is difficult .
mehlis does think the idea of sending un troops into southern lebanon is an interesting one .
however , he thinks the peacekeepers ' effectiveness could be limited . the united nations interim force in lebanon -lrb- unifil -rrb- , created in 1978 to confirm israeli withdrawal from lebanon , has had limited success in preventing israel from marching into lebanon or in stopping hezbollah from firing on israel . " the influence of the international community is restricted , " he said .
" the us has a clear influence on israel , that is certain .
iran and syria have real influence over hezbollah .
but whether they can apply enough pressure to stop the assaults , i doubt .
i think it 's unfortunately going to take some time . " hezbollah 's firing of iranian rockets over the last few days with a range of up to 100 kilometers has taken the conflict to a new dimension .
it has cast doubt on security concepts that up to now have been based on the concept of " security zones . "
those might have been effective when the weapons were katyusha rockets with a range of under 20 kilometers .
but when hezbollah rockets can now threaten haifa and other israeli cities , the entire equation is changed . " still , buffer zones would help prevent incidents that have led to this escalation such as the kidnapping of israeli soldiers , " said mehlis . " but what can one do ?
the lesser of two evils is still better than conflicts like we 're seeing now .

while some see the exhibition as an important part of coming to terms with the gdr , others feel that it plays down the brutality of a dictatorship . visiting berlin as a tourist a couple of years ago , peter kenzelmann wanted to explain east germany to his girlfriend .
the ethnologist and political scientist from freiburg in southwestern germany had been to east berlin years ago .

he hired a team of historians and museum managers , began asking people to donate everything east german and found a bank to finance the venture .

" the action plan provides a very good basis for our further work and cooperation , " finnish foreign minister erkki tuomioja told reporters after the plan was unveiled in brussels by serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica .
finland currently holds the eu presidency . " the plan needs to be developed further and the implemention of the action must begin immediately , " tuomioja added . economically hobbled by the wars that tore the former yugoslavia apart in the 1990s , serbia is desperate to keep alive its hopes of one day joining europe 's rich 25-member club . but the eu froze talks on closer ties with serbia in may , because of the failure of authorities to hand mladic , the former bosnian serb military chief , to the international criminal tribunal for former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- . serbia is hoping to agree a stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- with the eu - typically the first step for balkan states to join the bloc . eu wa n ts results while the eu is aware that the prospect of membership for serbia is a powerful force for stability in a volatile region , union officials have vowed that they should only resume when there are results , not just action plans . eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn , who has supervised the saa talks with belgrade , expressed satisfaction that the plan could lead to mladic 's arrest . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olli rehn " i am glad to see that the action plan contains an unequivocal commitment from the serbian government to arrest ratko mladic and other remaining indictees , " he told reporters .
" a plan can be a means to an end but action is more important than the plan because it realizes the results that matter . " the three-page plan includes a media campaign highlighting the mladic case , security and legal elements , ways to improve cooperation with icty , and evokes the need to amend some specific laws . mladic and the former bosnian serb political leader radovan karadic , who is also wanted for trial , have been on the run since the war in bosnia ended in 1995 .
the fugitive general is being sought for genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity , notably for his role in the massacre of some 8,000 muslim boys and men in the eastern enclave of srebrenica in july that year .
mladic is believed to have been hiding in serbia , but belgrade has denied knowing of his whereabouts and claims that it has a strong political will to arrest him once it tracks him down . " we think this plan is something that will enable serbia to continue the negotiations -lrb- on the saa -rrb- , " said kostunica , who explained that his government would now prepare a " detailed operational plan . " some skepticism german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said he thought it could be " possible " for the talks to resume by the end of the year . however some in the european union are not convinced . asked before seeing the plan whether it could lead mladic 's capture , dutch foreign minister ben bot said : " we will see , they have said it so often .

while some see the exhibition as an important part of coming to terms with the gdr , others feel that it plays down the brutality of a dictatorship . visiting berlin as a tourist a couple of years ago , peter kenzelmann wanted to explain east germany to his girlfriend .
the ethnologist and political scientist from freiburg in southwestern germany had been to east berlin years ago .
but his partner had not witnessed the atmosphere behind the iron curtain and so the couple searched for a museum that showcased the daily lives of ordinary east germans . " try amsterdam , " officials at berlin 's tourism bureau told them , adding that someone had set up such a museum in the netherlands . flabbergasted , kenzelmann decided to fill the void .
he hired a team of historians and museum managers , began asking people to donate everything east german and found a bank to finance the venture . " i did n't want to become dependent on subsidies - we are a business , " the 36-year-old said on monday , sitting outside his freshly opened ddr , or gdr museum , which is located in the basement of a brand-new hotel and entertainment complex in the heart of former east berlin . ha n ds-o n exhibit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once omnipresent on east german streets , now a museum piece : the trabant kenzelmann and his team want visitors to have a hands-on experience .
many of the exhibits , such as school bags , award medals or diaries , are hidden in drawers that have been built into room dividers that resemble east germany 's prefabricated apartment buildings , or platte n baute n . there 's a trabant car that people can pretend to drive .
in one corner , curators have rebuilt a typical east german living room and kitchen .
east german propaganda phrases - " learning from the soviet union means learning how to win " and " apple sauce always tastes good " among them - adorn the walls .
short texts in german and english describe the items in the various sections such as those on education , work , shopping , media , sports and vacation . " on their web site it says that they still need nudist photos , but maybe that 's an old posting , " heidrun loeper told ingrid fischer as the two women came across the large display on nudist culture , which was popular in the gdr . a differe n t perspective bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inside the museum loeper , a 64-year-old literary scholar , and fischer , a 72-year old former primary school teacher , kept smiling as they walked through the museum and recognized things they themselves had used years ago .
both said they enjoyed the exhibition as it helped to rectify the image of eastern germans . " we 've been put down as neandertalers and this shows that we lived like normal people , " fischer said , adding that many east germans were not that affected by the repressive aspects of the communist regime such as the gdr 's secret service , or stasi . joseph spadola , a 23-year-old philosophy student from new york city , agreed that the museum 's emphasis on the mundane was a good thing . " this is the part we never hear about , " he said .
" it 's fascinating to see a different way of life while keeping ideology out of the picture . " skeptical voices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : too cute ?
visitors check out the living room inside the mock apartment those working to remind people of the dictatorial nature of the east german regime felt differently .
gabriele camphausen , who is in charge of educational programs at the federal commission that administers files from the stasi secret police , said she was stunned when she visited the museum . " visitors can leave the exhibition with the impression that this was a slightly bizarre state in the 20th century , " she said .
" it does n't become clear that this was a brutal dictatorship ...
imagine if someone had done such a museum on daily life during the nazi era .
people would criticize it , and rightly so . " hubertus knabe , director of the memorial at the former stasi prison in berlin hohenschönhausen , added that the museum 's concept fell in line with recommendations by a government commission to concentrate less on places symbolizing repression in the gdr . " i 'm skeptical that depictions of everyday life can explain life in a dictatorship , " knabe said , adding that he had not been to the museum .
" it 's not important how people ate and slept when describing a political system . " a worthwhile experime n t ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a model of the berlin wall death strip is the first thing museum visitors see but the museum 's director , robert rückel , countered that the stasi 's infiltration was clearly documented . he pointed to a corner with a stasi work station where visitors can eavesdrop on conversations in another part of the exhibition .
rückel added that other museums in berlin already highlighted aspects such as the wall and stasi repression . " our goal is to focus on the daily lives of people , " he said .
" it 's an experiment . " and a good one at that , said thomas ahbe , a sociologist who has written extensively on east german culture and identity . " it compliments the picture , " he said , adding that so far only so-called museums on everday life that are run by laymen exist throughout east germany .
" the crimes that happened in east germany have been documented extensively , but the scientific research on daily life has fallen by the wayside , " he said .
" i think it will still take a long time before we can get to a balanced view of gdr history .

this year 's g8 presidency was supposed to help bring russia around the international corner with the help of the kremlin 's long-planned public relations campaign .
it did n't hesitate to spend money on us pr consultancy ketchum as an advisor .
putin 's adversary mikhail khodorkovsky and his -lrb- now virtually defunct -rrb- oil company yukos had proven before that the use of a western communications firm can help to promote one 's views : one of the best agencies , apco , still works for the oligarch that was sentenced by the kremlin . puti n " on message " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the media left st. petersburg with a variety of messages thanks to the influence of the western advisors and russian spin doctors , president vladimir putin and his ministers were part of every imaginable conference seminar ahead of the summit .
from the mini summit of religious leaders , labor and union boss meetings to exclusive television interviews with media from all the g8 countries and even at the internet conference organized by the bbc and russian news agency ria novosti , putin 's message became clear : russia is a stable , democratic and economically prosperous country that is entitled to participate in discussions about international affairs . the emphasis the western media gave russia 's important economic role was one of the successes putin and the russian leadership were able to take away from the three-day meeting .
an increased awareness of russia 's international and domestic policies also emerged in the west . but russia 's lack of a fair judicial system in putin 's highly centralized government did not escape the media 's notice , nor did the limits put on freedom of expression and the aggressive methods the government uses when dealing with opposition parties . whether putin was actually successful in improving russia 's image remains open to debate .

detlev mehlis , former un inspector , told deutsche welle that iran and syria are definitely playing a role . detlev mehlis , a senior public prosecutor in berlin is a former investigator with the united nations and closely involved in the probe after the assassination of lebanese prime minister rafiq hariri . very familiar with the dynamics and power politics of the region , mehlis is convinced that syria and iran are behind the recent outbreak of violence between israel and lebanon . while he says he has no proof , he insists that the current events would not be happening without explicit approval from syria , especially since the weapons being used by hezbollah in all likelihood came through syria . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : detlev mehlis in his former role as a un investigator " syria is on hezbollah 's side and vice versa , " he said .
" hezbollah would certainly not risk taking the kind of action it has without having syria 's approval . " mehlis thinks that syria , despite its withdrawal under international pressure from lebanon last year , has not given up its desire to bring the country under its control again . that became quite clear during the investigation into the hariri case , he says .
syrian secret agents tried to interfere in the investigation , the syrian justice department got involved and witness were intimidated .
according to him , syria 's attitude toward lebanon has not changed in the slightest . " syria refuses to this day to establish diplomatic relations ; it refuses to recognized a binding demarcation of common borders , " he said .
" for syria , lebanon is nowhere near being an autonomous country . " proxy war ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shiite muslim supporters of the hezbollah group but mehlis dismisses the speculation that hezbollah is conducting a proxy war for iran and syria as precisely that - speculation .
but he says that while such an analysis is premature , it is not a completely misguided conclusion , since syria has an interest in the destabilization of lebanon . formulating a strategy for preventing that very development , however , is difficult .
mehlis does think the idea of sending un troops into southern lebanon is an interesting one .
however , he thinks the peacekeepers ' effectiveness could be limited . the united nations interim force in lebanon -lrb- unifil -rrb- , created in 1978 to confirm israeli withdrawal from lebanon , has had limited success in preventing israel from marching into lebanon or in stopping hezbollah from firing on israel . " the influence of the international community is restricted , " he said .
" the us has a clear influence on israel , that is certain .
iran and syria have real influence over hezbollah .
but whether they can apply enough pressure to stop the assaults , i doubt .
i think it 's unfortunately going to take some time . " hezbollah 's firing of iranian rockets over the last few days with a range of up to 100 kilometers has taken the conflict to a new dimension .
it has cast doubt on security concepts that up to now have been based on the concept of " security zones . "
those might have been effective when the weapons were katyusha rockets with a range of under 20 kilometers .
but when hezbollah rockets can now threaten haifa and other israeli cities , the entire equation is changed . " still , buffer zones would help prevent incidents that have led to this escalation such as the kidnapping of israeli soldiers , " said mehlis . " but what can one do ?
the lesser of two evils is still better than conflicts like we 're seeing now .

while some see the exhibition as an important part of coming to terms with the gdr , others feel that it plays down the brutality of a dictatorship . visiting berlin as a tourist a couple of years ago , peter kenzelmann wanted to explain east germany to his girlfriend .
the ethnologist and political scientist from freiburg in southwestern germany had been to east berlin years ago .
but his partner had not witnessed the atmosphere behind the iron curtain and so the couple searched for a museum that showcased the daily lives of ordinary east germans . " try amsterdam , " officials at berlin 's tourism bureau told them , adding that someone had set up such a museum in the netherlands . flabbergasted , kenzelmann decided to fill the void .
he hired a team of historians and museum managers , began asking people to donate everything east german and found a bank to finance the venture . " i did n't want to become dependent on subsidies - we are a business , " the 36-year-old said on monday , sitting outside his freshly opened ddr , or gdr museum , which is located in the basement of a brand-new hotel and entertainment complex in the heart of former east berlin . ha n ds-o n exhibit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once omnipresent on east german streets , now a museum piece : the trabant kenzelmann and his team want visitors to have a hands-on experience .
many of the exhibits , such as school bags , award medals or diaries , are hidden in drawers that have been built into room dividers that resemble east germany 's prefabricated apartment buildings , or platte n baute n . there 's a trabant car that people can pretend to drive .
in one corner , curators have rebuilt a typical east german living room and kitchen .
east german propaganda phrases - " learning from the soviet union means learning how to win " and " apple sauce always tastes good " among them - adorn the walls .
short texts in german and english describe the items in the various sections such as those on education , work , shopping , media , sports and vacation . " on their web site it says that they still need nudist photos , but maybe that 's an old posting , " heidrun loeper told ingrid fischer as the two women came across the large display on nudist culture , which was popular in the gdr . a differe n t perspective bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inside the museum loeper , a 64-year-old literary scholar , and fischer , a 72-year old former primary school teacher , kept smiling as they walked through the museum and recognized things they themselves had used years ago .
both said they enjoyed the exhibition as it helped to rectify the image of eastern germans . " we 've been put down as neandertalers and this shows that we lived like normal people , " fischer said , adding that many east germans were not that affected by the repressive aspects of the communist regime such as the gdr 's secret service , or stasi . joseph spadola , a 23-year-old philosophy student from new york city , agreed that the museum 's emphasis on the mundane was a good thing . " this is the part we never hear about , " he said .
" it 's fascinating to see a different way of life while keeping ideology out of the picture . " skeptical voices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : too cute ?
visitors check out the living room inside the mock apartment those working to remind people of the dictatorial nature of the east german regime felt differently .
gabriele camphausen , who is in charge of educational programs at the federal commission that administers files from the stasi secret police , said she was stunned when she visited the museum . " visitors can leave the exhibition with the impression that this was a slightly bizarre state in the 20th century , " she said .
" it does n't become clear that this was a brutal dictatorship ...
imagine if someone had done such a museum on daily life during the nazi era .
people would criticize it , and rightly so . " hubertus knabe , director of the memorial at the former stasi prison in berlin hohenschönhausen , added that the museum 's concept fell in line with recommendations by a government commission to concentrate less on places symbolizing repression in the gdr .

the israeli army has said its offensive to defeat hezbollah could last several weeks .
yet time is running out for international diplomatic intervention .
what role could the european union play in the negotiation process ? the european union 's foreign policy chief javier solana said tuesday he was preparing to head back to the middle east following a weekend trip to lebanon amid the upsurge of violence there . beirut has hosted several leading european politicians in the past few days , including solana and french prime minister dominique de villepin . " in the middle east , you ignite a match and you do not know how the fire will end , " solana told the press after his visit with lebanese government leaders in beirut on sunday .
" that is why we have to stop it with acts of good will by everybody .
the eu is trying to do that . " yet these visits seem more a supportive pat on the back for lebanon than concrete efforts to arbitrate . " the europeans appear to be more immediately concerned with the conflict than the united states is , yet europe 's role to date has been ineffective , " said robert lowe from the international affairs think tank chatham house in london . according to martin beck from the german institute for middle east studies in hamburg , there are significant problems regarding european negotiation efforts . " there still is n't a common european position on the conflict , " beck said .
" european countries have to reach a consensus on this before further action is possible . " germany supporting diplomatic efforts german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said germany was continuing to pursue a diplomatic strategy to calm the situation in the middle east . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister steinmeier is speaking with israeli and arab representatives " the fact that we have n't been successful does n't mean that they are unnecessary , " steinmeier told german television zdf on tuesday .
" we are trying to do everything that is possible . " for the past few days , there have been talks with government representatives from the region to sound out possibilities and interests , he said .
these efforts were being coordinated with the european union . while there have been calls for germany to step in as a mediator in the conflict , it alone can not mediate , said andreas schockenhoff , foreign policy expert of the cdu / csu parliamentary group . " rather , the european union together with russia , the united states and the united nations can try as a quartet to get the conflict parties to the negotiating table , " schockenhoff said . the eu has abandoned its middle east policy beck said the eu should have done more to contribute to the stabilization of the region since hamas won the majority of seats in palestinian elections in january 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas has the majority of support in the palestinian territories " in the past months , europe and the eu did n't understand the need to react properly to the hamas victory , " beck said .
" of course , europe was surprised by the election results as much as everyone else .
but it then proceeded to take on the us and israeli position and give up its own .
there was no independent policy . " since the 1980s , the european union has developed a policy with the main objective of a two-state solution in the middle east . " but the eu forgot its own position and only placed pressure on hamas , but not on israel , " beck said .
" this sent israel the message that not only the united states , but now also the eu stands behind its actions . " washington has backed israel 's right to self-defense and refuses to endorse international calls for an immediate ceasefire between israel and hezbollah . regional support for a ceasefire is necessary " the eu has to find its own position and quickly , " beck said .
even then , though , would european mediation have any potential influence ? " the israelis in part would be reluctant to accept european involvement and less inclined to listen to the europeans , " said lowe .
" and they do n't need to because of their ties to the united states . " lowe said the europeans should play a larger role in mediating the conflict .
" it is to the europeans ' credit that they are even visiting the region , " lowe said .
american officials had talked about sending secretary of state condoleezza rice , but so far she has not gone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli air strikes have damaged much of lebanon 's infrastructure " maybe the united states thinks israel can solve this militarily , but europe could be firmer in pushing for talks , " lowe said . schockenhoff said all the important players , which have interests in this region , needed to be at the negotiating table . " otherwise , it wo n't succeed , " schockenhoff said .
" hezbollah 's actions have turned this into a supra-regional conflict .
its solution calls for a clear political stance from tehran and damascus . " lowe agreed that many parties needed to be involved .
" the hezbollah does not seem inclined to reduce the attacks .
only syria and iran could bring it into negotiations , " he said . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de by land and sea , europeans flee lebanon for their lives helicopters and warships , chartered ferries and passenger vessels have arrived in lebanon to pick up tens of thousands of people in one of the biggest mass evacuations since world war ii .

" the arab and muslim neighbors of palestine and israel have failed , concluded germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , in that they have neglected for many years to make proposals that were capable of " alleviating israel 's general mistrust . "
the paper commented that frustration had built up since israel 's full withdrawal from the gaza strip last summer - a move which , it says , was not rewarded by the other side .

" the action plan provides a very good basis for our further work and cooperation , " finnish foreign minister erkki tuomioja told reporters after the plan was unveiled in brussels by serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica .
finland currently holds the eu presidency . " the plan needs to be developed further and the implemention of the action must begin immediately , " tuomioja added . economically hobbled by the wars that tore the former yugoslavia apart in the 1990s , serbia is desperate to keep alive its hopes of one day joining europe 's rich 25-member club . but the eu froze talks on closer ties with serbia in may , because of the failure of authorities to hand mladic , the former bosnian serb military chief , to the international criminal tribunal for former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- . serbia is hoping to agree a stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- with the eu - typically the first step for balkan states to join the bloc . eu wa n ts results while the eu is aware that the prospect of membership for serbia is a powerful force for stability in a volatile region , union officials have vowed that they should only resume when there are results , not just action plans . eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn , who has supervised the saa talks with belgrade , expressed satisfaction that the plan could lead to mladic 's arrest . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olli rehn " i am glad to see that the action plan contains an unequivocal commitment from the serbian government to arrest ratko mladic and other remaining indictees , " he told reporters .
" a plan can be a means to an end but action is more important than the plan because it realizes the results that matter . " the three-page plan includes a media campaign highlighting the mladic case , security and legal elements , ways to improve cooperation with icty , and evokes the need to amend some specific laws . mladic and the former bosnian serb political leader radovan karadic , who is also wanted for trial , have been on the run since the war in bosnia ended in 1995 .
the fugitive general is being sought for genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity , notably for his role in the massacre of some 8,000 muslim boys and men in the eastern enclave of srebrenica in july that year .
mladic is believed to have been hiding in serbia , but belgrade has denied knowing of his whereabouts and claims that it has a strong political will to arrest him once it tracks him down . " we think this plan is something that will enable serbia to continue the negotiations -lrb- on the saa -rrb- , " said kostunica , who explained that his government would now prepare a " detailed operational plan . " some skepticism german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said he thought it could be " possible " for the talks to resume by the end of the year . however some in the european union are not convinced . asked before seeing the plan whether it could lead mladic 's capture , dutch foreign minister ben bot said : " we will see , they have said it so often .
i have been there on various occasions and each time they say in a week or in 14 days they will catch mladic .

" the plan needs to be developed further and the implemention of the action must begin immediately , " tuomioja added . economically hobbled by the wars that tore the former yugoslavia apart in the 1990s , serbia is desperate to keep alive its hopes of one day joining europe 's rich 25-member club . but the eu froze talks on closer ties with serbia in may , because of the failure of authorities to hand mladic , the former bosnian serb military chief , to the international criminal tribunal for former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- . serbia is hoping to agree a stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- with the eu - typically the first step for balkan states to join the bloc . eu wa n ts results while the eu is aware that the prospect of membership for serbia is a powerful force for stability in a volatile region , union officials have vowed that they should only resume when there are results , not just action plans . eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn , who has supervised the saa talks with belgrade , expressed satisfaction that the plan could lead to mladic 's arrest . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olli rehn " i am glad to see that the action plan contains an unequivocal commitment from the serbian government to arrest ratko mladic and other remaining indictees , " he told reporters .
" a plan can be a means to an end but action is more important than the plan because it realizes the results that matter . " the three-page plan includes a media campaign highlighting the mladic case , security and legal elements , ways to improve cooperation with icty , and evokes the need to amend some specific laws . mladic and the former bosnian serb political leader radovan karadic , who is also wanted for trial , have been on the run since the war in bosnia ended in 1995 .
the fugitive general is being sought for genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity , notably for his role in the massacre of some 8,000 muslim boys and men in the eastern enclave of srebrenica in july that year .
mladic is believed to have been hiding in serbia , but belgrade has denied knowing of his whereabouts and claims that it has a strong political will to arrest him once it tracks him down . " we think this plan is something that will enable serbia to continue the negotiations -lrb- on the saa -rrb- , " said kostunica , who explained that his government would now prepare a " detailed operational plan . " some skepticism german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said he thought it could be " possible " for the talks to resume by the end of the year . however some in the european union are not convinced . asked before seeing the plan whether it could lead mladic 's capture , dutch foreign minister ben bot said : " we will see , they have said it so often .
i have been there on various occasions and each time they say in a week or in 14 days they will catch mladic .

yet time is running out for international diplomatic intervention .
what role could the european union play in the negotiation process ? the european union 's foreign policy chief javier solana said tuesday he was preparing to head back to the middle east following a weekend trip to lebanon amid the upsurge of violence there . beirut has hosted several leading european politicians in the past few days , including solana and french prime minister dominique de villepin . " in the middle east , you ignite a match and you do not know how the fire will end , " solana told the press after his visit with lebanese government leaders in beirut on sunday .
" that is why we have to stop it with acts of good will by everybody .
the eu is trying to do that . " yet these visits seem more a supportive pat on the back for lebanon than concrete efforts to arbitrate . " the europeans appear to be more immediately concerned with the conflict than the united states is , yet europe 's role to date has been ineffective , " said robert lowe from the international affairs think tank chatham house in london . according to martin beck from the german institute for middle east studies in hamburg , there are significant problems regarding european negotiation efforts .

but it then proceeded to take on the us and israeli position and give up its own .
there was no independent policy . " since the 1980s , the european union has developed a policy with the main objective of a two-state solution in the middle east . " but the eu forgot its own position and only placed pressure on hamas , but not on israel , " beck said .

the israeli army has said its offensive to defeat hezbollah could last several weeks .
yet time is running out for international diplomatic intervention .
what role could the european union play in the negotiation process ? the european union 's foreign policy chief javier solana said tuesday he was preparing to head back to the middle east following a weekend trip to lebanon amid the upsurge of violence there . beirut has hosted several leading european politicians in the past few days , including solana and french prime minister dominique de villepin . " in the middle east , you ignite a match and you do not know how the fire will end , " solana told the press after his visit with lebanese government leaders in beirut on sunday .
" that is why we have to stop it with acts of good will by everybody .
the eu is trying to do that . " yet these visits seem more a supportive pat on the back for lebanon than concrete efforts to arbitrate . " the europeans appear to be more immediately concerned with the conflict than the united states is , yet europe 's role to date has been ineffective , " said robert lowe from the international affairs think tank chatham house in london . according to martin beck from the german institute for middle east studies in hamburg , there are significant problems regarding european negotiation efforts . " there still is n't a common european position on the conflict , " beck said .
" european countries have to reach a consensus on this before further action is possible . " germany supporting diplomatic efforts german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said germany was continuing to pursue a diplomatic strategy to calm the situation in the middle east . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister steinmeier is speaking with israeli and arab representatives " the fact that we have n't been successful does n't mean that they are unnecessary , " steinmeier told german television zdf on tuesday .
" we are trying to do everything that is possible . " for the past few days , there have been talks with government representatives from the region to sound out possibilities and interests , he said .
these efforts were being coordinated with the european union . while there have been calls for germany to step in as a mediator in the conflict , it alone can not mediate , said andreas schockenhoff , foreign policy expert of the cdu / csu parliamentary group . " rather , the european union together with russia , the united states and the united nations can try as a quartet to get the conflict parties to the negotiating table , " schockenhoff said . the eu has abandoned its middle east policy beck said the eu should have done more to contribute to the stabilization of the region since hamas won the majority of seats in palestinian elections in january 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas has the majority of support in the palestinian territories " in the past months , europe and the eu did n't understand the need to react properly to the hamas victory , " beck said .
" of course , europe was surprised by the election results as much as everyone else .
but it then proceeded to take on the us and israeli position and give up its own .
there was no independent policy . " since the 1980s , the european union has developed a policy with the main objective of a two-state solution in the middle east . " but the eu forgot its own position and only placed pressure on hamas , but not on israel , " beck said .
" this sent israel the message that not only the united states , but now also the eu stands behind its actions . " washington has backed israel 's right to self-defense and refuses to endorse international calls for an immediate ceasefire between israel and hezbollah . regional support for a ceasefire is necessary " the eu has to find its own position and quickly , " beck said .
even then , though , would european mediation have any potential influence ? " the israelis in part would be reluctant to accept european involvement and less inclined to listen to the europeans , " said lowe .
" and they do n't need to because of their ties to the united states . " lowe said the europeans should play a larger role in mediating the conflict .
" it is to the europeans ' credit that they are even visiting the region , " lowe said .
american officials had talked about sending secretary of state condoleezza rice , but so far she has not gone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli air strikes have damaged much of lebanon 's infrastructure " maybe the united states thinks israel can solve this militarily , but europe could be firmer in pushing for talks , " lowe said . schockenhoff said all the important players , which have interests in this region , needed to be at the negotiating table .

finland currently holds the eu presidency .

the fugitive general is being sought for genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity , notably for his role in the massacre of some 8,000 muslim boys and men in the eastern enclave of srebrenica in july that year .

the israeli army has said its offensive to defeat hezbollah could last several weeks .
yet time is running out for international diplomatic intervention .
what role could the european union play in the negotiation process ? the european union 's foreign policy chief javier solana said tuesday he was preparing to head back to the middle east following a weekend trip to lebanon amid the upsurge of violence there . beirut has hosted several leading european politicians in the past few days , including solana and french prime minister dominique de villepin .

there was no independent policy . " since the 1980s , the european union has developed a policy with the main objective of a two-state solution in the middle east . " but the eu forgot its own position and only placed pressure on hamas , but not on israel , " beck said .

while some see the exhibition as an important part of coming to terms with the gdr , others feel that it plays down the brutality of a dictatorship . visiting berlin as a tourist a couple of years ago , peter kenzelmann wanted to explain east germany to his girlfriend .
the ethnologist and political scientist from freiburg in southwestern germany had been to east berlin years ago .
but his partner had not witnessed the atmosphere behind the iron curtain and so the couple searched for a museum that showcased the daily lives of ordinary east germans . " try amsterdam , " officials at berlin 's tourism bureau told them , adding that someone had set up such a museum in the netherlands . flabbergasted , kenzelmann decided to fill the void .
he hired a team of historians and museum managers , began asking people to donate everything east german and found a bank to finance the venture . " i did n't want to become dependent on subsidies - we are a business , " the 36-year-old said on monday , sitting outside his freshly opened ddr , or gdr museum , which is located in the basement of a brand-new hotel and entertainment complex in the heart of former east berlin . ha n ds-o n exhibit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once omnipresent on east german streets , now a museum piece : the trabant kenzelmann and his team want visitors to have a hands-on experience .
many of the exhibits , such as school bags , award medals or diaries , are hidden in drawers that have been built into room dividers that resemble east germany 's prefabricated apartment buildings , or platte n baute n . there 's a trabant car that people can pretend to drive .
in one corner , curators have rebuilt a typical east german living room and kitchen .
east german propaganda phrases - " learning from the soviet union means learning how to win " and " apple sauce always tastes good " among them - adorn the walls .
short texts in german and english describe the items in the various sections such as those on education , work , shopping , media , sports and vacation . " on their web site it says that they still need nudist photos , but maybe that 's an old posting , " heidrun loeper told ingrid fischer as the two women came across the large display on nudist culture , which was popular in the gdr . a differe n t perspective bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inside the museum loeper , a 64-year-old literary scholar , and fischer , a 72-year old former primary school teacher , kept smiling as they walked through the museum and recognized things they themselves had used years ago .
both said they enjoyed the exhibition as it helped to rectify the image of eastern germans . " we 've been put down as neandertalers and this shows that we lived like normal people , " fischer said , adding that many east germans were not that affected by the repressive aspects of the communist regime such as the gdr 's secret service , or stasi . joseph spadola , a 23-year-old philosophy student from new york city , agreed that the museum 's emphasis on the mundane was a good thing . " this is the part we never hear about , " he said .
" it 's fascinating to see a different way of life while keeping ideology out of the picture . " skeptical voices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : too cute ?
visitors check out the living room inside the mock apartment those working to remind people of the dictatorial nature of the east german regime felt differently .
gabriele camphausen , who is in charge of educational programs at the federal commission that administers files from the stasi secret police , said she was stunned when she visited the museum . " visitors can leave the exhibition with the impression that this was a slightly bizarre state in the 20th century , " she said .
" it does n't become clear that this was a brutal dictatorship ...
imagine if someone had done such a museum on daily life during the nazi era .
people would criticize it , and rightly so . " hubertus knabe , director of the memorial at the former stasi prison in berlin hohenschönhausen , added that the museum 's concept fell in line with recommendations by a government commission to concentrate less on places symbolizing repression in the gdr . " i 'm skeptical that depictions of everyday life can explain life in a dictatorship , " knabe said , adding that he had not been to the museum .
" it 's not important how people ate and slept when describing a political system . " a worthwhile experime n t ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a model of the berlin wall death strip is the first thing museum visitors see but the museum 's director , robert rückel , countered that the stasi 's infiltration was clearly documented . he pointed to a corner with a stasi work station where visitors can eavesdrop on conversations in another part of the exhibition .
rückel added that other museums in berlin already highlighted aspects such as the wall and stasi repression . " our goal is to focus on the daily lives of people , " he said .
" it 's an experiment . " and a good one at that , said thomas ahbe , a sociologist who has written extensively on east german culture and identity . " it compliments the picture , " he said , adding that so far only so-called museums on everday life that are run by laymen exist throughout east germany .
" the crimes that happened in east germany have been documented extensively , but the scientific research on daily life has fallen by the wayside , " he said .
" i think it will still take a long time before we can get to a balanced view of gdr history . " mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de former stasi officers coming out of the shadows former members of east germany 's notorious secret police , the stasi , have increased their public profile recently , insisting that they are being libeled by the larger society .

detlev mehlis , former un inspector , told deutsche welle that iran and syria are definitely playing a role . detlev mehlis , a senior public prosecutor in berlin is a former investigator with the united nations and closely involved in the probe after the assassination of lebanese prime minister rafiq hariri . very familiar with the dynamics and power politics of the region , mehlis is convinced that syria and iran are behind the recent outbreak of violence between israel and lebanon . while he says he has no proof , he insists that the current events would not be happening without explicit approval from syria , especially since the weapons being used by hezbollah in all likelihood came through syria . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : detlev mehlis in his former role as a un investigator " syria is on hezbollah 's side and vice versa , " he said .
" hezbollah would certainly not risk taking the kind of action it has without having syria 's approval . " mehlis thinks that syria , despite its withdrawal under international pressure from lebanon last year , has not given up its desire to bring the country under its control again . that became quite clear during the investigation into the hariri case , he says .
syrian secret agents tried to interfere in the investigation , the syrian justice department got involved and witness were intimidated .
according to him , syria 's attitude toward lebanon has not changed in the slightest . " syria refuses to this day to establish diplomatic relations ; it refuses to recognized a binding demarcation of common borders , " he said .
" for syria , lebanon is nowhere near being an autonomous country . " proxy war ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shiite muslim supporters of the hezbollah group but mehlis dismisses the speculation that hezbollah is conducting a proxy war for iran and syria as precisely that - speculation .
but he says that while such an analysis is premature , it is not a completely misguided conclusion , since syria has an interest in the destabilization of lebanon . formulating a strategy for preventing that very development , however , is difficult .
mehlis does think the idea of sending un troops into southern lebanon is an interesting one .
however , he thinks the peacekeepers ' effectiveness could be limited . the united nations interim force in lebanon -lrb- unifil -rrb- , created in 1978 to confirm israeli withdrawal from lebanon , has had limited success in preventing israel from marching into lebanon or in stopping hezbollah from firing on israel . " the influence of the international community is restricted , " he said .
" the us has a clear influence on israel , that is certain .
iran and syria have real influence over hezbollah .
but whether they can apply enough pressure to stop the assaults , i doubt .
i think it 's unfortunately going to take some time . " hezbollah 's firing of iranian rockets over the last few days with a range of up to 100 kilometers has taken the conflict to a new dimension .
it has cast doubt on security concepts that up to now have been based on the concept of " security zones . "
those might have been effective when the weapons were katyusha rockets with a range of under 20 kilometers .
but when hezbollah rockets can now threaten haifa and other israeli cities , the entire equation is changed . " still , buffer zones would help prevent incidents that have led to this escalation such as the kidnapping of israeli soldiers , " said mehlis . " but what can one do ?
the lesser of two evils is still better than conflicts like we 're seeing now .

detlev mehlis , former un inspector , told deutsche welle that iran and syria are definitely playing a role . detlev mehlis , a senior public prosecutor in berlin is a former investigator with the united nations and closely involved in the probe after the assassination of lebanese prime minister rafiq hariri . very familiar with the dynamics and power politics of the region , mehlis is convinced that syria and iran are behind the recent outbreak of violence between israel and lebanon . while he says he has no proof , he insists that the current events would not be happening without explicit approval from syria , especially since the weapons being used by hezbollah in all likelihood came through syria . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : detlev mehlis in his former role as a un investigator " syria is on hezbollah 's side and vice versa , " he said .
" hezbollah would certainly not risk taking the kind of action it has without having syria 's approval . " mehlis thinks that syria , despite its withdrawal under international pressure from lebanon last year , has not given up its desire to bring the country under its control again . that became quite clear during the investigation into the hariri case , he says .
syrian secret agents tried to interfere in the investigation , the syrian justice department got involved and witness were intimidated .
according to him , syria 's attitude toward lebanon has not changed in the slightest . " syria refuses to this day to establish diplomatic relations ; it refuses to recognized a binding demarcation of common borders , " he said .
" for syria , lebanon is nowhere near being an autonomous country . " proxy war ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shiite muslim supporters of the hezbollah group but mehlis dismisses the speculation that hezbollah is conducting a proxy war for iran and syria as precisely that - speculation .
but he says that while such an analysis is premature , it is not a completely misguided conclusion , since syria has an interest in the destabilization of lebanon . formulating a strategy for preventing that very development , however , is difficult .
mehlis does think the idea of sending un troops into southern lebanon is an interesting one .
however , he thinks the peacekeepers ' effectiveness could be limited . the united nations interim force in lebanon -lrb- unifil -rrb- , created in 1978 to confirm israeli withdrawal from lebanon , has had limited success in preventing israel from marching into lebanon or in stopping hezbollah from firing on israel . " the influence of the international community is restricted , " he said .
" the us has a clear influence on israel , that is certain .
iran and syria have real influence over hezbollah .
but whether they can apply enough pressure to stop the assaults , i doubt .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 18.07.2006 opinion : g8 summit has limited effect for russia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and his ministers did all they could to make a case for russia at the g8 summit russian president putin 's aim going into the group of eight talks was clear : increase russia 's international prestige and make moscow one of the leading industrial capitals .
he failed , says dw-world.de 's ingo mannteufel . russians have complained about the west 's negative view of their country for years .
this year 's g8 presidency was supposed to help bring russia around the international corner with the help of the kremlin 's long-planned public relations campaign .
it did n't hesitate to spend money on us pr consultancy ketchum as an advisor .
putin 's adversary mikhail khodorkovsky and his -lrb- now virtually defunct -rrb- oil company yukos had proven before that the use of a western communications firm can help to promote one 's views : one of the best agencies , apco , still works for the oligarch that was sentenced by the kremlin . puti n " on message " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the media left st. petersburg with a variety of messages thanks to the influence of the western advisors and russian spin doctors , president vladimir putin and his ministers were part of every imaginable conference seminar ahead of the summit .
from the mini summit of religious leaders , labor and union boss meetings to exclusive television interviews with media from all the g8 countries and even at the internet conference organized by the bbc and russian news agency ria novosti , putin 's message became clear : russia is a stable , democratic and economically prosperous country that is entitled to participate in discussions about international affairs . the emphasis the western media gave russia 's important economic role was one of the successes putin and the russian leadership were able to take away from the three-day meeting .
an increased awareness of russia 's international and domestic policies also emerged in the west . but russia 's lack of a fair judicial system in putin 's highly centralized government did not escape the media 's notice , nor did the limits put on freedom of expression and the aggressive methods the government uses when dealing with opposition parties . whether putin was actually successful in improving russia 's image remains open to debate .
the west 's uneasiness when it comes to domestic developments in russia is still too strong , which will become clear during the coming parliamentary and presidential elections in 2007 and 2008 , when putin 's successor is chosen .
it is clear there 's more that stands between russia and the west than can be solved by a savvy public relations expert . failed eco n omic goals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no positions were changed after a weekend of talks putin also did not succeed in his second goal of integrating moscow in the group of leading industrial nations when it comes to energy security .
he got neither an approval for russia 's entrance to the world trade organization from us president george w. bush nor a change the european position regarding an energy partnership .
europe 's g8 members continue to insist that russia ratify the so-called energy charter before russian companies , including gazprom , are allowed free access to the european market . instead there were only the general , non-binding and vaguely worded statements about a shared responsibility for the world 's energy resources and calls for improved energy efficiency coming out of st. petersburg .
though these points are far from inconsequential , they are still too insubstantial for a topic the kremlin itself put on the g8 agenda . in fact , a joint statement on violence in the middle east was in some ways the only issue that saved russia 's first g8 summit from meaninglessness . ingo mannteufel -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu renews call for restraint in middle east european union foreign ministers are scrambling to find diplomatic solutions to halt the fighting between israel and hezbollah , as the escalating crisis risks setting the middle east aflame .
-lrb- july 17 , 2006 -rrb- g8 demands end to israeli assaults , militant attacks g8 leaders have called for " an end to israeli military operations " in the middle east and a halt to the shelling by militants of israeli territory after struggling to come up with a unified response to the crisis .

" it 's a new orient , " assessed the paper , " everything has changed since the fall of saddam . "
in just the last few months , the world has witnessed " arafat 's death , israel 's withdrawal from the gaza strip , sharon 's retirement , the developments in iran , syria 's withdrawal from lebanon , growing rivalries between the shiites and sunnis , and the chaos in iraq . "
all that , and the us , which had once been the referee in the region , has sunk into the " quagmire of iraq . " " the fire is spreading , " concluded the paper , " but who can make a stand against it ? " " israel has , in fact , the right to defend its territory , " opined serbia 's danas tuesday , but tempered the statement by saying the disproportional military response to the israeli soldier 's abduction indicated alternative motives .
" the hezbollah attack gave israel a legitimate reason to strike back , " asserted the paper .
without the military confrontation , olmert 's government would have faced certain political death , it said , adding : " olmert did n't pass up the opportunity to achieve deep political consensus and conduct a war that the majority of israelis support . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who can - and should - curb the violence ?
austria 's der standard praised the g8 countries for not only recognizing who is guilty in the crisis but also for casting off their timidity and " calling the guilty parties by name . "
" one can only hope , " continued the paper , " that the western world , out of its own interests , will now help kick out hezbollah . "
if that does n't work , warned the paper , " then hezbollah will have a nuclear iran behind them when they provoke the next crisis - and then the middle east will look very old . " the g8 declaration on the middle east " must rank as one of the most pro-israel international statements in at least a decade " and " is motivated by the fear that a victory for hamas and hezbollah will be a victory for the forces of extremism across the islamic world , " assessed britain 's telegraph .
on the other hand , " israel sees the war as an opportunity to change the perception that its withdrawals from lebanon in 2000 and gaza in 2005 were a sign of weakness . "
the paper predicted that an international intervention force would " either be ineffectual or risk turning itself into a target " and that " the best chance of success lies in politics and diplomacy . " the arab and muslim neighbors of palestine and israel have failed , concluded germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , in that they have neglected for many years to make proposals that were capable of " alleviating israel 's general mistrust . "
the paper commented that frustration had built up since israel 's full withdrawal from the gaza strip last summer - a move which , it says , was not rewarded by the other side .
" the israeli public is demanding an even stronger approach than the one taken so far , " observed the paper , adding that this stronger approach is now being demonstrated . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de annan , g8 call for international peacekeepers in middle east un secretary-general kofi annan and leaders of the g8 industrial nations called monday for a swift deployment of international troops in southern lebanon to halt escalating middle east violence .

" the action plan provides a very good basis for our further work and cooperation , " finnish foreign minister erkki tuomioja told reporters after the plan was unveiled in brussels by serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica .
finland currently holds the eu presidency . " the plan needs to be developed further and the implemention of the action must begin immediately , " tuomioja added . economically hobbled by the wars that tore the former yugoslavia apart in the 1990s , serbia is desperate to keep alive its hopes of one day joining europe 's rich 25-member club . but the eu froze talks on closer ties with serbia in may , because of the failure of authorities to hand mladic , the former bosnian serb military chief , to the international criminal tribunal for former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- . serbia is hoping to agree a stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- with the eu - typically the first step for balkan states to join the bloc . eu wa n ts results while the eu is aware that the prospect of membership for serbia is a powerful force for stability in a volatile region , union officials have vowed that they should only resume when there are results , not just action plans . eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn , who has supervised the saa talks with belgrade , expressed satisfaction that the plan could lead to mladic 's arrest . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olli rehn " i am glad to see that the action plan contains an unequivocal commitment from the serbian government to arrest ratko mladic and other remaining indictees , " he told reporters .
" a plan can be a means to an end but action is more important than the plan because it realizes the results that matter . " the three-page plan includes a media campaign highlighting the mladic case , security and legal elements , ways to improve cooperation with icty , and evokes the need to amend some specific laws . mladic and the former bosnian serb political leader radovan karadic , who is also wanted for trial , have been on the run since the war in bosnia ended in 1995 .
the fugitive general is being sought for genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity , notably for his role in the massacre of some 8,000 muslim boys and men in the eastern enclave of srebrenica in july that year .
mladic is believed to have been hiding in serbia , but belgrade has denied knowing of his whereabouts and claims that it has a strong political will to arrest him once it tracks him down . " we think this plan is something that will enable serbia to continue the negotiations -lrb- on the saa -rrb- , " said kostunica , who explained that his government would now prepare a " detailed operational plan . " some skepticism german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said he thought it could be " possible " for the talks to resume by the end of the year . however some in the european union are not convinced . asked before seeing the plan whether it could lead mladic 's capture , dutch foreign minister ben bot said : " we will see , they have said it so often .
i have been there on various occasions and each time they say in a week or in 14 days they will catch mladic .
i 'm still waiting . " dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de srebrenica mass trial opens in the hague the trial of seven top bosnian serb military officials opened in the hague on friday .

-lrb- july 14 , 2006 -rrb- eu suspends talks on closer ties with serbia the european commission announced wednesday that it had suspended talks on closer ties with serbia because belgrade has failed to fully cooperate with the united nations war crimes court .

" the plan needs to be developed further and the implemention of the action must begin immediately , " tuomioja added . economically hobbled by the wars that tore the former yugoslavia apart in the 1990s , serbia is desperate to keep alive its hopes of one day joining europe 's rich 25-member club . but the eu froze talks on closer ties with serbia in may , because of the failure of authorities to hand mladic , the former bosnian serb military chief , to the international criminal tribunal for former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- . serbia is hoping to agree a stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- with the eu - typically the first step for balkan states to join the bloc . eu wa n ts results while the eu is aware that the prospect of membership for serbia is a powerful force for stability in a volatile region , union officials have vowed that they should only resume when there are results , not just action plans . eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn , who has supervised the saa talks with belgrade , expressed satisfaction that the plan could lead to mladic 's arrest . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olli rehn " i am glad to see that the action plan contains an unequivocal commitment from the serbian government to arrest ratko mladic and other remaining indictees , " he told reporters .
" a plan can be a means to an end but action is more important than the plan because it realizes the results that matter . " the three-page plan includes a media campaign highlighting the mladic case , security and legal elements , ways to improve cooperation with icty , and evokes the need to amend some specific laws . mladic and the former bosnian serb political leader radovan karadic , who is also wanted for trial , have been on the run since the war in bosnia ended in 1995 .
the fugitive general is being sought for genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity , notably for his role in the massacre of some 8,000 muslim boys and men in the eastern enclave of srebrenica in july that year .
mladic is believed to have been hiding in serbia , but belgrade has denied knowing of his whereabouts and claims that it has a strong political will to arrest him once it tracks him down . " we think this plan is something that will enable serbia to continue the negotiations -lrb- on the saa -rrb- , " said kostunica , who explained that his government would now prepare a " detailed operational plan . " some skepticism german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said he thought it could be " possible " for the talks to resume by the end of the year . however some in the european union are not convinced . asked before seeing the plan whether it could lead mladic 's capture , dutch foreign minister ben bot said : " we will see , they have said it so often .
i have been there on various occasions and each time they say in a week or in 14 days they will catch mladic .
i 'm still waiting . " dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de srebrenica mass trial opens in the hague the trial of seven top bosnian serb military officials opened in the hague on friday .

detlev mehlis , former un inspector , told deutsche welle that iran and syria are definitely playing a role . detlev mehlis , a senior public prosecutor in berlin is a former investigator with the united nations and closely involved in the probe after the assassination of lebanese prime minister rafiq hariri . very familiar with the dynamics and power politics of the region , mehlis is convinced that syria and iran are behind the recent outbreak of violence between israel and lebanon . while he says he has no proof , he insists that the current events would not be happening without explicit approval from syria , especially since the weapons being used by hezbollah in all likelihood came through syria . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : detlev mehlis in his former role as a un investigator " syria is on hezbollah 's side and vice versa , " he said .
" hezbollah would certainly not risk taking the kind of action it has without having syria 's approval . " mehlis thinks that syria , despite its withdrawal under international pressure from lebanon last year , has not given up its desire to bring the country under its control again . that became quite clear during the investigation into the hariri case , he says .
syrian secret agents tried to interfere in the investigation , the syrian justice department got involved and witness were intimidated .
according to him , syria 's attitude toward lebanon has not changed in the slightest . " syria refuses to this day to establish diplomatic relations ; it refuses to recognized a binding demarcation of common borders , " he said .
" for syria , lebanon is nowhere near being an autonomous country . " proxy war ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shiite muslim supporters of the hezbollah group but mehlis dismisses the speculation that hezbollah is conducting a proxy war for iran and syria as precisely that - speculation .
but he says that while such an analysis is premature , it is not a completely misguided conclusion , since syria has an interest in the destabilization of lebanon . formulating a strategy for preventing that very development , however , is difficult .
mehlis does think the idea of sending un troops into southern lebanon is an interesting one .
however , he thinks the peacekeepers ' effectiveness could be limited . the united nations interim force in lebanon -lrb- unifil -rrb- , created in 1978 to confirm israeli withdrawal from lebanon , has had limited success in preventing israel from marching into lebanon or in stopping hezbollah from firing on israel . " the influence of the international community is restricted , " he said .
" the us has a clear influence on israel , that is certain .
iran and syria have real influence over hezbollah .
but whether they can apply enough pressure to stop the assaults , i doubt .
i think it 's unfortunately going to take some time . " hezbollah 's firing of iranian rockets over the last few days with a range of up to 100 kilometers has taken the conflict to a new dimension .
it has cast doubt on security concepts that up to now have been based on the concept of " security zones . "
those might have been effective when the weapons were katyusha rockets with a range of under 20 kilometers .
but when hezbollah rockets can now threaten haifa and other israeli cities , the entire equation is changed . " still , buffer zones would help prevent incidents that have led to this escalation such as the kidnapping of israeli soldiers , " said mehlis . " but what can one do ?

detlev mehlis , former un inspector , told deutsche welle that iran and syria are definitely playing a role . detlev mehlis , a senior public prosecutor in berlin is a former investigator with the united nations and closely involved in the probe after the assassination of lebanese prime minister rafiq hariri . very familiar with the dynamics and power politics of the region , mehlis is convinced that syria and iran are behind the recent outbreak of violence between israel and lebanon . while he says he has no proof , he insists that the current events would not be happening without explicit approval from syria , especially since the weapons being used by hezbollah in all likelihood came through syria . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : detlev mehlis in his former role as a un investigator " syria is on hezbollah 's side and vice versa , " he said .
" hezbollah would certainly not risk taking the kind of action it has without having syria 's approval . " mehlis thinks that syria , despite its withdrawal under international pressure from lebanon last year , has not given up its desire to bring the country under its control again . that became quite clear during the investigation into the hariri case , he says .
syrian secret agents tried to interfere in the investigation , the syrian justice department got involved and witness were intimidated .
according to him , syria 's attitude toward lebanon has not changed in the slightest . " syria refuses to this day to establish diplomatic relations ; it refuses to recognized a binding demarcation of common borders , " he said .
" for syria , lebanon is nowhere near being an autonomous country . " proxy war ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shiite muslim supporters of the hezbollah group but mehlis dismisses the speculation that hezbollah is conducting a proxy war for iran and syria as precisely that - speculation .
but he says that while such an analysis is premature , it is not a completely misguided conclusion , since syria has an interest in the destabilization of lebanon . formulating a strategy for preventing that very development , however , is difficult .
mehlis does think the idea of sending un troops into southern lebanon is an interesting one .
however , he thinks the peacekeepers ' effectiveness could be limited . the united nations interim force in lebanon -lrb- unifil -rrb- , created in 1978 to confirm israeli withdrawal from lebanon , has had limited success in preventing israel from marching into lebanon or in stopping hezbollah from firing on israel . " the influence of the international community is restricted , " he said .
" the us has a clear influence on israel , that is certain .
iran and syria have real influence over hezbollah .
but whether they can apply enough pressure to stop the assaults , i doubt .
i think it 's unfortunately going to take some time . " hezbollah 's firing of iranian rockets over the last few days with a range of up to 100 kilometers has taken the conflict to a new dimension .
it has cast doubt on security concepts that up to now have been based on the concept of " security zones . "
those might have been effective when the weapons were katyusha rockets with a range of under 20 kilometers .
but when hezbollah rockets can now threaten haifa and other israeli cities , the entire equation is changed . " still , buffer zones would help prevent incidents that have led to this escalation such as the kidnapping of israeli soldiers , " said mehlis . " but what can one do ?

the israeli army has said its offensive to defeat hezbollah could last several weeks .
yet time is running out for international diplomatic intervention .
what role could the european union play in the negotiation process ? the european union 's foreign policy chief javier solana said tuesday he was preparing to head back to the middle east following a weekend trip to lebanon amid the upsurge of violence there . beirut has hosted several leading european politicians in the past few days , including solana and french prime minister dominique de villepin . " in the middle east , you ignite a match and you do not know how the fire will end , " solana told the press after his visit with lebanese government leaders in beirut on sunday .
" that is why we have to stop it with acts of good will by everybody .
the eu is trying to do that . " yet these visits seem more a supportive pat on the back for lebanon than concrete efforts to arbitrate . " the europeans appear to be more immediately concerned with the conflict than the united states is , yet europe 's role to date has been ineffective , " said robert lowe from the international affairs think tank chatham house in london . according to martin beck from the german institute for middle east studies in hamburg , there are significant problems regarding european negotiation efforts . " there still is n't a common european position on the conflict , " beck said .
" european countries have to reach a consensus on this before further action is possible . " germany supporting diplomatic efforts german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said germany was continuing to pursue a diplomatic strategy to calm the situation in the middle east . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister steinmeier is speaking with israeli and arab representatives " the fact that we have n't been successful does n't mean that they are unnecessary , " steinmeier told german television zdf on tuesday .
" we are trying to do everything that is possible . " for the past few days , there have been talks with government representatives from the region to sound out possibilities and interests , he said .
these efforts were being coordinated with the european union . while there have been calls for germany to step in as a mediator in the conflict , it alone can not mediate , said andreas schockenhoff , foreign policy expert of the cdu / csu parliamentary group . " rather , the european union together with russia , the united states and the united nations can try as a quartet to get the conflict parties to the negotiating table , " schockenhoff said . the eu has abandoned its middle east policy beck said the eu should have done more to contribute to the stabilization of the region since hamas won the majority of seats in palestinian elections in january 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas has the majority of support in the palestinian territories " in the past months , europe and the eu did n't understand the need to react properly to the hamas victory , " beck said .
" of course , europe was surprised by the election results as much as everyone else .
but it then proceeded to take on the us and israeli position and give up its own .
there was no independent policy . " since the 1980s , the european union has developed a policy with the main objective of a two-state solution in the middle east . " but the eu forgot its own position and only placed pressure on hamas , but not on israel , " beck said .
" this sent israel the message that not only the united states , but now also the eu stands behind its actions . " washington has backed israel 's right to self-defense and refuses to endorse international calls for an immediate ceasefire between israel and hezbollah . regional support for a ceasefire is necessary " the eu has to find its own position and quickly , " beck said .
even then , though , would european mediation have any potential influence ? " the israelis in part would be reluctant to accept european involvement and less inclined to listen to the europeans , " said lowe .
" and they do n't need to because of their ties to the united states . " lowe said the europeans should play a larger role in mediating the conflict .
" it is to the europeans ' credit that they are even visiting the region , " lowe said .
american officials had talked about sending secretary of state condoleezza rice , but so far she has not gone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli air strikes have damaged much of lebanon 's infrastructure " maybe the united states thinks israel can solve this militarily , but europe could be firmer in pushing for talks , " lowe said . schockenhoff said all the important players , which have interests in this region , needed to be at the negotiating table . " otherwise , it wo n't succeed , " schockenhoff said .
" hezbollah 's actions have turned this into a supra-regional conflict .
its solution calls for a clear political stance from tehran and damascus . " lowe agreed that many parties needed to be involved .
" the hezbollah does not seem inclined to reduce the attacks .
only syria and iran could bring it into negotiations , " he said . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de by land and sea , europeans flee lebanon for their lives helicopters and warships , chartered ferries and passenger vessels have arrived in lebanon to pick up tens of thousands of people in one of the biggest mass evacuations since world war ii .

the israeli army has said its offensive to defeat hezbollah could last several weeks .
yet time is running out for international diplomatic intervention .
what role could the european union play in the negotiation process ? the european union 's foreign policy chief javier solana said tuesday he was preparing to head back to the middle east following a weekend trip to lebanon amid the upsurge of violence there . beirut has hosted several leading european politicians in the past few days , including solana and french prime minister dominique de villepin . " in the middle east , you ignite a match and you do not know how the fire will end , " solana told the press after his visit with lebanese government leaders in beirut on sunday .
" that is why we have to stop it with acts of good will by everybody .
the eu is trying to do that . " yet these visits seem more a supportive pat on the back for lebanon than concrete efforts to arbitrate . " the europeans appear to be more immediately concerned with the conflict than the united states is , yet europe 's role to date has been ineffective , " said robert lowe from the international affairs think tank chatham house in london . according to martin beck from the german institute for middle east studies in hamburg , there are significant problems regarding european negotiation efforts . " there still is n't a common european position on the conflict , " beck said .
" european countries have to reach a consensus on this before further action is possible . " germany supporting diplomatic efforts german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said germany was continuing to pursue a diplomatic strategy to calm the situation in the middle east . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister steinmeier is speaking with israeli and arab representatives " the fact that we have n't been successful does n't mean that they are unnecessary , " steinmeier told german television zdf on tuesday .

while some see the exhibition as an important part of coming to terms with the gdr , others feel that it plays down the brutality of a dictatorship . visiting berlin as a tourist a couple of years ago , peter kenzelmann wanted to explain east germany to his girlfriend .
the ethnologist and political scientist from freiburg in southwestern germany had been to east berlin years ago .
but his partner had not witnessed the atmosphere behind the iron curtain and so the couple searched for a museum that showcased the daily lives of ordinary east germans . " try amsterdam , " officials at berlin 's tourism bureau told them , adding that someone had set up such a museum in the netherlands . flabbergasted , kenzelmann decided to fill the void .
he hired a team of historians and museum managers , began asking people to donate everything east german and found a bank to finance the venture . " i did n't want to become dependent on subsidies - we are a business , " the 36-year-old said on monday , sitting outside his freshly opened ddr , or gdr museum , which is located in the basement of a brand-new hotel and entertainment complex in the heart of former east berlin . ha n ds-o n exhibit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once omnipresent on east german streets , now a museum piece : the trabant kenzelmann and his team want visitors to have a hands-on experience .
many of the exhibits , such as school bags , award medals or diaries , are hidden in drawers that have been built into room dividers that resemble east germany 's prefabricated apartment buildings , or platte n baute n . there 's a trabant car that people can pretend to drive .
in one corner , curators have rebuilt a typical east german living room and kitchen .
east german propaganda phrases - " learning from the soviet union means learning how to win " and " apple sauce always tastes good " among them - adorn the walls .

both said they enjoyed the exhibition as it helped to rectify the image of eastern germans . " we 've been put down as neandertalers and this shows that we lived like normal people , " fischer said , adding that many east germans were not that affected by the repressive aspects of the communist regime such as the gdr 's secret service , or stasi . joseph spadola , a 23-year-old philosophy student from new york city , agreed that the museum 's emphasis on the mundane was a good thing . " this is the part we never hear about , " he said .
" it 's fascinating to see a different way of life while keeping ideology out of the picture . " skeptical voices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : too cute ?
visitors check out the living room inside the mock apartment those working to remind people of the dictatorial nature of the east german regime felt differently .
gabriele camphausen , who is in charge of educational programs at the federal commission that administers files from the stasi secret police , said she was stunned when she visited the museum . " visitors can leave the exhibition with the impression that this was a slightly bizarre state in the 20th century , " she said .

people would criticize it , and rightly so .

while some see the exhibition as an important part of coming to terms with the gdr , others feel that it plays down the brutality of a dictatorship . visiting berlin as a tourist a couple of years ago , peter kenzelmann wanted to explain east germany to his girlfriend .
the ethnologist and political scientist from freiburg in southwestern germany had been to east berlin years ago .
but his partner had not witnessed the atmosphere behind the iron curtain and so the couple searched for a museum that showcased the daily lives of ordinary east germans . " try amsterdam , " officials at berlin 's tourism bureau told them , adding that someone had set up such a museum in the netherlands . flabbergasted , kenzelmann decided to fill the void .
he hired a team of historians and museum managers , began asking people to donate everything east german and found a bank to finance the venture . " i did n't want to become dependent on subsidies - we are a business , " the 36-year-old said on monday , sitting outside his freshly opened ddr , or gdr museum , which is located in the basement of a brand-new hotel and entertainment complex in the heart of former east berlin . ha n ds-o n exhibit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once omnipresent on east german streets , now a museum piece : the trabant kenzelmann and his team want visitors to have a hands-on experience .
many of the exhibits , such as school bags , award medals or diaries , are hidden in drawers that have been built into room dividers that resemble east germany 's prefabricated apartment buildings , or platte n baute n . there 's a trabant car that people can pretend to drive .
in one corner , curators have rebuilt a typical east german living room and kitchen .

gabriele camphausen , who is in charge of educational programs at the federal commission that administers files from the stasi secret police , said she was stunned when she visited the museum . " visitors can leave the exhibition with the impression that this was a slightly bizarre state in the 20th century , " she said .
" it does n't become clear that this was a brutal dictatorship ...

people would criticize it , and rightly so . " hubertus knabe , director of the memorial at the former stasi prison in berlin hohenschönhausen , added that the museum 's concept fell in line with recommendations by a government commission to concentrate less on places symbolizing repression in the gdr . " i 'm skeptical that depictions of everyday life can explain life in a dictatorship , " knabe said , adding that he had not been to the museum .

rückel added that other museums in berlin already highlighted aspects such as the wall and stasi repression . " our goal is to focus on the daily lives of people , " he said .

" we 've been put down as neandertalers and this shows that we lived like normal people , " fischer said , adding that many east germans were not that affected by the repressive aspects of the communist regime such as the gdr 's secret service , or stasi . joseph spadola , a 23-year-old philosophy student from new york city , agreed that the museum 's emphasis on the mundane was a good thing . " this is the part we never hear about , " he said .
" it 's fascinating to see a different way of life while keeping ideology out of the picture . " skeptical voices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : too cute ?
visitors check out the living room inside the mock apartment those working to remind people of the dictatorial nature of the east german regime felt differently .
gabriele camphausen , who is in charge of educational programs at the federal commission that administers files from the stasi secret police , said she was stunned when she visited the museum . " visitors can leave the exhibition with the impression that this was a slightly bizarre state in the 20th century , " she said .
" it does n't become clear that this was a brutal dictatorship ...
imagine if someone had done such a museum on daily life during the nazi era .
people would criticize it , and rightly so . " hubertus knabe , director of the memorial at the former stasi prison in berlin hohenschönhausen , added that the museum 's concept fell in line with recommendations by a government commission to concentrate less on places symbolizing repression in the gdr . " i 'm skeptical that depictions of everyday life can explain life in a dictatorship , " knabe said , adding that he had not been to the museum .
" it 's not important how people ate and slept when describing a political system . " a worthwhile experime n t ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a model of the berlin wall death strip is the first thing museum visitors see but the museum 's director , robert rückel , countered that the stasi 's infiltration was clearly documented . he pointed to a corner with a stasi work station where visitors can eavesdrop on conversations in another part of the exhibition .
rückel added that other museums in berlin already highlighted aspects such as the wall and stasi repression . " our goal is to focus on the daily lives of people , " he said .
" it 's an experiment . " and a good one at that , said thomas ahbe , a sociologist who has written extensively on east german culture and identity . " it compliments the picture , " he said , adding that so far only so-called museums on everday life that are run by laymen exist throughout east germany .
" the crimes that happened in east germany have been documented extensively , but the scientific research on daily life has fallen by the wayside , " he said .
" i think it will still take a long time before we can get to a balanced view of gdr history .

he failed , says dw-world.de 's ingo mannteufel . russians have complained about the west 's negative view of their country for years .
this year 's g8 presidency was supposed to help bring russia around the international corner with the help of the kremlin 's long-planned public relations campaign .

from the mini summit of religious leaders , labor and union boss meetings to exclusive television interviews with media from all the g8 countries and even at the internet conference organized by the bbc and russian news agency ria novosti , putin 's message became clear : russia is a stable , democratic and economically prosperous country that is entitled to participate in discussions about international affairs . the emphasis the western media gave russia 's important economic role was one of the successes putin and the russian leadership were able to take away from the three-day meeting .

" the action plan provides a very good basis for our further work and cooperation , " finnish foreign minister erkki tuomioja told reporters after the plan was unveiled in brussels by serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica .
finland currently holds the eu presidency . " the plan needs to be developed further and the implemention of the action must begin immediately , " tuomioja added . economically hobbled by the wars that tore the former yugoslavia apart in the 1990s , serbia is desperate to keep alive its hopes of one day joining europe 's rich 25-member club . but the eu froze talks on closer ties with serbia in may , because of the failure of authorities to hand mladic , the former bosnian serb military chief , to the international criminal tribunal for former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- . serbia is hoping to agree a stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- with the eu - typically the first step for balkan states to join the bloc . eu wa n ts results while the eu is aware that the prospect of membership for serbia is a powerful force for stability in a volatile region , union officials have vowed that they should only resume when there are results , not just action plans . eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn , who has supervised the saa talks with belgrade , expressed satisfaction that the plan could lead to mladic 's arrest . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olli rehn " i am glad to see that the action plan contains an unequivocal commitment from the serbian government to arrest ratko mladic and other remaining indictees , " he told reporters .
" a plan can be a means to an end but action is more important than the plan because it realizes the results that matter . " the three-page plan includes a media campaign highlighting the mladic case , security and legal elements , ways to improve cooperation with icty , and evokes the need to amend some specific laws . mladic and the former bosnian serb political leader radovan karadic , who is also wanted for trial , have been on the run since the war in bosnia ended in 1995 .
the fugitive general is being sought for genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity , notably for his role in the massacre of some 8,000 muslim boys and men in the eastern enclave of srebrenica in july that year .
mladic is believed to have been hiding in serbia , but belgrade has denied knowing of his whereabouts and claims that it has a strong political will to arrest him once it tracks him down . " we think this plan is something that will enable serbia to continue the negotiations -lrb- on the saa -rrb- , " said kostunica , who explained that his government would now prepare a " detailed operational plan . " some skepticism german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said he thought it could be " possible " for the talks to resume by the end of the year . however some in the european union are not convinced . asked before seeing the plan whether it could lead mladic 's capture , dutch foreign minister ben bot said : " we will see , they have said it so often .
i have been there on various occasions and each time they say in a week or in 14 days they will catch mladic .

detlev mehlis , former un inspector , told deutsche welle that iran and syria are definitely playing a role . detlev mehlis , a senior public prosecutor in berlin is a former investigator with the united nations and closely involved in the probe after the assassination of lebanese prime minister rafiq hariri . very familiar with the dynamics and power politics of the region , mehlis is convinced that syria and iran are behind the recent outbreak of violence between israel and lebanon . while he says he has no proof , he insists that the current events would not be happening without explicit approval from syria , especially since the weapons being used by hezbollah in all likelihood came through syria . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : detlev mehlis in his former role as a un investigator " syria is on hezbollah 's side and vice versa , " he said .
" hezbollah would certainly not risk taking the kind of action it has without having syria 's approval . " mehlis thinks that syria , despite its withdrawal under international pressure from lebanon last year , has not given up its desire to bring the country under its control again . that became quite clear during the investigation into the hariri case , he says .
syrian secret agents tried to interfere in the investigation , the syrian justice department got involved and witness were intimidated .
according to him , syria 's attitude toward lebanon has not changed in the slightest . " syria refuses to this day to establish diplomatic relations ; it refuses to recognized a binding demarcation of common borders , " he said .
" for syria , lebanon is nowhere near being an autonomous country . " proxy war ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shiite muslim supporters of the hezbollah group but mehlis dismisses the speculation that hezbollah is conducting a proxy war for iran and syria as precisely that - speculation .
but he says that while such an analysis is premature , it is not a completely misguided conclusion , since syria has an interest in the destabilization of lebanon . formulating a strategy for preventing that very development , however , is difficult .
mehlis does think the idea of sending un troops into southern lebanon is an interesting one .
however , he thinks the peacekeepers ' effectiveness could be limited . the united nations interim force in lebanon -lrb- unifil -rrb- , created in 1978 to confirm israeli withdrawal from lebanon , has had limited success in preventing israel from marching into lebanon or in stopping hezbollah from firing on israel . " the influence of the international community is restricted , " he said .
" the us has a clear influence on israel , that is certain .
iran and syria have real influence over hezbollah .
but whether they can apply enough pressure to stop the assaults , i doubt .
i think it 's unfortunately going to take some time . " hezbollah 's firing of iranian rockets over the last few days with a range of up to 100 kilometers has taken the conflict to a new dimension .
it has cast doubt on security concepts that up to now have been based on the concept of " security zones . "
those might have been effective when the weapons were katyusha rockets with a range of under 20 kilometers .
but when hezbollah rockets can now threaten haifa and other israeli cities , the entire equation is changed . " still , buffer zones would help prevent incidents that have led to this escalation such as the kidnapping of israeli soldiers , " said mehlis . " but what can one do ?

detlev mehlis , former un inspector , told deutsche welle that iran and syria are definitely playing a role . detlev mehlis , a senior public prosecutor in berlin is a former investigator with the united nations and closely involved in the probe after the assassination of lebanese prime minister rafiq hariri . very familiar with the dynamics and power politics of the region , mehlis is convinced that syria and iran are behind the recent outbreak of violence between israel and lebanon . while he says he has no proof , he insists that the current events would not be happening without explicit approval from syria , especially since the weapons being used by hezbollah in all likelihood came through syria . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : detlev mehlis in his former role as a un investigator " syria is on hezbollah 's side and vice versa , " he said .
" hezbollah would certainly not risk taking the kind of action it has without having syria 's approval . " mehlis thinks that syria , despite its withdrawal under international pressure from lebanon last year , has not given up its desire to bring the country under its control again . that became quite clear during the investigation into the hariri case , he says .
syrian secret agents tried to interfere in the investigation , the syrian justice department got involved and witness were intimidated .
according to him , syria 's attitude toward lebanon has not changed in the slightest . " syria refuses to this day to establish diplomatic relations ; it refuses to recognized a binding demarcation of common borders , " he said .
" for syria , lebanon is nowhere near being an autonomous country . " proxy war ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shiite muslim supporters of the hezbollah group but mehlis dismisses the speculation that hezbollah is conducting a proxy war for iran and syria as precisely that - speculation .
but he says that while such an analysis is premature , it is not a completely misguided conclusion , since syria has an interest in the destabilization of lebanon . formulating a strategy for preventing that very development , however , is difficult .
mehlis does think the idea of sending un troops into southern lebanon is an interesting one .
however , he thinks the peacekeepers ' effectiveness could be limited . the united nations interim force in lebanon -lrb- unifil -rrb- , created in 1978 to confirm israeli withdrawal from lebanon , has had limited success in preventing israel from marching into lebanon or in stopping hezbollah from firing on israel . " the influence of the international community is restricted , " he said .
" the us has a clear influence on israel , that is certain .
iran and syria have real influence over hezbollah .
but whether they can apply enough pressure to stop the assaults , i doubt .
i think it 's unfortunately going to take some time . " hezbollah 's firing of iranian rockets over the last few days with a range of up to 100 kilometers has taken the conflict to a new dimension .
it has cast doubt on security concepts that up to now have been based on the concept of " security zones . "
those might have been effective when the weapons were katyusha rockets with a range of under 20 kilometers .
but when hezbollah rockets can now threaten haifa and other israeli cities , the entire equation is changed . " still , buffer zones would help prevent incidents that have led to this escalation such as the kidnapping of israeli soldiers , " said mehlis . " but what can one do ?

" the action plan provides a very good basis for our further work and cooperation , " finnish foreign minister erkki tuomioja told reporters after the plan was unveiled in brussels by serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica .
finland currently holds the eu presidency . " the plan needs to be developed further and the implemention of the action must begin immediately , " tuomioja added . economically hobbled by the wars that tore the former yugoslavia apart in the 1990s , serbia is desperate to keep alive its hopes of one day joining europe 's rich 25-member club . but the eu froze talks on closer ties with serbia in may , because of the failure of authorities to hand mladic , the former bosnian serb military chief , to the international criminal tribunal for former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- . serbia is hoping to agree a stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- with the eu - typically the first step for balkan states to join the bloc . eu wa n ts results while the eu is aware that the prospect of membership for serbia is a powerful force for stability in a volatile region , union officials have vowed that they should only resume when there are results , not just action plans . eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn , who has supervised the saa talks with belgrade , expressed satisfaction that the plan could lead to mladic 's arrest . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olli rehn " i am glad to see that the action plan contains an unequivocal commitment from the serbian government to arrest ratko mladic and other remaining indictees , " he told reporters .
" a plan can be a means to an end but action is more important than the plan because it realizes the results that matter . " the three-page plan includes a media campaign highlighting the mladic case , security and legal elements , ways to improve cooperation with icty , and evokes the need to amend some specific laws . mladic and the former bosnian serb political leader radovan karadic , who is also wanted for trial , have been on the run since the war in bosnia ended in 1995 .
the fugitive general is being sought for genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity , notably for his role in the massacre of some 8,000 muslim boys and men in the eastern enclave of srebrenica in july that year .

" it 's a new orient , " assessed the paper , " everything has changed since the fall of saddam . "
in just the last few months , the world has witnessed " arafat 's death , israel 's withdrawal from the gaza strip , sharon 's retirement , the developments in iran , syria 's withdrawal from lebanon , growing rivalries between the shiites and sunnis , and the chaos in iraq . "

while some see the exhibition as an important part of coming to terms with the gdr , others feel that it plays down the brutality of a dictatorship . visiting berlin as a tourist a couple of years ago , peter kenzelmann wanted to explain east germany to his girlfriend .
the ethnologist and political scientist from freiburg in southwestern germany had been to east berlin years ago .
but his partner had not witnessed the atmosphere behind the iron curtain and so the couple searched for a museum that showcased the daily lives of ordinary east germans . " try amsterdam , " officials at berlin 's tourism bureau told them , adding that someone had set up such a museum in the netherlands . flabbergasted , kenzelmann decided to fill the void .
he hired a team of historians and museum managers , began asking people to donate everything east german and found a bank to finance the venture . " i did n't want to become dependent on subsidies - we are a business , " the 36-year-old said on monday , sitting outside his freshly opened ddr , or gdr museum , which is located in the basement of a brand-new hotel and entertainment complex in the heart of former east berlin . ha n ds-o n exhibit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once omnipresent on east german streets , now a museum piece : the trabant kenzelmann and his team want visitors to have a hands-on experience .
many of the exhibits , such as school bags , award medals or diaries , are hidden in drawers that have been built into room dividers that resemble east germany 's prefabricated apartment buildings , or platte n baute n . there 's a trabant car that people can pretend to drive .
in one corner , curators have rebuilt a typical east german living room and kitchen .
east german propaganda phrases - " learning from the soviet union means learning how to win " and " apple sauce always tastes good " among them - adorn the walls .
short texts in german and english describe the items in the various sections such as those on education , work , shopping , media , sports and vacation . " on their web site it says that they still need nudist photos , but maybe that 's an old posting , " heidrun loeper told ingrid fischer as the two women came across the large display on nudist culture , which was popular in the gdr . a differe n t perspective bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inside the museum loeper , a 64-year-old literary scholar , and fischer , a 72-year old former primary school teacher , kept smiling as they walked through the museum and recognized things they themselves had used years ago .
both said they enjoyed the exhibition as it helped to rectify the image of eastern germans . " we 've been put down as neandertalers and this shows that we lived like normal people , " fischer said , adding that many east germans were not that affected by the repressive aspects of the communist regime such as the gdr 's secret service , or stasi . joseph spadola , a 23-year-old philosophy student from new york city , agreed that the museum 's emphasis on the mundane was a good thing . " this is the part we never hear about , " he said .
" it 's fascinating to see a different way of life while keeping ideology out of the picture . " skeptical voices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : too cute ?
visitors check out the living room inside the mock apartment those working to remind people of the dictatorial nature of the east german regime felt differently .
gabriele camphausen , who is in charge of educational programs at the federal commission that administers files from the stasi secret police , said she was stunned when she visited the museum . " visitors can leave the exhibition with the impression that this was a slightly bizarre state in the 20th century , " she said .
" it does n't become clear that this was a brutal dictatorship ...
imagine if someone had done such a museum on daily life during the nazi era .
people would criticize it , and rightly so . " hubertus knabe , director of the memorial at the former stasi prison in berlin hohenschönhausen , added that the museum 's concept fell in line with recommendations by a government commission to concentrate less on places symbolizing repression in the gdr . " i 'm skeptical that depictions of everyday life can explain life in a dictatorship , " knabe said , adding that he had not been to the museum .
" it 's not important how people ate and slept when describing a political system . " a worthwhile experime n t ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a model of the berlin wall death strip is the first thing museum visitors see but the museum 's director , robert rückel , countered that the stasi 's infiltration was clearly documented . he pointed to a corner with a stasi work station where visitors can eavesdrop on conversations in another part of the exhibition .
rückel added that other museums in berlin already highlighted aspects such as the wall and stasi repression . " our goal is to focus on the daily lives of people , " he said .
" it 's an experiment . " and a good one at that , said thomas ahbe , a sociologist who has written extensively on east german culture and identity . " it compliments the picture , " he said , adding that so far only so-called museums on everday life that are run by laymen exist throughout east germany .
" the crimes that happened in east germany have been documented extensively , but the scientific research on daily life has fallen by the wayside , " he said .
" i think it will still take a long time before we can get to a balanced view of gdr history . " mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de former stasi officers coming out of the shadows former members of east germany 's notorious secret police , the stasi , have increased their public profile recently , insisting that they are being libeled by the larger society .

while some see the exhibition as an important part of coming to terms with the gdr , others feel that it plays down the brutality of a dictatorship . visiting berlin as a tourist a couple of years ago , peter kenzelmann wanted to explain east germany to his girlfriend .
the ethnologist and political scientist from freiburg in southwestern germany had been to east berlin years ago .
but his partner had not witnessed the atmosphere behind the iron curtain and so the couple searched for a museum that showcased the daily lives of ordinary east germans . " try amsterdam , " officials at berlin 's tourism bureau told them , adding that someone had set up such a museum in the netherlands . flabbergasted , kenzelmann decided to fill the void .
he hired a team of historians and museum managers , began asking people to donate everything east german and found a bank to finance the venture . " i did n't want to become dependent on subsidies - we are a business , " the 36-year-old said on monday , sitting outside his freshly opened ddr , or gdr museum , which is located in the basement of a brand-new hotel and entertainment complex in the heart of former east berlin . ha n ds-o n exhibit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once omnipresent on east german streets , now a museum piece : the trabant kenzelmann and his team want visitors to have a hands-on experience .

both said they enjoyed the exhibition as it helped to rectify the image of eastern germans . " we 've been put down as neandertalers and this shows that we lived like normal people , " fischer said , adding that many east germans were not that affected by the repressive aspects of the communist regime such as the gdr 's secret service , or stasi . joseph spadola , a 23-year-old philosophy student from new york city , agreed that the museum 's emphasis on the mundane was a good thing .

visitors check out the living room inside the mock apartment those working to remind people of the dictatorial nature of the east german regime felt differently .
gabriele camphausen , who is in charge of educational programs at the federal commission that administers files from the stasi secret police , said she was stunned when she visited the museum . " visitors can leave the exhibition with the impression that this was a slightly bizarre state in the 20th century , " she said .

rückel added that other museums in berlin already highlighted aspects such as the wall and stasi repression . " our goal is to focus on the daily lives of people , " he said .

the israeli army has said its offensive to defeat hezbollah could last several weeks .
yet time is running out for international diplomatic intervention .
what role could the european union play in the negotiation process ? the european union 's foreign policy chief javier solana said tuesday he was preparing to head back to the middle east following a weekend trip to lebanon amid the upsurge of violence there . beirut has hosted several leading european politicians in the past few days , including solana and french prime minister dominique de villepin . " in the middle east , you ignite a match and you do not know how the fire will end , " solana told the press after his visit with lebanese government leaders in beirut on sunday .

" that is why we have to stop it with acts of good will by everybody .
the eu is trying to do that . " yet these visits seem more a supportive pat on the back for lebanon than concrete efforts to arbitrate .

" there still is n't a common european position on the conflict , " beck said .

" we are trying to do everything that is possible . " for the past few days , there have been talks with government representatives from the region to sound out possibilities and interests , he said .
these efforts were being coordinated with the european union . while there have been calls for germany to step in as a mediator in the conflict , it alone can not mediate , said andreas schockenhoff , foreign policy expert of the cdu / csu parliamentary group . " rather , the european union together with russia , the united states and the united nations can try as a quartet to get the conflict parties to the negotiating table , " schockenhoff said . the eu has abandoned its middle east policy beck said the eu should have done more to contribute to the stabilization of the region since hamas won the majority of seats in palestinian elections in january 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas has the majority of support in the palestinian territories " in the past months , europe and the eu did n't understand the need to react properly to the hamas victory , " beck said .
" of course , europe was surprised by the election results as much as everyone else .
but it then proceeded to take on the us and israeli position and give up its own .
there was no independent policy . " since the 1980s , the european union has developed a policy with the main objective of a two-state solution in the middle east . " but the eu forgot its own position and only placed pressure on hamas , but not on israel , " beck said .

even then , though , would european mediation have any potential influence ? " the israelis in part would be reluctant to accept european involvement and less inclined to listen to the europeans , " said lowe .

while some see the exhibition as an important part of coming to terms with the gdr , others feel that it plays down the brutality of a dictatorship . visiting berlin as a tourist a couple of years ago , peter kenzelmann wanted to explain east germany to his girlfriend .
the ethnologist and political scientist from freiburg in southwestern germany had been to east berlin years ago .
but his partner had not witnessed the atmosphere behind the iron curtain and so the couple searched for a museum that showcased the daily lives of ordinary east germans . " try amsterdam , " officials at berlin 's tourism bureau told them , adding that someone had set up such a museum in the netherlands . flabbergasted , kenzelmann decided to fill the void .
he hired a team of historians and museum managers , began asking people to donate everything east german and found a bank to finance the venture . " i did n't want to become dependent on subsidies - we are a business , " the 36-year-old said on monday , sitting outside his freshly opened ddr , or gdr museum , which is located in the basement of a brand-new hotel and entertainment complex in the heart of former east berlin . ha n ds-o n exhibit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once omnipresent on east german streets , now a museum piece : the trabant kenzelmann and his team want visitors to have a hands-on experience .

he failed , says dw-world.de 's ingo mannteufel . russians have complained about the west 's negative view of their country for years .
this year 's g8 presidency was supposed to help bring russia around the international corner with the help of the kremlin 's long-planned public relations campaign .

putin 's adversary mikhail khodorkovsky and his -lrb- now virtually defunct -rrb- oil company yukos had proven before that the use of a western communications firm can help to promote one 's views : one of the best agencies , apco , still works for the oligarch that was sentenced by the kremlin . puti n " on message " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the media left st. petersburg with a variety of messages thanks to the influence of the western advisors and russian spin doctors , president vladimir putin and his ministers were part of every imaginable conference seminar ahead of the summit .
from the mini summit of religious leaders , labor and union boss meetings to exclusive television interviews with media from all the g8 countries and even at the internet conference organized by the bbc and russian news agency ria novosti , putin 's message became clear : russia is a stable , democratic and economically prosperous country that is entitled to participate in discussions about international affairs . the emphasis the western media gave russia 's important economic role was one of the successes putin and the russian leadership were able to take away from the three-day meeting .
an increased awareness of russia 's international and domestic policies also emerged in the west . but russia 's lack of a fair judicial system in putin 's highly centralized government did not escape the media 's notice , nor did the limits put on freedom of expression and the aggressive methods the government uses when dealing with opposition parties . whether putin was actually successful in improving russia 's image remains open to debate .
the west 's uneasiness when it comes to domestic developments in russia is still too strong , which will become clear during the coming parliamentary and presidential elections in 2007 and 2008 , when putin 's successor is chosen .

europe 's g8 members continue to insist that russia ratify the so-called energy charter before russian companies , including gazprom , are allowed free access to the european market . instead there were only the general , non-binding and vaguely worded statements about a shared responsibility for the world 's energy resources and calls for improved energy efficiency coming out of st. petersburg .
though these points are far from inconsequential , they are still too insubstantial for a topic the kremlin itself put on the g8 agenda . in fact , a joint statement on violence in the middle east was in some ways the only issue that saved russia 's first g8 summit from meaninglessness . ingo mannteufel -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu renews call for restraint in middle east european union foreign ministers are scrambling to find diplomatic solutions to halt the fighting between israel and hezbollah , as the escalating crisis risks setting the middle east aflame .

he failed , says dw-world.de 's ingo mannteufel . russians have complained about the west 's negative view of their country for years .
this year 's g8 presidency was supposed to help bring russia around the international corner with the help of the kremlin 's long-planned public relations campaign .
it did n't hesitate to spend money on us pr consultancy ketchum as an advisor .
putin 's adversary mikhail khodorkovsky and his -lrb- now virtually defunct -rrb- oil company yukos had proven before that the use of a western communications firm can help to promote one 's views : one of the best agencies , apco , still works for the oligarch that was sentenced by the kremlin . puti n " on message " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the media left st. petersburg with a variety of messages thanks to the influence of the western advisors and russian spin doctors , president vladimir putin and his ministers were part of every imaginable conference seminar ahead of the summit .
from the mini summit of religious leaders , labor and union boss meetings to exclusive television interviews with media from all the g8 countries and even at the internet conference organized by the bbc and russian news agency ria novosti , putin 's message became clear : russia is a stable , democratic and economically prosperous country that is entitled to participate in discussions about international affairs . the emphasis the western media gave russia 's important economic role was one of the successes putin and the russian leadership were able to take away from the three-day meeting .
an increased awareness of russia 's international and domestic policies also emerged in the west . but russia 's lack of a fair judicial system in putin 's highly centralized government did not escape the media 's notice , nor did the limits put on freedom of expression and the aggressive methods the government uses when dealing with opposition parties . whether putin was actually successful in improving russia 's image remains open to debate .
the west 's uneasiness when it comes to domestic developments in russia is still too strong , which will become clear during the coming parliamentary and presidential elections in 2007 and 2008 , when putin 's successor is chosen .
it is clear there 's more that stands between russia and the west than can be solved by a savvy public relations expert . failed eco n omic goals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no positions were changed after a weekend of talks putin also did not succeed in his second goal of integrating moscow in the group of leading industrial nations when it comes to energy security .
he got neither an approval for russia 's entrance to the world trade organization from us president george w. bush nor a change the european position regarding an energy partnership .

while some see the exhibition as an important part of coming to terms with the gdr , others feel that it plays down the brutality of a dictatorship . visiting berlin as a tourist a couple of years ago , peter kenzelmann wanted to explain east germany to his girlfriend .
the ethnologist and political scientist from freiburg in southwestern germany had been to east berlin years ago .
but his partner had not witnessed the atmosphere behind the iron curtain and so the couple searched for a museum that showcased the daily lives of ordinary east germans . " try amsterdam , " officials at berlin 's tourism bureau told them , adding that someone had set up such a museum in the netherlands . flabbergasted , kenzelmann decided to fill the void .
he hired a team of historians and museum managers , began asking people to donate everything east german and found a bank to finance the venture . " i did n't want to become dependent on subsidies - we are a business , " the 36-year-old said on monday , sitting outside his freshly opened ddr , or gdr museum , which is located in the basement of a brand-new hotel and entertainment complex in the heart of former east berlin . ha n ds-o n exhibit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once omnipresent on east german streets , now a museum piece : the trabant kenzelmann and his team want visitors to have a hands-on experience .
many of the exhibits , such as school bags , award medals or diaries , are hidden in drawers that have been built into room dividers that resemble east germany 's prefabricated apartment buildings , or platte n baute n . there 's a trabant car that people can pretend to drive .
in one corner , curators have rebuilt a typical east german living room and kitchen .
east german propaganda phrases - " learning from the soviet union means learning how to win " and " apple sauce always tastes good " among them - adorn the walls .
short texts in german and english describe the items in the various sections such as those on education , work , shopping , media , sports and vacation . " on their web site it says that they still need nudist photos , but maybe that 's an old posting , " heidrun loeper told ingrid fischer as the two women came across the large display on nudist culture , which was popular in the gdr . a differe n t perspective bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inside the museum loeper , a 64-year-old literary scholar , and fischer , a 72-year old former primary school teacher , kept smiling as they walked through the museum and recognized things they themselves had used years ago .
both said they enjoyed the exhibition as it helped to rectify the image of eastern germans . " we 've been put down as neandertalers and this shows that we lived like normal people , " fischer said , adding that many east germans were not that affected by the repressive aspects of the communist regime such as the gdr 's secret service , or stasi . joseph spadola , a 23-year-old philosophy student from new york city , agreed that the museum 's emphasis on the mundane was a good thing . " this is the part we never hear about , " he said .
" it 's fascinating to see a different way of life while keeping ideology out of the picture . " skeptical voices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : too cute ?
visitors check out the living room inside the mock apartment those working to remind people of the dictatorial nature of the east german regime felt differently .
gabriele camphausen , who is in charge of educational programs at the federal commission that administers files from the stasi secret police , said she was stunned when she visited the museum . " visitors can leave the exhibition with the impression that this was a slightly bizarre state in the 20th century , " she said .
" it does n't become clear that this was a brutal dictatorship ...
imagine if someone had done such a museum on daily life during the nazi era .
people would criticize it , and rightly so . " hubertus knabe , director of the memorial at the former stasi prison in berlin hohenschönhausen , added that the museum 's concept fell in line with recommendations by a government commission to concentrate less on places symbolizing repression in the gdr . " i 'm skeptical that depictions of everyday life can explain life in a dictatorship , " knabe said , adding that he had not been to the museum .
" it 's not important how people ate and slept when describing a political system . " a worthwhile experime n t ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a model of the berlin wall death strip is the first thing museum visitors see but the museum 's director , robert rückel , countered that the stasi 's infiltration was clearly documented . he pointed to a corner with a stasi work station where visitors can eavesdrop on conversations in another part of the exhibition .
rückel added that other museums in berlin already highlighted aspects such as the wall and stasi repression . " our goal is to focus on the daily lives of people , " he said .
" it 's an experiment . " and a good one at that , said thomas ahbe , a sociologist who has written extensively on east german culture and identity . " it compliments the picture , " he said , adding that so far only so-called museums on everday life that are run by laymen exist throughout east germany .
" the crimes that happened in east germany have been documented extensively , but the scientific research on daily life has fallen by the wayside , " he said .
" i think it will still take a long time before we can get to a balanced view of gdr history . " mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de former stasi officers coming out of the shadows former members of east germany 's notorious secret police , the stasi , have increased their public profile recently , insisting that they are being libeled by the larger society .

the israeli army has said its offensive to defeat hezbollah could last several weeks .
yet time is running out for international diplomatic intervention .
what role could the european union play in the negotiation process ? the european union 's foreign policy chief javier solana said tuesday he was preparing to head back to the middle east following a weekend trip to lebanon amid the upsurge of violence there . beirut has hosted several leading european politicians in the past few days , including solana and french prime minister dominique de villepin . " in the middle east , you ignite a match and you do not know how the fire will end , " solana told the press after his visit with lebanese government leaders in beirut on sunday .
" that is why we have to stop it with acts of good will by everybody .
the eu is trying to do that . " yet these visits seem more a supportive pat on the back for lebanon than concrete efforts to arbitrate . " the europeans appear to be more immediately concerned with the conflict than the united states is , yet europe 's role to date has been ineffective , " said robert lowe from the international affairs think tank chatham house in london . according to martin beck from the german institute for middle east studies in hamburg , there are significant problems regarding european negotiation efforts . " there still is n't a common european position on the conflict , " beck said .
" european countries have to reach a consensus on this before further action is possible . " germany supporting diplomatic efforts german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said germany was continuing to pursue a diplomatic strategy to calm the situation in the middle east . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister steinmeier is speaking with israeli and arab representatives " the fact that we have n't been successful does n't mean that they are unnecessary , " steinmeier told german television zdf on tuesday .
" we are trying to do everything that is possible . " for the past few days , there have been talks with government representatives from the region to sound out possibilities and interests , he said .
these efforts were being coordinated with the european union . while there have been calls for germany to step in as a mediator in the conflict , it alone can not mediate , said andreas schockenhoff , foreign policy expert of the cdu / csu parliamentary group . " rather , the european union together with russia , the united states and the united nations can try as a quartet to get the conflict parties to the negotiating table , " schockenhoff said . the eu has abandoned its middle east policy beck said the eu should have done more to contribute to the stabilization of the region since hamas won the majority of seats in palestinian elections in january 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas has the majority of support in the palestinian territories " in the past months , europe and the eu did n't understand the need to react properly to the hamas victory , " beck said .
" of course , europe was surprised by the election results as much as everyone else .
but it then proceeded to take on the us and israeli position and give up its own .
there was no independent policy . " since the 1980s , the european union has developed a policy with the main objective of a two-state solution in the middle east . " but the eu forgot its own position and only placed pressure on hamas , but not on israel , " beck said .
" this sent israel the message that not only the united states , but now also the eu stands behind its actions . " washington has backed israel 's right to self-defense and refuses to endorse international calls for an immediate ceasefire between israel and hezbollah . regional support for a ceasefire is necessary " the eu has to find its own position and quickly , " beck said .
even then , though , would european mediation have any potential influence ? " the israelis in part would be reluctant to accept european involvement and less inclined to listen to the europeans , " said lowe .
" and they do n't need to because of their ties to the united states . " lowe said the europeans should play a larger role in mediating the conflict .
" it is to the europeans ' credit that they are even visiting the region , " lowe said .

" otherwise , it wo n't succeed , " schockenhoff said .
" hezbollah 's actions have turned this into a supra-regional conflict .

the israeli army has said its offensive to defeat hezbollah could last several weeks .
yet time is running out for international diplomatic intervention .
what role could the european union play in the negotiation process ? the european union 's foreign policy chief javier solana said tuesday he was preparing to head back to the middle east following a weekend trip to lebanon amid the upsurge of violence there . beirut has hosted several leading european politicians in the past few days , including solana and french prime minister dominique de villepin . " in the middle east , you ignite a match and you do not know how the fire will end , " solana told the press after his visit with lebanese government leaders in beirut on sunday .
" that is why we have to stop it with acts of good will by everybody .
the eu is trying to do that . " yet these visits seem more a supportive pat on the back for lebanon than concrete efforts to arbitrate . " the europeans appear to be more immediately concerned with the conflict than the united states is , yet europe 's role to date has been ineffective , " said robert lowe from the international affairs think tank chatham house in london . according to martin beck from the german institute for middle east studies in hamburg , there are significant problems regarding european negotiation efforts . " there still is n't a common european position on the conflict , " beck said .
" european countries have to reach a consensus on this before further action is possible . " germany supporting diplomatic efforts german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said germany was continuing to pursue a diplomatic strategy to calm the situation in the middle east . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister steinmeier is speaking with israeli and arab representatives " the fact that we have n't been successful does n't mean that they are unnecessary , " steinmeier told german television zdf on tuesday .
" we are trying to do everything that is possible . " for the past few days , there have been talks with government representatives from the region to sound out possibilities and interests , he said .
these efforts were being coordinated with the european union . while there have been calls for germany to step in as a mediator in the conflict , it alone can not mediate , said andreas schockenhoff , foreign policy expert of the cdu / csu parliamentary group . " rather , the european union together with russia , the united states and the united nations can try as a quartet to get the conflict parties to the negotiating table , " schockenhoff said . the eu has abandoned its middle east policy beck said the eu should have done more to contribute to the stabilization of the region since hamas won the majority of seats in palestinian elections in january 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas has the majority of support in the palestinian territories " in the past months , europe and the eu did n't understand the need to react properly to the hamas victory , " beck said .
" of course , europe was surprised by the election results as much as everyone else .
but it then proceeded to take on the us and israeli position and give up its own .
there was no independent policy . " since the 1980s , the european union has developed a policy with the main objective of a two-state solution in the middle east . " but the eu forgot its own position and only placed pressure on hamas , but not on israel , " beck said .
" this sent israel the message that not only the united states , but now also the eu stands behind its actions . " washington has backed israel 's right to self-defense and refuses to endorse international calls for an immediate ceasefire between israel and hezbollah . regional support for a ceasefire is necessary " the eu has to find its own position and quickly , " beck said .
even then , though , would european mediation have any potential influence ? " the israelis in part would be reluctant to accept european involvement and less inclined to listen to the europeans , " said lowe .
" and they do n't need to because of their ties to the united states . " lowe said the europeans should play a larger role in mediating the conflict .

while some see the exhibition as an important part of coming to terms with the gdr , others feel that it plays down the brutality of a dictatorship . visiting berlin as a tourist a couple of years ago , peter kenzelmann wanted to explain east germany to his girlfriend .
the ethnologist and political scientist from freiburg in southwestern germany had been to east berlin years ago .
but his partner had not witnessed the atmosphere behind the iron curtain and so the couple searched for a museum that showcased the daily lives of ordinary east germans . " try amsterdam , " officials at berlin 's tourism bureau told them , adding that someone had set up such a museum in the netherlands . flabbergasted , kenzelmann decided to fill the void .
he hired a team of historians and museum managers , began asking people to donate everything east german and found a bank to finance the venture . " i did n't want to become dependent on subsidies - we are a business , " the 36-year-old said on monday , sitting outside his freshly opened ddr , or gdr museum , which is located in the basement of a brand-new hotel and entertainment complex in the heart of former east berlin . ha n ds-o n exhibit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once omnipresent on east german streets , now a museum piece : the trabant kenzelmann and his team want visitors to have a hands-on experience .
many of the exhibits , such as school bags , award medals or diaries , are hidden in drawers that have been built into room dividers that resemble east germany 's prefabricated apartment buildings , or platte n baute n . there 's a trabant car that people can pretend to drive .
in one corner , curators have rebuilt a typical east german living room and kitchen .
east german propaganda phrases - " learning from the soviet union means learning how to win " and " apple sauce always tastes good " among them - adorn the walls .
short texts in german and english describe the items in the various sections such as those on education , work , shopping , media , sports and vacation . " on their web site it says that they still need nudist photos , but maybe that 's an old posting , " heidrun loeper told ingrid fischer as the two women came across the large display on nudist culture , which was popular in the gdr . a differe n t perspective bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inside the museum loeper , a 64-year-old literary scholar , and fischer , a 72-year old former primary school teacher , kept smiling as they walked through the museum and recognized things they themselves had used years ago .
both said they enjoyed the exhibition as it helped to rectify the image of eastern germans . " we 've been put down as neandertalers and this shows that we lived like normal people , " fischer said , adding that many east germans were not that affected by the repressive aspects of the communist regime such as the gdr 's secret service , or stasi . joseph spadola , a 23-year-old philosophy student from new york city , agreed that the museum 's emphasis on the mundane was a good thing . " this is the part we never hear about , " he said .
" it 's fascinating to see a different way of life while keeping ideology out of the picture . " skeptical voices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : too cute ?
visitors check out the living room inside the mock apartment those working to remind people of the dictatorial nature of the east german regime felt differently .
gabriele camphausen , who is in charge of educational programs at the federal commission that administers files from the stasi secret police , said she was stunned when she visited the museum . " visitors can leave the exhibition with the impression that this was a slightly bizarre state in the 20th century , " she said .
" it does n't become clear that this was a brutal dictatorship ...
imagine if someone had done such a museum on daily life during the nazi era .
people would criticize it , and rightly so . " hubertus knabe , director of the memorial at the former stasi prison in berlin hohenschönhausen , added that the museum 's concept fell in line with recommendations by a government commission to concentrate less on places symbolizing repression in the gdr . " i 'm skeptical that depictions of everyday life can explain life in a dictatorship , " knabe said , adding that he had not been to the museum .
" it 's not important how people ate and slept when describing a political system . " a worthwhile experime n t ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a model of the berlin wall death strip is the first thing museum visitors see but the museum 's director , robert rückel , countered that the stasi 's infiltration was clearly documented . he pointed to a corner with a stasi work station where visitors can eavesdrop on conversations in another part of the exhibition .
rückel added that other museums in berlin already highlighted aspects such as the wall and stasi repression . " our goal is to focus on the daily lives of people , " he said .
" it 's an experiment . " and a good one at that , said thomas ahbe , a sociologist who has written extensively on east german culture and identity . " it compliments the picture , " he said , adding that so far only so-called museums on everday life that are run by laymen exist throughout east germany .
" the crimes that happened in east germany have been documented extensively , but the scientific research on daily life has fallen by the wayside , " he said .

the israeli army has said its offensive to defeat hezbollah could last several weeks .
yet time is running out for international diplomatic intervention .
what role could the european union play in the negotiation process ? the european union 's foreign policy chief javier solana said tuesday he was preparing to head back to the middle east following a weekend trip to lebanon amid the upsurge of violence there . beirut has hosted several leading european politicians in the past few days , including solana and french prime minister dominique de villepin . " in the middle east , you ignite a match and you do not know how the fire will end , " solana told the press after his visit with lebanese government leaders in beirut on sunday .
" that is why we have to stop it with acts of good will by everybody .
the eu is trying to do that . " yet these visits seem more a supportive pat on the back for lebanon than concrete efforts to arbitrate . " the europeans appear to be more immediately concerned with the conflict than the united states is , yet europe 's role to date has been ineffective , " said robert lowe from the international affairs think tank chatham house in london . according to martin beck from the german institute for middle east studies in hamburg , there are significant problems regarding european negotiation efforts . " there still is n't a common european position on the conflict , " beck said .
" european countries have to reach a consensus on this before further action is possible . " germany supporting diplomatic efforts german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said germany was continuing to pursue a diplomatic strategy to calm the situation in the middle east . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister steinmeier is speaking with israeli and arab representatives " the fact that we have n't been successful does n't mean that they are unnecessary , " steinmeier told german television zdf on tuesday .
" we are trying to do everything that is possible . " for the past few days , there have been talks with government representatives from the region to sound out possibilities and interests , he said .
these efforts were being coordinated with the european union . while there have been calls for germany to step in as a mediator in the conflict , it alone can not mediate , said andreas schockenhoff , foreign policy expert of the cdu / csu parliamentary group . " rather , the european union together with russia , the united states and the united nations can try as a quartet to get the conflict parties to the negotiating table , " schockenhoff said . the eu has abandoned its middle east policy beck said the eu should have done more to contribute to the stabilization of the region since hamas won the majority of seats in palestinian elections in january 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas has the majority of support in the palestinian territories " in the past months , europe and the eu did n't understand the need to react properly to the hamas victory , " beck said .
" of course , europe was surprised by the election results as much as everyone else .
but it then proceeded to take on the us and israeli position and give up its own .
there was no independent policy . " since the 1980s , the european union has developed a policy with the main objective of a two-state solution in the middle east . " but the eu forgot its own position and only placed pressure on hamas , but not on israel , " beck said .
" this sent israel the message that not only the united states , but now also the eu stands behind its actions . " washington has backed israel 's right to self-defense and refuses to endorse international calls for an immediate ceasefire between israel and hezbollah . regional support for a ceasefire is necessary " the eu has to find its own position and quickly , " beck said .
even then , though , would european mediation have any potential influence ? " the israelis in part would be reluctant to accept european involvement and less inclined to listen to the europeans , " said lowe .
" and they do n't need to because of their ties to the united states . " lowe said the europeans should play a larger role in mediating the conflict .
" it is to the europeans ' credit that they are even visiting the region , " lowe said .
american officials had talked about sending secretary of state condoleezza rice , but so far she has not gone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli air strikes have damaged much of lebanon 's infrastructure " maybe the united states thinks israel can solve this militarily , but europe could be firmer in pushing for talks , " lowe said . schockenhoff said all the important players , which have interests in this region , needed to be at the negotiating table . " otherwise , it wo n't succeed , " schockenhoff said .
" hezbollah 's actions have turned this into a supra-regional conflict .
its solution calls for a clear political stance from tehran and damascus . " lowe agreed that many parties needed to be involved .
" the hezbollah does not seem inclined to reduce the attacks .
only syria and iran could bring it into negotiations , " he said . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de by land and sea , europeans flee lebanon for their lives helicopters and warships , chartered ferries and passenger vessels have arrived in lebanon to pick up tens of thousands of people in one of the biggest mass evacuations since world war ii .

" the action plan provides a very good basis for our further work and cooperation , " finnish foreign minister erkki tuomioja told reporters after the plan was unveiled in brussels by serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica .
finland currently holds the eu presidency . " the plan needs to be developed further and the implemention of the action must begin immediately , " tuomioja added . economically hobbled by the wars that tore the former yugoslavia apart in the 1990s , serbia is desperate to keep alive its hopes of one day joining europe 's rich 25-member club . but the eu froze talks on closer ties with serbia in may , because of the failure of authorities to hand mladic , the former bosnian serb military chief , to the international criminal tribunal for former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- . serbia is hoping to agree a stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- with the eu - typically the first step for balkan states to join the bloc . eu wa n ts results while the eu is aware that the prospect of membership for serbia is a powerful force for stability in a volatile region , union officials have vowed that they should only resume when there are results , not just action plans . eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn , who has supervised the saa talks with belgrade , expressed satisfaction that the plan could lead to mladic 's arrest . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olli rehn " i am glad to see that the action plan contains an unequivocal commitment from the serbian government to arrest ratko mladic and other remaining indictees , " he told reporters .
" a plan can be a means to an end but action is more important than the plan because it realizes the results that matter . " the three-page plan includes a media campaign highlighting the mladic case , security and legal elements , ways to improve cooperation with icty , and evokes the need to amend some specific laws . mladic and the former bosnian serb political leader radovan karadic , who is also wanted for trial , have been on the run since the war in bosnia ended in 1995 .

" it 's a new orient , " assessed the paper , " everything has changed since the fall of saddam . "
in just the last few months , the world has witnessed " arafat 's death , israel 's withdrawal from the gaza strip , sharon 's retirement , the developments in iran , syria 's withdrawal from lebanon , growing rivalries between the shiites and sunnis , and the chaos in iraq . "
all that , and the us , which had once been the referee in the region , has sunk into the " quagmire of iraq .

a spokesman in jerusalem said liaison was under way with both the european union and the united states . " we are coordinating with the europeans and americans how to get foreign civilians out of lebanon , " he said .

british warships were preparing for the possible evacuation of up to 12,000 british nationals and 10,000 dual nationals , plus other commonwealth citizens . some 40 british nationals fled beirut by helicopter monday morning , taking advantage of the visit of eu foreign policy chief javier solana , british ambassador james watt told the bbc . france was also sending a naval vessel to help move out several thousands of its own nationals .
and a ferry chartered by the french government left beirut for cyprus late monday with some 1,250 evacuees : 800 french nationals , including 300 children , 400 from other european union member states , and 50 americans . canadian officials in ottawa said that three chartered ships were already on their way from cyprus to lebanon to help evacuate some of the nearly 50,000 canadian citizens trapped amid the heavy fighting . cyprus braci n g for te n s of thousa n ds of evacuees cypriot authorities estimated the various operations could bring about 6,000 evacuees to the island this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waiting for a bus to safety , these children join the exodus the first evacuees to arrive in cyprus recounted harrowing tales of the fighting as their italian vessel docked in the cypriot port of larnaca monday evening .
the ship held over 300 people , including 186 italians , 58 lebanese and 49 swedes , and one infant only a few days old , said an italian embassy official . the swedish ambassador to cyprus , ingemar lindhal , said stockholm was also chartering a 1,600-passenger greek vessel to ferry out evacuees to larnaca wednesday . he said priority would be given to the 5,000 swedish nationals registered with the embassy in beirut , some 750 of whom are believed already to have escaped overland through syria , and to other eu nationals . us begi n s evacuating n atio n als the united states , which has an estimated 25,000 passport holders in lebanon , flew 43 people out of lebanon monday on military helicopters , most of them children , elderly and sick people .

detlev mehlis , former un inspector , told deutsche welle that iran and syria are definitely playing a role . detlev mehlis , a senior public prosecutor in berlin is a former investigator with the united nations and closely involved in the probe after the assassination of lebanese prime minister rafiq hariri . very familiar with the dynamics and power politics of the region , mehlis is convinced that syria and iran are behind the recent outbreak of violence between israel and lebanon . while he says he has no proof , he insists that the current events would not be happening without explicit approval from syria , especially since the weapons being used by hezbollah in all likelihood came through syria . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : detlev mehlis in his former role as a un investigator " syria is on hezbollah 's side and vice versa , " he said .
" hezbollah would certainly not risk taking the kind of action it has without having syria 's approval . " mehlis thinks that syria , despite its withdrawal under international pressure from lebanon last year , has not given up its desire to bring the country under its control again . that became quite clear during the investigation into the hariri case , he says .
syrian secret agents tried to interfere in the investigation , the syrian justice department got involved and witness were intimidated .
according to him , syria 's attitude toward lebanon has not changed in the slightest . " syria refuses to this day to establish diplomatic relations ; it refuses to recognized a binding demarcation of common borders , " he said .
" for syria , lebanon is nowhere near being an autonomous country . " proxy war ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shiite muslim supporters of the hezbollah group but mehlis dismisses the speculation that hezbollah is conducting a proxy war for iran and syria as precisely that - speculation .
but he says that while such an analysis is premature , it is not a completely misguided conclusion , since syria has an interest in the destabilization of lebanon . formulating a strategy for preventing that very development , however , is difficult .
mehlis does think the idea of sending un troops into southern lebanon is an interesting one .
however , he thinks the peacekeepers ' effectiveness could be limited . the united nations interim force in lebanon -lrb- unifil -rrb- , created in 1978 to confirm israeli withdrawal from lebanon , has had limited success in preventing israel from marching into lebanon or in stopping hezbollah from firing on israel . " the influence of the international community is restricted , " he said .
" the us has a clear influence on israel , that is certain .
iran and syria have real influence over hezbollah .
but whether they can apply enough pressure to stop the assaults , i doubt .
i think it 's unfortunately going to take some time . " hezbollah 's firing of iranian rockets over the last few days with a range of up to 100 kilometers has taken the conflict to a new dimension .
it has cast doubt on security concepts that up to now have been based on the concept of " security zones . "
those might have been effective when the weapons were katyusha rockets with a range of under 20 kilometers .
but when hezbollah rockets can now threaten haifa and other israeli cities , the entire equation is changed . " still , buffer zones would help prevent incidents that have led to this escalation such as the kidnapping of israeli soldiers , " said mehlis . " but what can one do ?
the lesser of two evils is still better than conflicts like we 're seeing now .

the israeli army has said its offensive to defeat hezbollah could last several weeks .
yet time is running out for international diplomatic intervention .
what role could the european union play in the negotiation process ? the european union 's foreign policy chief javier solana said tuesday he was preparing to head back to the middle east following a weekend trip to lebanon amid the upsurge of violence there . beirut has hosted several leading european politicians in the past few days , including solana and french prime minister dominique de villepin . " in the middle east , you ignite a match and you do not know how the fire will end , " solana told the press after his visit with lebanese government leaders in beirut on sunday .
" that is why we have to stop it with acts of good will by everybody .
the eu is trying to do that . " yet these visits seem more a supportive pat on the back for lebanon than concrete efforts to arbitrate . " the europeans appear to be more immediately concerned with the conflict than the united states is , yet europe 's role to date has been ineffective , " said robert lowe from the international affairs think tank chatham house in london . according to martin beck from the german institute for middle east studies in hamburg , there are significant problems regarding european negotiation efforts . " there still is n't a common european position on the conflict , " beck said .

" we are trying to do everything that is possible . " for the past few days , there have been talks with government representatives from the region to sound out possibilities and interests , he said .
these efforts were being coordinated with the european union . while there have been calls for germany to step in as a mediator in the conflict , it alone can not mediate , said andreas schockenhoff , foreign policy expert of the cdu / csu parliamentary group . " rather , the european union together with russia , the united states and the united nations can try as a quartet to get the conflict parties to the negotiating table , " schockenhoff said . the eu has abandoned its middle east policy beck said the eu should have done more to contribute to the stabilization of the region since hamas won the majority of seats in palestinian elections in january 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas has the majority of support in the palestinian territories " in the past months , europe and the eu did n't understand the need to react properly to the hamas victory , " beck said .
" of course , europe was surprised by the election results as much as everyone else .
but it then proceeded to take on the us and israeli position and give up its own .
there was no independent policy . " since the 1980s , the european union has developed a policy with the main objective of a two-state solution in the middle east . " but the eu forgot its own position and only placed pressure on hamas , but not on israel , " beck said .
" this sent israel the message that not only the united states , but now also the eu stands behind its actions . " washington has backed israel 's right to self-defense and refuses to endorse international calls for an immediate ceasefire between israel and hezbollah . regional support for a ceasefire is necessary " the eu has to find its own position and quickly , " beck said .
even then , though , would european mediation have any potential influence ? " the israelis in part would be reluctant to accept european involvement and less inclined to listen to the europeans , " said lowe .
" and they do n't need to because of their ties to the united states . " lowe said the europeans should play a larger role in mediating the conflict .

the israeli army has said its offensive to defeat hezbollah could last several weeks .
yet time is running out for international diplomatic intervention .
what role could the european union play in the negotiation process ? the european union 's foreign policy chief javier solana said tuesday he was preparing to head back to the middle east following a weekend trip to lebanon amid the upsurge of violence there . beirut has hosted several leading european politicians in the past few days , including solana and french prime minister dominique de villepin . " in the middle east , you ignite a match and you do not know how the fire will end , " solana told the press after his visit with lebanese government leaders in beirut on sunday .
" that is why we have to stop it with acts of good will by everybody .
the eu is trying to do that . " yet these visits seem more a supportive pat on the back for lebanon than concrete efforts to arbitrate . " the europeans appear to be more immediately concerned with the conflict than the united states is , yet europe 's role to date has been ineffective , " said robert lowe from the international affairs think tank chatham house in london . according to martin beck from the german institute for middle east studies in hamburg , there are significant problems regarding european negotiation efforts . " there still is n't a common european position on the conflict , " beck said .
" european countries have to reach a consensus on this before further action is possible . " germany supporting diplomatic efforts german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said germany was continuing to pursue a diplomatic strategy to calm the situation in the middle east . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister steinmeier is speaking with israeli and arab representatives " the fact that we have n't been successful does n't mean that they are unnecessary , " steinmeier told german television zdf on tuesday .
" we are trying to do everything that is possible . " for the past few days , there have been talks with government representatives from the region to sound out possibilities and interests , he said .
these efforts were being coordinated with the european union . while there have been calls for germany to step in as a mediator in the conflict , it alone can not mediate , said andreas schockenhoff , foreign policy expert of the cdu / csu parliamentary group . " rather , the european union together with russia , the united states and the united nations can try as a quartet to get the conflict parties to the negotiating table , " schockenhoff said . the eu has abandoned its middle east policy beck said the eu should have done more to contribute to the stabilization of the region since hamas won the majority of seats in palestinian elections in january 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas has the majority of support in the palestinian territories " in the past months , europe and the eu did n't understand the need to react properly to the hamas victory , " beck said .
" of course , europe was surprised by the election results as much as everyone else .
but it then proceeded to take on the us and israeli position and give up its own .
there was no independent policy . " since the 1980s , the european union has developed a policy with the main objective of a two-state solution in the middle east . " but the eu forgot its own position and only placed pressure on hamas , but not on israel , " beck said .
" this sent israel the message that not only the united states , but now also the eu stands behind its actions . " washington has backed israel 's right to self-defense and refuses to endorse international calls for an immediate ceasefire between israel and hezbollah . regional support for a ceasefire is necessary " the eu has to find its own position and quickly , " beck said .
even then , though , would european mediation have any potential influence ? " the israelis in part would be reluctant to accept european involvement and less inclined to listen to the europeans , " said lowe .
" and they do n't need to because of their ties to the united states . " lowe said the europeans should play a larger role in mediating the conflict .
" it is to the europeans ' credit that they are even visiting the region , " lowe said .
american officials had talked about sending secretary of state condoleezza rice , but so far she has not gone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli air strikes have damaged much of lebanon 's infrastructure " maybe the united states thinks israel can solve this militarily , but europe could be firmer in pushing for talks , " lowe said . schockenhoff said all the important players , which have interests in this region , needed to be at the negotiating table . " otherwise , it wo n't succeed , " schockenhoff said .
" hezbollah 's actions have turned this into a supra-regional conflict .
its solution calls for a clear political stance from tehran and damascus . " lowe agreed that many parties needed to be involved .

he hired a team of historians and museum managers , began asking people to donate everything east german and found a bank to finance the venture . " i did n't want to become dependent on subsidies - we are a business , " the 36-year-old said on monday , sitting outside his freshly opened ddr , or gdr museum , which is located in the basement of a brand-new hotel and entertainment complex in the heart of former east berlin . ha n ds-o n exhibit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once omnipresent on east german streets , now a museum piece : the trabant kenzelmann and his team want visitors to have a hands-on experience .

while some see the exhibition as an important part of coming to terms with the gdr , others feel that it plays down the brutality of a dictatorship . visiting berlin as a tourist a couple of years ago , peter kenzelmann wanted to explain east germany to his girlfriend .
the ethnologist and political scientist from freiburg in southwestern germany had been to east berlin years ago .
but his partner had not witnessed the atmosphere behind the iron curtain and so the couple searched for a museum that showcased the daily lives of ordinary east germans . " try amsterdam , " officials at berlin 's tourism bureau told them , adding that someone had set up such a museum in the netherlands . flabbergasted , kenzelmann decided to fill the void .
he hired a team of historians and museum managers , began asking people to donate everything east german and found a bank to finance the venture . " i did n't want to become dependent on subsidies - we are a business , " the 36-year-old said on monday , sitting outside his freshly opened ddr , or gdr museum , which is located in the basement of a brand-new hotel and entertainment complex in the heart of former east berlin . ha n ds-o n exhibit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once omnipresent on east german streets , now a museum piece : the trabant kenzelmann and his team want visitors to have a hands-on experience .
many of the exhibits , such as school bags , award medals or diaries , are hidden in drawers that have been built into room dividers that resemble east germany 's prefabricated apartment buildings , or platte n baute n . there 's a trabant car that people can pretend to drive .
in one corner , curators have rebuilt a typical east german living room and kitchen .
east german propaganda phrases - " learning from the soviet union means learning how to win " and " apple sauce always tastes good " among them - adorn the walls .
short texts in german and english describe the items in the various sections such as those on education , work , shopping , media , sports and vacation . " on their web site it says that they still need nudist photos , but maybe that 's an old posting , " heidrun loeper told ingrid fischer as the two women came across the large display on nudist culture , which was popular in the gdr . a differe n t perspective bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inside the museum loeper , a 64-year-old literary scholar , and fischer , a 72-year old former primary school teacher , kept smiling as they walked through the museum and recognized things they themselves had used years ago .
both said they enjoyed the exhibition as it helped to rectify the image of eastern germans . " we 've been put down as neandertalers and this shows that we lived like normal people , " fischer said , adding that many east germans were not that affected by the repressive aspects of the communist regime such as the gdr 's secret service , or stasi . joseph spadola , a 23-year-old philosophy student from new york city , agreed that the museum 's emphasis on the mundane was a good thing . " this is the part we never hear about , " he said .
" it 's fascinating to see a different way of life while keeping ideology out of the picture . " skeptical voices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : too cute ?
visitors check out the living room inside the mock apartment those working to remind people of the dictatorial nature of the east german regime felt differently .
gabriele camphausen , who is in charge of educational programs at the federal commission that administers files from the stasi secret police , said she was stunned when she visited the museum . " visitors can leave the exhibition with the impression that this was a slightly bizarre state in the 20th century , " she said .
" it does n't become clear that this was a brutal dictatorship ...
imagine if someone had done such a museum on daily life during the nazi era .
people would criticize it , and rightly so . " hubertus knabe , director of the memorial at the former stasi prison in berlin hohenschönhausen , added that the museum 's concept fell in line with recommendations by a government commission to concentrate less on places symbolizing repression in the gdr . " i 'm skeptical that depictions of everyday life can explain life in a dictatorship , " knabe said , adding that he had not been to the museum .
" it 's not important how people ate and slept when describing a political system . " a worthwhile experime n t ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a model of the berlin wall death strip is the first thing museum visitors see but the museum 's director , robert rückel , countered that the stasi 's infiltration was clearly documented . he pointed to a corner with a stasi work station where visitors can eavesdrop on conversations in another part of the exhibition .
rückel added that other museums in berlin already highlighted aspects such as the wall and stasi repression . " our goal is to focus on the daily lives of people , " he said .

while some see the exhibition as an important part of coming to terms with the gdr , others feel that it plays down the brutality of a dictatorship . visiting berlin as a tourist a couple of years ago , peter kenzelmann wanted to explain east germany to his girlfriend .
the ethnologist and political scientist from freiburg in southwestern germany had been to east berlin years ago .
but his partner had not witnessed the atmosphere behind the iron curtain and so the couple searched for a museum that showcased the daily lives of ordinary east germans . " try amsterdam , " officials at berlin 's tourism bureau told them , adding that someone had set up such a museum in the netherlands . flabbergasted , kenzelmann decided to fill the void .
he hired a team of historians and museum managers , began asking people to donate everything east german and found a bank to finance the venture . " i did n't want to become dependent on subsidies - we are a business , " the 36-year-old said on monday , sitting outside his freshly opened ddr , or gdr museum , which is located in the basement of a brand-new hotel and entertainment complex in the heart of former east berlin . ha n ds-o n exhibit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once omnipresent on east german streets , now a museum piece : the trabant kenzelmann and his team want visitors to have a hands-on experience .
many of the exhibits , such as school bags , award medals or diaries , are hidden in drawers that have been built into room dividers that resemble east germany 's prefabricated apartment buildings , or platte n baute n . there 's a trabant car that people can pretend to drive .
in one corner , curators have rebuilt a typical east german living room and kitchen .
east german propaganda phrases - " learning from the soviet union means learning how to win " and " apple sauce always tastes good " among them - adorn the walls .
short texts in german and english describe the items in the various sections such as those on education , work , shopping , media , sports and vacation . " on their web site it says that they still need nudist photos , but maybe that 's an old posting , " heidrun loeper told ingrid fischer as the two women came across the large display on nudist culture , which was popular in the gdr . a differe n t perspective bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inside the museum loeper , a 64-year-old literary scholar , and fischer , a 72-year old former primary school teacher , kept smiling as they walked through the museum and recognized things they themselves had used years ago .
both said they enjoyed the exhibition as it helped to rectify the image of eastern germans . " we 've been put down as neandertalers and this shows that we lived like normal people , " fischer said , adding that many east germans were not that affected by the repressive aspects of the communist regime such as the gdr 's secret service , or stasi . joseph spadola , a 23-year-old philosophy student from new york city , agreed that the museum 's emphasis on the mundane was a good thing . " this is the part we never hear about , " he said .
" it 's fascinating to see a different way of life while keeping ideology out of the picture . " skeptical voices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : too cute ?
visitors check out the living room inside the mock apartment those working to remind people of the dictatorial nature of the east german regime felt differently .
gabriele camphausen , who is in charge of educational programs at the federal commission that administers files from the stasi secret police , said she was stunned when she visited the museum . " visitors can leave the exhibition with the impression that this was a slightly bizarre state in the 20th century , " she said .
" it does n't become clear that this was a brutal dictatorship ...
imagine if someone had done such a museum on daily life during the nazi era .
people would criticize it , and rightly so . " hubertus knabe , director of the memorial at the former stasi prison in berlin hohenschönhausen , added that the museum 's concept fell in line with recommendations by a government commission to concentrate less on places symbolizing repression in the gdr . " i 'm skeptical that depictions of everyday life can explain life in a dictatorship , " knabe said , adding that he had not been to the museum .
" it 's not important how people ate and slept when describing a political system . " a worthwhile experime n t ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a model of the berlin wall death strip is the first thing museum visitors see but the museum 's director , robert rückel , countered that the stasi 's infiltration was clearly documented . he pointed to a corner with a stasi work station where visitors can eavesdrop on conversations in another part of the exhibition .
rückel added that other museums in berlin already highlighted aspects such as the wall and stasi repression . " our goal is to focus on the daily lives of people , " he said .
" it 's an experiment . " and a good one at that , said thomas ahbe , a sociologist who has written extensively on east german culture and identity . " it compliments the picture , " he said , adding that so far only so-called museums on everday life that are run by laymen exist throughout east germany .
" the crimes that happened in east germany have been documented extensively , but the scientific research on daily life has fallen by the wayside , " he said .
" i think it will still take a long time before we can get to a balanced view of gdr history .

detlev mehlis , former un inspector , told deutsche welle that iran and syria are definitely playing a role . detlev mehlis , a senior public prosecutor in berlin is a former investigator with the united nations and closely involved in the probe after the assassination of lebanese prime minister rafiq hariri . very familiar with the dynamics and power politics of the region , mehlis is convinced that syria and iran are behind the recent outbreak of violence between israel and lebanon . while he says he has no proof , he insists that the current events would not be happening without explicit approval from syria , especially since the weapons being used by hezbollah in all likelihood came through syria . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : detlev mehlis in his former role as a un investigator " syria is on hezbollah 's side and vice versa , " he said .
" hezbollah would certainly not risk taking the kind of action it has without having syria 's approval . " mehlis thinks that syria , despite its withdrawal under international pressure from lebanon last year , has not given up its desire to bring the country under its control again . that became quite clear during the investigation into the hariri case , he says .
syrian secret agents tried to interfere in the investigation , the syrian justice department got involved and witness were intimidated .
according to him , syria 's attitude toward lebanon has not changed in the slightest . " syria refuses to this day to establish diplomatic relations ; it refuses to recognized a binding demarcation of common borders , " he said .
" for syria , lebanon is nowhere near being an autonomous country . " proxy war ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shiite muslim supporters of the hezbollah group but mehlis dismisses the speculation that hezbollah is conducting a proxy war for iran and syria as precisely that - speculation .
but he says that while such an analysis is premature , it is not a completely misguided conclusion , since syria has an interest in the destabilization of lebanon . formulating a strategy for preventing that very development , however , is difficult .
mehlis does think the idea of sending un troops into southern lebanon is an interesting one .
however , he thinks the peacekeepers ' effectiveness could be limited . the united nations interim force in lebanon -lrb- unifil -rrb- , created in 1978 to confirm israeli withdrawal from lebanon , has had limited success in preventing israel from marching into lebanon or in stopping hezbollah from firing on israel . " the influence of the international community is restricted , " he said .
" the us has a clear influence on israel , that is certain .
iran and syria have real influence over hezbollah .
but whether they can apply enough pressure to stop the assaults , i doubt .
i think it 's unfortunately going to take some time . " hezbollah 's firing of iranian rockets over the last few days with a range of up to 100 kilometers has taken the conflict to a new dimension .
it has cast doubt on security concepts that up to now have been based on the concept of " security zones . "
those might have been effective when the weapons were katyusha rockets with a range of under 20 kilometers .
but when hezbollah rockets can now threaten haifa and other israeli cities , the entire equation is changed . " still , buffer zones would help prevent incidents that have led to this escalation such as the kidnapping of israeli soldiers , " said mehlis . " but what can one do ?
the lesser of two evils is still better than conflicts like we 're seeing now .

" the action plan provides a very good basis for our further work and cooperation , " finnish foreign minister erkki tuomioja told reporters after the plan was unveiled in brussels by serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica .
finland currently holds the eu presidency . " the plan needs to be developed further and the implemention of the action must begin immediately , " tuomioja added . economically hobbled by the wars that tore the former yugoslavia apart in the 1990s , serbia is desperate to keep alive its hopes of one day joining europe 's rich 25-member club . but the eu froze talks on closer ties with serbia in may , because of the failure of authorities to hand mladic , the former bosnian serb military chief , to the international criminal tribunal for former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- . serbia is hoping to agree a stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- with the eu - typically the first step for balkan states to join the bloc . eu wa n ts results while the eu is aware that the prospect of membership for serbia is a powerful force for stability in a volatile region , union officials have vowed that they should only resume when there are results , not just action plans . eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn , who has supervised the saa talks with belgrade , expressed satisfaction that the plan could lead to mladic 's arrest . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olli rehn " i am glad to see that the action plan contains an unequivocal commitment from the serbian government to arrest ratko mladic and other remaining indictees , " he told reporters .
" a plan can be a means to an end but action is more important than the plan because it realizes the results that matter . " the three-page plan includes a media campaign highlighting the mladic case , security and legal elements , ways to improve cooperation with icty , and evokes the need to amend some specific laws . mladic and the former bosnian serb political leader radovan karadic , who is also wanted for trial , have been on the run since the war in bosnia ended in 1995 .
the fugitive general is being sought for genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity , notably for his role in the massacre of some 8,000 muslim boys and men in the eastern enclave of srebrenica in july that year .
mladic is believed to have been hiding in serbia , but belgrade has denied knowing of his whereabouts and claims that it has a strong political will to arrest him once it tracks him down . " we think this plan is something that will enable serbia to continue the negotiations -lrb- on the saa -rrb- , " said kostunica , who explained that his government would now prepare a " detailed operational plan . " some skepticism german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said he thought it could be " possible " for the talks to resume by the end of the year . however some in the european union are not convinced . asked before seeing the plan whether it could lead mladic 's capture , dutch foreign minister ben bot said : " we will see , they have said it so often .
i have been there on various occasions and each time they say in a week or in 14 days they will catch mladic .
i 'm still waiting . " dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de srebrenica mass trial opens in the hague the trial of seven top bosnian serb military officials opened in the hague on friday .
the men charged must answer for their role in the 1995 srebrenica massacre of nearly 8,000 muslims .
-lrb- july 14 , 2006 -rrb- eu suspends talks on closer ties with serbia the european commission announced wednesday that it had suspended talks on closer ties with serbia because belgrade has failed to fully cooperate with the united nations war crimes court .

a spokesman in jerusalem said liaison was under way with both the european union and the united states . " we are coordinating with the europeans and americans how to get foreign civilians out of lebanon , " he said .
" we are trying to organize the evacuation . " but denmark said it had received reports from its citizens of attacks by israeli forces on people traveling from southern lebanon to beirut to escape the worst of the bombing . avoiding the air blockade , an airbus carrying 320 germans who fled the israeli offensive landed in düsseldorf on tuesday after flying out of syria . the flight was chartered by the german foreign ministry , which is planning to organize several more in the coming days to repatriate german nationals who want to leave lebanon . a spokesman for the ministry said there were 10 children on tuesday 's flight .
the group traveled from beirut to damascus in buses and were made to wait eight hours at the syrian-lebanese border , he said . there were about 2,000 germans in lebanon when israel began bombarding the country last week , of whom 1,100 live there .
about 200 had left by sunday . biggest evacuatio n si n ce world war ii bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some lebanese citizens are also fleeing the country british foreign office minister kim howells told the british parliament that the royal navy could be faced with " the biggest evacuation since dunkerque , " when some 330,000 soldiers were evacuated by sea from france in 1940 .

he failed , says dw-world.de 's ingo mannteufel . russians have complained about the west 's negative view of their country for years .
this year 's g8 presidency was supposed to help bring russia around the international corner with the help of the kremlin 's long-planned public relations campaign .
it did n't hesitate to spend money on us pr consultancy ketchum as an advisor .

the israeli army has said its offensive to defeat hezbollah could last several weeks .
yet time is running out for international diplomatic intervention .
what role could the european union play in the negotiation process ? the european union 's foreign policy chief javier solana said tuesday he was preparing to head back to the middle east following a weekend trip to lebanon amid the upsurge of violence there . beirut has hosted several leading european politicians in the past few days , including solana and french prime minister dominique de villepin . " in the middle east , you ignite a match and you do not know how the fire will end , " solana told the press after his visit with lebanese government leaders in beirut on sunday .
" that is why we have to stop it with acts of good will by everybody .
the eu is trying to do that . " yet these visits seem more a supportive pat on the back for lebanon than concrete efforts to arbitrate . " the europeans appear to be more immediately concerned with the conflict than the united states is , yet europe 's role to date has been ineffective , " said robert lowe from the international affairs think tank chatham house in london . according to martin beck from the german institute for middle east studies in hamburg , there are significant problems regarding european negotiation efforts . " there still is n't a common european position on the conflict , " beck said .
" european countries have to reach a consensus on this before further action is possible . " germany supporting diplomatic efforts german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said germany was continuing to pursue a diplomatic strategy to calm the situation in the middle east . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister steinmeier is speaking with israeli and arab representatives " the fact that we have n't been successful does n't mean that they are unnecessary , " steinmeier told german television zdf on tuesday .
" we are trying to do everything that is possible . " for the past few days , there have been talks with government representatives from the region to sound out possibilities and interests , he said .
these efforts were being coordinated with the european union . while there have been calls for germany to step in as a mediator in the conflict , it alone can not mediate , said andreas schockenhoff , foreign policy expert of the cdu / csu parliamentary group . " rather , the european union together with russia , the united states and the united nations can try as a quartet to get the conflict parties to the negotiating table , " schockenhoff said . the eu has abandoned its middle east policy beck said the eu should have done more to contribute to the stabilization of the region since hamas won the majority of seats in palestinian elections in january 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas has the majority of support in the palestinian territories " in the past months , europe and the eu did n't understand the need to react properly to the hamas victory , " beck said .
" of course , europe was surprised by the election results as much as everyone else .
but it then proceeded to take on the us and israeli position and give up its own .
there was no independent policy . " since the 1980s , the european union has developed a policy with the main objective of a two-state solution in the middle east . " but the eu forgot its own position and only placed pressure on hamas , but not on israel , " beck said .
" this sent israel the message that not only the united states , but now also the eu stands behind its actions . " washington has backed israel 's right to self-defense and refuses to endorse international calls for an immediate ceasefire between israel and hezbollah . regional support for a ceasefire is necessary " the eu has to find its own position and quickly , " beck said .
even then , though , would european mediation have any potential influence ? " the israelis in part would be reluctant to accept european involvement and less inclined to listen to the europeans , " said lowe .
" and they do n't need to because of their ties to the united states . " lowe said the europeans should play a larger role in mediating the conflict .
" it is to the europeans ' credit that they are even visiting the region , " lowe said .
american officials had talked about sending secretary of state condoleezza rice , but so far she has not gone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli air strikes have damaged much of lebanon 's infrastructure " maybe the united states thinks israel can solve this militarily , but europe could be firmer in pushing for talks , " lowe said . schockenhoff said all the important players , which have interests in this region , needed to be at the negotiating table . " otherwise , it wo n't succeed , " schockenhoff said .
" hezbollah 's actions have turned this into a supra-regional conflict .
its solution calls for a clear political stance from tehran and damascus . " lowe agreed that many parties needed to be involved .
" the hezbollah does not seem inclined to reduce the attacks .
only syria and iran could bring it into negotiations , " he said . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de by land and sea , europeans flee lebanon for their lives helicopters and warships , chartered ferries and passenger vessels have arrived in lebanon to pick up tens of thousands of people in one of the biggest mass evacuations since world war ii .

detlev mehlis , former un inspector , told deutsche welle that iran and syria are definitely playing a role . detlev mehlis , a senior public prosecutor in berlin is a former investigator with the united nations and closely involved in the probe after the assassination of lebanese prime minister rafiq hariri . very familiar with the dynamics and power politics of the region , mehlis is convinced that syria and iran are behind the recent outbreak of violence between israel and lebanon . while he says he has no proof , he insists that the current events would not be happening without explicit approval from syria , especially since the weapons being used by hezbollah in all likelihood came through syria . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : detlev mehlis in his former role as a un investigator " syria is on hezbollah 's side and vice versa , " he said .
" hezbollah would certainly not risk taking the kind of action it has without having syria 's approval . " mehlis thinks that syria , despite its withdrawal under international pressure from lebanon last year , has not given up its desire to bring the country under its control again . that became quite clear during the investigation into the hariri case , he says .
syrian secret agents tried to interfere in the investigation , the syrian justice department got involved and witness were intimidated .
according to him , syria 's attitude toward lebanon has not changed in the slightest . " syria refuses to this day to establish diplomatic relations ; it refuses to recognized a binding demarcation of common borders , " he said .
" for syria , lebanon is nowhere near being an autonomous country . " proxy war ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shiite muslim supporters of the hezbollah group but mehlis dismisses the speculation that hezbollah is conducting a proxy war for iran and syria as precisely that - speculation .
but he says that while such an analysis is premature , it is not a completely misguided conclusion , since syria has an interest in the destabilization of lebanon . formulating a strategy for preventing that very development , however , is difficult .
mehlis does think the idea of sending un troops into southern lebanon is an interesting one .
however , he thinks the peacekeepers ' effectiveness could be limited . the united nations interim force in lebanon -lrb- unifil -rrb- , created in 1978 to confirm israeli withdrawal from lebanon , has had limited success in preventing israel from marching into lebanon or in stopping hezbollah from firing on israel . " the influence of the international community is restricted , " he said .
" the us has a clear influence on israel , that is certain .
iran and syria have real influence over hezbollah .
but whether they can apply enough pressure to stop the assaults , i doubt .
i think it 's unfortunately going to take some time . " hezbollah 's firing of iranian rockets over the last few days with a range of up to 100 kilometers has taken the conflict to a new dimension .
it has cast doubt on security concepts that up to now have been based on the concept of " security zones . "
those might have been effective when the weapons were katyusha rockets with a range of under 20 kilometers .
but when hezbollah rockets can now threaten haifa and other israeli cities , the entire equation is changed . " still , buffer zones would help prevent incidents that have led to this escalation such as the kidnapping of israeli soldiers , " said mehlis . " but what can one do ?
the lesser of two evils is still better than conflicts like we 're seeing now .

detlev mehlis , former un inspector , told deutsche welle that iran and syria are definitely playing a role . detlev mehlis , a senior public prosecutor in berlin is a former investigator with the united nations and closely involved in the probe after the assassination of lebanese prime minister rafiq hariri . very familiar with the dynamics and power politics of the region , mehlis is convinced that syria and iran are behind the recent outbreak of violence between israel and lebanon . while he says he has no proof , he insists that the current events would not be happening without explicit approval from syria , especially since the weapons being used by hezbollah in all likelihood came through syria . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : detlev mehlis in his former role as a un investigator " syria is on hezbollah 's side and vice versa , " he said .
" hezbollah would certainly not risk taking the kind of action it has without having syria 's approval . " mehlis thinks that syria , despite its withdrawal under international pressure from lebanon last year , has not given up its desire to bring the country under its control again . that became quite clear during the investigation into the hariri case , he says .
syrian secret agents tried to interfere in the investigation , the syrian justice department got involved and witness were intimidated .
according to him , syria 's attitude toward lebanon has not changed in the slightest . " syria refuses to this day to establish diplomatic relations ; it refuses to recognized a binding demarcation of common borders , " he said .
" for syria , lebanon is nowhere near being an autonomous country .

but he says that while such an analysis is premature , it is not a completely misguided conclusion , since syria has an interest in the destabilization of lebanon . formulating a strategy for preventing that very development , however , is difficult .
mehlis does think the idea of sending un troops into southern lebanon is an interesting one .
however , he thinks the peacekeepers ' effectiveness could be limited . the united nations interim force in lebanon -lrb- unifil -rrb- , created in 1978 to confirm israeli withdrawal from lebanon , has had limited success in preventing israel from marching into lebanon or in stopping hezbollah from firing on israel . " the influence of the international community is restricted , " he said .
" the us has a clear influence on israel , that is certain .
iran and syria have real influence over hezbollah .
but whether they can apply enough pressure to stop the assaults , i doubt .
i think it 's unfortunately going to take some time . " hezbollah 's firing of iranian rockets over the last few days with a range of up to 100 kilometers has taken the conflict to a new dimension .
it has cast doubt on security concepts that up to now have been based on the concept of " security zones . "
those might have been effective when the weapons were katyusha rockets with a range of under 20 kilometers .
but when hezbollah rockets can now threaten haifa and other israeli cities , the entire equation is changed . " still , buffer zones would help prevent incidents that have led to this escalation such as the kidnapping of israeli soldiers , " said mehlis . " but what can one do ?

while some see the exhibition as an important part of coming to terms with the gdr , others feel that it plays down the brutality of a dictatorship . visiting berlin as a tourist a couple of years ago , peter kenzelmann wanted to explain east germany to his girlfriend .
the ethnologist and political scientist from freiburg in southwestern germany had been to east berlin years ago .
but his partner had not witnessed the atmosphere behind the iron curtain and so the couple searched for a museum that showcased the daily lives of ordinary east germans . " try amsterdam , " officials at berlin 's tourism bureau told them , adding that someone had set up such a museum in the netherlands . flabbergasted , kenzelmann decided to fill the void .
he hired a team of historians and museum managers , began asking people to donate everything east german and found a bank to finance the venture . " i did n't want to become dependent on subsidies - we are a business , " the 36-year-old said on monday , sitting outside his freshly opened ddr , or gdr museum , which is located in the basement of a brand-new hotel and entertainment complex in the heart of former east berlin . ha n ds-o n exhibit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once omnipresent on east german streets , now a museum piece : the trabant kenzelmann and his team want visitors to have a hands-on experience .
many of the exhibits , such as school bags , award medals or diaries , are hidden in drawers that have been built into room dividers that resemble east germany 's prefabricated apartment buildings , or platte n baute n . there 's a trabant car that people can pretend to drive .
in one corner , curators have rebuilt a typical east german living room and kitchen .
east german propaganda phrases - " learning from the soviet union means learning how to win " and " apple sauce always tastes good " among them - adorn the walls .
short texts in german and english describe the items in the various sections such as those on education , work , shopping , media , sports and vacation . " on their web site it says that they still need nudist photos , but maybe that 's an old posting , " heidrun loeper told ingrid fischer as the two women came across the large display on nudist culture , which was popular in the gdr . a differe n t perspective bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inside the museum loeper , a 64-year-old literary scholar , and fischer , a 72-year old former primary school teacher , kept smiling as they walked through the museum and recognized things they themselves had used years ago .
both said they enjoyed the exhibition as it helped to rectify the image of eastern germans . " we 've been put down as neandertalers and this shows that we lived like normal people , " fischer said , adding that many east germans were not that affected by the repressive aspects of the communist regime such as the gdr 's secret service , or stasi . joseph spadola , a 23-year-old philosophy student from new york city , agreed that the museum 's emphasis on the mundane was a good thing . " this is the part we never hear about , " he said .
" it 's fascinating to see a different way of life while keeping ideology out of the picture . " skeptical voices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : too cute ?
visitors check out the living room inside the mock apartment those working to remind people of the dictatorial nature of the east german regime felt differently .
gabriele camphausen , who is in charge of educational programs at the federal commission that administers files from the stasi secret police , said she was stunned when she visited the museum . " visitors can leave the exhibition with the impression that this was a slightly bizarre state in the 20th century , " she said .
" it does n't become clear that this was a brutal dictatorship ...
imagine if someone had done such a museum on daily life during the nazi era .
people would criticize it , and rightly so . " hubertus knabe , director of the memorial at the former stasi prison in berlin hohenschönhausen , added that the museum 's concept fell in line with recommendations by a government commission to concentrate less on places symbolizing repression in the gdr . " i 'm skeptical that depictions of everyday life can explain life in a dictatorship , " knabe said , adding that he had not been to the museum .
" it 's not important how people ate and slept when describing a political system . " a worthwhile experime n t ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a model of the berlin wall death strip is the first thing museum visitors see but the museum 's director , robert rückel , countered that the stasi 's infiltration was clearly documented . he pointed to a corner with a stasi work station where visitors can eavesdrop on conversations in another part of the exhibition .
rückel added that other museums in berlin already highlighted aspects such as the wall and stasi repression . " our goal is to focus on the daily lives of people , " he said .
" it 's an experiment . " and a good one at that , said thomas ahbe , a sociologist who has written extensively on east german culture and identity . " it compliments the picture , " he said , adding that so far only so-called museums on everday life that are run by laymen exist throughout east germany .
" the crimes that happened in east germany have been documented extensively , but the scientific research on daily life has fallen by the wayside , " he said .
" i think it will still take a long time before we can get to a balanced view of gdr history .

while some see the exhibition as an important part of coming to terms with the gdr , others feel that it plays down the brutality of a dictatorship . visiting berlin as a tourist a couple of years ago , peter kenzelmann wanted to explain east germany to his girlfriend .
the ethnologist and political scientist from freiburg in southwestern germany had been to east berlin years ago .
but his partner had not witnessed the atmosphere behind the iron curtain and so the couple searched for a museum that showcased the daily lives of ordinary east germans . " try amsterdam , " officials at berlin 's tourism bureau told them , adding that someone had set up such a museum in the netherlands . flabbergasted , kenzelmann decided to fill the void .
he hired a team of historians and museum managers , began asking people to donate everything east german and found a bank to finance the venture . " i did n't want to become dependent on subsidies - we are a business , " the 36-year-old said on monday , sitting outside his freshly opened ddr , or gdr museum , which is located in the basement of a brand-new hotel and entertainment complex in the heart of former east berlin . ha n ds-o n exhibit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once omnipresent on east german streets , now a museum piece : the trabant kenzelmann and his team want visitors to have a hands-on experience .
many of the exhibits , such as school bags , award medals or diaries , are hidden in drawers that have been built into room dividers that resemble east germany 's prefabricated apartment buildings , or platte n baute n . there 's a trabant car that people can pretend to drive .
in one corner , curators have rebuilt a typical east german living room and kitchen .
east german propaganda phrases - " learning from the soviet union means learning how to win " and " apple sauce always tastes good " among them - adorn the walls .
short texts in german and english describe the items in the various sections such as those on education , work , shopping , media , sports and vacation . " on their web site it says that they still need nudist photos , but maybe that 's an old posting , " heidrun loeper told ingrid fischer as the two women came across the large display on nudist culture , which was popular in the gdr . a differe n t perspective bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inside the museum loeper , a 64-year-old literary scholar , and fischer , a 72-year old former primary school teacher , kept smiling as they walked through the museum and recognized things they themselves had used years ago .
both said they enjoyed the exhibition as it helped to rectify the image of eastern germans . " we 've been put down as neandertalers and this shows that we lived like normal people , " fischer said , adding that many east germans were not that affected by the repressive aspects of the communist regime such as the gdr 's secret service , or stasi . joseph spadola , a 23-year-old philosophy student from new york city , agreed that the museum 's emphasis on the mundane was a good thing . " this is the part we never hear about , " he said .
" it 's fascinating to see a different way of life while keeping ideology out of the picture . " skeptical voices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : too cute ?
visitors check out the living room inside the mock apartment those working to remind people of the dictatorial nature of the east german regime felt differently .
gabriele camphausen , who is in charge of educational programs at the federal commission that administers files from the stasi secret police , said she was stunned when she visited the museum . " visitors can leave the exhibition with the impression that this was a slightly bizarre state in the 20th century , " she said .
" it does n't become clear that this was a brutal dictatorship ...
imagine if someone had done such a museum on daily life during the nazi era .
people would criticize it , and rightly so . " hubertus knabe , director of the memorial at the former stasi prison in berlin hohenschönhausen , added that the museum 's concept fell in line with recommendations by a government commission to concentrate less on places symbolizing repression in the gdr . " i 'm skeptical that depictions of everyday life can explain life in a dictatorship , " knabe said , adding that he had not been to the museum .
" it 's not important how people ate and slept when describing a political system . " a worthwhile experime n t ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a model of the berlin wall death strip is the first thing museum visitors see but the museum 's director , robert rückel , countered that the stasi 's infiltration was clearly documented . he pointed to a corner with a stasi work station where visitors can eavesdrop on conversations in another part of the exhibition .
rückel added that other museums in berlin already highlighted aspects such as the wall and stasi repression . " our goal is to focus on the daily lives of people , " he said .
" it 's an experiment . " and a good one at that , said thomas ahbe , a sociologist who has written extensively on east german culture and identity . " it compliments the picture , " he said , adding that so far only so-called museums on everday life that are run by laymen exist throughout east germany .
" the crimes that happened in east germany have been documented extensively , but the scientific research on daily life has fallen by the wayside , " he said .
" i think it will still take a long time before we can get to a balanced view of gdr history .

the rights group said there has been little progress since june 2005 , when it called on the authorities to act .
up to 70 % of murders of women are not investigated and no arrests are made in 97 % of cases , amnesty says .
it adds that some officials recognise how serious the problem is , but many still tend to blame the victims .
amnesty 's latest report cites police figures which show that 229 women and girls were killed in guatemala in the first six months of 2006 .
guatemala femicide 229 women killed so far in 2006 665 women and girls killed in 2005 between 2002 and 2005 , murders of women rose 63 % , of men 45 % source : amnesty report : " no protection , no justice " many of the murders were exceptionally brutal , with the victims suffering sexual violence , mutilation and dismemberment .
amnesty says that it knows of only two convictions out of 665 murders of women in 2005 .
training among the cases highlighted in the report is that of cristina hernandez , who was forced into a car outside her home on 27 july 2005 .
her father tried in vain to give chase and then went to a police to report the abduction and to ask the officers to set up roadblocks .
her father said the officers refused , arguing that girls often ran off with boyfriends and that they could not begin a search for 24 hours .
claudina velazquez 's family say her killer knew he was unlikely to be caught cristina 's body was found the next morning .
she had been shot four times and bitten all over her body .
her family , afraid for their safety , went into hiding .
her killers are still at large .
amnesty says that in many cases , there is a failure to carry out even basic investigations , process the crime scene and preserve potential evidence .
heavy case loads , lack of equipment and the shortage of police investigators mean that few cases are pursued vigorously .
amnesty is calling on the guatemalan authorities to improve the quality of criminal investigations , including providing more training for investigators .
it also says there should be more efforts to guarantee the safety of witnesses and family members , and to follow up reported abductions of women and girls .

bbc news -pipe- africa -pipe- poets hail nelson mandela 's life home news sport radio tv weather languages low graphics -pipe- accessibility help one-minute world news news services your news when you want it news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk business health science & environment technology entertainment also in the news - video and audio - programmes have your say in pictures country profiles special reports related bbc sites sport weather on this day editors ' blog languages somali french arabic swahili great lakes hausa portuguese africa more last updated : tuesday , 18 july 2006 , 06:36 gmt 07:36 uk e-mail this to a friend printable version poets hail nelson mandela 's life by shen liknaitzky bbc a book of poetry celebrating the life of nelson mandela has been launched to mark the south african statesman 's 88th birthday on tuesday .
enlarge image the book , titled halala madiba -lrb- hail mandela -rrb- , is more than an anthology about one man .
it is also the story - through poems from around the world - of south africa 's freedom struggle .
the poets include former statesmen , reggae and rap artists , performance poets , and even a 12-year-old child .
it follows the trajectory of mandela from freedom fighter to " grand old man " .
it was the long years of incarceration on robben island , beginning in 1963 , which inspired the first poems .
click here to read your poems about nelson mandela one of the earliest is " and i watch it in mandela " by south african john matshikiza , written in 1974 .
it is not for the safety of silence that this man has opened his arms to lead .
the strength of his words hangs in the air as the strength in his eyes remains on the sky ; and the years of impatient waiting draw on while this man burns to clear the smoke in the air .
there is fire here , which no prison can kill in this man ; and i watch it in mandela .
this poem was written during the darkest days , but it is full of fire - and a sense of what was to come was borne out when mandela was , eventually released .
like everyone else , john matshikiza remembers that day : " i was in london , i was with my mother and my daughter and my partner and we were all just bowled over by what was happening .
" we 'd been waiting all of our lives for this .
that is all i can say .
it was the whole of my life . "
freedom that same day in february 1990 was evoked by poet chris mann in his poem " tamed " , published in 1992 : you come out onto the dais , distant as a god , a totem , raise your arms and we roar with an adoration like a rage .
as well as spanning more than 30 years , the poems come from everywhere in the world - most of course from south africa , as well as many from elsewhere on the continent .
armindo vaz d 'almeida , a former prime minister of sao tome and principe , wrote " poem to the southern wind " in 1987 .
this is an extract of a translation from the original portuguese : and the steps of men keep going patiently counting the stones of the road long road on which you encapsulating the spirit of insurgency like a light of inspiring brilliance you rise against the pale destiny imposed on your mutilated flag .
critical but perhaps surprisingly , the collection also includes poems that are critical of a man seen by many as a hero .
" there is also one really interesting poem which is written by an apartheid - one could call him - apparatchik , someone who worked within the apartheid state , " says richard bartlett , the editor of the collection .
" he wrote a poem saying that mandela got what he deserved and that if he had n't been thrown in prison south africa would n't be as free a country as it is now and this was written in the mid 1970s , so that is one of the poems that is not just praising mandela . "
gerrit fourie 's poem " rivonia " , written in afrikaans in 1976 , translates as follows : let them be remembered , and what they wanted to do : let the fear and the blood and violence , death hatred , vengeance , vandalism and looting , anguish , pain , agony , noise and racket and rape , let this , the rejection of order , discipline , civilisation , love of humanity , let this , i say , never in all eternity as long as there are those who can think , ever be forgotten or denied .
but the majority of the poems are conducting an intimate conversation with mandela himself - from the endless years when he was in prison to the moment of release and beyond .
published in 2004 , jekwu ikeme 's " when mandela goes " imagines life after a man who has dominated south african history for more than half a century .
when you go chosen soldier in the crusade of dreams our tears shall not cloud your journey home .
when you go madiba your nobility shall be our lasting inheritance this land you so love shall continue to love we shall trail the long and majestic walk your gallant walk shall be our cross and shepherd .

enlarge image the book , titled halala madiba -lrb- hail mandela -rrb- , is more than an anthology about one man .
it is also the story - through poems from around the world - of south africa 's freedom struggle .
the poets include former statesmen , reggae and rap artists , performance poets , and even a 12-year-old child .
it follows the trajectory of mandela from freedom fighter to " grand old man " .
it was the long years of incarceration on robben island , beginning in 1963 , which inspired the first poems .
click here to read your poems about nelson mandela one of the earliest is " and i watch it in mandela " by south african john matshikiza , written in 1974 .
it is not for the safety of silence that this man has opened his arms to lead .
the strength of his words hangs in the air as the strength in his eyes remains on the sky ; and the years of impatient waiting draw on while this man burns to clear the smoke in the air .
there is fire here , which no prison can kill in this man ; and i watch it in mandela .
this poem was written during the darkest days , but it is full of fire - and a sense of what was to come was borne out when mandela was , eventually released .
like everyone else , john matshikiza remembers that day : " i was in london , i was with my mother and my daughter and my partner and we were all just bowled over by what was happening .
" we 'd been waiting all of our lives for this .
that is all i can say .
it was the whole of my life . "
freedom that same day in february 1990 was evoked by poet chris mann in his poem " tamed " , published in 1992 : you come out onto the dais , distant as a god , a totem , raise your arms and we roar with an adoration like a rage .
as well as spanning more than 30 years , the poems come from everywhere in the world - most of course from south africa , as well as many from elsewhere on the continent .
armindo vaz d 'almeida , a former prime minister of sao tome and principe , wrote " poem to the southern wind " in 1987 .
this is an extract of a translation from the original portuguese : and the steps of men keep going patiently counting the stones of the road long road on which you encapsulating the spirit of insurgency like a light of inspiring brilliance you rise against the pale destiny imposed on your mutilated flag .
critical but perhaps surprisingly , the collection also includes poems that are critical of a man seen by many as a hero .
" there is also one really interesting poem which is written by an apartheid - one could call him - apparatchik , someone who worked within the apartheid state , " says richard bartlett , the editor of the collection .
" he wrote a poem saying that mandela got what he deserved and that if he had n't been thrown in prison south africa would n't be as free a country as it is now and this was written in the mid 1970s , so that is one of the poems that is not just praising mandela . "
gerrit fourie 's poem " rivonia " , written in afrikaans in 1976 , translates as follows : let them be remembered , and what they wanted to do : let the fear and the blood and violence , death hatred , vengeance , vandalism and looting , anguish , pain , agony , noise and racket and rape , let this , the rejection of order , discipline , civilisation , love of humanity , let this , i say , never in all eternity as long as there are those who can think , ever be forgotten or denied .
but the majority of the poems are conducting an intimate conversation with mandela himself - from the endless years when he was in prison to the moment of release and beyond .
published in 2004 , jekwu ikeme 's " when mandela goes " imagines life after a man who has dominated south african history for more than half a century .
when you go chosen soldier in the crusade of dreams our tears shall not cloud your journey home .
when you go madiba your nobility shall be our lasting inheritance this land you so love shall continue to love we shall trail the long and majestic walk your gallant walk shall be our cross and shepherd .

published in 2004 , jekwu ikeme 's " when mandela goes " imagines life after a man who has dominated south african history for more than half a century .
when you go chosen soldier in the crusade of dreams our tears shall not cloud your journey home .
when you go madiba your nobility shall be our lasting inheritance this land you so love shall continue to love we shall trail the long and majestic walk your gallant walk shall be our cross and shepherd .

the public accounts committee 's report said performance had been " overstated " against the target for medals won at major international championships .
it also said performance information should only report " accurate figures " .
the report , released on tuesday , said uk sport had included 83 medals won in events not taken into account in setting future olympic targets .
the report also called for clearer goals , better assessment of progress and more accurate performance reporting .
" while great britain 's position in the athens olympic and paralympic medal tables was broadly on target , many funded sports did not meet their individual medal targets and 10 sports won no medals at all , " it said . "
the conclusions show that the government was not completely transparent over the medal target for 2012 and that it fiddled the figures in previous games by including extra sports " shadow sports minister hugh robertson " to the extent that value for money can be measured in terms of medal success , uk sport should look to achieve a better return from its expenditure in future . "
the committee 's report also urges organisations representing the different sports to set performance targets for the london games in 2012 and calls on uk sport to monitor the athletes it supports more closely .
uk sport is a public body which allocates funding to governing bodies of sport and individual athletes .
the public accounts committee -lrb- pac -rrb- report examined the use of lottery money by uk sport to support elite athletes competing in athens in 2004 and turin 2006 and the plans for the olympics in beijing in 2008 and london in 2012 .
the pac also reported that uk sport 's funding submission for 2012 referred to a goal of finishing fourth in the 2012 olympics , although the published funding agreement between the department for culture , media and sport -lrb- dcms -rrb- and uk sport said the goal was finishing fifth .
' damning indictment ' " yet , when recalled by the committee , the department and uk sport maintained there was no target and attributed the confusion to their inappropriate use of the term ' target ' , " the committee said .
the government has announced it will have a £ 600m package in the run-up to the 2012 olympics .
this includes £ 300m from the national lottery , £ 200m from government and £ 100m to be raised from commercial sponsorship .
the conservatives demanded an urgent statement from the government following the report , with the shadow sports minister hugh robertson calling it " a damning indictment " of the way the dcms had conducted its business . "
we recognise the need for clear transparency and accountability in our own actions and with the sports and athletes we fund " uk sport chief executive john steele " the conclusions show that the government was not completely transparent over the medal target for 2012 and that it fiddled the figures in previous games by including extra sports , " he said .
" this smacks of dishonesty , which is entirely unacceptable from both the government and a public body like uk sport .
" these are extremely serious conclusions and the secretary of state needs not just to brush these away but to make an urgent statement to the house . "
a dcms spokeswoman said : " we welcome the pac report and recognise that a majority of these recommendations are already being implemented by uk sport . "
john steele , chief executive of uk sport , said : " as the lead agency for elite sport in the lead-up to 2012 , we recognise the need for clear transparency and accountability in our own actions and with the sports and athletes we fund .

the public accounts committee -lrb- pac -rrb- report examined the use of lottery money by uk sport to support elite athletes competing in athens in 2004 and turin 2006 and the plans for the olympics in beijing in 2008 and london in 2012 .
the pac also reported that uk sport 's funding submission for 2012 referred to a goal of finishing fourth in the 2012 olympics , although the published funding agreement between the department for culture , media and sport -lrb- dcms -rrb- and uk sport said the goal was finishing fifth .
' damning indictment ' " yet , when recalled by the committee , the department and uk sport maintained there was no target and attributed the confusion to their inappropriate use of the term ' target ' , " the committee said .
the government has announced it will have a £ 600m package in the run-up to the 2012 olympics .
this includes £ 300m from the national lottery , £ 200m from government and £ 100m to be raised from commercial sponsorship .
the conservatives demanded an urgent statement from the government following the report , with the shadow sports minister hugh robertson calling it " a damning indictment " of the way the dcms had conducted its business .
we recognise the need for clear transparency and accountability in our own actions and with the sports and athletes we fund uk sport chief executive john steele " the conclusions show that the government was not completely transparent over the medal target for 2012 and that it fiddled the figures in previous games by including extra sports , " he said .
" this smacks of dishonesty , which is entirely unacceptable from both the government and a public body like uk sport .
" these are extremely serious conclusions and the secretary of state needs not just to brush these away but to make an urgent statement to the house . "
a dcms spokeswoman said : " we welcome the pac report and recognise that a majority of these recommendations are already being implemented by uk sport . "
john steele , chief executive of uk sport , said : " as the lead agency for elite sport in the lead-up to 2012 , we recognise the need for clear transparency and accountability in our own actions and with the sports and athletes we fund .
" we therefore welcome the majority of the recommendations made by the pac and have already acted on them in relation to our own reporting and assessment of progress by the governing bodies . "

uk newcomer alex pettyfer has the lead role in stormbreaker , which pits the young spy against an evil businessman .
pettyfer , who won the lead role ahead of more than 500 rivals , stars alongside ewan mcgregor , mickey rourke , bill nighy and alicia silverstone .
huge crowds greeted the stars at the event in leicester square .
the british film goes on release in the uk on friday .
pettyfer said he was not worried about the prospects of becoming so famous at a young age .
he said : " if you have a crowd like that and you were getting a buzz from it then it does n't matter . "
the 16-year-old arrived at the premiere wearing a leather jacket with a union jack on the back .
' wise head ' co-star mcgregor was full of praise for his young colleague , saying he had " a very wise head on his shoulders " .
the scottish actor said he had had " a great time " making the film , which was shot entirely in the uk and on the isle of man .
" it is very important we make films like this , " he told reporters .
" we are not known for our action films . "
stormbreaker is based on the first of six alex rider novels , which have sold more than 10 million copies worldwide .
it follows the boy 's discovery that his late uncle was a spy , and that he has prepared alex for espionage by training him in scuba diving , mountaineering , marksmanship and martial arts .
he is then recruited by the special operations division of mi6 , and armed with an array of gadgets .
horowitz adapted the book himself and the film is directed by geoffrey sax , who made 2005 sci-fi drama white noise .

huge crowds greeted the stars at the event in leicester square .
the british film goes on release in the uk on friday .
pettyfer said he was not worried about the prospects of becoming so famous at a young age .
he said : " if you have a crowd like that and you were getting a buzz from it then it does n't matter . "
the 16-year-old arrived at the premiere wearing a leather jacket with a union jack on the back .
' wise head ' co-star mcgregor was full of praise for his young colleague , saying he had " a very wise head on his shoulders " .
the scottish actor said he had had " a great time " making the film , which was shot entirely in the uk and on the isle of man .
bill nighy and alicia silverstone were also in attendance " it is very important we make films like this , " he told reporters .
" we are not known for our action films . "
stormbreaker is based on the first of six alex rider novels , which have sold more than 10 million copies worldwide .
it follows the boy 's discovery that his late uncle was a spy , and that he has prepared alex for espionage by training him in scuba diving , mountaineering , marksmanship and martial arts .
he is then recruited by the special operations division of mi6 , and armed with an array of gadgets .
horowitz adapted the book himself and the film is directed by geoffrey sax , who made 2005 sci-fi drama white noise .

the most important uk motoring event moved from birmingham after more and more manufacturers failed to turn up to display their cars .
uk marques jaguar , land rover , bentley and rolls-royce all launch significant models , while bmw marks its return with a super-fast m6 convertible .
but several leading carmakers will stay away , including ferrari , porsche , fiat , volkswagen and audi .
world and uk premieres the main showstopper will be jaguar 's 420bhp supercharged gt , which will be vying for attention with the uk premieres of the rolls-royce 101ex concept car and bentley 's continental gtc convertible .
and there are also some world premieres , including land rover 's tough new freelander , vauxhall 's new corsa , and bmw 's m6 cabriolet , which might even give the topless bentley a run for its money .
other global debuts include the convertible sportscar mazda mx-5 - though this time with a retractable roof rather than a canvas top - the seat leon cupra and the new honda civic type s and type r.
" for the first time since 1998 , we have significant world debuts at the british show , " according to the chief executive of the society of motor manufacturers and traders -lrb- smmt -rrb- , christopher macgowan .
" that helps bring global chief executives to the uk , which in turn boosts the show 's profile in the media and industry . "
convincing car makers to show off their cars in britain before they take them to shows elsewhere has always been seen as vital to maintain interest in the uk show .
in recent years , britain has been losing out to much larger shows in geneva , paris and frankfurt .
however , this year promises to be different .

uk marques jaguar , land rover , bentley and rolls-royce all launch significant models , while bmw marks its return with a super-fast m6 convertible .
but several leading carmakers will stay away , including ferrari , porsche , fiat , volkswagen and audi .
world and uk premieres the main showstopper will be jaguar 's 420bhp supercharged gt , which will be vying for attention with the uk premieres of the rolls-royce 101ex concept car and bentley 's continental gtc convertible .
some colourful surprises start the london motor show in pictures and there are also some world premieres , including land rover 's tough new freelander , vauxhall 's new corsa , and bmw 's m6 cabriolet , which might even give the topless bentley a run for its money .
other global debuts include the convertible sportscar mazda mx-5 - though this time with a retractable roof rather than a canvas top - the seat leon cupra and the new honda civic type s and type r.
" for the first time since 1998 , we have significant world debuts at the british show , " according to the chief executive of the society of motor manufacturers and traders -lrb- smmt -rrb- , christopher macgowan .
" that helps bring global chief executives to the uk , which in turn boosts the show 's profile in the media and industry . "
convincing car makers to show off their cars in britain before they take them to shows elsewhere has always been seen as vital to maintain interest in the uk show .
in recent years , britain has been losing out to much larger shows in geneva , paris and frankfurt .
however , this year promises to be different .

john macfarlane , chief executive of sonos , said neither consumers nor the technology itself were ready .
sonos makes wireless -lrb- wi-fi -rrb- music streaming systems , aimed at customers who want to listen to their digital music around the house .
apple and microsoft are among many firms betting on the digital home .
apple manufactures a device , called the airport express , which plugs into a hi-fi system and lets users broadcast or " stream " their music from a pc or mac via a wireless network . "
i am a big believer that in six to eight years you will see lots of these devices on store shelves .
it 's going to be a large market " john mcfarlane , sonos similarly pc and mac users can stream music to an xbox 360 and to a number of other products from companies such as philips , slim devices , roku and belkin .
" the digital home has been talked about for a long time but it 's only just starting to happen , " said mr macfarlane .
" there needs to be enough digital content and the understanding of the technology before the work can get started .
mp3 players " it 's not the mainstream that will know about this yet . "
millions of people now have mp3 players and music tracks downloaded onto computers .
vote do you stream music wirelessly around your house ?
yes no results are indicative and may not reflect public opinion many technology firms believe customers will want to listen to their music on a home hi-fi and around the house .
as television download services are growing in popularity in the us , observers predict that people will also want to watch video on any tv in the house .
" it will happen in the next 10 to 20 years not in the next two , " said mr macfarlane .
" video takes up too much bandwidth to be delivered over current wireless networks .
" the next wi-fi standard is not ready for the mass market yet . "
he added : " tv works .
streaming video does not work successfully right now . "
stream video owners of an xbox 360 and a pc running windows media center edition can stream video from the pc to the games console and mr macfarlane predicted that apple would be launching a video streaming product in the near future .
but there are many obstacles to overcome before it became " mass market " , he warned .
wireless for sound two wi-fi music systems put to the test one of the biggest is the need for a home network to take advantage of music or video streaming .
about one in six homes have a home network in north america , according to a recent report from forrester research .
the report 's author , charles s. golvin , said : " most networks simply enable basic pc activities like broadband , file and printer sharing .
" the shift to the entertainment-centric network remains well into the future . "
according to forrester , only one in five people who have a home network actually use it to listen to music .
and of people who do not have a home network , one in six said it was because they did not understand what one was .
a recent report commissioned by cable firm ntl telewest predicted that wireless networks would be in the majority of homes by 2010 .
mr golvin said manufacturers needed to explain the benefits of home networks to customers and retailers needed to give more space on shelves to networking devices .
mr macfarlane said : " i am a big believer that in six to eight years you will see lots of these devices on store shelves .

the report 's author , charles s. golvin , said : " most networks simply enable basic pc activities like broadband , file and printer sharing .
" the shift to the entertainment-centric network remains well into the future . "
according to forrester , only one in five people who have a home network actually use it to listen to music .
and of people who do not have a home network , one in six said it was because they did not understand what one was .
a recent report commissioned by cable firm ntl telewest predicted that wireless networks would be in the majority of homes by 2010 .
mr golvin said manufacturers needed to explain the benefits of home networks to customers and retailers needed to give more space on shelves to networking devices .
mr macfarlane said : " i am a big believer that in six to eight years you will see lots of these devices on store shelves .
it 's going to be a large market . "
