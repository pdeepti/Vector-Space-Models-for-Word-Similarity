now that the world cup opening extravaganza in berlin has been given the boot , politicians are clambering for some kind of replacement show .
but fifa is n't interested . the announcement by the world soccer governing body fifa that the planned opening extravaganza by star director andre heller would not take place struck like a bolt of lightning on a sunny day in berlin .
the city 's mayor , klaus wowereit , scrambled quickly after being knocked down by the fifa blow . he said he would try to persuade fifa to allow an alternative show at the brandenburg gate , a location better known for its new year 's celebrations , the love parade and naturally the emotional scenes of the reunification in 1989 .
it seems less than the ideal spot for soccer fans to gather in the direct run-up to the world cup , far away from the olympic stadium , where the world cup final will take place . but now fifa very much wants to distance itself from any kind of opening ceremony . " the gala will not be replaced , " said the soccer body 's director of communications markus siegler . fifa incurring germany 's wrath bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andre heller -lrb- r -rrb- said fifa 's cancellation of his extravaganza would not come " cheap " the matter is leaving a bitter taste in public officials ' mouths . " this is embarrassing and is not a good start , " dieter wiefelspütz , the social democratic domestic policy spokesman , told hanover 's neue presse newspaper . not only has the extravaganza been ignominiously wiped off the schedule of world cup events , germany 's image itself could even be tarnished , according to wiefelspütz .
the organizers of the month-long tournament , led by former soccer star franz beckenbauer , are hoping for a world cup that would make all others pale in comparison .
yet months before the first german goal is scored , the spd politician said that grave mistakes have already been made . why not move it to munich ? while some berlin officials seethe , others have floated the idea of moving the gala to munich , where the opening match will be played on june 9 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the brandenburg gate was the venue for wild parties like the now-defunct love parade ernst hinsken , the chair of the parliamentary tourism committee and also from bavaria , said that munich has the facilities to do it . " the old olympic stadium would be the right place for the gala , " he told the passauer neue presse newspaper .
" the concept would have to be watered down a little bit -lrb- for munich -rrb- but then it would work . " the idea is not without its merits .
thousands of fans would be spared having to make the trek from berlin to munich said hinsken .
most importantly , hinsken believes , the financial and image loss must be held to a minimum . the call has so far fallen on deaf ears in zurich , where fifa 's headquarters are located .
fifa 's siegler said that there is no chance that the gala will be held elsewhere . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup gala gets the ax the star-studded gala which was to open the 2006 world cup in berlin has been cancelled due to concerns over damage to the olympic stadium 's pitch .

brian pickering talked to senator dan coats , the former us ambassador to germany , about german chancellor angela merkel 's talks with us president george w. bush . during her first visit to the united states since becoming german chancellor , angela merkel held talks with president george w. bush on friday on a wide range of issues .
the two leaders differed on guantanamo bay but vowed to seek a common approach on iran as they opened a new chapter in us-german relations .
president bush 's relationship with merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder , was often stormy because of schröder 's opposition to the us-led invasion of iraq . deutsche welle : senator coats , do you have the impression that germany and the united states countries have made progress in overcoming their differences and moving closer together again ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former us ambassador to germany daniel r. coats dan coats : very much so , this clearly was an indication by both chancellor merkel and the president that they want to open a new chapter in our relationship .
it 's going to be a return to a much more harmonious and united effort to deal with some of the major challenges and i think to respect each others differences in terms of some of the areas where we might not have total agreement .
but it 's clear that the president and chancellor merkel established a very good start . how would you describe the personal chemistry between the two ?
did they hit it off ? i think they clearly hit it off .
i think there is personal chemistry there .
the president referenced it when he said he was touched by the chancellor 's discussion about her upbringing in east germany and her appreciation for freedom from someone coming from a place where that freedom was not available .
i was at a dinner with chancellor merkel where she talked about this also .
i think the most important point that was made and had an impact on those who attended the dinner was that understanding that she had lived in isolation in east germany and of course the incredible rise to become the first woman chancellor of germany .
i think that 's something the president very much appreciated and he clearly wants to establish a working relationship and a good personal relationship with the new chancellor . ms. merkel is still prepared to criticize the united states and only last weekend she raised a few eyebrows in germany by saying that the guantanamo prison camp should not continued to operate indefinitely .
what was the president 's reaction to that criticism ? well , i think his reaction was the appropriate reaction .
that was that one he hopes for understanding in terms of the terrorist threat that exists and the implications of that for a free society .
so i think we 're going to see a president who is responsive to criticism because particularly he knows it is well-meant criticism .
it is criticism of a friend and ally as opposed to someone that may be using for political purposes or simply to gain political favor at home by making negative comments about the united states . at the moment it 's iran and not iraq that 's the focus of world attention .
germany is one of the three eu countries that have called for iran to be referred to the un security council over its decision to resume its nuclear program .
is there broad agreement between the united states and the eu on what action should be taken against iran ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations security council there clearly is broad agreement that has been obtained over the last couple of years as the eu has attempted to use diplomacy and negotiations to seek a favorable resolution to this .
clearly there is now agreement that this should be taken to the un security council and should move to the next step .
now what specific action the security council takes is something that has to be discussed and negotiated .
sanctions , if they are imposed , what kind of support we can get from other nations like china , india and russia to form a united front .
i think all of these still have to be decided .
but we 've taken a very important step forward in saying our best efforts , the eu-3 's best efforts over the past year and a half have not met with success and it is time to up the pressure on iran to take a much more sensible course of action . are ordinary americans taking an interest in ms. merkel 's visit to the us ? yes , they are .
ordinary americans are , i think , grateful and relieved , that the situation has changed , that we have a president now who is saying warm things about this new chancellor and has a willingness not only to reach out and work with the chancellor but to reach out and work with the german people in trying to address these international problems that affect both of us . dw-radio 's brian pickering interviewed dan coats send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush and merkel hail new chapter in us-german relations german chancellor angela merkel emerged from talks with president george w. bush in washington friday to say that us-german relations were back on track and that they shared common ground on many issues , including iran .

i think that 's something the president very much appreciated and he clearly wants to establish a working relationship and a good personal relationship with the new chancellor . ms. merkel is still prepared to criticize the united states and only last weekend she raised a few eyebrows in germany by saying that the guantanamo prison camp should not continued to operate indefinitely .
what was the president 's reaction to that criticism ? well , i think his reaction was the appropriate reaction .
that was that one he hopes for understanding in terms of the terrorist threat that exists and the implications of that for a free society .
so i think we 're going to see a president who is responsive to criticism because particularly he knows it is well-meant criticism .
it is criticism of a friend and ally as opposed to someone that may be using for political purposes or simply to gain political favor at home by making negative comments about the united states . at the moment it 's iran and not iraq that 's the focus of world attention .
germany is one of the three eu countries that have called for iran to be referred to the un security council over its decision to resume its nuclear program .
is there broad agreement between the united states and the eu on what action should be taken against iran ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations security council there clearly is broad agreement that has been obtained over the last couple of years as the eu has attempted to use diplomacy and negotiations to seek a favorable resolution to this .
clearly there is now agreement that this should be taken to the un security council and should move to the next step .
now what specific action the security council takes is something that has to be discussed and negotiated .
sanctions , if they are imposed , what kind of support we can get from other nations like china , india and russia to form a united front .
i think all of these still have to be decided .
but we 've taken a very important step forward in saying our best efforts , the eu-3 's best efforts over the past year and a half have not met with success and it is time to up the pressure on iran to take a much more sensible course of action . are ordinary americans taking an interest in ms. merkel 's visit to the us ? yes , they are .
ordinary americans are , i think , grateful and relieved , that the situation has changed , that we have a president now who is saying warm things about this new chancellor and has a willingness not only to reach out and work with the chancellor but to reach out and work with the german people in trying to address these international problems that affect both of us . dw-radio 's brian pickering interviewed dan coats send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush and merkel hail new chapter in us-german relations german chancellor angela merkel emerged from talks with president george w. bush in washington friday to say that us-german relations were back on track and that they shared common ground on many issues , including iran .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 14.01.2006 iran digs in over nuclear crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president ahmadinejad is refusing to budge despite possible un security council action iran dug in over its disputed nuclear program saturday , saying it would not reverse a decision to conduct sensitive atomic research work even if referred to the un security council .
germany has warned against sanctions . president mahmoud ahmadinejad was due to give a press conference - only his second since his shock election win last june - with the controversial hardliner expected to repeat his defiant stance . he has already vowed not to compromise " one iota " on his country 's nuclear program , especially efforts to master the fuel cycle . quoted by the official news agency irna , national security spokesman hossein entezami said iran was still open to negotiations with the european union - but said it was not ready to discuss research activities at the centre of the current stand-off . " the subject of the negotiations with the europeans is uniquely -lrb- full-scale -rrb- uranium enrichment , and the matter of nuclear research is not a part of that , " he said .
" the decision by iran to carry out research activities is serious . " small-scale enrichment now iran resumed research this week , with the work involving small scale enrichment to test centrifuges .
it insists this is separate from full-scale uranium enrichment , which remains frozen for the time being . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bushehr nuclear power plant in south iran iran says its nuclear program is only directed towards generating electricity and is entirely legal , although the enrichment process can be extended to make atomic bombs . the three main eu powers - britain , france and germany - have for more than two years been trying to convince iran to voluntarily limit its nuclear activities in exchange for trade and other incentives . but iran has consistently refused striking any such deal , and since ahmadinejad 's election win has been progressively been backing away from a temporary freeze on fuel cycle work agreed to in 2003 and again in 2004 . talks next week eu , us , chinese and russian officials are due to hold talks in london on monday , when they are expected to set a date for an emergency meeting of the international atomic energy agency 's 35-nation board of governors . both the eu and the us are now pushing for iran to be referred to the un security council , hoping to back up a series of iaea calls - so far ignored - for tehran to return to a full nuclear freeze . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush at a joint press conference with german chancellor angela merkel " it 's logical that a country which has rejected diplomatic " efforts to end the crisis " be sent to the united nations security council , " us president george w. bush said at a joint press conference with visiting german chancellor angela merkel in washington on friday . if iran obtained nuclear weapons , it would pose " a grave threat to the security of the world , " bush said , recalling how ahmadinejad had called last year for israel to be " wiped off the map . " germany warns against sanctions but so far the west has played down any talk of immediate sanctions or even military action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gernot erler germany 's deputy foreign minister gernot erler told german radio in an interview to be broadcast on sunday that imposing economic sanctions against iran would be a " very dangerous path . " he said he favored imposing travel restrictions on iranian politicians , since they would have " an extraordinarily unpleasant impact . " iran has warned that a referral to the security council would bring serious consequences from its side . " all voluntary means of cooperation " with the iaea would end , foreign minister manouchehr mottaki warned friday . this could entail an end to tougher un inspections of iranian nuclear sites or even result in a resumption of full-scale uranium enrichment . the mounting crisis is affecting the world energy markets : oil futures closed marginally lower friday in line with falls for natural gas , but traders said anxiety remained about the nuclear crisis surrounding iran . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran threatens to halt nuclear cooperation iran threatened on friday to stop cooperating with the un atomic watchdog , including possibly resuming uranium enrichment , if its controversial nuclear program is referred to the un security council .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : mozart year 2006 - the 250th birthday of a musical genius celebrating a quarter-millennium of mozart mozart and modern art mark the new year american director creates new space for mozart mozart : a pop icon with staying power culture & lifestyle -pipe- 14.01.2006 on the trail of mozart : augsburg großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : augsburg remembers the famous offspring of a native son two cities are especially important to the celebration of mozart 's 250 anniversary , salzburg and vienna .
but there is a city in germany closely connected to his life - augsburg . he was born in salzburg , austria ; he died in vienna .
but in between , the composer spent time in the hometown of his father leopold , in the bavarian city of augsburg . when leopold mozart recognized the musical talent of his children , wolfgang amadeus and anna maria , known as nannerl , he took them on a european tour , visiting courts and academies in order to present their abilities . on their first trip , they visited munich , vienna , frankfurt and augsburg . and it is in augsburg , where the relationship between father and son will be especially highlighted during the mozart year 2006 .
for two weeks in may , the city will feature works from the pair performed as they would have been during their lifetimes . mozart 's mentor and manager leopold mozart was born in augsburg on nov .
14 , 1719 .
while a talented musician and composer in his own right , he is most well known there today for the fact he was both determined manager and mentor to his exceptionally talented son . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mozart 's great-grandfather lived here for mozart year , the city has spruced up sites connected to the mozart family .
one is the house that leopold mozart was born in at 30 frauentorstrasse . " the rooms are arranged thematically , " said one city official .
" one features a biography ; one illustrates the travels of the family .
above , there is a small multi-media room which has a slide show . " in the walled quarter of city known as the " fuggerei , " there is a stone tablet commemorating the musician 's great-grandfather , franz mozart , who lived for 12 years in what is the world 's oldest public housing project for the poor .
he got into financial trouble and as a result , had a right to live in this quarter established by rich bankers in 1516 . the head of the city 's tourist agency , regina thieme , says the neighborhood retains its atmosphere and its function to this day . " it was seen as a moral duty then , when one was rich , to do good works , " she said .
" and even today , tenants pay a yearly rent of 88 cents . " renaissance gem augsburg , after munich and nürnberg , is bavaria 's third largest city and one of the oldest in germany .

now that the world cup opening extravaganza in berlin has been given the boot , politicians are clambering for some kind of replacement show .
but fifa is n't interested . the announcement by the world soccer governing body fifa that the planned opening extravaganza by star director andre heller would not take place struck like a bolt of lightning on a sunny day in berlin .
the city 's mayor , klaus wowereit , scrambled quickly after being knocked down by the fifa blow . he said he would try to persuade fifa to allow an alternative show at the brandenburg gate , a location better known for its new year 's celebrations , the love parade and naturally the emotional scenes of the reunification in 1989 .
it seems less than the ideal spot for soccer fans to gather in the direct run-up to the world cup , far away from the olympic stadium , where the world cup final will take place . but now fifa very much wants to distance itself from any kind of opening ceremony . " the gala will not be replaced , " said the soccer body 's director of communications markus siegler . fifa incurring germany 's wrath bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andre heller -lrb- r -rrb- said fifa 's cancellation of his extravaganza would not come " cheap " the matter is leaving a bitter taste in public officials ' mouths . " this is embarrassing and is not a good start , " dieter wiefelspütz , the social democratic domestic policy spokesman , told hanover 's neue presse newspaper . not only has the extravaganza been ignominiously wiped off the schedule of world cup events , germany 's image itself could even be tarnished , according to wiefelspütz .
the organizers of the month-long tournament , led by former soccer star franz beckenbauer , are hoping for a world cup that would make all others pale in comparison .
yet months before the first german goal is scored , the spd politician said that grave mistakes have already been made . why not move it to munich ? while some berlin officials seethe , others have floated the idea of moving the gala to munich , where the opening match will be played on june 9 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the brandenburg gate was the venue for wild parties like the now-defunct love parade ernst hinsken , the chair of the parliamentary tourism committee and also from bavaria , said that munich has the facilities to do it . " the old olympic stadium would be the right place for the gala , " he told the passauer neue presse newspaper .
" the concept would have to be watered down a little bit -lrb- for munich -rrb- but then it would work . " the idea is not without its merits .
thousands of fans would be spared having to make the trek from berlin to munich said hinsken .
most importantly , hinsken believes , the financial and image loss must be held to a minimum . the call has so far fallen on deaf ears in zurich , where fifa 's headquarters are located .
fifa 's siegler said that there is no chance that the gala will be held elsewhere . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup gala gets the ax the star-studded gala which was to open the 2006 world cup in berlin has been cancelled due to concerns over damage to the olympic stadium 's pitch .

but there is a city in germany closely connected to his life - augsburg . he was born in salzburg , austria ; he died in vienna .
but in between , the composer spent time in the hometown of his father leopold , in the bavarian city of augsburg . when leopold mozart recognized the musical talent of his children , wolfgang amadeus and anna maria , known as nannerl , he took them on a european tour , visiting courts and academies in order to present their abilities . on their first trip , they visited munich , vienna , frankfurt and augsburg . and it is in augsburg , where the relationship between father and son will be especially highlighted during the mozart year 2006 .
for two weeks in may , the city will feature works from the pair performed as they would have been during their lifetimes . mozart 's mentor and manager leopold mozart was born in augsburg on nov .
14 , 1719 .
while a talented musician and composer in his own right , he is most well known there today for the fact he was both determined manager and mentor to his exceptionally talented son . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mozart 's great-grandfather lived here for mozart year , the city has spruced up sites connected to the mozart family .
one is the house that leopold mozart was born in at 30 frauentorstrasse . " the rooms are arranged thematically , " said one city official .
" one features a biography ; one illustrates the travels of the family .
above , there is a small multi-media room which has a slide show . " in the walled quarter of city known as the " fuggerei , " there is a stone tablet commemorating the musician 's great-grandfather , franz mozart , who lived for 12 years in what is the world 's oldest public housing project for the poor .
he got into financial trouble and as a result , had a right to live in this quarter established by rich bankers in 1516 . the head of the city 's tourist agency , regina thieme , says the neighborhood retains its atmosphere and its function to this day . " it was seen as a moral duty then , when one was rich , to do good works , " she said .
" and even today , tenants pay a yearly rent of 88 cents . " renaissance gem augsburg , after munich and nürnberg , is bavaria 's third largest city and one of the oldest in germany .

the eu constitution is a massive project that took years to put together - and itself failed to lift off when french and dutch voters said " no " to it last year .
the question remains whether it can survive in some form or not . austria , which took over the eu presidency on january 1 pledged to work on reviving the constitution and vienna announced soon after that it would check with the other 24 eu nations by june on how to orchestrate this . bot pronounces constitution dead for the netherlands bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch minister of foreign affairs bernard bot read the last rites over the constitution .

" jo leinen , the chairman of the constitutional affairs committee in the european parliament , and the german member of the european parliament , shares austria 's desire for the constitution to be kept alive , but warned against renegotiating the text . " i can ’ t see what 's new that needs to be discussed .
we discussed the constitution for four years .
those who want to open a pandora 's box will get a weaker rather than a better constitution , " leinen said . like german chancellor angela merkel , leinen recommends that the entire constitution be preserved but made more attractive with an added charter on the " social dimension of europe . " leinen sees the eu door shutting if constitution dies this method was successful in saving the maastricht treaty which appeared to be facing almost certain defeat in the 1990 's . nothing is likely to happen before 2007 when the dutch and french both hold elections and get possible changes in leadership which may promote a " yes " vote in new referendums .
leinen says if the constitution does n't go through , no more seats will be made available in the european parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jo leinen sees no more new members if the eu constitution fails .
" rumania and bulgaria … well , they 've been decided on and they will be the last to get in based on the treaty of nice .

i think we have a lever here to create some sort of breakthrough , " leinen added . chirac 's " cherry picking " idea could cause further divisions french president jacques chirac suggested that the best parts of the constitution be " cherry-picked . "
that idea , as well as one that countries in favor of the constitution team up and move forward with it , has been overwhelmingly rejected , according to hans-gert pöttering , member of the christian social democrats and leader of the european parliament ’ s largest conservative faction .

even as germany 's federal intelligence agency denies reports its spies in baghdad helped the us in selecting bombing targets there , jürgen trittin of the opposition green party told dw-world the fog has to be cleared . dw-world : mr trittin do you think it was and is right that the german federal intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- works in iraq ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin , former environment minister and prominent green party member jürgen trittin : it is right that in a situation that leads to such a war , the bnd does n't let the german government - it does n't matter which one - rely alone on information supplied by only one combatant or the other .
that 's why it was also right that members of the secret intelligence agency remained there .
as we know , they were housed in the french embassy - the embassy of a country that displayed a stance similar to germany 's on the iraq war . what do you have to say about the alleged fact that bnd spies did n't just work in iraq , but also supplied information to us troops that helped them to select their bombing targets ? so far there 's only one source for that claim and that 's a member of the american military intelligence community .
the bnd has issued a statement saying that 's not the case .
it seems like a parliamentary enquiry will have to clear up this contradiction .
we are all interested in shedding light on this matter because we ca n't accept that , if it is proved , authorities or even individual members - it does n't matter with whose knowledge - thwarted the political stance of the federal republic of germany on the iraq war by turning into one of the war parties themselves .
i 'm not going to volunteer to weigh the credibility of the different intelligence services against each other .
we have had our experiences with intelligence agencies of the us in the run-up to the iraq war . can you imagine that your own green party , also the party of the former foreign minister joschka fischer , was n't informed about such procedures ? the then-foreign minister -lrb- fischer -rrb- had clearly explained that he was aware that bnd spies stayed in iraq .
that 's right and gets the wholehearted support of the greens .
fischer also made it clear that he was n't aware of activities that the spies had allowed themselves to be dragged into the war .
so , the former foreign minister is also naturally very much in favor of leaving no stone unturned in clearing up the issue . if it turns out that the bnd did work together with the us in iraq , would that be seen as a breaking of the " green " promise to keep germany out of the iraq war ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany refused to be part of the us-led invasion of iraq if that is the case , the bnd would have acted disloyally , not towards a party , but towards the german government which has represented a clear-cut position , nationally as well as internationally , that we consider the war , for one , to be wrong and secondly , that we do n't want to be part of it .
but , as i said , these are speculations and we first want to have facts on the table . there are allegations that the bnd does its own thing because even the parliamentary control commission is n't informed about all its activities .
what do you say to that ? this too has to be examined within the framework of the parliamentary investigation .
what is also true - and also been pointed out by the head of the parliamentary control commission in the past weeks - is that the rights of the board have to be strengthened when it comes to getting access to files and even publishing improper conduct .
that 's apparent even today . the opposition liberal free democrats and the left party are demanding the setting up an investigation committee in parliament .
how do the greens see the move ? the party 's parliamentary leadership has already recommended such an investigation because we do n't see any other way to clear up the matter . the interview was conducted by martin schrader -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the americans want to make clear germany is n't innocent " german intelligence agency expert erich schmidt-eenboom offers his take on the allegations that german secret agents were involved in assessing targets during the us military invasion in iraq .

i 'm not going to volunteer to weigh the credibility of the different intelligence services against each other .
we have had our experiences with intelligence agencies of the us in the run-up to the iraq war . can you imagine that your own green party , also the party of the former foreign minister joschka fischer , was n't informed about such procedures ? the then-foreign minister -lrb- fischer -rrb- had clearly explained that he was aware that bnd spies stayed in iraq .
that 's right and gets the wholehearted support of the greens .
fischer also made it clear that he was n't aware of activities that the spies had allowed themselves to be dragged into the war .
so , the former foreign minister is also naturally very much in favor of leaving no stone unturned in clearing up the issue . if it turns out that the bnd did work together with the us in iraq , would that be seen as a breaking of the " green " promise to keep germany out of the iraq war ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany refused to be part of the us-led invasion of iraq if that is the case , the bnd would have acted disloyally , not towards a party , but towards the german government which has represented a clear-cut position , nationally as well as internationally , that we consider the war , for one , to be wrong and secondly , that we do n't want to be part of it .
but , as i said , these are speculations and we first want to have facts on the table . there are allegations that the bnd does its own thing because even the parliamentary control commission is n't informed about all its activities .
what do you say to that ? this too has to be examined within the framework of the parliamentary investigation .
what is also true - and also been pointed out by the head of the parliamentary control commission in the past weeks - is that the rights of the board have to be strengthened when it comes to getting access to files and even publishing improper conduct .
that 's apparent even today . the opposition liberal free democrats and the left party are demanding the setting up an investigation committee in parliament .
how do the greens see the move ? the party 's parliamentary leadership has already recommended such an investigation because we do n't see any other way to clear up the matter . the interview was conducted by martin schrader -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the americans want to make clear germany is n't innocent " german intelligence agency expert erich schmidt-eenboom offers his take on the allegations that german secret agents were involved in assessing targets during the us military invasion in iraq .

but there is a city in germany closely connected to his life - augsburg . he was born in salzburg , austria ; he died in vienna .
but in between , the composer spent time in the hometown of his father leopold , in the bavarian city of augsburg . when leopold mozart recognized the musical talent of his children , wolfgang amadeus and anna maria , known as nannerl , he took them on a european tour , visiting courts and academies in order to present their abilities . on their first trip , they visited munich , vienna , frankfurt and augsburg . and it is in augsburg , where the relationship between father and son will be especially highlighted during the mozart year 2006 .
for two weeks in may , the city will feature works from the pair performed as they would have been during their lifetimes . mozart 's mentor and manager leopold mozart was born in augsburg on nov .
14 , 1719 .
while a talented musician and composer in his own right , he is most well known there today for the fact he was both determined manager and mentor to his exceptionally talented son . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mozart 's great-grandfather lived here for mozart year , the city has spruced up sites connected to the mozart family .
one is the house that leopold mozart was born in at 30 frauentorstrasse . " the rooms are arranged thematically , " said one city official .
" one features a biography ; one illustrates the travels of the family .
above , there is a small multi-media room which has a slide show . " in the walled quarter of city known as the " fuggerei , " there is a stone tablet commemorating the musician 's great-grandfather , franz mozart , who lived for 12 years in what is the world 's oldest public housing project for the poor .
he got into financial trouble and as a result , had a right to live in this quarter established by rich bankers in 1516 . the head of the city 's tourist agency , regina thieme , says the neighborhood retains its atmosphere and its function to this day . " it was seen as a moral duty then , when one was rich , to do good works , " she said .
" and even today , tenants pay a yearly rent of 88 cents . " renaissance gem augsburg , after munich and nürnberg , is bavaria 's third largest city and one of the oldest in germany .
full of roman ruins , it was an international city during the renaissance period and the evidence thereof is plentiful , particularly in the splendid facades of the merchant houses on maximilianstrasse , in the fountain of adriaen de vries and in the sumptuous town hall built by renaissance master elias holl . the famous golden hall is an authentic example of a venue of the time of mozart .
a rococo gem is the schaezler palace with its marvellous staircase , a two-story ballroom with precious wood panelling and venetian chandeliers and mirrors .
it was here that leopold mozart , in 1763 , introduced his two children to augsburg society . thomas weitzel , who heads the culture office of the city , said there are links to leopold mozart everywhere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the town hall is a testament to augsburg rich past " leopold himself want to school here in augsburg , worked as a musician and singer at the jesuiten theater , " he said .
" if we look to the left , we will see the tauf church , where leopold mozart was baptized .
a little further down jesuitengasse , wolfgang amadeus mozart 's cousin " bäsle " lived , his first love affair that has been preserved in letters . " in 1951 , the german mozart society was founded in the city .
the organization mainly researches mozart 's life and work .
they have 17 regional associations around germany and independent members around the world . " we have about 3,000 members , a considerable number of whom are outside germany , " said hansjörg franzius , vice president of the institution .
" they includes universities , associations , libraries and other organizations from almost everywhere around the globe , except china or south africa .
but we hope to welcome them soon , too .

now that the world cup opening extravaganza in berlin has been given the boot , politicians are clambering for some kind of replacement show .

the city 's mayor , klaus wowereit , scrambled quickly after being knocked down by the fifa blow . he said he would try to persuade fifa to allow an alternative show at the brandenburg gate , a location better known for its new year 's celebrations , the love parade and naturally the emotional scenes of the reunification in 1989 .
it seems less than the ideal spot for soccer fans to gather in the direct run-up to the world cup , far away from the olympic stadium , where the world cup final will take place . but now fifa very much wants to distance itself from any kind of opening ceremony . " the gala will not be replaced , " said the soccer body 's director of communications markus siegler . fifa incurring germany 's wrath bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andre heller -lrb- r -rrb- said fifa 's cancellation of his extravaganza would not come " cheap " the matter is leaving a bitter taste in public officials ' mouths .

the organizers of the month-long tournament , led by former soccer star franz beckenbauer , are hoping for a world cup that would make all others pale in comparison .

even as germany 's federal intelligence agency denies reports its spies in baghdad helped the us in selecting bombing targets there , jürgen trittin of the opposition green party told dw-world the fog has to be cleared . dw-world : mr trittin do you think it was and is right that the german federal intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- works in iraq ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin , former environment minister and prominent green party member jürgen trittin : it is right that in a situation that leads to such a war , the bnd does n't let the german government - it does n't matter which one - rely alone on information supplied by only one combatant or the other .
that 's why it was also right that members of the secret intelligence agency remained there .
as we know , they were housed in the french embassy - the embassy of a country that displayed a stance similar to germany 's on the iraq war . what do you have to say about the alleged fact that bnd spies did n't just work in iraq , but also supplied information to us troops that helped them to select their bombing targets ? so far there 's only one source for that claim and that 's a member of the american military intelligence community .
the bnd has issued a statement saying that 's not the case .
it seems like a parliamentary enquiry will have to clear up this contradiction .
we are all interested in shedding light on this matter because we ca n't accept that , if it is proved , authorities or even individual members - it does n't matter with whose knowledge - thwarted the political stance of the federal republic of germany on the iraq war by turning into one of the war parties themselves .
i 'm not going to volunteer to weigh the credibility of the different intelligence services against each other .
we have had our experiences with intelligence agencies of the us in the run-up to the iraq war . can you imagine that your own green party , also the party of the former foreign minister joschka fischer , was n't informed about such procedures ? the then-foreign minister -lrb- fischer -rrb- had clearly explained that he was aware that bnd spies stayed in iraq .
that 's right and gets the wholehearted support of the greens .
fischer also made it clear that he was n't aware of activities that the spies had allowed themselves to be dragged into the war .
so , the former foreign minister is also naturally very much in favor of leaving no stone unturned in clearing up the issue . if it turns out that the bnd did work together with the us in iraq , would that be seen as a breaking of the " green " promise to keep germany out of the iraq war ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany refused to be part of the us-led invasion of iraq if that is the case , the bnd would have acted disloyally , not towards a party , but towards the german government which has represented a clear-cut position , nationally as well as internationally , that we consider the war , for one , to be wrong and secondly , that we do n't want to be part of it .
but , as i said , these are speculations and we first want to have facts on the table . there are allegations that the bnd does its own thing because even the parliamentary control commission is n't informed about all its activities .
what do you say to that ? this too has to be examined within the framework of the parliamentary investigation .
what is also true - and also been pointed out by the head of the parliamentary control commission in the past weeks - is that the rights of the board have to be strengthened when it comes to getting access to files and even publishing improper conduct .
that 's apparent even today . the opposition liberal free democrats and the left party are demanding the setting up an investigation committee in parliament .
how do the greens see the move ? the party 's parliamentary leadership has already recommended such an investigation because we do n't see any other way to clear up the matter . the interview was conducted by martin schrader -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the americans want to make clear germany is n't innocent " german intelligence agency expert erich schmidt-eenboom offers his take on the allegations that german secret agents were involved in assessing targets during the us military invasion in iraq .

germany has warned against sanctions . president mahmoud ahmadinejad was due to give a press conference - only his second since his shock election win last june - with the controversial hardliner expected to repeat his defiant stance . he has already vowed not to compromise " one iota " on his country 's nuclear program , especially efforts to master the fuel cycle . quoted by the official news agency irna , national security spokesman hossein entezami said iran was still open to negotiations with the european union - but said it was not ready to discuss research activities at the centre of the current stand-off . " the subject of the negotiations with the europeans is uniquely -lrb- full-scale -rrb- uranium enrichment , and the matter of nuclear research is not a part of that , " he said .

brian pickering talked to senator dan coats , the former us ambassador to germany , about german chancellor angela merkel 's talks with us president george w. bush . during her first visit to the united states since becoming german chancellor , angela merkel held talks with president george w. bush on friday on a wide range of issues .
the two leaders differed on guantanamo bay but vowed to seek a common approach on iran as they opened a new chapter in us-german relations .
president bush 's relationship with merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder , was often stormy because of schröder 's opposition to the us-led invasion of iraq . deutsche welle : senator coats , do you have the impression that germany and the united states countries have made progress in overcoming their differences and moving closer together again ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former us ambassador to germany daniel r. coats dan coats : very much so , this clearly was an indication by both chancellor merkel and the president that they want to open a new chapter in our relationship .
it 's going to be a return to a much more harmonious and united effort to deal with some of the major challenges and i think to respect each others differences in terms of some of the areas where we might not have total agreement .
but it 's clear that the president and chancellor merkel established a very good start . how would you describe the personal chemistry between the two ?
did they hit it off ? i think they clearly hit it off .
i think there is personal chemistry there .
the president referenced it when he said he was touched by the chancellor 's discussion about her upbringing in east germany and her appreciation for freedom from someone coming from a place where that freedom was not available .
i was at a dinner with chancellor merkel where she talked about this also .
i think the most important point that was made and had an impact on those who attended the dinner was that understanding that she had lived in isolation in east germany and of course the incredible rise to become the first woman chancellor of germany .
i think that 's something the president very much appreciated and he clearly wants to establish a working relationship and a good personal relationship with the new chancellor . ms. merkel is still prepared to criticize the united states and only last weekend she raised a few eyebrows in germany by saying that the guantanamo prison camp should not continued to operate indefinitely .
what was the president 's reaction to that criticism ? well , i think his reaction was the appropriate reaction .
that was that one he hopes for understanding in terms of the terrorist threat that exists and the implications of that for a free society .
so i think we 're going to see a president who is responsive to criticism because particularly he knows it is well-meant criticism .
it is criticism of a friend and ally as opposed to someone that may be using for political purposes or simply to gain political favor at home by making negative comments about the united states . at the moment it 's iran and not iraq that 's the focus of world attention .
germany is one of the three eu countries that have called for iran to be referred to the un security council over its decision to resume its nuclear program .
is there broad agreement between the united states and the eu on what action should be taken against iran ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations security council there clearly is broad agreement that has been obtained over the last couple of years as the eu has attempted to use diplomacy and negotiations to seek a favorable resolution to this .
clearly there is now agreement that this should be taken to the un security council and should move to the next step .
now what specific action the security council takes is something that has to be discussed and negotiated .
sanctions , if they are imposed , what kind of support we can get from other nations like china , india and russia to form a united front .
i think all of these still have to be decided .
but we 've taken a very important step forward in saying our best efforts , the eu-3 's best efforts over the past year and a half have not met with success and it is time to up the pressure on iran to take a much more sensible course of action . are ordinary americans taking an interest in ms. merkel 's visit to the us ? yes , they are .
ordinary americans are , i think , grateful and relieved , that the situation has changed , that we have a president now who is saying warm things about this new chancellor and has a willingness not only to reach out and work with the chancellor but to reach out and work with the german people in trying to address these international problems that affect both of us . dw-radio 's brian pickering interviewed dan coats send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush and merkel hail new chapter in us-german relations german chancellor angela merkel emerged from talks with president george w. bush in washington friday to say that us-german relations were back on track and that they shared common ground on many issues , including iran .

even as germany 's federal intelligence agency denies reports its spies in baghdad helped the us in selecting bombing targets there , jürgen trittin of the opposition green party told dw-world the fog has to be cleared . dw-world : mr trittin do you think it was and is right that the german federal intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- works in iraq ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin , former environment minister and prominent green party member jürgen trittin : it is right that in a situation that leads to such a war , the bnd does n't let the german government - it does n't matter which one - rely alone on information supplied by only one combatant or the other .
that 's why it was also right that members of the secret intelligence agency remained there .
as we know , they were housed in the french embassy - the embassy of a country that displayed a stance similar to germany 's on the iraq war . what do you have to say about the alleged fact that bnd spies did n't just work in iraq , but also supplied information to us troops that helped them to select their bombing targets ? so far there 's only one source for that claim and that 's a member of the american military intelligence community .
the bnd has issued a statement saying that 's not the case .
it seems like a parliamentary enquiry will have to clear up this contradiction .
we are all interested in shedding light on this matter because we ca n't accept that , if it is proved , authorities or even individual members - it does n't matter with whose knowledge - thwarted the political stance of the federal republic of germany on the iraq war by turning into one of the war parties themselves .
i 'm not going to volunteer to weigh the credibility of the different intelligence services against each other .
we have had our experiences with intelligence agencies of the us in the run-up to the iraq war . can you imagine that your own green party , also the party of the former foreign minister joschka fischer , was n't informed about such procedures ? the then-foreign minister -lrb- fischer -rrb- had clearly explained that he was aware that bnd spies stayed in iraq .
that 's right and gets the wholehearted support of the greens .
fischer also made it clear that he was n't aware of activities that the spies had allowed themselves to be dragged into the war .
so , the former foreign minister is also naturally very much in favor of leaving no stone unturned in clearing up the issue . if it turns out that the bnd did work together with the us in iraq , would that be seen as a breaking of the " green " promise to keep germany out of the iraq war ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany refused to be part of the us-led invasion of iraq if that is the case , the bnd would have acted disloyally , not towards a party , but towards the german government which has represented a clear-cut position , nationally as well as internationally , that we consider the war , for one , to be wrong and secondly , that we do n't want to be part of it .
but , as i said , these are speculations and we first want to have facts on the table . there are allegations that the bnd does its own thing because even the parliamentary control commission is n't informed about all its activities .
what do you say to that ? this too has to be examined within the framework of the parliamentary investigation .
what is also true - and also been pointed out by the head of the parliamentary control commission in the past weeks - is that the rights of the board have to be strengthened when it comes to getting access to files and even publishing improper conduct .
that 's apparent even today . the opposition liberal free democrats and the left party are demanding the setting up an investigation committee in parliament .
how do the greens see the move ? the party 's parliamentary leadership has already recommended such an investigation because we do n't see any other way to clear up the matter . the interview was conducted by martin schrader -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the americans want to make clear germany is n't innocent " german intelligence agency expert erich schmidt-eenboom offers his take on the allegations that german secret agents were involved in assessing targets during the us military invasion in iraq .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 14.01.2006 flightless eu constitution going the same way as the dodo ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much like the dodo , the eu constitution is an unwieldly beast being hunted to extinction austria 's hopes of breathing new life into the european constitution have had cold water poured over them after the netherlands announced the treaty was " dead . "
but is the idea really extinct ? dutch foreign minister bernard bot publicly declared what many european leaders had been avoiding saying : that the eu constitution , turned down by dutch and french voters , appears to have gone the way of another extinct object that failed to take flight - the dodo . the dodo was a plump , large bird that could neither run nor fly and which eventually became extinct .
the eu constitution is a massive project that took years to put together - and itself failed to lift off when french and dutch voters said " no " to it last year .
the question remains whether it can survive in some form or not . austria , which took over the eu presidency on january 1 pledged to work on reviving the constitution and vienna announced soon after that it would check with the other 24 eu nations by june on how to orchestrate this . bot pronounces constitution dead for the netherlands bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch minister of foreign affairs bernard bot read the last rites over the constitution .
just a few days after that announcement , austria 's foreign minister ursula plassnik met with her dutch counterpart bernard bot in the hague .
bot promptly snuffed out any hopes of a resurrection by saying the european constitution was dead for the netherlands . bot 's statement came just days after the austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel insisted that the constitution was " in the middle of ratification " and that " the constitution is not dead . " jo leinen , the chairman of the constitutional affairs committee in the european parliament , and the german member of the european parliament , shares austria 's desire for the constitution to be kept alive , but warned against renegotiating the text . " i can ’ t see what 's new that needs to be discussed .
we discussed the constitution for four years .
those who want to open a pandora 's box will get a weaker rather than a better constitution , " leinen said . like german chancellor angela merkel , leinen recommends that the entire constitution be preserved but made more attractive with an added charter on the " social dimension of europe . " leinen sees the eu door shutting if constitution dies this method was successful in saving the maastricht treaty which appeared to be facing almost certain defeat in the 1990 's . nothing is likely to happen before 2007 when the dutch and french both hold elections and get possible changes in leadership which may promote a " yes " vote in new referendums .
leinen says if the constitution does n't go through , no more seats will be made available in the european parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jo leinen sees no more new members if the eu constitution fails .
" rumania and bulgaria … well , they 've been decided on and they will be the last to get in based on the treaty of nice .
but it will be hard for croatia , macedonia and the others .
i think we have a lever here to create some sort of breakthrough , " leinen added . chirac 's " cherry picking " idea could cause further divisions french president jacques chirac suggested that the best parts of the constitution be " cherry-picked . "
that idea , as well as one that countries in favor of the constitution team up and move forward with it , has been overwhelmingly rejected , according to hans-gert pöttering , member of the christian social democrats and leader of the european parliament ’ s largest conservative faction . " we totally reject these ideas that are coming from paris , which promote that states in favor of the constitution form their own separate working group .
we have seen too many psychological divisions in europe in the past , " pöttering said . of the 25 eu member states , 14 have ratified the treaty , including germany .
but there are no guarantees that countries like denmark and the uk will follow .
as the uk 's foreign secretary jack straw said : " the treaty is in limbo .
that is somewhere between heaven and hell .
it is difficult to argue , that it ’ s not dead . " bernd riegert -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : the eu constitution is dead what happens now following the no votes to the eu constitution ?

but , as i said , these are speculations and we first want to have facts on the table . there are allegations that the bnd does its own thing because even the parliamentary control commission is n't informed about all its activities .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.01.2006 " we have to shed light on the issue " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much of a role did germany 's federal intelligence agency play in iraq ?
even as germany 's federal intelligence agency denies reports its spies in baghdad helped the us in selecting bombing targets there , jürgen trittin of the opposition green party told dw-world the fog has to be cleared . dw-world : mr trittin do you think it was and is right that the german federal intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- works in iraq ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin , former environment minister and prominent green party member jürgen trittin : it is right that in a situation that leads to such a war , the bnd does n't let the german government - it does n't matter which one - rely alone on information supplied by only one combatant or the other .
that 's why it was also right that members of the secret intelligence agency remained there .
as we know , they were housed in the french embassy - the embassy of a country that displayed a stance similar to germany 's on the iraq war . what do you have to say about the alleged fact that bnd spies did n't just work in iraq , but also supplied information to us troops that helped them to select their bombing targets ? so far there 's only one source for that claim and that 's a member of the american military intelligence community .
the bnd has issued a statement saying that 's not the case .
it seems like a parliamentary enquiry will have to clear up this contradiction .
we are all interested in shedding light on this matter because we ca n't accept that , if it is proved , authorities or even individual members - it does n't matter with whose knowledge - thwarted the political stance of the federal republic of germany on the iraq war by turning into one of the war parties themselves .
i 'm not going to volunteer to weigh the credibility of the different intelligence services against each other .
we have had our experiences with intelligence agencies of the us in the run-up to the iraq war . can you imagine that your own green party , also the party of the former foreign minister joschka fischer , was n't informed about such procedures ? the then-foreign minister -lrb- fischer -rrb- had clearly explained that he was aware that bnd spies stayed in iraq .
that 's right and gets the wholehearted support of the greens .
fischer also made it clear that he was n't aware of activities that the spies had allowed themselves to be dragged into the war .
so , the former foreign minister is also naturally very much in favor of leaving no stone unturned in clearing up the issue . if it turns out that the bnd did work together with the us in iraq , would that be seen as a breaking of the " green " promise to keep germany out of the iraq war ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany refused to be part of the us-led invasion of iraq if that is the case , the bnd would have acted disloyally , not towards a party , but towards the german government which has represented a clear-cut position , nationally as well as internationally , that we consider the war , for one , to be wrong and secondly , that we do n't want to be part of it .

germany has warned against sanctions . president mahmoud ahmadinejad was due to give a press conference - only his second since his shock election win last june - with the controversial hardliner expected to repeat his defiant stance . he has already vowed not to compromise " one iota " on his country 's nuclear program , especially efforts to master the fuel cycle . quoted by the official news agency irna , national security spokesman hossein entezami said iran was still open to negotiations with the european union - but said it was not ready to discuss research activities at the centre of the current stand-off . " the subject of the negotiations with the europeans is uniquely -lrb- full-scale -rrb- uranium enrichment , and the matter of nuclear research is not a part of that , " he said .
" the decision by iran to carry out research activities is serious . " small-scale enrichment now iran resumed research this week , with the work involving small scale enrichment to test centrifuges .
it insists this is separate from full-scale uranium enrichment , which remains frozen for the time being . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bushehr nuclear power plant in south iran iran says its nuclear program is only directed towards generating electricity and is entirely legal , although the enrichment process can be extended to make atomic bombs . the three main eu powers - britain , france and germany - have for more than two years been trying to convince iran to voluntarily limit its nuclear activities in exchange for trade and other incentives . but iran has consistently refused striking any such deal , and since ahmadinejad 's election win has been progressively been backing away from a temporary freeze on fuel cycle work agreed to in 2003 and again in 2004 . talks next week eu , us , chinese and russian officials are due to hold talks in london on monday , when they are expected to set a date for an emergency meeting of the international atomic energy agency 's 35-nation board of governors . both the eu and the us are now pushing for iran to be referred to the un security council , hoping to back up a series of iaea calls - so far ignored - for tehran to return to a full nuclear freeze . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush at a joint press conference with german chancellor angela merkel " it 's logical that a country which has rejected diplomatic " efforts to end the crisis " be sent to the united nations security council , " us president george w. bush said at a joint press conference with visiting german chancellor angela merkel in washington on friday . if iran obtained nuclear weapons , it would pose " a grave threat to the security of the world , " bush said , recalling how ahmadinejad had called last year for israel to be " wiped off the map . " germany warns against sanctions but so far the west has played down any talk of immediate sanctions or even military action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gernot erler germany 's deputy foreign minister gernot erler told german radio in an interview to be broadcast on sunday that imposing economic sanctions against iran would be a " very dangerous path .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 14.01.2006 flightless eu constitution going the same way as the dodo ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much like the dodo , the eu constitution is an unwieldly beast being hunted to extinction austria 's hopes of breathing new life into the european constitution have had cold water poured over them after the netherlands announced the treaty was " dead . "
but is the idea really extinct ? dutch foreign minister bernard bot publicly declared what many european leaders had been avoiding saying : that the eu constitution , turned down by dutch and french voters , appears to have gone the way of another extinct object that failed to take flight - the dodo . the dodo was a plump , large bird that could neither run nor fly and which eventually became extinct .
the eu constitution is a massive project that took years to put together - and itself failed to lift off when french and dutch voters said " no " to it last year .
the question remains whether it can survive in some form or not . austria , which took over the eu presidency on january 1 pledged to work on reviving the constitution and vienna announced soon after that it would check with the other 24 eu nations by june on how to orchestrate this . bot pronounces constitution dead for the netherlands bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch minister of foreign affairs bernard bot read the last rites over the constitution .
just a few days after that announcement , austria 's foreign minister ursula plassnik met with her dutch counterpart bernard bot in the hague .
bot promptly snuffed out any hopes of a resurrection by saying the european constitution was dead for the netherlands . bot 's statement came just days after the austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel insisted that the constitution was " in the middle of ratification " and that " the constitution is not dead . " jo leinen , the chairman of the constitutional affairs committee in the european parliament , and the german member of the european parliament , shares austria 's desire for the constitution to be kept alive , but warned against renegotiating the text . " i can ’ t see what 's new that needs to be discussed .
we discussed the constitution for four years .
those who want to open a pandora 's box will get a weaker rather than a better constitution , " leinen said . like german chancellor angela merkel , leinen recommends that the entire constitution be preserved but made more attractive with an added charter on the " social dimension of europe . " leinen sees the eu door shutting if constitution dies this method was successful in saving the maastricht treaty which appeared to be facing almost certain defeat in the 1990 's . nothing is likely to happen before 2007 when the dutch and french both hold elections and get possible changes in leadership which may promote a " yes " vote in new referendums .
leinen says if the constitution does n't go through , no more seats will be made available in the european parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jo leinen sees no more new members if the eu constitution fails .
" rumania and bulgaria … well , they 've been decided on and they will be the last to get in based on the treaty of nice .
but it will be hard for croatia , macedonia and the others .
i think we have a lever here to create some sort of breakthrough , " leinen added . chirac 's " cherry picking " idea could cause further divisions french president jacques chirac suggested that the best parts of the constitution be " cherry-picked . "
that idea , as well as one that countries in favor of the constitution team up and move forward with it , has been overwhelmingly rejected , according to hans-gert pöttering , member of the christian social democrats and leader of the european parliament ’ s largest conservative faction . " we totally reject these ideas that are coming from paris , which promote that states in favor of the constitution form their own separate working group .
we have seen too many psychological divisions in europe in the past , " pöttering said . of the 25 eu member states , 14 have ratified the treaty , including germany .
but there are no guarantees that countries like denmark and the uk will follow .
as the uk 's foreign secretary jack straw said : " the treaty is in limbo .
that is somewhere between heaven and hell .
it is difficult to argue , that it ’ s not dead . " bernd riegert -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : the eu constitution is dead what happens now following the no votes to the eu constitution ?
just push on as if nothing happened , like some eu leaders are demanding ?
maybe some breathing space for the eu to take stock of itself would be better .
-lrb- june 3 , 2005 -rrb- curing the eu 's democratic deficit ?
the referendums in france and the netherlands on the eu constitution gave citizens a real , if disapproving , voice in the eu 's future .
but some question if referendums are a good way to chart the eu 's future direction .
-lrb- june 7 , 2005 -rrb- austria set to revive eu constitution austria promised monday to inject momentum into the european union during its six-month presidency .

germany has warned against sanctions . president mahmoud ahmadinejad was due to give a press conference - only his second since his shock election win last june - with the controversial hardliner expected to repeat his defiant stance . he has already vowed not to compromise " one iota " on his country 's nuclear program , especially efforts to master the fuel cycle . quoted by the official news agency irna , national security spokesman hossein entezami said iran was still open to negotiations with the european union - but said it was not ready to discuss research activities at the centre of the current stand-off . " the subject of the negotiations with the europeans is uniquely -lrb- full-scale -rrb- uranium enrichment , and the matter of nuclear research is not a part of that , " he said .
" the decision by iran to carry out research activities is serious . " small-scale enrichment now iran resumed research this week , with the work involving small scale enrichment to test centrifuges .
it insists this is separate from full-scale uranium enrichment , which remains frozen for the time being . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bushehr nuclear power plant in south iran iran says its nuclear program is only directed towards generating electricity and is entirely legal , although the enrichment process can be extended to make atomic bombs . the three main eu powers - britain , france and germany - have for more than two years been trying to convince iran to voluntarily limit its nuclear activities in exchange for trade and other incentives . but iran has consistently refused striking any such deal , and since ahmadinejad 's election win has been progressively been backing away from a temporary freeze on fuel cycle work agreed to in 2003 and again in 2004 . talks next week eu , us , chinese and russian officials are due to hold talks in london on monday , when they are expected to set a date for an emergency meeting of the international atomic energy agency 's 35-nation board of governors . both the eu and the us are now pushing for iran to be referred to the un security council , hoping to back up a series of iaea calls - so far ignored - for tehran to return to a full nuclear freeze . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush at a joint press conference with german chancellor angela merkel " it 's logical that a country which has rejected diplomatic " efforts to end the crisis " be sent to the united nations security council , " us president george w. bush said at a joint press conference with visiting german chancellor angela merkel in washington on friday . if iran obtained nuclear weapons , it would pose " a grave threat to the security of the world , " bush said , recalling how ahmadinejad had called last year for israel to be " wiped off the map . " germany warns against sanctions but so far the west has played down any talk of immediate sanctions or even military action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gernot erler germany 's deputy foreign minister gernot erler told german radio in an interview to be broadcast on sunday that imposing economic sanctions against iran would be a " very dangerous path . " he said he favored imposing travel restrictions on iranian politicians , since they would have " an extraordinarily unpleasant impact . " iran has warned that a referral to the security council would bring serious consequences from its side . " all voluntary means of cooperation " with the iaea would end , foreign minister manouchehr mottaki warned friday . this could entail an end to tougher un inspections of iranian nuclear sites or even result in a resumption of full-scale uranium enrichment . the mounting crisis is affecting the world energy markets : oil futures closed marginally lower friday in line with falls for natural gas , but traders said anxiety remained about the nuclear crisis surrounding iran . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran threatens to halt nuclear cooperation iran threatened on friday to stop cooperating with the un atomic watchdog , including possibly resuming uranium enrichment , if its controversial nuclear program is referred to the un security council .

brian pickering talked to senator dan coats , the former us ambassador to germany , about german chancellor angela merkel 's talks with us president george w. bush . during her first visit to the united states since becoming german chancellor , angela merkel held talks with president george w. bush on friday on a wide range of issues .
the two leaders differed on guantanamo bay but vowed to seek a common approach on iran as they opened a new chapter in us-german relations .
president bush 's relationship with merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder , was often stormy because of schröder 's opposition to the us-led invasion of iraq . deutsche welle : senator coats , do you have the impression that germany and the united states countries have made progress in overcoming their differences and moving closer together again ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former us ambassador to germany daniel r. coats dan coats : very much so , this clearly was an indication by both chancellor merkel and the president that they want to open a new chapter in our relationship .
it 's going to be a return to a much more harmonious and united effort to deal with some of the major challenges and i think to respect each others differences in terms of some of the areas where we might not have total agreement .
but it 's clear that the president and chancellor merkel established a very good start . how would you describe the personal chemistry between the two ?
did they hit it off ? i think they clearly hit it off .
i think there is personal chemistry there .
the president referenced it when he said he was touched by the chancellor 's discussion about her upbringing in east germany and her appreciation for freedom from someone coming from a place where that freedom was not available .
i was at a dinner with chancellor merkel where she talked about this also .
i think the most important point that was made and had an impact on those who attended the dinner was that understanding that she had lived in isolation in east germany and of course the incredible rise to become the first woman chancellor of germany .
i think that 's something the president very much appreciated and he clearly wants to establish a working relationship and a good personal relationship with the new chancellor . ms. merkel is still prepared to criticize the united states and only last weekend she raised a few eyebrows in germany by saying that the guantanamo prison camp should not continued to operate indefinitely .
what was the president 's reaction to that criticism ? well , i think his reaction was the appropriate reaction .
that was that one he hopes for understanding in terms of the terrorist threat that exists and the implications of that for a free society .
so i think we 're going to see a president who is responsive to criticism because particularly he knows it is well-meant criticism .

brian pickering talked to senator dan coats , the former us ambassador to germany , about german chancellor angela merkel 's talks with us president george w. bush . during her first visit to the united states since becoming german chancellor , angela merkel held talks with president george w. bush on friday on a wide range of issues .
the two leaders differed on guantanamo bay but vowed to seek a common approach on iran as they opened a new chapter in us-german relations .
president bush 's relationship with merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder , was often stormy because of schröder 's opposition to the us-led invasion of iraq . deutsche welle : senator coats , do you have the impression that germany and the united states countries have made progress in overcoming their differences and moving closer together again ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former us ambassador to germany daniel r. coats dan coats : very much so , this clearly was an indication by both chancellor merkel and the president that they want to open a new chapter in our relationship .
it 's going to be a return to a much more harmonious and united effort to deal with some of the major challenges and i think to respect each others differences in terms of some of the areas where we might not have total agreement .
but it 's clear that the president and chancellor merkel established a very good start . how would you describe the personal chemistry between the two ?
did they hit it off ? i think they clearly hit it off .
i think there is personal chemistry there .
the president referenced it when he said he was touched by the chancellor 's discussion about her upbringing in east germany and her appreciation for freedom from someone coming from a place where that freedom was not available .

ordinary americans are , i think , grateful and relieved , that the situation has changed , that we have a president now who is saying warm things about this new chancellor and has a willingness not only to reach out and work with the chancellor but to reach out and work with the german people in trying to address these international problems that affect both of us . dw-radio 's brian pickering interviewed dan coats send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush and merkel hail new chapter in us-german relations german chancellor angela merkel emerged from talks with president george w. bush in washington friday to say that us-german relations were back on track and that they shared common ground on many issues , including iran .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 14.01.2006 iran digs in over nuclear crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president ahmadinejad is refusing to budge despite possible un security council action iran dug in over its disputed nuclear program saturday , saying it would not reverse a decision to conduct sensitive atomic research work even if referred to the un security council .
germany has warned against sanctions . president mahmoud ahmadinejad was due to give a press conference - only his second since his shock election win last june - with the controversial hardliner expected to repeat his defiant stance . he has already vowed not to compromise " one iota " on his country 's nuclear program , especially efforts to master the fuel cycle . quoted by the official news agency irna , national security spokesman hossein entezami said iran was still open to negotiations with the european union - but said it was not ready to discuss research activities at the centre of the current stand-off . " the subject of the negotiations with the europeans is uniquely -lrb- full-scale -rrb- uranium enrichment , and the matter of nuclear research is not a part of that , " he said .
" the decision by iran to carry out research activities is serious . " small-scale enrichment now iran resumed research this week , with the work involving small scale enrichment to test centrifuges .
it insists this is separate from full-scale uranium enrichment , which remains frozen for the time being . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bushehr nuclear power plant in south iran iran says its nuclear program is only directed towards generating electricity and is entirely legal , although the enrichment process can be extended to make atomic bombs . the three main eu powers - britain , france and germany - have for more than two years been trying to convince iran to voluntarily limit its nuclear activities in exchange for trade and other incentives . but iran has consistently refused striking any such deal , and since ahmadinejad 's election win has been progressively been backing away from a temporary freeze on fuel cycle work agreed to in 2003 and again in 2004 . talks next week eu , us , chinese and russian officials are due to hold talks in london on monday , when they are expected to set a date for an emergency meeting of the international atomic energy agency 's 35-nation board of governors . both the eu and the us are now pushing for iran to be referred to the un security council , hoping to back up a series of iaea calls - so far ignored - for tehran to return to a full nuclear freeze . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush at a joint press conference with german chancellor angela merkel " it 's logical that a country which has rejected diplomatic " efforts to end the crisis " be sent to the united nations security council , " us president george w. bush said at a joint press conference with visiting german chancellor angela merkel in washington on friday . if iran obtained nuclear weapons , it would pose " a grave threat to the security of the world , " bush said , recalling how ahmadinejad had called last year for israel to be " wiped off the map . " germany warns against sanctions but so far the west has played down any talk of immediate sanctions or even military action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gernot erler germany 's deputy foreign minister gernot erler told german radio in an interview to be broadcast on sunday that imposing economic sanctions against iran would be a " very dangerous path . " he said he favored imposing travel restrictions on iranian politicians , since they would have " an extraordinarily unpleasant impact . " iran has warned that a referral to the security council would bring serious consequences from its side . " all voluntary means of cooperation " with the iaea would end , foreign minister manouchehr mottaki warned friday . this could entail an end to tougher un inspections of iranian nuclear sites or even result in a resumption of full-scale uranium enrichment . the mounting crisis is affecting the world energy markets : oil futures closed marginally lower friday in line with falls for natural gas , but traders said anxiety remained about the nuclear crisis surrounding iran . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran threatens to halt nuclear cooperation iran threatened on friday to stop cooperating with the un atomic watchdog , including possibly resuming uranium enrichment , if its controversial nuclear program is referred to the un security council .

even as germany 's federal intelligence agency denies reports its spies in baghdad helped the us in selecting bombing targets there , jürgen trittin of the opposition green party told dw-world the fog has to be cleared . dw-world : mr trittin do you think it was and is right that the german federal intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- works in iraq ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin , former environment minister and prominent green party member jürgen trittin : it is right that in a situation that leads to such a war , the bnd does n't let the german government - it does n't matter which one - rely alone on information supplied by only one combatant or the other .
that 's why it was also right that members of the secret intelligence agency remained there .
as we know , they were housed in the french embassy - the embassy of a country that displayed a stance similar to germany 's on the iraq war . what do you have to say about the alleged fact that bnd spies did n't just work in iraq , but also supplied information to us troops that helped them to select their bombing targets ? so far there 's only one source for that claim and that 's a member of the american military intelligence community .
the bnd has issued a statement saying that 's not the case .
it seems like a parliamentary enquiry will have to clear up this contradiction .
we are all interested in shedding light on this matter because we ca n't accept that , if it is proved , authorities or even individual members - it does n't matter with whose knowledge - thwarted the political stance of the federal republic of germany on the iraq war by turning into one of the war parties themselves .
i 'm not going to volunteer to weigh the credibility of the different intelligence services against each other .
we have had our experiences with intelligence agencies of the us in the run-up to the iraq war . can you imagine that your own green party , also the party of the former foreign minister joschka fischer , was n't informed about such procedures ? the then-foreign minister -lrb- fischer -rrb- had clearly explained that he was aware that bnd spies stayed in iraq .
that 's right and gets the wholehearted support of the greens .
fischer also made it clear that he was n't aware of activities that the spies had allowed themselves to be dragged into the war .
so , the former foreign minister is also naturally very much in favor of leaving no stone unturned in clearing up the issue . if it turns out that the bnd did work together with the us in iraq , would that be seen as a breaking of the " green " promise to keep germany out of the iraq war ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany refused to be part of the us-led invasion of iraq if that is the case , the bnd would have acted disloyally , not towards a party , but towards the german government which has represented a clear-cut position , nationally as well as internationally , that we consider the war , for one , to be wrong and secondly , that we do n't want to be part of it .
but , as i said , these are speculations and we first want to have facts on the table . there are allegations that the bnd does its own thing because even the parliamentary control commission is n't informed about all its activities .
what do you say to that ? this too has to be examined within the framework of the parliamentary investigation .
what is also true - and also been pointed out by the head of the parliamentary control commission in the past weeks - is that the rights of the board have to be strengthened when it comes to getting access to files and even publishing improper conduct .
that 's apparent even today . the opposition liberal free democrats and the left party are demanding the setting up an investigation committee in parliament .
how do the greens see the move ? the party 's parliamentary leadership has already recommended such an investigation because we do n't see any other way to clear up the matter . the interview was conducted by martin schrader -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the americans want to make clear germany is n't innocent " german intelligence agency expert erich schmidt-eenboom offers his take on the allegations that german secret agents were involved in assessing targets during the us military invasion in iraq .

germany has warned against sanctions . president mahmoud ahmadinejad was due to give a press conference - only his second since his shock election win last june - with the controversial hardliner expected to repeat his defiant stance . he has already vowed not to compromise " one iota " on his country 's nuclear program , especially efforts to master the fuel cycle . quoted by the official news agency irna , national security spokesman hossein entezami said iran was still open to negotiations with the european union - but said it was not ready to discuss research activities at the centre of the current stand-off . " the subject of the negotiations with the europeans is uniquely -lrb- full-scale -rrb- uranium enrichment , and the matter of nuclear research is not a part of that , " he said .
" the decision by iran to carry out research activities is serious . " small-scale enrichment now iran resumed research this week , with the work involving small scale enrichment to test centrifuges .
it insists this is separate from full-scale uranium enrichment , which remains frozen for the time being . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bushehr nuclear power plant in south iran iran says its nuclear program is only directed towards generating electricity and is entirely legal , although the enrichment process can be extended to make atomic bombs . the three main eu powers - britain , france and germany - have for more than two years been trying to convince iran to voluntarily limit its nuclear activities in exchange for trade and other incentives . but iran has consistently refused striking any such deal , and since ahmadinejad 's election win has been progressively been backing away from a temporary freeze on fuel cycle work agreed to in 2003 and again in 2004 . talks next week eu , us , chinese and russian officials are due to hold talks in london on monday , when they are expected to set a date for an emergency meeting of the international atomic energy agency 's 35-nation board of governors . both the eu and the us are now pushing for iran to be referred to the un security council , hoping to back up a series of iaea calls - so far ignored - for tehran to return to a full nuclear freeze . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush at a joint press conference with german chancellor angela merkel " it 's logical that a country which has rejected diplomatic " efforts to end the crisis " be sent to the united nations security council , " us president george w. bush said at a joint press conference with visiting german chancellor angela merkel in washington on friday . if iran obtained nuclear weapons , it would pose " a grave threat to the security of the world , " bush said , recalling how ahmadinejad had called last year for israel to be " wiped off the map . " germany warns against sanctions but so far the west has played down any talk of immediate sanctions or even military action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gernot erler germany 's deputy foreign minister gernot erler told german radio in an interview to be broadcast on sunday that imposing economic sanctions against iran would be a " very dangerous path . " he said he favored imposing travel restrictions on iranian politicians , since they would have " an extraordinarily unpleasant impact . " iran has warned that a referral to the security council would bring serious consequences from its side . " all voluntary means of cooperation " with the iaea would end , foreign minister manouchehr mottaki warned friday . this could entail an end to tougher un inspections of iranian nuclear sites or even result in a resumption of full-scale uranium enrichment . the mounting crisis is affecting the world energy markets : oil futures closed marginally lower friday in line with falls for natural gas , but traders said anxiety remained about the nuclear crisis surrounding iran . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran threatens to halt nuclear cooperation iran threatened on friday to stop cooperating with the un atomic watchdog , including possibly resuming uranium enrichment , if its controversial nuclear program is referred to the un security council .

"
but is the idea really extinct ? dutch foreign minister bernard bot publicly declared what many european leaders had been avoiding saying : that the eu constitution , turned down by dutch and french voters , appears to have gone the way of another extinct object that failed to take flight - the dodo . the dodo was a plump , large bird that could neither run nor fly and which eventually became extinct .
the eu constitution is a massive project that took years to put together - and itself failed to lift off when french and dutch voters said " no " to it last year .
the question remains whether it can survive in some form or not . austria , which took over the eu presidency on january 1 pledged to work on reviving the constitution and vienna announced soon after that it would check with the other 24 eu nations by june on how to orchestrate this . bot pronounces constitution dead for the netherlands bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch minister of foreign affairs bernard bot read the last rites over the constitution .
just a few days after that announcement , austria 's foreign minister ursula plassnik met with her dutch counterpart bernard bot in the hague .
bot promptly snuffed out any hopes of a resurrection by saying the european constitution was dead for the netherlands . bot 's statement came just days after the austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel insisted that the constitution was " in the middle of ratification " and that " the constitution is not dead . " jo leinen , the chairman of the constitutional affairs committee in the european parliament , and the german member of the european parliament , shares austria 's desire for the constitution to be kept alive , but warned against renegotiating the text . " i can ’ t see what 's new that needs to be discussed .
we discussed the constitution for four years .
those who want to open a pandora 's box will get a weaker rather than a better constitution , " leinen said . like german chancellor angela merkel , leinen recommends that the entire constitution be preserved but made more attractive with an added charter on the " social dimension of europe . " leinen sees the eu door shutting if constitution dies this method was successful in saving the maastricht treaty which appeared to be facing almost certain defeat in the 1990 's . nothing is likely to happen before 2007 when the dutch and french both hold elections and get possible changes in leadership which may promote a " yes " vote in new referendums .
leinen says if the constitution does n't go through , no more seats will be made available in the european parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jo leinen sees no more new members if the eu constitution fails .
" rumania and bulgaria … well , they 've been decided on and they will be the last to get in based on the treaty of nice .
but it will be hard for croatia , macedonia and the others .
i think we have a lever here to create some sort of breakthrough , " leinen added . chirac 's " cherry picking " idea could cause further divisions french president jacques chirac suggested that the best parts of the constitution be " cherry-picked . "
that idea , as well as one that countries in favor of the constitution team up and move forward with it , has been overwhelmingly rejected , according to hans-gert pöttering , member of the christian social democrats and leader of the european parliament ’ s largest conservative faction . " we totally reject these ideas that are coming from paris , which promote that states in favor of the constitution form their own separate working group .
we have seen too many psychological divisions in europe in the past , " pöttering said . of the 25 eu member states , 14 have ratified the treaty , including germany .
but there are no guarantees that countries like denmark and the uk will follow .
as the uk 's foreign secretary jack straw said : " the treaty is in limbo .
that is somewhere between heaven and hell .
it is difficult to argue , that it ’ s not dead . " bernd riegert -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : the eu constitution is dead what happens now following the no votes to the eu constitution ?

now that the world cup opening extravaganza in berlin has been given the boot , politicians are clambering for some kind of replacement show .
but fifa is n't interested . the announcement by the world soccer governing body fifa that the planned opening extravaganza by star director andre heller would not take place struck like a bolt of lightning on a sunny day in berlin .
the city 's mayor , klaus wowereit , scrambled quickly after being knocked down by the fifa blow . he said he would try to persuade fifa to allow an alternative show at the brandenburg gate , a location better known for its new year 's celebrations , the love parade and naturally the emotional scenes of the reunification in 1989 .
it seems less than the ideal spot for soccer fans to gather in the direct run-up to the world cup , far away from the olympic stadium , where the world cup final will take place . but now fifa very much wants to distance itself from any kind of opening ceremony . " the gala will not be replaced , " said the soccer body 's director of communications markus siegler . fifa incurring germany 's wrath bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andre heller -lrb- r -rrb- said fifa 's cancellation of his extravaganza would not come " cheap " the matter is leaving a bitter taste in public officials ' mouths .

the organizers of the month-long tournament , led by former soccer star franz beckenbauer , are hoping for a world cup that would make all others pale in comparison .
yet months before the first german goal is scored , the spd politician said that grave mistakes have already been made . why not move it to munich ? while some berlin officials seethe , others have floated the idea of moving the gala to munich , where the opening match will be played on june 9 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the brandenburg gate was the venue for wild parties like the now-defunct love parade ernst hinsken , the chair of the parliamentary tourism committee and also from bavaria , said that munich has the facilities to do it .

now that the world cup opening extravaganza in berlin has been given the boot , politicians are clambering for some kind of replacement show .
but fifa is n't interested . the announcement by the world soccer governing body fifa that the planned opening extravaganza by star director andre heller would not take place struck like a bolt of lightning on a sunny day in berlin .
the city 's mayor , klaus wowereit , scrambled quickly after being knocked down by the fifa blow . he said he would try to persuade fifa to allow an alternative show at the brandenburg gate , a location better known for its new year 's celebrations , the love parade and naturally the emotional scenes of the reunification in 1989 .
it seems less than the ideal spot for soccer fans to gather in the direct run-up to the world cup , far away from the olympic stadium , where the world cup final will take place . but now fifa very much wants to distance itself from any kind of opening ceremony . " the gala will not be replaced , " said the soccer body 's director of communications markus siegler . fifa incurring germany 's wrath bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andre heller -lrb- r -rrb- said fifa 's cancellation of his extravaganza would not come " cheap " the matter is leaving a bitter taste in public officials ' mouths . " this is embarrassing and is not a good start , " dieter wiefelspütz , the social democratic domestic policy spokesman , told hanover 's neue presse newspaper . not only has the extravaganza been ignominiously wiped off the schedule of world cup events , germany 's image itself could even be tarnished , according to wiefelspütz .
the organizers of the month-long tournament , led by former soccer star franz beckenbauer , are hoping for a world cup that would make all others pale in comparison .
yet months before the first german goal is scored , the spd politician said that grave mistakes have already been made . why not move it to munich ? while some berlin officials seethe , others have floated the idea of moving the gala to munich , where the opening match will be played on june 9 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the brandenburg gate was the venue for wild parties like the now-defunct love parade ernst hinsken , the chair of the parliamentary tourism committee and also from bavaria , said that munich has the facilities to do it . " the old olympic stadium would be the right place for the gala , " he told the passauer neue presse newspaper .
" the concept would have to be watered down a little bit -lrb- for munich -rrb- but then it would work . " the idea is not without its merits .
thousands of fans would be spared having to make the trek from berlin to munich said hinsken .
most importantly , hinsken believes , the financial and image loss must be held to a minimum . the call has so far fallen on deaf ears in zurich , where fifa 's headquarters are located .
fifa 's siegler said that there is no chance that the gala will be held elsewhere . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup gala gets the ax the star-studded gala which was to open the 2006 world cup in berlin has been cancelled due to concerns over damage to the olympic stadium 's pitch .

even as germany 's federal intelligence agency denies reports its spies in baghdad helped the us in selecting bombing targets there , jürgen trittin of the opposition green party told dw-world the fog has to be cleared . dw-world : mr trittin do you think it was and is right that the german federal intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- works in iraq ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin , former environment minister and prominent green party member jürgen trittin : it is right that in a situation that leads to such a war , the bnd does n't let the german government - it does n't matter which one - rely alone on information supplied by only one combatant or the other .
that 's why it was also right that members of the secret intelligence agency remained there .
as we know , they were housed in the french embassy - the embassy of a country that displayed a stance similar to germany 's on the iraq war . what do you have to say about the alleged fact that bnd spies did n't just work in iraq , but also supplied information to us troops that helped them to select their bombing targets ? so far there 's only one source for that claim and that 's a member of the american military intelligence community .
the bnd has issued a statement saying that 's not the case .
it seems like a parliamentary enquiry will have to clear up this contradiction .
we are all interested in shedding light on this matter because we ca n't accept that , if it is proved , authorities or even individual members - it does n't matter with whose knowledge - thwarted the political stance of the federal republic of germany on the iraq war by turning into one of the war parties themselves .
i 'm not going to volunteer to weigh the credibility of the different intelligence services against each other .
we have had our experiences with intelligence agencies of the us in the run-up to the iraq war . can you imagine that your own green party , also the party of the former foreign minister joschka fischer , was n't informed about such procedures ? the then-foreign minister -lrb- fischer -rrb- had clearly explained that he was aware that bnd spies stayed in iraq .
that 's right and gets the wholehearted support of the greens .
fischer also made it clear that he was n't aware of activities that the spies had allowed themselves to be dragged into the war .
so , the former foreign minister is also naturally very much in favor of leaving no stone unturned in clearing up the issue . if it turns out that the bnd did work together with the us in iraq , would that be seen as a breaking of the " green " promise to keep germany out of the iraq war ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany refused to be part of the us-led invasion of iraq if that is the case , the bnd would have acted disloyally , not towards a party , but towards the german government which has represented a clear-cut position , nationally as well as internationally , that we consider the war , for one , to be wrong and secondly , that we do n't want to be part of it .
but , as i said , these are speculations and we first want to have facts on the table . there are allegations that the bnd does its own thing because even the parliamentary control commission is n't informed about all its activities .
what do you say to that ? this too has to be examined within the framework of the parliamentary investigation .
what is also true - and also been pointed out by the head of the parliamentary control commission in the past weeks - is that the rights of the board have to be strengthened when it comes to getting access to files and even publishing improper conduct .
that 's apparent even today . the opposition liberal free democrats and the left party are demanding the setting up an investigation committee in parliament .
how do the greens see the move ? the party 's parliamentary leadership has already recommended such an investigation because we do n't see any other way to clear up the matter . the interview was conducted by martin schrader -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the americans want to make clear germany is n't innocent " german intelligence agency expert erich schmidt-eenboom offers his take on the allegations that german secret agents were involved in assessing targets during the us military invasion in iraq .

"
but is the idea really extinct ? dutch foreign minister bernard bot publicly declared what many european leaders had been avoiding saying : that the eu constitution , turned down by dutch and french voters , appears to have gone the way of another extinct object that failed to take flight - the dodo . the dodo was a plump , large bird that could neither run nor fly and which eventually became extinct .
the eu constitution is a massive project that took years to put together - and itself failed to lift off when french and dutch voters said " no " to it last year .
the question remains whether it can survive in some form or not . austria , which took over the eu presidency on january 1 pledged to work on reviving the constitution and vienna announced soon after that it would check with the other 24 eu nations by june on how to orchestrate this . bot pronounces constitution dead for the netherlands bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch minister of foreign affairs bernard bot read the last rites over the constitution .
just a few days after that announcement , austria 's foreign minister ursula plassnik met with her dutch counterpart bernard bot in the hague .
bot promptly snuffed out any hopes of a resurrection by saying the european constitution was dead for the netherlands . bot 's statement came just days after the austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel insisted that the constitution was " in the middle of ratification " and that " the constitution is not dead . " jo leinen , the chairman of the constitutional affairs committee in the european parliament , and the german member of the european parliament , shares austria 's desire for the constitution to be kept alive , but warned against renegotiating the text . " i can ’ t see what 's new that needs to be discussed .
we discussed the constitution for four years .
those who want to open a pandora 's box will get a weaker rather than a better constitution , " leinen said . like german chancellor angela merkel , leinen recommends that the entire constitution be preserved but made more attractive with an added charter on the " social dimension of europe . " leinen sees the eu door shutting if constitution dies this method was successful in saving the maastricht treaty which appeared to be facing almost certain defeat in the 1990 's . nothing is likely to happen before 2007 when the dutch and french both hold elections and get possible changes in leadership which may promote a " yes " vote in new referendums .
leinen says if the constitution does n't go through , no more seats will be made available in the european parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jo leinen sees no more new members if the eu constitution fails .
" rumania and bulgaria … well , they 've been decided on and they will be the last to get in based on the treaty of nice .

i think we have a lever here to create some sort of breakthrough , " leinen added . chirac 's " cherry picking " idea could cause further divisions french president jacques chirac suggested that the best parts of the constitution be " cherry-picked . "
that idea , as well as one that countries in favor of the constitution team up and move forward with it , has been overwhelmingly rejected , according to hans-gert pöttering , member of the christian social democrats and leader of the european parliament ’ s largest conservative faction . " we totally reject these ideas that are coming from paris , which promote that states in favor of the constitution form their own separate working group .

germany has warned against sanctions . president mahmoud ahmadinejad was due to give a press conference - only his second since his shock election win last june - with the controversial hardliner expected to repeat his defiant stance . he has already vowed not to compromise " one iota " on his country 's nuclear program , especially efforts to master the fuel cycle . quoted by the official news agency irna , national security spokesman hossein entezami said iran was still open to negotiations with the european union - but said it was not ready to discuss research activities at the centre of the current stand-off . " the subject of the negotiations with the europeans is uniquely -lrb- full-scale -rrb- uranium enrichment , and the matter of nuclear research is not a part of that , " he said .
" the decision by iran to carry out research activities is serious . " small-scale enrichment now iran resumed research this week , with the work involving small scale enrichment to test centrifuges .
it insists this is separate from full-scale uranium enrichment , which remains frozen for the time being . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bushehr nuclear power plant in south iran iran says its nuclear program is only directed towards generating electricity and is entirely legal , although the enrichment process can be extended to make atomic bombs . the three main eu powers - britain , france and germany - have for more than two years been trying to convince iran to voluntarily limit its nuclear activities in exchange for trade and other incentives . but iran has consistently refused striking any such deal , and since ahmadinejad 's election win has been progressively been backing away from a temporary freeze on fuel cycle work agreed to in 2003 and again in 2004 . talks next week eu , us , chinese and russian officials are due to hold talks in london on monday , when they are expected to set a date for an emergency meeting of the international atomic energy agency 's 35-nation board of governors . both the eu and the us are now pushing for iran to be referred to the un security council , hoping to back up a series of iaea calls - so far ignored - for tehran to return to a full nuclear freeze . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush at a joint press conference with german chancellor angela merkel " it 's logical that a country which has rejected diplomatic " efforts to end the crisis " be sent to the united nations security council , " us president george w. bush said at a joint press conference with visiting german chancellor angela merkel in washington on friday . if iran obtained nuclear weapons , it would pose " a grave threat to the security of the world , " bush said , recalling how ahmadinejad had called last year for israel to be " wiped off the map . " germany warns against sanctions but so far the west has played down any talk of immediate sanctions or even military action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gernot erler germany 's deputy foreign minister gernot erler told german radio in an interview to be broadcast on sunday that imposing economic sanctions against iran would be a " very dangerous path . " he said he favored imposing travel restrictions on iranian politicians , since they would have " an extraordinarily unpleasant impact . " iran has warned that a referral to the security council would bring serious consequences from its side . " all voluntary means of cooperation " with the iaea would end , foreign minister manouchehr mottaki warned friday . this could entail an end to tougher un inspections of iranian nuclear sites or even result in a resumption of full-scale uranium enrichment . the mounting crisis is affecting the world energy markets : oil futures closed marginally lower friday in line with falls for natural gas , but traders said anxiety remained about the nuclear crisis surrounding iran . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran threatens to halt nuclear cooperation iran threatened on friday to stop cooperating with the un atomic watchdog , including possibly resuming uranium enrichment , if its controversial nuclear program is referred to the un security council .

germany has warned against sanctions . president mahmoud ahmadinejad was due to give a press conference - only his second since his shock election win last june - with the controversial hardliner expected to repeat his defiant stance . he has already vowed not to compromise " one iota " on his country 's nuclear program , especially efforts to master the fuel cycle . quoted by the official news agency irna , national security spokesman hossein entezami said iran was still open to negotiations with the european union - but said it was not ready to discuss research activities at the centre of the current stand-off . " the subject of the negotiations with the europeans is uniquely -lrb- full-scale -rrb- uranium enrichment , and the matter of nuclear research is not a part of that , " he said .

even as germany 's federal intelligence agency denies reports its spies in baghdad helped the us in selecting bombing targets there , jürgen trittin of the opposition green party told dw-world the fog has to be cleared . dw-world : mr trittin do you think it was and is right that the german federal intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- works in iraq ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin , former environment minister and prominent green party member jürgen trittin : it is right that in a situation that leads to such a war , the bnd does n't let the german government - it does n't matter which one - rely alone on information supplied by only one combatant or the other .
that 's why it was also right that members of the secret intelligence agency remained there .
as we know , they were housed in the french embassy - the embassy of a country that displayed a stance similar to germany 's on the iraq war . what do you have to say about the alleged fact that bnd spies did n't just work in iraq , but also supplied information to us troops that helped them to select their bombing targets ? so far there 's only one source for that claim and that 's a member of the american military intelligence community .
the bnd has issued a statement saying that 's not the case .
it seems like a parliamentary enquiry will have to clear up this contradiction .
we are all interested in shedding light on this matter because we ca n't accept that , if it is proved , authorities or even individual members - it does n't matter with whose knowledge - thwarted the political stance of the federal republic of germany on the iraq war by turning into one of the war parties themselves .
i 'm not going to volunteer to weigh the credibility of the different intelligence services against each other .
we have had our experiences with intelligence agencies of the us in the run-up to the iraq war . can you imagine that your own green party , also the party of the former foreign minister joschka fischer , was n't informed about such procedures ? the then-foreign minister -lrb- fischer -rrb- had clearly explained that he was aware that bnd spies stayed in iraq .
that 's right and gets the wholehearted support of the greens .
fischer also made it clear that he was n't aware of activities that the spies had allowed themselves to be dragged into the war .
so , the former foreign minister is also naturally very much in favor of leaving no stone unturned in clearing up the issue . if it turns out that the bnd did work together with the us in iraq , would that be seen as a breaking of the " green " promise to keep germany out of the iraq war ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany refused to be part of the us-led invasion of iraq if that is the case , the bnd would have acted disloyally , not towards a party , but towards the german government which has represented a clear-cut position , nationally as well as internationally , that we consider the war , for one , to be wrong and secondly , that we do n't want to be part of it .
but , as i said , these are speculations and we first want to have facts on the table . there are allegations that the bnd does its own thing because even the parliamentary control commission is n't informed about all its activities .
what do you say to that ? this too has to be examined within the framework of the parliamentary investigation .
what is also true - and also been pointed out by the head of the parliamentary control commission in the past weeks - is that the rights of the board have to be strengthened when it comes to getting access to files and even publishing improper conduct .
that 's apparent even today . the opposition liberal free democrats and the left party are demanding the setting up an investigation committee in parliament .
how do the greens see the move ? the party 's parliamentary leadership has already recommended such an investigation because we do n't see any other way to clear up the matter . the interview was conducted by martin schrader -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the americans want to make clear germany is n't innocent " german intelligence agency expert erich schmidt-eenboom offers his take on the allegations that german secret agents were involved in assessing targets during the us military invasion in iraq .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 14.01.2006 flightless eu constitution going the same way as the dodo ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much like the dodo , the eu constitution is an unwieldly beast being hunted to extinction austria 's hopes of breathing new life into the european constitution have had cold water poured over them after the netherlands announced the treaty was " dead . "
but is the idea really extinct ? dutch foreign minister bernard bot publicly declared what many european leaders had been avoiding saying : that the eu constitution , turned down by dutch and french voters , appears to have gone the way of another extinct object that failed to take flight - the dodo . the dodo was a plump , large bird that could neither run nor fly and which eventually became extinct .
the eu constitution is a massive project that took years to put together - and itself failed to lift off when french and dutch voters said " no " to it last year .
the question remains whether it can survive in some form or not . austria , which took over the eu presidency on january 1 pledged to work on reviving the constitution and vienna announced soon after that it would check with the other 24 eu nations by june on how to orchestrate this . bot pronounces constitution dead for the netherlands bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch minister of foreign affairs bernard bot read the last rites over the constitution .
just a few days after that announcement , austria 's foreign minister ursula plassnik met with her dutch counterpart bernard bot in the hague .
bot promptly snuffed out any hopes of a resurrection by saying the european constitution was dead for the netherlands . bot 's statement came just days after the austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel insisted that the constitution was " in the middle of ratification " and that " the constitution is not dead . " jo leinen , the chairman of the constitutional affairs committee in the european parliament , and the german member of the european parliament , shares austria 's desire for the constitution to be kept alive , but warned against renegotiating the text . " i can ’ t see what 's new that needs to be discussed .
we discussed the constitution for four years .
those who want to open a pandora 's box will get a weaker rather than a better constitution , " leinen said . like german chancellor angela merkel , leinen recommends that the entire constitution be preserved but made more attractive with an added charter on the " social dimension of europe . " leinen sees the eu door shutting if constitution dies this method was successful in saving the maastricht treaty which appeared to be facing almost certain defeat in the 1990 's . nothing is likely to happen before 2007 when the dutch and french both hold elections and get possible changes in leadership which may promote a " yes " vote in new referendums .
leinen says if the constitution does n't go through , no more seats will be made available in the european parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jo leinen sees no more new members if the eu constitution fails .
" rumania and bulgaria … well , they 've been decided on and they will be the last to get in based on the treaty of nice .
but it will be hard for croatia , macedonia and the others .
i think we have a lever here to create some sort of breakthrough , " leinen added . chirac 's " cherry picking " idea could cause further divisions french president jacques chirac suggested that the best parts of the constitution be " cherry-picked . "
that idea , as well as one that countries in favor of the constitution team up and move forward with it , has been overwhelmingly rejected , according to hans-gert pöttering , member of the christian social democrats and leader of the european parliament ’ s largest conservative faction . " we totally reject these ideas that are coming from paris , which promote that states in favor of the constitution form their own separate working group .
we have seen too many psychological divisions in europe in the past , " pöttering said . of the 25 eu member states , 14 have ratified the treaty , including germany .
but there are no guarantees that countries like denmark and the uk will follow .
as the uk 's foreign secretary jack straw said : " the treaty is in limbo .
that is somewhere between heaven and hell .
it is difficult to argue , that it ’ s not dead . " bernd riegert -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : the eu constitution is dead what happens now following the no votes to the eu constitution ?
just push on as if nothing happened , like some eu leaders are demanding ?

the referendums in france and the netherlands on the eu constitution gave citizens a real , if disapproving , voice in the eu 's future .

-lrb- june 7 , 2005 -rrb- austria set to revive eu constitution austria promised monday to inject momentum into the european union during its six-month presidency .

even as germany 's federal intelligence agency denies reports its spies in baghdad helped the us in selecting bombing targets there , jürgen trittin of the opposition green party told dw-world the fog has to be cleared . dw-world : mr trittin do you think it was and is right that the german federal intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- works in iraq ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin , former environment minister and prominent green party member jürgen trittin : it is right that in a situation that leads to such a war , the bnd does n't let the german government - it does n't matter which one - rely alone on information supplied by only one combatant or the other .
that 's why it was also right that members of the secret intelligence agency remained there .
as we know , they were housed in the french embassy - the embassy of a country that displayed a stance similar to germany 's on the iraq war . what do you have to say about the alleged fact that bnd spies did n't just work in iraq , but also supplied information to us troops that helped them to select their bombing targets ? so far there 's only one source for that claim and that 's a member of the american military intelligence community .
the bnd has issued a statement saying that 's not the case .
it seems like a parliamentary enquiry will have to clear up this contradiction .
we are all interested in shedding light on this matter because we ca n't accept that , if it is proved , authorities or even individual members - it does n't matter with whose knowledge - thwarted the political stance of the federal republic of germany on the iraq war by turning into one of the war parties themselves .
i 'm not going to volunteer to weigh the credibility of the different intelligence services against each other .
we have had our experiences with intelligence agencies of the us in the run-up to the iraq war . can you imagine that your own green party , also the party of the former foreign minister joschka fischer , was n't informed about such procedures ? the then-foreign minister -lrb- fischer -rrb- had clearly explained that he was aware that bnd spies stayed in iraq .
that 's right and gets the wholehearted support of the greens .
fischer also made it clear that he was n't aware of activities that the spies had allowed themselves to be dragged into the war .
so , the former foreign minister is also naturally very much in favor of leaving no stone unturned in clearing up the issue . if it turns out that the bnd did work together with the us in iraq , would that be seen as a breaking of the " green " promise to keep germany out of the iraq war ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany refused to be part of the us-led invasion of iraq if that is the case , the bnd would have acted disloyally , not towards a party , but towards the german government which has represented a clear-cut position , nationally as well as internationally , that we consider the war , for one , to be wrong and secondly , that we do n't want to be part of it .
but , as i said , these are speculations and we first want to have facts on the table . there are allegations that the bnd does its own thing because even the parliamentary control commission is n't informed about all its activities .
what do you say to that ? this too has to be examined within the framework of the parliamentary investigation .
what is also true - and also been pointed out by the head of the parliamentary control commission in the past weeks - is that the rights of the board have to be strengthened when it comes to getting access to files and even publishing improper conduct .
that 's apparent even today . the opposition liberal free democrats and the left party are demanding the setting up an investigation committee in parliament .
how do the greens see the move ? the party 's parliamentary leadership has already recommended such an investigation because we do n't see any other way to clear up the matter . the interview was conducted by martin schrader -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the americans want to make clear germany is n't innocent " german intelligence agency expert erich schmidt-eenboom offers his take on the allegations that german secret agents were involved in assessing targets during the us military invasion in iraq .

germany has warned against sanctions . president mahmoud ahmadinejad was due to give a press conference - only his second since his shock election win last june - with the controversial hardliner expected to repeat his defiant stance . he has already vowed not to compromise " one iota " on his country 's nuclear program , especially efforts to master the fuel cycle . quoted by the official news agency irna , national security spokesman hossein entezami said iran was still open to negotiations with the european union - but said it was not ready to discuss research activities at the centre of the current stand-off . " the subject of the negotiations with the europeans is uniquely -lrb- full-scale -rrb- uranium enrichment , and the matter of nuclear research is not a part of that , " he said .
" the decision by iran to carry out research activities is serious . " small-scale enrichment now iran resumed research this week , with the work involving small scale enrichment to test centrifuges .
it insists this is separate from full-scale uranium enrichment , which remains frozen for the time being . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bushehr nuclear power plant in south iran iran says its nuclear program is only directed towards generating electricity and is entirely legal , although the enrichment process can be extended to make atomic bombs . the three main eu powers - britain , france and germany - have for more than two years been trying to convince iran to voluntarily limit its nuclear activities in exchange for trade and other incentives . but iran has consistently refused striking any such deal , and since ahmadinejad 's election win has been progressively been backing away from a temporary freeze on fuel cycle work agreed to in 2003 and again in 2004 . talks next week eu , us , chinese and russian officials are due to hold talks in london on monday , when they are expected to set a date for an emergency meeting of the international atomic energy agency 's 35-nation board of governors . both the eu and the us are now pushing for iran to be referred to the un security council , hoping to back up a series of iaea calls - so far ignored - for tehran to return to a full nuclear freeze . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush at a joint press conference with german chancellor angela merkel " it 's logical that a country which has rejected diplomatic " efforts to end the crisis " be sent to the united nations security council , " us president george w. bush said at a joint press conference with visiting german chancellor angela merkel in washington on friday . if iran obtained nuclear weapons , it would pose " a grave threat to the security of the world , " bush said , recalling how ahmadinejad had called last year for israel to be " wiped off the map . " germany warns against sanctions but so far the west has played down any talk of immediate sanctions or even military action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gernot erler germany 's deputy foreign minister gernot erler told german radio in an interview to be broadcast on sunday that imposing economic sanctions against iran would be a " very dangerous path . " he said he favored imposing travel restrictions on iranian politicians , since they would have " an extraordinarily unpleasant impact . " iran has warned that a referral to the security council would bring serious consequences from its side . " all voluntary means of cooperation " with the iaea would end , foreign minister manouchehr mottaki warned friday . this could entail an end to tougher un inspections of iranian nuclear sites or even result in a resumption of full-scale uranium enrichment . the mounting crisis is affecting the world energy markets : oil futures closed marginally lower friday in line with falls for natural gas , but traders said anxiety remained about the nuclear crisis surrounding iran . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran threatens to halt nuclear cooperation iran threatened on friday to stop cooperating with the un atomic watchdog , including possibly resuming uranium enrichment , if its controversial nuclear program is referred to the un security council .

even as germany 's federal intelligence agency denies reports its spies in baghdad helped the us in selecting bombing targets there , jürgen trittin of the opposition green party told dw-world the fog has to be cleared . dw-world : mr trittin do you think it was and is right that the german federal intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- works in iraq ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin , former environment minister and prominent green party member jürgen trittin : it is right that in a situation that leads to such a war , the bnd does n't let the german government - it does n't matter which one - rely alone on information supplied by only one combatant or the other .
that 's why it was also right that members of the secret intelligence agency remained there .
as we know , they were housed in the french embassy - the embassy of a country that displayed a stance similar to germany 's on the iraq war . what do you have to say about the alleged fact that bnd spies did n't just work in iraq , but also supplied information to us troops that helped them to select their bombing targets ? so far there 's only one source for that claim and that 's a member of the american military intelligence community .
the bnd has issued a statement saying that 's not the case .
it seems like a parliamentary enquiry will have to clear up this contradiction .
we are all interested in shedding light on this matter because we ca n't accept that , if it is proved , authorities or even individual members - it does n't matter with whose knowledge - thwarted the political stance of the federal republic of germany on the iraq war by turning into one of the war parties themselves .
i 'm not going to volunteer to weigh the credibility of the different intelligence services against each other .
we have had our experiences with intelligence agencies of the us in the run-up to the iraq war . can you imagine that your own green party , also the party of the former foreign minister joschka fischer , was n't informed about such procedures ? the then-foreign minister -lrb- fischer -rrb- had clearly explained that he was aware that bnd spies stayed in iraq .
that 's right and gets the wholehearted support of the greens .
fischer also made it clear that he was n't aware of activities that the spies had allowed themselves to be dragged into the war .
so , the former foreign minister is also naturally very much in favor of leaving no stone unturned in clearing up the issue . if it turns out that the bnd did work together with the us in iraq , would that be seen as a breaking of the " green " promise to keep germany out of the iraq war ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany refused to be part of the us-led invasion of iraq if that is the case , the bnd would have acted disloyally , not towards a party , but towards the german government which has represented a clear-cut position , nationally as well as internationally , that we consider the war , for one , to be wrong and secondly , that we do n't want to be part of it .
but , as i said , these are speculations and we first want to have facts on the table . there are allegations that the bnd does its own thing because even the parliamentary control commission is n't informed about all its activities .
what do you say to that ? this too has to be examined within the framework of the parliamentary investigation .
what is also true - and also been pointed out by the head of the parliamentary control commission in the past weeks - is that the rights of the board have to be strengthened when it comes to getting access to files and even publishing improper conduct .
that 's apparent even today . the opposition liberal free democrats and the left party are demanding the setting up an investigation committee in parliament .
how do the greens see the move ? the party 's parliamentary leadership has already recommended such an investigation because we do n't see any other way to clear up the matter . the interview was conducted by martin schrader -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the americans want to make clear germany is n't innocent " german intelligence agency expert erich schmidt-eenboom offers his take on the allegations that german secret agents were involved in assessing targets during the us military invasion in iraq .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 14.01.2006 flightless eu constitution going the same way as the dodo ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much like the dodo , the eu constitution is an unwieldly beast being hunted to extinction austria 's hopes of breathing new life into the european constitution have had cold water poured over them after the netherlands announced the treaty was " dead . "
but is the idea really extinct ? dutch foreign minister bernard bot publicly declared what many european leaders had been avoiding saying : that the eu constitution , turned down by dutch and french voters , appears to have gone the way of another extinct object that failed to take flight - the dodo . the dodo was a plump , large bird that could neither run nor fly and which eventually became extinct .
the eu constitution is a massive project that took years to put together - and itself failed to lift off when french and dutch voters said " no " to it last year .
the question remains whether it can survive in some form or not . austria , which took over the eu presidency on january 1 pledged to work on reviving the constitution and vienna announced soon after that it would check with the other 24 eu nations by june on how to orchestrate this . bot pronounces constitution dead for the netherlands bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch minister of foreign affairs bernard bot read the last rites over the constitution .
just a few days after that announcement , austria 's foreign minister ursula plassnik met with her dutch counterpart bernard bot in the hague .
bot promptly snuffed out any hopes of a resurrection by saying the european constitution was dead for the netherlands . bot 's statement came just days after the austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel insisted that the constitution was " in the middle of ratification " and that " the constitution is not dead . " jo leinen , the chairman of the constitutional affairs committee in the european parliament , and the german member of the european parliament , shares austria 's desire for the constitution to be kept alive , but warned against renegotiating the text . " i can ’ t see what 's new that needs to be discussed .
we discussed the constitution for four years .
those who want to open a pandora 's box will get a weaker rather than a better constitution , " leinen said . like german chancellor angela merkel , leinen recommends that the entire constitution be preserved but made more attractive with an added charter on the " social dimension of europe . " leinen sees the eu door shutting if constitution dies this method was successful in saving the maastricht treaty which appeared to be facing almost certain defeat in the 1990 's . nothing is likely to happen before 2007 when the dutch and french both hold elections and get possible changes in leadership which may promote a " yes " vote in new referendums .
leinen says if the constitution does n't go through , no more seats will be made available in the european parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jo leinen sees no more new members if the eu constitution fails .
" rumania and bulgaria … well , they 've been decided on and they will be the last to get in based on the treaty of nice .
but it will be hard for croatia , macedonia and the others .
i think we have a lever here to create some sort of breakthrough , " leinen added . chirac 's " cherry picking " idea could cause further divisions french president jacques chirac suggested that the best parts of the constitution be " cherry-picked . "
that idea , as well as one that countries in favor of the constitution team up and move forward with it , has been overwhelmingly rejected , according to hans-gert pöttering , member of the christian social democrats and leader of the european parliament ’ s largest conservative faction . " we totally reject these ideas that are coming from paris , which promote that states in favor of the constitution form their own separate working group .
we have seen too many psychological divisions in europe in the past , " pöttering said . of the 25 eu member states , 14 have ratified the treaty , including germany .
but there are no guarantees that countries like denmark and the uk will follow .
as the uk 's foreign secretary jack straw said : " the treaty is in limbo .
that is somewhere between heaven and hell .
it is difficult to argue , that it ’ s not dead . " bernd riegert -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : the eu constitution is dead what happens now following the no votes to the eu constitution ?
just push on as if nothing happened , like some eu leaders are demanding ?

the referendums in france and the netherlands on the eu constitution gave citizens a real , if disapproving , voice in the eu 's future .

but is the idea really extinct ? dutch foreign minister bernard bot publicly declared what many european leaders had been avoiding saying : that the eu constitution , turned down by dutch and french voters , appears to have gone the way of another extinct object that failed to take flight - the dodo . the dodo was a plump , large bird that could neither run nor fly and which eventually became extinct .
the eu constitution is a massive project that took years to put together - and itself failed to lift off when french and dutch voters said " no " to it last year .
the question remains whether it can survive in some form or not . austria , which took over the eu presidency on january 1 pledged to work on reviving the constitution and vienna announced soon after that it would check with the other 24 eu nations by june on how to orchestrate this . bot pronounces constitution dead for the netherlands bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch minister of foreign affairs bernard bot read the last rites over the constitution .
just a few days after that announcement , austria 's foreign minister ursula plassnik met with her dutch counterpart bernard bot in the hague .
bot promptly snuffed out any hopes of a resurrection by saying the european constitution was dead for the netherlands . bot 's statement came just days after the austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel insisted that the constitution was " in the middle of ratification " and that " the constitution is not dead . " jo leinen , the chairman of the constitutional affairs committee in the european parliament , and the german member of the european parliament , shares austria 's desire for the constitution to be kept alive , but warned against renegotiating the text . " i can ’ t see what 's new that needs to be discussed .
we discussed the constitution for four years .
those who want to open a pandora 's box will get a weaker rather than a better constitution , " leinen said . like german chancellor angela merkel , leinen recommends that the entire constitution be preserved but made more attractive with an added charter on the " social dimension of europe . " leinen sees the eu door shutting if constitution dies this method was successful in saving the maastricht treaty which appeared to be facing almost certain defeat in the 1990 's . nothing is likely to happen before 2007 when the dutch and french both hold elections and get possible changes in leadership which may promote a " yes " vote in new referendums .

brian pickering talked to senator dan coats , the former us ambassador to germany , about german chancellor angela merkel 's talks with us president george w. bush . during her first visit to the united states since becoming german chancellor , angela merkel held talks with president george w. bush on friday on a wide range of issues .
the two leaders differed on guantanamo bay but vowed to seek a common approach on iran as they opened a new chapter in us-german relations .
president bush 's relationship with merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder , was often stormy because of schröder 's opposition to the us-led invasion of iraq . deutsche welle : senator coats , do you have the impression that germany and the united states countries have made progress in overcoming their differences and moving closer together again ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former us ambassador to germany daniel r. coats dan coats : very much so , this clearly was an indication by both chancellor merkel and the president that they want to open a new chapter in our relationship .
it 's going to be a return to a much more harmonious and united effort to deal with some of the major challenges and i think to respect each others differences in terms of some of the areas where we might not have total agreement .
but it 's clear that the president and chancellor merkel established a very good start . how would you describe the personal chemistry between the two ?
did they hit it off ? i think they clearly hit it off .
i think there is personal chemistry there .
the president referenced it when he said he was touched by the chancellor 's discussion about her upbringing in east germany and her appreciation for freedom from someone coming from a place where that freedom was not available .
i was at a dinner with chancellor merkel where she talked about this also .
i think the most important point that was made and had an impact on those who attended the dinner was that understanding that she had lived in isolation in east germany and of course the incredible rise to become the first woman chancellor of germany .
i think that 's something the president very much appreciated and he clearly wants to establish a working relationship and a good personal relationship with the new chancellor . ms. merkel is still prepared to criticize the united states and only last weekend she raised a few eyebrows in germany by saying that the guantanamo prison camp should not continued to operate indefinitely .
what was the president 's reaction to that criticism ? well , i think his reaction was the appropriate reaction .
that was that one he hopes for understanding in terms of the terrorist threat that exists and the implications of that for a free society .
so i think we 're going to see a president who is responsive to criticism because particularly he knows it is well-meant criticism .
it is criticism of a friend and ally as opposed to someone that may be using for political purposes or simply to gain political favor at home by making negative comments about the united states . at the moment it 's iran and not iraq that 's the focus of world attention .
germany is one of the three eu countries that have called for iran to be referred to the un security council over its decision to resume its nuclear program .
is there broad agreement between the united states and the eu on what action should be taken against iran ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations security council there clearly is broad agreement that has been obtained over the last couple of years as the eu has attempted to use diplomacy and negotiations to seek a favorable resolution to this .
clearly there is now agreement that this should be taken to the un security council and should move to the next step .
now what specific action the security council takes is something that has to be discussed and negotiated .
sanctions , if they are imposed , what kind of support we can get from other nations like china , india and russia to form a united front .
i think all of these still have to be decided .
but we 've taken a very important step forward in saying our best efforts , the eu-3 's best efforts over the past year and a half have not met with success and it is time to up the pressure on iran to take a much more sensible course of action . are ordinary americans taking an interest in ms. merkel 's visit to the us ? yes , they are .
ordinary americans are , i think , grateful and relieved , that the situation has changed , that we have a president now who is saying warm things about this new chancellor and has a willingness not only to reach out and work with the chancellor but to reach out and work with the german people in trying to address these international problems that affect both of us . dw-radio 's brian pickering interviewed dan coats send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush and merkel hail new chapter in us-german relations german chancellor angela merkel emerged from talks with president george w. bush in washington friday to say that us-german relations were back on track and that they shared common ground on many issues , including iran .

the president referenced it when he said he was touched by the chancellor 's discussion about her upbringing in east germany and her appreciation for freedom from someone coming from a place where that freedom was not available .
i was at a dinner with chancellor merkel where she talked about this also .
i think the most important point that was made and had an impact on those who attended the dinner was that understanding that she had lived in isolation in east germany and of course the incredible rise to become the first woman chancellor of germany .
i think that 's something the president very much appreciated and he clearly wants to establish a working relationship and a good personal relationship with the new chancellor . ms. merkel is still prepared to criticize the united states and only last weekend she raised a few eyebrows in germany by saying that the guantanamo prison camp should not continued to operate indefinitely .
what was the president 's reaction to that criticism ? well , i think his reaction was the appropriate reaction .
that was that one he hopes for understanding in terms of the terrorist threat that exists and the implications of that for a free society .
so i think we 're going to see a president who is responsive to criticism because particularly he knows it is well-meant criticism .

brian pickering talked to senator dan coats , the former us ambassador to germany , about german chancellor angela merkel 's talks with us president george w. bush . during her first visit to the united states since becoming german chancellor , angela merkel held talks with president george w. bush on friday on a wide range of issues .
the two leaders differed on guantanamo bay but vowed to seek a common approach on iran as they opened a new chapter in us-german relations .
president bush 's relationship with merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder , was often stormy because of schröder 's opposition to the us-led invasion of iraq . deutsche welle : senator coats , do you have the impression that germany and the united states countries have made progress in overcoming their differences and moving closer together again ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former us ambassador to germany daniel r. coats dan coats : very much so , this clearly was an indication by both chancellor merkel and the president that they want to open a new chapter in our relationship .

now that the world cup opening extravaganza in berlin has been given the boot , politicians are clambering for some kind of replacement show .
but fifa is n't interested . the announcement by the world soccer governing body fifa that the planned opening extravaganza by star director andre heller would not take place struck like a bolt of lightning on a sunny day in berlin .
the city 's mayor , klaus wowereit , scrambled quickly after being knocked down by the fifa blow . he said he would try to persuade fifa to allow an alternative show at the brandenburg gate , a location better known for its new year 's celebrations , the love parade and naturally the emotional scenes of the reunification in 1989 .
it seems less than the ideal spot for soccer fans to gather in the direct run-up to the world cup , far away from the olympic stadium , where the world cup final will take place . but now fifa very much wants to distance itself from any kind of opening ceremony .

the organizers of the month-long tournament , led by former soccer star franz beckenbauer , are hoping for a world cup that would make all others pale in comparison .
yet months before the first german goal is scored , the spd politician said that grave mistakes have already been made . why not move it to munich ? while some berlin officials seethe , others have floated the idea of moving the gala to munich , where the opening match will be played on june 9 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the brandenburg gate was the venue for wild parties like the now-defunct love parade ernst hinsken , the chair of the parliamentary tourism committee and also from bavaria , said that munich has the facilities to do it .

" the concept would have to be watered down a little bit -lrb- for munich -rrb- but then it would work . " the idea is not without its merits .
thousands of fans would be spared having to make the trek from berlin to munich said hinsken .

germany has warned against sanctions . president mahmoud ahmadinejad was due to give a press conference - only his second since his shock election win last june - with the controversial hardliner expected to repeat his defiant stance . he has already vowed not to compromise " one iota " on his country 's nuclear program , especially efforts to master the fuel cycle . quoted by the official news agency irna , national security spokesman hossein entezami said iran was still open to negotiations with the european union - but said it was not ready to discuss research activities at the centre of the current stand-off . " the subject of the negotiations with the europeans is uniquely -lrb- full-scale -rrb- uranium enrichment , and the matter of nuclear research is not a part of that , " he said .
" the decision by iran to carry out research activities is serious . " small-scale enrichment now iran resumed research this week , with the work involving small scale enrichment to test centrifuges .
it insists this is separate from full-scale uranium enrichment , which remains frozen for the time being . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bushehr nuclear power plant in south iran iran says its nuclear program is only directed towards generating electricity and is entirely legal , although the enrichment process can be extended to make atomic bombs . the three main eu powers - britain , france and germany - have for more than two years been trying to convince iran to voluntarily limit its nuclear activities in exchange for trade and other incentives . but iran has consistently refused striking any such deal , and since ahmadinejad 's election win has been progressively been backing away from a temporary freeze on fuel cycle work agreed to in 2003 and again in 2004 . talks next week eu , us , chinese and russian officials are due to hold talks in london on monday , when they are expected to set a date for an emergency meeting of the international atomic energy agency 's 35-nation board of governors . both the eu and the us are now pushing for iran to be referred to the un security council , hoping to back up a series of iaea calls - so far ignored - for tehran to return to a full nuclear freeze . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush at a joint press conference with german chancellor angela merkel " it 's logical that a country which has rejected diplomatic " efforts to end the crisis " be sent to the united nations security council , " us president george w. bush said at a joint press conference with visiting german chancellor angela merkel in washington on friday . if iran obtained nuclear weapons , it would pose " a grave threat to the security of the world , " bush said , recalling how ahmadinejad had called last year for israel to be " wiped off the map . " germany warns against sanctions but so far the west has played down any talk of immediate sanctions or even military action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gernot erler germany 's deputy foreign minister gernot erler told german radio in an interview to be broadcast on sunday that imposing economic sanctions against iran would be a " very dangerous path . " he said he favored imposing travel restrictions on iranian politicians , since they would have " an extraordinarily unpleasant impact . " iran has warned that a referral to the security council would bring serious consequences from its side . " all voluntary means of cooperation " with the iaea would end , foreign minister manouchehr mottaki warned friday . this could entail an end to tougher un inspections of iranian nuclear sites or even result in a resumption of full-scale uranium enrichment . the mounting crisis is affecting the world energy markets : oil futures closed marginally lower friday in line with falls for natural gas , but traders said anxiety remained about the nuclear crisis surrounding iran . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran threatens to halt nuclear cooperation iran threatened on friday to stop cooperating with the un atomic watchdog , including possibly resuming uranium enrichment , if its controversial nuclear program is referred to the un security council .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.01.2006 " we have to shed light on the issue " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much of a role did germany 's federal intelligence agency play in iraq ?
even as germany 's federal intelligence agency denies reports its spies in baghdad helped the us in selecting bombing targets there , jürgen trittin of the opposition green party told dw-world the fog has to be cleared . dw-world : mr trittin do you think it was and is right that the german federal intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- works in iraq ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin , former environment minister and prominent green party member jürgen trittin : it is right that in a situation that leads to such a war , the bnd does n't let the german government - it does n't matter which one - rely alone on information supplied by only one combatant or the other .
that 's why it was also right that members of the secret intelligence agency remained there .
as we know , they were housed in the french embassy - the embassy of a country that displayed a stance similar to germany 's on the iraq war . what do you have to say about the alleged fact that bnd spies did n't just work in iraq , but also supplied information to us troops that helped them to select their bombing targets ? so far there 's only one source for that claim and that 's a member of the american military intelligence community .
the bnd has issued a statement saying that 's not the case .
it seems like a parliamentary enquiry will have to clear up this contradiction .
we are all interested in shedding light on this matter because we ca n't accept that , if it is proved , authorities or even individual members - it does n't matter with whose knowledge - thwarted the political stance of the federal republic of germany on the iraq war by turning into one of the war parties themselves .
i 'm not going to volunteer to weigh the credibility of the different intelligence services against each other .
we have had our experiences with intelligence agencies of the us in the run-up to the iraq war . can you imagine that your own green party , also the party of the former foreign minister joschka fischer , was n't informed about such procedures ? the then-foreign minister -lrb- fischer -rrb- had clearly explained that he was aware that bnd spies stayed in iraq .
that 's right and gets the wholehearted support of the greens .
fischer also made it clear that he was n't aware of activities that the spies had allowed themselves to be dragged into the war .
so , the former foreign minister is also naturally very much in favor of leaving no stone unturned in clearing up the issue . if it turns out that the bnd did work together with the us in iraq , would that be seen as a breaking of the " green " promise to keep germany out of the iraq war ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany refused to be part of the us-led invasion of iraq if that is the case , the bnd would have acted disloyally , not towards a party , but towards the german government which has represented a clear-cut position , nationally as well as internationally , that we consider the war , for one , to be wrong and secondly , that we do n't want to be part of it .
but , as i said , these are speculations and we first want to have facts on the table . there are allegations that the bnd does its own thing because even the parliamentary control commission is n't informed about all its activities .
what do you say to that ? this too has to be examined within the framework of the parliamentary investigation .
what is also true - and also been pointed out by the head of the parliamentary control commission in the past weeks - is that the rights of the board have to be strengthened when it comes to getting access to files and even publishing improper conduct .
that 's apparent even today . the opposition liberal free democrats and the left party are demanding the setting up an investigation committee in parliament .
how do the greens see the move ? the party 's parliamentary leadership has already recommended such an investigation because we do n't see any other way to clear up the matter . the interview was conducted by martin schrader -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the americans want to make clear germany is n't innocent " german intelligence agency expert erich schmidt-eenboom offers his take on the allegations that german secret agents were involved in assessing targets during the us military invasion in iraq .

but is the idea really extinct ? dutch foreign minister bernard bot publicly declared what many european leaders had been avoiding saying : that the eu constitution , turned down by dutch and french voters , appears to have gone the way of another extinct object that failed to take flight - the dodo . the dodo was a plump , large bird that could neither run nor fly and which eventually became extinct .
the eu constitution is a massive project that took years to put together - and itself failed to lift off when french and dutch voters said " no " to it last year .
the question remains whether it can survive in some form or not . austria , which took over the eu presidency on january 1 pledged to work on reviving the constitution and vienna announced soon after that it would check with the other 24 eu nations by june on how to orchestrate this . bot pronounces constitution dead for the netherlands bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch minister of foreign affairs bernard bot read the last rites over the constitution .
just a few days after that announcement , austria 's foreign minister ursula plassnik met with her dutch counterpart bernard bot in the hague .
bot promptly snuffed out any hopes of a resurrection by saying the european constitution was dead for the netherlands . bot 's statement came just days after the austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel insisted that the constitution was " in the middle of ratification " and that " the constitution is not dead . " jo leinen , the chairman of the constitutional affairs committee in the european parliament , and the german member of the european parliament , shares austria 's desire for the constitution to be kept alive , but warned against renegotiating the text . " i can ’ t see what 's new that needs to be discussed .
we discussed the constitution for four years .
those who want to open a pandora 's box will get a weaker rather than a better constitution , " leinen said . like german chancellor angela merkel , leinen recommends that the entire constitution be preserved but made more attractive with an added charter on the " social dimension of europe . " leinen sees the eu door shutting if constitution dies this method was successful in saving the maastricht treaty which appeared to be facing almost certain defeat in the 1990 's . nothing is likely to happen before 2007 when the dutch and french both hold elections and get possible changes in leadership which may promote a " yes " vote in new referendums .
leinen says if the constitution does n't go through , no more seats will be made available in the european parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jo leinen sees no more new members if the eu constitution fails .
" rumania and bulgaria … well , they 've been decided on and they will be the last to get in based on the treaty of nice .
but it will be hard for croatia , macedonia and the others .
i think we have a lever here to create some sort of breakthrough , " leinen added . chirac 's " cherry picking " idea could cause further divisions french president jacques chirac suggested that the best parts of the constitution be " cherry-picked . "
that idea , as well as one that countries in favor of the constitution team up and move forward with it , has been overwhelmingly rejected , according to hans-gert pöttering , member of the christian social democrats and leader of the european parliament ’ s largest conservative faction . " we totally reject these ideas that are coming from paris , which promote that states in favor of the constitution form their own separate working group .
we have seen too many psychological divisions in europe in the past , " pöttering said . of the 25 eu member states , 14 have ratified the treaty , including germany .
but there are no guarantees that countries like denmark and the uk will follow .
as the uk 's foreign secretary jack straw said : " the treaty is in limbo .
that is somewhere between heaven and hell .
it is difficult to argue , that it ’ s not dead . " bernd riegert -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : the eu constitution is dead what happens now following the no votes to the eu constitution ?
just push on as if nothing happened , like some eu leaders are demanding ?
maybe some breathing space for the eu to take stock of itself would be better .

the referendums in france and the netherlands on the eu constitution gave citizens a real , if disapproving , voice in the eu 's future .

now that the world cup opening extravaganza in berlin has been given the boot , politicians are clambering for some kind of replacement show .
but fifa is n't interested . the announcement by the world soccer governing body fifa that the planned opening extravaganza by star director andre heller would not take place struck like a bolt of lightning on a sunny day in berlin .
the city 's mayor , klaus wowereit , scrambled quickly after being knocked down by the fifa blow . he said he would try to persuade fifa to allow an alternative show at the brandenburg gate , a location better known for its new year 's celebrations , the love parade and naturally the emotional scenes of the reunification in 1989 .
it seems less than the ideal spot for soccer fans to gather in the direct run-up to the world cup , far away from the olympic stadium , where the world cup final will take place . but now fifa very much wants to distance itself from any kind of opening ceremony . " the gala will not be replaced , " said the soccer body 's director of communications markus siegler . fifa incurring germany 's wrath bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andre heller -lrb- r -rrb- said fifa 's cancellation of his extravaganza would not come " cheap " the matter is leaving a bitter taste in public officials ' mouths .

the organizers of the month-long tournament , led by former soccer star franz beckenbauer , are hoping for a world cup that would make all others pale in comparison .
yet months before the first german goal is scored , the spd politician said that grave mistakes have already been made . why not move it to munich ? while some berlin officials seethe , others have floated the idea of moving the gala to munich , where the opening match will be played on june 9 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the brandenburg gate was the venue for wild parties like the now-defunct love parade ernst hinsken , the chair of the parliamentary tourism committee and also from bavaria , said that munich has the facilities to do it .

now that the world cup opening extravaganza in berlin has been given the boot , politicians are clambering for some kind of replacement show .
but fifa is n't interested . the announcement by the world soccer governing body fifa that the planned opening extravaganza by star director andre heller would not take place struck like a bolt of lightning on a sunny day in berlin .
the city 's mayor , klaus wowereit , scrambled quickly after being knocked down by the fifa blow . he said he would try to persuade fifa to allow an alternative show at the brandenburg gate , a location better known for its new year 's celebrations , the love parade and naturally the emotional scenes of the reunification in 1989 .
it seems less than the ideal spot for soccer fans to gather in the direct run-up to the world cup , far away from the olympic stadium , where the world cup final will take place . but now fifa very much wants to distance itself from any kind of opening ceremony .

the organizers of the month-long tournament , led by former soccer star franz beckenbauer , are hoping for a world cup that would make all others pale in comparison .
yet months before the first german goal is scored , the spd politician said that grave mistakes have already been made . why not move it to munich ? while some berlin officials seethe , others have floated the idea of moving the gala to munich , where the opening match will be played on june 9 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the brandenburg gate was the venue for wild parties like the now-defunct love parade ernst hinsken , the chair of the parliamentary tourism committee and also from bavaria , said that munich has the facilities to do it .

brian pickering talked to senator dan coats , the former us ambassador to germany , about german chancellor angela merkel 's talks with us president george w. bush . during her first visit to the united states since becoming german chancellor , angela merkel held talks with president george w. bush on friday on a wide range of issues .
the two leaders differed on guantanamo bay but vowed to seek a common approach on iran as they opened a new chapter in us-german relations .
president bush 's relationship with merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder , was often stormy because of schröder 's opposition to the us-led invasion of iraq . deutsche welle : senator coats , do you have the impression that germany and the united states countries have made progress in overcoming their differences and moving closer together again ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former us ambassador to germany daniel r. coats dan coats : very much so , this clearly was an indication by both chancellor merkel and the president that they want to open a new chapter in our relationship .
it 's going to be a return to a much more harmonious and united effort to deal with some of the major challenges and i think to respect each others differences in terms of some of the areas where we might not have total agreement .
but it 's clear that the president and chancellor merkel established a very good start . how would you describe the personal chemistry between the two ?
did they hit it off ? i think they clearly hit it off .
i think there is personal chemistry there .
the president referenced it when he said he was touched by the chancellor 's discussion about her upbringing in east germany and her appreciation for freedom from someone coming from a place where that freedom was not available .
i was at a dinner with chancellor merkel where she talked about this also .
i think the most important point that was made and had an impact on those who attended the dinner was that understanding that she had lived in isolation in east germany and of course the incredible rise to become the first woman chancellor of germany .
i think that 's something the president very much appreciated and he clearly wants to establish a working relationship and a good personal relationship with the new chancellor . ms. merkel is still prepared to criticize the united states and only last weekend she raised a few eyebrows in germany by saying that the guantanamo prison camp should not continued to operate indefinitely .
what was the president 's reaction to that criticism ? well , i think his reaction was the appropriate reaction .
that was that one he hopes for understanding in terms of the terrorist threat that exists and the implications of that for a free society .
so i think we 're going to see a president who is responsive to criticism because particularly he knows it is well-meant criticism .
it is criticism of a friend and ally as opposed to someone that may be using for political purposes or simply to gain political favor at home by making negative comments about the united states . at the moment it 's iran and not iraq that 's the focus of world attention .
germany is one of the three eu countries that have called for iran to be referred to the un security council over its decision to resume its nuclear program .
is there broad agreement between the united states and the eu on what action should be taken against iran ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations security council there clearly is broad agreement that has been obtained over the last couple of years as the eu has attempted to use diplomacy and negotiations to seek a favorable resolution to this .
clearly there is now agreement that this should be taken to the un security council and should move to the next step .
now what specific action the security council takes is something that has to be discussed and negotiated .
sanctions , if they are imposed , what kind of support we can get from other nations like china , india and russia to form a united front .
i think all of these still have to be decided .
but we 've taken a very important step forward in saying our best efforts , the eu-3 's best efforts over the past year and a half have not met with success and it is time to up the pressure on iran to take a much more sensible course of action . are ordinary americans taking an interest in ms. merkel 's visit to the us ? yes , they are .
ordinary americans are , i think , grateful and relieved , that the situation has changed , that we have a president now who is saying warm things about this new chancellor and has a willingness not only to reach out and work with the chancellor but to reach out and work with the german people in trying to address these international problems that affect both of us . dw-radio 's brian pickering interviewed dan coats send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush and merkel hail new chapter in us-german relations german chancellor angela merkel emerged from talks with president george w. bush in washington friday to say that us-german relations were back on track and that they shared common ground on many issues , including iran .

brian pickering talked to senator dan coats , the former us ambassador to germany , about german chancellor angela merkel 's talks with us president george w. bush . during her first visit to the united states since becoming german chancellor , angela merkel held talks with president george w. bush on friday on a wide range of issues .
the two leaders differed on guantanamo bay but vowed to seek a common approach on iran as they opened a new chapter in us-german relations .
president bush 's relationship with merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder , was often stormy because of schröder 's opposition to the us-led invasion of iraq . deutsche welle : senator coats , do you have the impression that germany and the united states countries have made progress in overcoming their differences and moving closer together again ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former us ambassador to germany daniel r. coats dan coats : very much so , this clearly was an indication by both chancellor merkel and the president that they want to open a new chapter in our relationship .
it 's going to be a return to a much more harmonious and united effort to deal with some of the major challenges and i think to respect each others differences in terms of some of the areas where we might not have total agreement .
but it 's clear that the president and chancellor merkel established a very good start . how would you describe the personal chemistry between the two ?
did they hit it off ? i think they clearly hit it off .
i think there is personal chemistry there .
the president referenced it when he said he was touched by the chancellor 's discussion about her upbringing in east germany and her appreciation for freedom from someone coming from a place where that freedom was not available .
i was at a dinner with chancellor merkel where she talked about this also .
i think the most important point that was made and had an impact on those who attended the dinner was that understanding that she had lived in isolation in east germany and of course the incredible rise to become the first woman chancellor of germany .
i think that 's something the president very much appreciated and he clearly wants to establish a working relationship and a good personal relationship with the new chancellor . ms. merkel is still prepared to criticize the united states and only last weekend she raised a few eyebrows in germany by saying that the guantanamo prison camp should not continued to operate indefinitely .
what was the president 's reaction to that criticism ? well , i think his reaction was the appropriate reaction .
that was that one he hopes for understanding in terms of the terrorist threat that exists and the implications of that for a free society .
so i think we 're going to see a president who is responsive to criticism because particularly he knows it is well-meant criticism .
it is criticism of a friend and ally as opposed to someone that may be using for political purposes or simply to gain political favor at home by making negative comments about the united states . at the moment it 's iran and not iraq that 's the focus of world attention .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.01.2006 " we have to shed light on the issue " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much of a role did germany 's federal intelligence agency play in iraq ?
even as germany 's federal intelligence agency denies reports its spies in baghdad helped the us in selecting bombing targets there , jürgen trittin of the opposition green party told dw-world the fog has to be cleared . dw-world : mr trittin do you think it was and is right that the german federal intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- works in iraq ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin , former environment minister and prominent green party member jürgen trittin : it is right that in a situation that leads to such a war , the bnd does n't let the german government - it does n't matter which one - rely alone on information supplied by only one combatant or the other .
that 's why it was also right that members of the secret intelligence agency remained there .
as we know , they were housed in the french embassy - the embassy of a country that displayed a stance similar to germany 's on the iraq war . what do you have to say about the alleged fact that bnd spies did n't just work in iraq , but also supplied information to us troops that helped them to select their bombing targets ? so far there 's only one source for that claim and that 's a member of the american military intelligence community .
the bnd has issued a statement saying that 's not the case .
it seems like a parliamentary enquiry will have to clear up this contradiction .
we are all interested in shedding light on this matter because we ca n't accept that , if it is proved , authorities or even individual members - it does n't matter with whose knowledge - thwarted the political stance of the federal republic of germany on the iraq war by turning into one of the war parties themselves .
i 'm not going to volunteer to weigh the credibility of the different intelligence services against each other .
we have had our experiences with intelligence agencies of the us in the run-up to the iraq war . can you imagine that your own green party , also the party of the former foreign minister joschka fischer , was n't informed about such procedures ? the then-foreign minister -lrb- fischer -rrb- had clearly explained that he was aware that bnd spies stayed in iraq .
that 's right and gets the wholehearted support of the greens .
fischer also made it clear that he was n't aware of activities that the spies had allowed themselves to be dragged into the war .
so , the former foreign minister is also naturally very much in favor of leaving no stone unturned in clearing up the issue . if it turns out that the bnd did work together with the us in iraq , would that be seen as a breaking of the " green " promise to keep germany out of the iraq war ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany refused to be part of the us-led invasion of iraq if that is the case , the bnd would have acted disloyally , not towards a party , but towards the german government which has represented a clear-cut position , nationally as well as internationally , that we consider the war , for one , to be wrong and secondly , that we do n't want to be part of it .
but , as i said , these are speculations and we first want to have facts on the table . there are allegations that the bnd does its own thing because even the parliamentary control commission is n't informed about all its activities .
what do you say to that ? this too has to be examined within the framework of the parliamentary investigation .
what is also true - and also been pointed out by the head of the parliamentary control commission in the past weeks - is that the rights of the board have to be strengthened when it comes to getting access to files and even publishing improper conduct .
that 's apparent even today . the opposition liberal free democrats and the left party are demanding the setting up an investigation committee in parliament .
how do the greens see the move ? the party 's parliamentary leadership has already recommended such an investigation because we do n't see any other way to clear up the matter . the interview was conducted by martin schrader -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the americans want to make clear germany is n't innocent " german intelligence agency expert erich schmidt-eenboom offers his take on the allegations that german secret agents were involved in assessing targets during the us military invasion in iraq .

even as germany 's federal intelligence agency denies reports its spies in baghdad helped the us in selecting bombing targets there , jürgen trittin of the opposition green party told dw-world the fog has to be cleared . dw-world : mr trittin do you think it was and is right that the german federal intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- works in iraq ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin , former environment minister and prominent green party member jürgen trittin : it is right that in a situation that leads to such a war , the bnd does n't let the german government - it does n't matter which one - rely alone on information supplied by only one combatant or the other .
that 's why it was also right that members of the secret intelligence agency remained there .
as we know , they were housed in the french embassy - the embassy of a country that displayed a stance similar to germany 's on the iraq war . what do you have to say about the alleged fact that bnd spies did n't just work in iraq , but also supplied information to us troops that helped them to select their bombing targets ? so far there 's only one source for that claim and that 's a member of the american military intelligence community .
the bnd has issued a statement saying that 's not the case .
it seems like a parliamentary enquiry will have to clear up this contradiction .
we are all interested in shedding light on this matter because we ca n't accept that , if it is proved , authorities or even individual members - it does n't matter with whose knowledge - thwarted the political stance of the federal republic of germany on the iraq war by turning into one of the war parties themselves .
i 'm not going to volunteer to weigh the credibility of the different intelligence services against each other .
we have had our experiences with intelligence agencies of the us in the run-up to the iraq war . can you imagine that your own green party , also the party of the former foreign minister joschka fischer , was n't informed about such procedures ? the then-foreign minister -lrb- fischer -rrb- had clearly explained that he was aware that bnd spies stayed in iraq .
that 's right and gets the wholehearted support of the greens .
fischer also made it clear that he was n't aware of activities that the spies had allowed themselves to be dragged into the war .
so , the former foreign minister is also naturally very much in favor of leaving no stone unturned in clearing up the issue . if it turns out that the bnd did work together with the us in iraq , would that be seen as a breaking of the " green " promise to keep germany out of the iraq war ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany refused to be part of the us-led invasion of iraq if that is the case , the bnd would have acted disloyally , not towards a party , but towards the german government which has represented a clear-cut position , nationally as well as internationally , that we consider the war , for one , to be wrong and secondly , that we do n't want to be part of it .
but , as i said , these are speculations and we first want to have facts on the table . there are allegations that the bnd does its own thing because even the parliamentary control commission is n't informed about all its activities .
what do you say to that ? this too has to be examined within the framework of the parliamentary investigation .
what is also true - and also been pointed out by the head of the parliamentary control commission in the past weeks - is that the rights of the board have to be strengthened when it comes to getting access to files and even publishing improper conduct .
that 's apparent even today . the opposition liberal free democrats and the left party are demanding the setting up an investigation committee in parliament .
how do the greens see the move ? the party 's parliamentary leadership has already recommended such an investigation because we do n't see any other way to clear up the matter . the interview was conducted by martin schrader -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the americans want to make clear germany is n't innocent " german intelligence agency expert erich schmidt-eenboom offers his take on the allegations that german secret agents were involved in assessing targets during the us military invasion in iraq .

but , as i said , these are speculations and we first want to have facts on the table . there are allegations that the bnd does its own thing because even the parliamentary control commission is n't informed about all its activities .
what do you say to that ? this too has to be examined within the framework of the parliamentary investigation .
what is also true - and also been pointed out by the head of the parliamentary control commission in the past weeks - is that the rights of the board have to be strengthened when it comes to getting access to files and even publishing improper conduct .
that 's apparent even today . the opposition liberal free democrats and the left party are demanding the setting up an investigation committee in parliament .
how do the greens see the move ? the party 's parliamentary leadership has already recommended such an investigation because we do n't see any other way to clear up the matter . the interview was conducted by martin schrader -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the americans want to make clear germany is n't innocent " german intelligence agency expert erich schmidt-eenboom offers his take on the allegations that german secret agents were involved in assessing targets during the us military invasion in iraq .

brian pickering talked to senator dan coats , the former us ambassador to germany , about german chancellor angela merkel 's talks with us president george w. bush . during her first visit to the united states since becoming german chancellor , angela merkel held talks with president george w. bush on friday on a wide range of issues .
the two leaders differed on guantanamo bay but vowed to seek a common approach on iran as they opened a new chapter in us-german relations .
president bush 's relationship with merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder , was often stormy because of schröder 's opposition to the us-led invasion of iraq . deutsche welle : senator coats , do you have the impression that germany and the united states countries have made progress in overcoming their differences and moving closer together again ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former us ambassador to germany daniel r. coats dan coats : very much so , this clearly was an indication by both chancellor merkel and the president that they want to open a new chapter in our relationship .
it 's going to be a return to a much more harmonious and united effort to deal with some of the major challenges and i think to respect each others differences in terms of some of the areas where we might not have total agreement .
but it 's clear that the president and chancellor merkel established a very good start . how would you describe the personal chemistry between the two ?
did they hit it off ? i think they clearly hit it off .
i think there is personal chemistry there .
the president referenced it when he said he was touched by the chancellor 's discussion about her upbringing in east germany and her appreciation for freedom from someone coming from a place where that freedom was not available .
i was at a dinner with chancellor merkel where she talked about this also .
i think the most important point that was made and had an impact on those who attended the dinner was that understanding that she had lived in isolation in east germany and of course the incredible rise to become the first woman chancellor of germany .
i think that 's something the president very much appreciated and he clearly wants to establish a working relationship and a good personal relationship with the new chancellor . ms. merkel is still prepared to criticize the united states and only last weekend she raised a few eyebrows in germany by saying that the guantanamo prison camp should not continued to operate indefinitely .
what was the president 's reaction to that criticism ? well , i think his reaction was the appropriate reaction .
that was that one he hopes for understanding in terms of the terrorist threat that exists and the implications of that for a free society .
so i think we 're going to see a president who is responsive to criticism because particularly he knows it is well-meant criticism .
it is criticism of a friend and ally as opposed to someone that may be using for political purposes or simply to gain political favor at home by making negative comments about the united states . at the moment it 's iran and not iraq that 's the focus of world attention .
germany is one of the three eu countries that have called for iran to be referred to the un security council over its decision to resume its nuclear program .
is there broad agreement between the united states and the eu on what action should be taken against iran ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations security council there clearly is broad agreement that has been obtained over the last couple of years as the eu has attempted to use diplomacy and negotiations to seek a favorable resolution to this .
clearly there is now agreement that this should be taken to the un security council and should move to the next step .
now what specific action the security council takes is something that has to be discussed and negotiated .
sanctions , if they are imposed , what kind of support we can get from other nations like china , india and russia to form a united front .
i think all of these still have to be decided .
but we 've taken a very important step forward in saying our best efforts , the eu-3 's best efforts over the past year and a half have not met with success and it is time to up the pressure on iran to take a much more sensible course of action . are ordinary americans taking an interest in ms. merkel 's visit to the us ? yes , they are .
ordinary americans are , i think , grateful and relieved , that the situation has changed , that we have a president now who is saying warm things about this new chancellor and has a willingness not only to reach out and work with the chancellor but to reach out and work with the german people in trying to address these international problems that affect both of us . dw-radio 's brian pickering interviewed dan coats send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush and merkel hail new chapter in us-german relations german chancellor angela merkel emerged from talks with president george w. bush in washington friday to say that us-german relations were back on track and that they shared common ground on many issues , including iran .

germany has warned against sanctions . president mahmoud ahmadinejad was due to give a press conference - only his second since his shock election win last june - with the controversial hardliner expected to repeat his defiant stance . he has already vowed not to compromise " one iota " on his country 's nuclear program , especially efforts to master the fuel cycle . quoted by the official news agency irna , national security spokesman hossein entezami said iran was still open to negotiations with the european union - but said it was not ready to discuss research activities at the centre of the current stand-off . " the subject of the negotiations with the europeans is uniquely -lrb- full-scale -rrb- uranium enrichment , and the matter of nuclear research is not a part of that , " he said .
" the decision by iran to carry out research activities is serious . " small-scale enrichment now iran resumed research this week , with the work involving small scale enrichment to test centrifuges .
it insists this is separate from full-scale uranium enrichment , which remains frozen for the time being . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bushehr nuclear power plant in south iran iran says its nuclear program is only directed towards generating electricity and is entirely legal , although the enrichment process can be extended to make atomic bombs . the three main eu powers - britain , france and germany - have for more than two years been trying to convince iran to voluntarily limit its nuclear activities in exchange for trade and other incentives . but iran has consistently refused striking any such deal , and since ahmadinejad 's election win has been progressively been backing away from a temporary freeze on fuel cycle work agreed to in 2003 and again in 2004 . talks next week eu , us , chinese and russian officials are due to hold talks in london on monday , when they are expected to set a date for an emergency meeting of the international atomic energy agency 's 35-nation board of governors . both the eu and the us are now pushing for iran to be referred to the un security council , hoping to back up a series of iaea calls - so far ignored - for tehran to return to a full nuclear freeze . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush at a joint press conference with german chancellor angela merkel " it 's logical that a country which has rejected diplomatic " efforts to end the crisis " be sent to the united nations security council , " us president george w. bush said at a joint press conference with visiting german chancellor angela merkel in washington on friday . if iran obtained nuclear weapons , it would pose " a grave threat to the security of the world , " bush said , recalling how ahmadinejad had called last year for israel to be " wiped off the map . " germany warns against sanctions but so far the west has played down any talk of immediate sanctions or even military action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gernot erler germany 's deputy foreign minister gernot erler told german radio in an interview to be broadcast on sunday that imposing economic sanctions against iran would be a " very dangerous path . " he said he favored imposing travel restrictions on iranian politicians , since they would have " an extraordinarily unpleasant impact . " iran has warned that a referral to the security council would bring serious consequences from its side . " all voluntary means of cooperation " with the iaea would end , foreign minister manouchehr mottaki warned friday . this could entail an end to tougher un inspections of iranian nuclear sites or even result in a resumption of full-scale uranium enrichment . the mounting crisis is affecting the world energy markets : oil futures closed marginally lower friday in line with falls for natural gas , but traders said anxiety remained about the nuclear crisis surrounding iran . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran threatens to halt nuclear cooperation iran threatened on friday to stop cooperating with the un atomic watchdog , including possibly resuming uranium enrichment , if its controversial nuclear program is referred to the un security council .

"
but is the idea really extinct ? dutch foreign minister bernard bot publicly declared what many european leaders had been avoiding saying : that the eu constitution , turned down by dutch and french voters , appears to have gone the way of another extinct object that failed to take flight - the dodo . the dodo was a plump , large bird that could neither run nor fly and which eventually became extinct .
the eu constitution is a massive project that took years to put together - and itself failed to lift off when french and dutch voters said " no " to it last year .
the question remains whether it can survive in some form or not . austria , which took over the eu presidency on january 1 pledged to work on reviving the constitution and vienna announced soon after that it would check with the other 24 eu nations by june on how to orchestrate this . bot pronounces constitution dead for the netherlands bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch minister of foreign affairs bernard bot read the last rites over the constitution .
just a few days after that announcement , austria 's foreign minister ursula plassnik met with her dutch counterpart bernard bot in the hague .
bot promptly snuffed out any hopes of a resurrection by saying the european constitution was dead for the netherlands . bot 's statement came just days after the austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel insisted that the constitution was " in the middle of ratification " and that " the constitution is not dead . " jo leinen , the chairman of the constitutional affairs committee in the european parliament , and the german member of the european parliament , shares austria 's desire for the constitution to be kept alive , but warned against renegotiating the text . " i can ’ t see what 's new that needs to be discussed .
we discussed the constitution for four years .
those who want to open a pandora 's box will get a weaker rather than a better constitution , " leinen said . like german chancellor angela merkel , leinen recommends that the entire constitution be preserved but made more attractive with an added charter on the " social dimension of europe . " leinen sees the eu door shutting if constitution dies this method was successful in saving the maastricht treaty which appeared to be facing almost certain defeat in the 1990 's . nothing is likely to happen before 2007 when the dutch and french both hold elections and get possible changes in leadership which may promote a " yes " vote in new referendums .
leinen says if the constitution does n't go through , no more seats will be made available in the european parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jo leinen sees no more new members if the eu constitution fails .
" rumania and bulgaria … well , they 've been decided on and they will be the last to get in based on the treaty of nice .
but it will be hard for croatia , macedonia and the others .
i think we have a lever here to create some sort of breakthrough , " leinen added . chirac 's " cherry picking " idea could cause further divisions french president jacques chirac suggested that the best parts of the constitution be " cherry-picked . "
that idea , as well as one that countries in favor of the constitution team up and move forward with it , has been overwhelmingly rejected , according to hans-gert pöttering , member of the christian social democrats and leader of the european parliament ’ s largest conservative faction . " we totally reject these ideas that are coming from paris , which promote that states in favor of the constitution form their own separate working group .
we have seen too many psychological divisions in europe in the past , " pöttering said . of the 25 eu member states , 14 have ratified the treaty , including germany .

"
but is the idea really extinct ? dutch foreign minister bernard bot publicly declared what many european leaders had been avoiding saying : that the eu constitution , turned down by dutch and french voters , appears to have gone the way of another extinct object that failed to take flight - the dodo . the dodo was a plump , large bird that could neither run nor fly and which eventually became extinct .
the eu constitution is a massive project that took years to put together - and itself failed to lift off when french and dutch voters said " no " to it last year .
the question remains whether it can survive in some form or not . austria , which took over the eu presidency on january 1 pledged to work on reviving the constitution and vienna announced soon after that it would check with the other 24 eu nations by june on how to orchestrate this . bot pronounces constitution dead for the netherlands bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch minister of foreign affairs bernard bot read the last rites over the constitution .
just a few days after that announcement , austria 's foreign minister ursula plassnik met with her dutch counterpart bernard bot in the hague .
bot promptly snuffed out any hopes of a resurrection by saying the european constitution was dead for the netherlands . bot 's statement came just days after the austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel insisted that the constitution was " in the middle of ratification " and that " the constitution is not dead . " jo leinen , the chairman of the constitutional affairs committee in the european parliament , and the german member of the european parliament , shares austria 's desire for the constitution to be kept alive , but warned against renegotiating the text . " i can ’ t see what 's new that needs to be discussed .
we discussed the constitution for four years .
those who want to open a pandora 's box will get a weaker rather than a better constitution , " leinen said . like german chancellor angela merkel , leinen recommends that the entire constitution be preserved but made more attractive with an added charter on the " social dimension of europe . " leinen sees the eu door shutting if constitution dies this method was successful in saving the maastricht treaty which appeared to be facing almost certain defeat in the 1990 's . nothing is likely to happen before 2007 when the dutch and french both hold elections and get possible changes in leadership which may promote a " yes " vote in new referendums .
leinen says if the constitution does n't go through , no more seats will be made available in the european parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jo leinen sees no more new members if the eu constitution fails .
" rumania and bulgaria … well , they 've been decided on and they will be the last to get in based on the treaty of nice .
but it will be hard for croatia , macedonia and the others .
i think we have a lever here to create some sort of breakthrough , " leinen added . chirac 's " cherry picking " idea could cause further divisions french president jacques chirac suggested that the best parts of the constitution be " cherry-picked . "
that idea , as well as one that countries in favor of the constitution team up and move forward with it , has been overwhelmingly rejected , according to hans-gert pöttering , member of the christian social democrats and leader of the european parliament ’ s largest conservative faction . " we totally reject these ideas that are coming from paris , which promote that states in favor of the constitution form their own separate working group .

even as germany 's federal intelligence agency denies reports its spies in baghdad helped the us in selecting bombing targets there , jürgen trittin of the opposition green party told dw-world the fog has to be cleared . dw-world : mr trittin do you think it was and is right that the german federal intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- works in iraq ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin , former environment minister and prominent green party member jürgen trittin : it is right that in a situation that leads to such a war , the bnd does n't let the german government - it does n't matter which one - rely alone on information supplied by only one combatant or the other .
that 's why it was also right that members of the secret intelligence agency remained there .
as we know , they were housed in the french embassy - the embassy of a country that displayed a stance similar to germany 's on the iraq war . what do you have to say about the alleged fact that bnd spies did n't just work in iraq , but also supplied information to us troops that helped them to select their bombing targets ? so far there 's only one source for that claim and that 's a member of the american military intelligence community .
the bnd has issued a statement saying that 's not the case .
it seems like a parliamentary enquiry will have to clear up this contradiction .
we are all interested in shedding light on this matter because we ca n't accept that , if it is proved , authorities or even individual members - it does n't matter with whose knowledge - thwarted the political stance of the federal republic of germany on the iraq war by turning into one of the war parties themselves .
i 'm not going to volunteer to weigh the credibility of the different intelligence services against each other .
we have had our experiences with intelligence agencies of the us in the run-up to the iraq war . can you imagine that your own green party , also the party of the former foreign minister joschka fischer , was n't informed about such procedures ? the then-foreign minister -lrb- fischer -rrb- had clearly explained that he was aware that bnd spies stayed in iraq .
that 's right and gets the wholehearted support of the greens .
fischer also made it clear that he was n't aware of activities that the spies had allowed themselves to be dragged into the war .
so , the former foreign minister is also naturally very much in favor of leaving no stone unturned in clearing up the issue . if it turns out that the bnd did work together with the us in iraq , would that be seen as a breaking of the " green " promise to keep germany out of the iraq war ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany refused to be part of the us-led invasion of iraq if that is the case , the bnd would have acted disloyally , not towards a party , but towards the german government which has represented a clear-cut position , nationally as well as internationally , that we consider the war , for one , to be wrong and secondly , that we do n't want to be part of it .
but , as i said , these are speculations and we first want to have facts on the table . there are allegations that the bnd does its own thing because even the parliamentary control commission is n't informed about all its activities .
what do you say to that ? this too has to be examined within the framework of the parliamentary investigation .
what is also true - and also been pointed out by the head of the parliamentary control commission in the past weeks - is that the rights of the board have to be strengthened when it comes to getting access to files and even publishing improper conduct .
that 's apparent even today . the opposition liberal free democrats and the left party are demanding the setting up an investigation committee in parliament .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the world cup circus rolls on to germany from soccer yard to world-class stadium the specter of hooliganism returns the world cup , german money-maker germany plans star-studded opening gala for world cup world cup 2006 -pipe- 14.01.2006 politicians incensed over gala cancellation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could munich be a viable replacement location for cup gala ?
now that the world cup opening extravaganza in berlin has been given the boot , politicians are clambering for some kind of replacement show .
but fifa is n't interested . the announcement by the world soccer governing body fifa that the planned opening extravaganza by star director andre heller would not take place struck like a bolt of lightning on a sunny day in berlin .
the city 's mayor , klaus wowereit , scrambled quickly after being knocked down by the fifa blow . he said he would try to persuade fifa to allow an alternative show at the brandenburg gate , a location better known for its new year 's celebrations , the love parade and naturally the emotional scenes of the reunification in 1989 .
it seems less than the ideal spot for soccer fans to gather in the direct run-up to the world cup , far away from the olympic stadium , where the world cup final will take place . but now fifa very much wants to distance itself from any kind of opening ceremony . " the gala will not be replaced , " said the soccer body 's director of communications markus siegler . fifa incurring germany 's wrath bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andre heller -lrb- r -rrb- said fifa 's cancellation of his extravaganza would not come " cheap " the matter is leaving a bitter taste in public officials ' mouths . " this is embarrassing and is not a good start , " dieter wiefelspütz , the social democratic domestic policy spokesman , told hanover 's neue presse newspaper . not only has the extravaganza been ignominiously wiped off the schedule of world cup events , germany 's image itself could even be tarnished , according to wiefelspütz .
the organizers of the month-long tournament , led by former soccer star franz beckenbauer , are hoping for a world cup that would make all others pale in comparison .
yet months before the first german goal is scored , the spd politician said that grave mistakes have already been made . why not move it to munich ? while some berlin officials seethe , others have floated the idea of moving the gala to munich , where the opening match will be played on june 9 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the brandenburg gate was the venue for wild parties like the now-defunct love parade ernst hinsken , the chair of the parliamentary tourism committee and also from bavaria , said that munich has the facilities to do it . " the old olympic stadium would be the right place for the gala , " he told the passauer neue presse newspaper .

brian pickering talked to senator dan coats , the former us ambassador to germany , about german chancellor angela merkel 's talks with us president george w. bush . during her first visit to the united states since becoming german chancellor , angela merkel held talks with president george w. bush on friday on a wide range of issues .
the two leaders differed on guantanamo bay but vowed to seek a common approach on iran as they opened a new chapter in us-german relations .
president bush 's relationship with merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder , was often stormy because of schröder 's opposition to the us-led invasion of iraq . deutsche welle : senator coats , do you have the impression that germany and the united states countries have made progress in overcoming their differences and moving closer together again ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former us ambassador to germany daniel r. coats dan coats : very much so , this clearly was an indication by both chancellor merkel and the president that they want to open a new chapter in our relationship .
it 's going to be a return to a much more harmonious and united effort to deal with some of the major challenges and i think to respect each others differences in terms of some of the areas where we might not have total agreement .
but it 's clear that the president and chancellor merkel established a very good start . how would you describe the personal chemistry between the two ?
did they hit it off ? i think they clearly hit it off .
i think there is personal chemistry there .
the president referenced it when he said he was touched by the chancellor 's discussion about her upbringing in east germany and her appreciation for freedom from someone coming from a place where that freedom was not available .
i was at a dinner with chancellor merkel where she talked about this also .
i think the most important point that was made and had an impact on those who attended the dinner was that understanding that she had lived in isolation in east germany and of course the incredible rise to become the first woman chancellor of germany .
i think that 's something the president very much appreciated and he clearly wants to establish a working relationship and a good personal relationship with the new chancellor . ms. merkel is still prepared to criticize the united states and only last weekend she raised a few eyebrows in germany by saying that the guantanamo prison camp should not continued to operate indefinitely .
what was the president 's reaction to that criticism ? well , i think his reaction was the appropriate reaction .
that was that one he hopes for understanding in terms of the terrorist threat that exists and the implications of that for a free society .
so i think we 're going to see a president who is responsive to criticism because particularly he knows it is well-meant criticism .
it is criticism of a friend and ally as opposed to someone that may be using for political purposes or simply to gain political favor at home by making negative comments about the united states . at the moment it 's iran and not iraq that 's the focus of world attention .
germany is one of the three eu countries that have called for iran to be referred to the un security council over its decision to resume its nuclear program .
is there broad agreement between the united states and the eu on what action should be taken against iran ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations security council there clearly is broad agreement that has been obtained over the last couple of years as the eu has attempted to use diplomacy and negotiations to seek a favorable resolution to this .
clearly there is now agreement that this should be taken to the un security council and should move to the next step .
now what specific action the security council takes is something that has to be discussed and negotiated .
sanctions , if they are imposed , what kind of support we can get from other nations like china , india and russia to form a united front .
i think all of these still have to be decided .
but we 've taken a very important step forward in saying our best efforts , the eu-3 's best efforts over the past year and a half have not met with success and it is time to up the pressure on iran to take a much more sensible course of action . are ordinary americans taking an interest in ms. merkel 's visit to the us ? yes , they are .
ordinary americans are , i think , grateful and relieved , that the situation has changed , that we have a president now who is saying warm things about this new chancellor and has a willingness not only to reach out and work with the chancellor but to reach out and work with the german people in trying to address these international problems that affect both of us . dw-radio 's brian pickering interviewed dan coats send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush and merkel hail new chapter in us-german relations german chancellor angela merkel emerged from talks with president george w. bush in washington friday to say that us-german relations were back on track and that they shared common ground on many issues , including iran .

brian pickering talked to senator dan coats , the former us ambassador to germany , about german chancellor angela merkel 's talks with us president george w. bush . during her first visit to the united states since becoming german chancellor , angela merkel held talks with president george w. bush on friday on a wide range of issues .
the two leaders differed on guantanamo bay but vowed to seek a common approach on iran as they opened a new chapter in us-german relations .
president bush 's relationship with merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder , was often stormy because of schröder 's opposition to the us-led invasion of iraq . deutsche welle : senator coats , do you have the impression that germany and the united states countries have made progress in overcoming their differences and moving closer together again ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former us ambassador to germany daniel r. coats dan coats : very much so , this clearly was an indication by both chancellor merkel and the president that they want to open a new chapter in our relationship .
it 's going to be a return to a much more harmonious and united effort to deal with some of the major challenges and i think to respect each others differences in terms of some of the areas where we might not have total agreement .
but it 's clear that the president and chancellor merkel established a very good start . how would you describe the personal chemistry between the two ?
did they hit it off ? i think they clearly hit it off .
i think there is personal chemistry there .
the president referenced it when he said he was touched by the chancellor 's discussion about her upbringing in east germany and her appreciation for freedom from someone coming from a place where that freedom was not available .
i was at a dinner with chancellor merkel where she talked about this also .
i think the most important point that was made and had an impact on those who attended the dinner was that understanding that she had lived in isolation in east germany and of course the incredible rise to become the first woman chancellor of germany .
i think that 's something the president very much appreciated and he clearly wants to establish a working relationship and a good personal relationship with the new chancellor . ms. merkel is still prepared to criticize the united states and only last weekend she raised a few eyebrows in germany by saying that the guantanamo prison camp should not continued to operate indefinitely .
what was the president 's reaction to that criticism ? well , i think his reaction was the appropriate reaction .
that was that one he hopes for understanding in terms of the terrorist threat that exists and the implications of that for a free society .
so i think we 're going to see a president who is responsive to criticism because particularly he knows it is well-meant criticism .
it is criticism of a friend and ally as opposed to someone that may be using for political purposes or simply to gain political favor at home by making negative comments about the united states . at the moment it 's iran and not iraq that 's the focus of world attention .
germany is one of the three eu countries that have called for iran to be referred to the un security council over its decision to resume its nuclear program .
is there broad agreement between the united states and the eu on what action should be taken against iran ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations security council there clearly is broad agreement that has been obtained over the last couple of years as the eu has attempted to use diplomacy and negotiations to seek a favorable resolution to this .
clearly there is now agreement that this should be taken to the un security council and should move to the next step .
now what specific action the security council takes is something that has to be discussed and negotiated .
sanctions , if they are imposed , what kind of support we can get from other nations like china , india and russia to form a united front .
i think all of these still have to be decided .
but we 've taken a very important step forward in saying our best efforts , the eu-3 's best efforts over the past year and a half have not met with success and it is time to up the pressure on iran to take a much more sensible course of action . are ordinary americans taking an interest in ms. merkel 's visit to the us ? yes , they are .
ordinary americans are , i think , grateful and relieved , that the situation has changed , that we have a president now who is saying warm things about this new chancellor and has a willingness not only to reach out and work with the chancellor but to reach out and work with the german people in trying to address these international problems that affect both of us . dw-radio 's brian pickering interviewed dan coats send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush and merkel hail new chapter in us-german relations german chancellor angela merkel emerged from talks with president george w. bush in washington friday to say that us-german relations were back on track and that they shared common ground on many issues , including iran .

now that the world cup opening extravaganza in berlin has been given the boot , politicians are clambering for some kind of replacement show .

the city 's mayor , klaus wowereit , scrambled quickly after being knocked down by the fifa blow . he said he would try to persuade fifa to allow an alternative show at the brandenburg gate , a location better known for its new year 's celebrations , the love parade and naturally the emotional scenes of the reunification in 1989 .
it seems less than the ideal spot for soccer fans to gather in the direct run-up to the world cup , far away from the olympic stadium , where the world cup final will take place . but now fifa very much wants to distance itself from any kind of opening ceremony .

the organizers of the month-long tournament , led by former soccer star franz beckenbauer , are hoping for a world cup that would make all others pale in comparison .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 14.01.2006 iran digs in over nuclear crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president ahmadinejad is refusing to budge despite possible un security council action iran dug in over its disputed nuclear program saturday , saying it would not reverse a decision to conduct sensitive atomic research work even if referred to the un security council .
germany has warned against sanctions . president mahmoud ahmadinejad was due to give a press conference - only his second since his shock election win last june - with the controversial hardliner expected to repeat his defiant stance . he has already vowed not to compromise " one iota " on his country 's nuclear program , especially efforts to master the fuel cycle . quoted by the official news agency irna , national security spokesman hossein entezami said iran was still open to negotiations with the european union - but said it was not ready to discuss research activities at the centre of the current stand-off . " the subject of the negotiations with the europeans is uniquely -lrb- full-scale -rrb- uranium enrichment , and the matter of nuclear research is not a part of that , " he said .
" the decision by iran to carry out research activities is serious . " small-scale enrichment now iran resumed research this week , with the work involving small scale enrichment to test centrifuges .
it insists this is separate from full-scale uranium enrichment , which remains frozen for the time being . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bushehr nuclear power plant in south iran iran says its nuclear program is only directed towards generating electricity and is entirely legal , although the enrichment process can be extended to make atomic bombs . the three main eu powers - britain , france and germany - have for more than two years been trying to convince iran to voluntarily limit its nuclear activities in exchange for trade and other incentives . but iran has consistently refused striking any such deal , and since ahmadinejad 's election win has been progressively been backing away from a temporary freeze on fuel cycle work agreed to in 2003 and again in 2004 . talks next week eu , us , chinese and russian officials are due to hold talks in london on monday , when they are expected to set a date for an emergency meeting of the international atomic energy agency 's 35-nation board of governors . both the eu and the us are now pushing for iran to be referred to the un security council , hoping to back up a series of iaea calls - so far ignored - for tehran to return to a full nuclear freeze . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush at a joint press conference with german chancellor angela merkel " it 's logical that a country which has rejected diplomatic " efforts to end the crisis " be sent to the united nations security council , " us president george w. bush said at a joint press conference with visiting german chancellor angela merkel in washington on friday . if iran obtained nuclear weapons , it would pose " a grave threat to the security of the world , " bush said , recalling how ahmadinejad had called last year for israel to be " wiped off the map . " germany warns against sanctions but so far the west has played down any talk of immediate sanctions or even military action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gernot erler germany 's deputy foreign minister gernot erler told german radio in an interview to be broadcast on sunday that imposing economic sanctions against iran would be a " very dangerous path . " he said he favored imposing travel restrictions on iranian politicians , since they would have " an extraordinarily unpleasant impact . " iran has warned that a referral to the security council would bring serious consequences from its side . " all voluntary means of cooperation " with the iaea would end , foreign minister manouchehr mottaki warned friday . this could entail an end to tougher un inspections of iranian nuclear sites or even result in a resumption of full-scale uranium enrichment . the mounting crisis is affecting the world energy markets : oil futures closed marginally lower friday in line with falls for natural gas , but traders said anxiety remained about the nuclear crisis surrounding iran . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran threatens to halt nuclear cooperation iran threatened on friday to stop cooperating with the un atomic watchdog , including possibly resuming uranium enrichment , if its controversial nuclear program is referred to the un security council .

now that the world cup opening extravaganza in berlin has been given the boot , politicians are clambering for some kind of replacement show .
but fifa is n't interested . the announcement by the world soccer governing body fifa that the planned opening extravaganza by star director andre heller would not take place struck like a bolt of lightning on a sunny day in berlin .
the city 's mayor , klaus wowereit , scrambled quickly after being knocked down by the fifa blow . he said he would try to persuade fifa to allow an alternative show at the brandenburg gate , a location better known for its new year 's celebrations , the love parade and naturally the emotional scenes of the reunification in 1989 .
it seems less than the ideal spot for soccer fans to gather in the direct run-up to the world cup , far away from the olympic stadium , where the world cup final will take place . but now fifa very much wants to distance itself from any kind of opening ceremony . " the gala will not be replaced , " said the soccer body 's director of communications markus siegler . fifa incurring germany 's wrath bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andre heller -lrb- r -rrb- said fifa 's cancellation of his extravaganza would not come " cheap " the matter is leaving a bitter taste in public officials ' mouths . " this is embarrassing and is not a good start , " dieter wiefelspütz , the social democratic domestic policy spokesman , told hanover 's neue presse newspaper . not only has the extravaganza been ignominiously wiped off the schedule of world cup events , germany 's image itself could even be tarnished , according to wiefelspütz .
the organizers of the month-long tournament , led by former soccer star franz beckenbauer , are hoping for a world cup that would make all others pale in comparison .
yet months before the first german goal is scored , the spd politician said that grave mistakes have already been made . why not move it to munich ? while some berlin officials seethe , others have floated the idea of moving the gala to munich , where the opening match will be played on june 9 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the brandenburg gate was the venue for wild parties like the now-defunct love parade ernst hinsken , the chair of the parliamentary tourism committee and also from bavaria , said that munich has the facilities to do it . " the old olympic stadium would be the right place for the gala , " he told the passauer neue presse newspaper .
" the concept would have to be watered down a little bit -lrb- for munich -rrb- but then it would work . " the idea is not without its merits .
thousands of fans would be spared having to make the trek from berlin to munich said hinsken .
most importantly , hinsken believes , the financial and image loss must be held to a minimum . the call has so far fallen on deaf ears in zurich , where fifa 's headquarters are located .
fifa 's siegler said that there is no chance that the gala will be held elsewhere . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup gala gets the ax the star-studded gala which was to open the 2006 world cup in berlin has been cancelled due to concerns over damage to the olympic stadium 's pitch .

even as germany 's federal intelligence agency denies reports its spies in baghdad helped the us in selecting bombing targets there , jürgen trittin of the opposition green party told dw-world the fog has to be cleared . dw-world : mr trittin do you think it was and is right that the german federal intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- works in iraq ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin , former environment minister and prominent green party member jürgen trittin : it is right that in a situation that leads to such a war , the bnd does n't let the german government - it does n't matter which one - rely alone on information supplied by only one combatant or the other .
that 's why it was also right that members of the secret intelligence agency remained there .
as we know , they were housed in the french embassy - the embassy of a country that displayed a stance similar to germany 's on the iraq war . what do you have to say about the alleged fact that bnd spies did n't just work in iraq , but also supplied information to us troops that helped them to select their bombing targets ? so far there 's only one source for that claim and that 's a member of the american military intelligence community .
the bnd has issued a statement saying that 's not the case .
it seems like a parliamentary enquiry will have to clear up this contradiction .
we are all interested in shedding light on this matter because we ca n't accept that , if it is proved , authorities or even individual members - it does n't matter with whose knowledge - thwarted the political stance of the federal republic of germany on the iraq war by turning into one of the war parties themselves .
i 'm not going to volunteer to weigh the credibility of the different intelligence services against each other .
we have had our experiences with intelligence agencies of the us in the run-up to the iraq war . can you imagine that your own green party , also the party of the former foreign minister joschka fischer , was n't informed about such procedures ? the then-foreign minister -lrb- fischer -rrb- had clearly explained that he was aware that bnd spies stayed in iraq .
that 's right and gets the wholehearted support of the greens .
fischer also made it clear that he was n't aware of activities that the spies had allowed themselves to be dragged into the war .
so , the former foreign minister is also naturally very much in favor of leaving no stone unturned in clearing up the issue . if it turns out that the bnd did work together with the us in iraq , would that be seen as a breaking of the " green " promise to keep germany out of the iraq war ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany refused to be part of the us-led invasion of iraq if that is the case , the bnd would have acted disloyally , not towards a party , but towards the german government which has represented a clear-cut position , nationally as well as internationally , that we consider the war , for one , to be wrong and secondly , that we do n't want to be part of it .
but , as i said , these are speculations and we first want to have facts on the table . there are allegations that the bnd does its own thing because even the parliamentary control commission is n't informed about all its activities .
what do you say to that ? this too has to be examined within the framework of the parliamentary investigation .
what is also true - and also been pointed out by the head of the parliamentary control commission in the past weeks - is that the rights of the board have to be strengthened when it comes to getting access to files and even publishing improper conduct .
that 's apparent even today . the opposition liberal free democrats and the left party are demanding the setting up an investigation committee in parliament .
how do the greens see the move ? the party 's parliamentary leadership has already recommended such an investigation because we do n't see any other way to clear up the matter . the interview was conducted by martin schrader -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the americans want to make clear germany is n't innocent " german intelligence agency expert erich schmidt-eenboom offers his take on the allegations that german secret agents were involved in assessing targets during the us military invasion in iraq .

even as germany 's federal intelligence agency denies reports its spies in baghdad helped the us in selecting bombing targets there , jürgen trittin of the opposition green party told dw-world the fog has to be cleared . dw-world : mr trittin do you think it was and is right that the german federal intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- works in iraq ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin , former environment minister and prominent green party member jürgen trittin : it is right that in a situation that leads to such a war , the bnd does n't let the german government - it does n't matter which one - rely alone on information supplied by only one combatant or the other .
that 's why it was also right that members of the secret intelligence agency remained there .
as we know , they were housed in the french embassy - the embassy of a country that displayed a stance similar to germany 's on the iraq war . what do you have to say about the alleged fact that bnd spies did n't just work in iraq , but also supplied information to us troops that helped them to select their bombing targets ? so far there 's only one source for that claim and that 's a member of the american military intelligence community .
the bnd has issued a statement saying that 's not the case .
it seems like a parliamentary enquiry will have to clear up this contradiction .
we are all interested in shedding light on this matter because we ca n't accept that , if it is proved , authorities or even individual members - it does n't matter with whose knowledge - thwarted the political stance of the federal republic of germany on the iraq war by turning into one of the war parties themselves .
i 'm not going to volunteer to weigh the credibility of the different intelligence services against each other .
we have had our experiences with intelligence agencies of the us in the run-up to the iraq war . can you imagine that your own green party , also the party of the former foreign minister joschka fischer , was n't informed about such procedures ? the then-foreign minister -lrb- fischer -rrb- had clearly explained that he was aware that bnd spies stayed in iraq .
that 's right and gets the wholehearted support of the greens .
fischer also made it clear that he was n't aware of activities that the spies had allowed themselves to be dragged into the war .
so , the former foreign minister is also naturally very much in favor of leaving no stone unturned in clearing up the issue . if it turns out that the bnd did work together with the us in iraq , would that be seen as a breaking of the " green " promise to keep germany out of the iraq war ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany refused to be part of the us-led invasion of iraq if that is the case , the bnd would have acted disloyally , not towards a party , but towards the german government which has represented a clear-cut position , nationally as well as internationally , that we consider the war , for one , to be wrong and secondly , that we do n't want to be part of it .
but , as i said , these are speculations and we first want to have facts on the table . there are allegations that the bnd does its own thing because even the parliamentary control commission is n't informed about all its activities .
what do you say to that ? this too has to be examined within the framework of the parliamentary investigation .
what is also true - and also been pointed out by the head of the parliamentary control commission in the past weeks - is that the rights of the board have to be strengthened when it comes to getting access to files and even publishing improper conduct .

" and even today , tenants pay a yearly rent of 88 cents . " renaissance gem augsburg , after munich and nürnberg , is bavaria 's third largest city and one of the oldest in germany .
full of roman ruins , it was an international city during the renaissance period and the evidence thereof is plentiful , particularly in the splendid facades of the merchant houses on maximilianstrasse , in the fountain of adriaen de vries and in the sumptuous town hall built by renaissance master elias holl . the famous golden hall is an authentic example of a venue of the time of mozart .
a rococo gem is the schaezler palace with its marvellous staircase , a two-story ballroom with precious wood panelling and venetian chandeliers and mirrors .
it was here that leopold mozart , in 1763 , introduced his two children to augsburg society . thomas weitzel , who heads the culture office of the city , said there are links to leopold mozart everywhere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the town hall is a testament to augsburg rich past " leopold himself want to school here in augsburg , worked as a musician and singer at the jesuiten theater , " he said .

a little further down jesuitengasse , wolfgang amadeus mozart 's cousin " bäsle " lived , his first love affair that has been preserved in letters . " in 1951 , the german mozart society was founded in the city .
the organization mainly researches mozart 's life and work .
they have 17 regional associations around germany and independent members around the world . " we have about 3,000 members , a considerable number of whom are outside germany , " said hansjörg franzius , vice president of the institution .
" they includes universities , associations , libraries and other organizations from almost everywhere around the globe , except china or south africa .
but we hope to welcome them soon , too .

now that the world cup opening extravaganza in berlin has been given the boot , politicians are clambering for some kind of replacement show .
but fifa is n't interested . the announcement by the world soccer governing body fifa that the planned opening extravaganza by star director andre heller would not take place struck like a bolt of lightning on a sunny day in berlin .
the city 's mayor , klaus wowereit , scrambled quickly after being knocked down by the fifa blow . he said he would try to persuade fifa to allow an alternative show at the brandenburg gate , a location better known for its new year 's celebrations , the love parade and naturally the emotional scenes of the reunification in 1989 .
it seems less than the ideal spot for soccer fans to gather in the direct run-up to the world cup , far away from the olympic stadium , where the world cup final will take place . but now fifa very much wants to distance itself from any kind of opening ceremony . " the gala will not be replaced , " said the soccer body 's director of communications markus siegler . fifa incurring germany 's wrath bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andre heller -lrb- r -rrb- said fifa 's cancellation of his extravaganza would not come " cheap " the matter is leaving a bitter taste in public officials ' mouths .

the organizers of the month-long tournament , led by former soccer star franz beckenbauer , are hoping for a world cup that would make all others pale in comparison .
yet months before the first german goal is scored , the spd politician said that grave mistakes have already been made . why not move it to munich ? while some berlin officials seethe , others have floated the idea of moving the gala to munich , where the opening match will be played on june 9 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the brandenburg gate was the venue for wild parties like the now-defunct love parade ernst hinsken , the chair of the parliamentary tourism committee and also from bavaria , said that munich has the facilities to do it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : a new thaw ahead for german-american relations the rocky german-american landscape opinion : germany 's steinmeier makes his mark in washington germany 's jung promises improved relations with washington germany 's image in us improved , study shows germany -pipe- 14.01.2006 " a very good start " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do the smiles really mean the ice has melted between germany and the us ?
brian pickering talked to senator dan coats , the former us ambassador to germany , about german chancellor angela merkel 's talks with us president george w. bush . during her first visit to the united states since becoming german chancellor , angela merkel held talks with president george w. bush on friday on a wide range of issues .
the two leaders differed on guantanamo bay but vowed to seek a common approach on iran as they opened a new chapter in us-german relations .
president bush 's relationship with merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder , was often stormy because of schröder 's opposition to the us-led invasion of iraq . deutsche welle : senator coats , do you have the impression that germany and the united states countries have made progress in overcoming their differences and moving closer together again ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former us ambassador to germany daniel r. coats dan coats : very much so , this clearly was an indication by both chancellor merkel and the president that they want to open a new chapter in our relationship .
it 's going to be a return to a much more harmonious and united effort to deal with some of the major challenges and i think to respect each others differences in terms of some of the areas where we might not have total agreement .
but it 's clear that the president and chancellor merkel established a very good start . how would you describe the personal chemistry between the two ?
did they hit it off ? i think they clearly hit it off .
i think there is personal chemistry there .
the president referenced it when he said he was touched by the chancellor 's discussion about her upbringing in east germany and her appreciation for freedom from someone coming from a place where that freedom was not available .
i was at a dinner with chancellor merkel where she talked about this also .
i think the most important point that was made and had an impact on those who attended the dinner was that understanding that she had lived in isolation in east germany and of course the incredible rise to become the first woman chancellor of germany .
i think that 's something the president very much appreciated and he clearly wants to establish a working relationship and a good personal relationship with the new chancellor . ms. merkel is still prepared to criticize the united states and only last weekend she raised a few eyebrows in germany by saying that the guantanamo prison camp should not continued to operate indefinitely .
what was the president 's reaction to that criticism ? well , i think his reaction was the appropriate reaction .
that was that one he hopes for understanding in terms of the terrorist threat that exists and the implications of that for a free society .
so i think we 're going to see a president who is responsive to criticism because particularly he knows it is well-meant criticism .
it is criticism of a friend and ally as opposed to someone that may be using for political purposes or simply to gain political favor at home by making negative comments about the united states . at the moment it 's iran and not iraq that 's the focus of world attention .
germany is one of the three eu countries that have called for iran to be referred to the un security council over its decision to resume its nuclear program .
is there broad agreement between the united states and the eu on what action should be taken against iran ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations security council there clearly is broad agreement that has been obtained over the last couple of years as the eu has attempted to use diplomacy and negotiations to seek a favorable resolution to this .
clearly there is now agreement that this should be taken to the un security council and should move to the next step .
now what specific action the security council takes is something that has to be discussed and negotiated .
sanctions , if they are imposed , what kind of support we can get from other nations like china , india and russia to form a united front .
i think all of these still have to be decided .
but we 've taken a very important step forward in saying our best efforts , the eu-3 's best efforts over the past year and a half have not met with success and it is time to up the pressure on iran to take a much more sensible course of action . are ordinary americans taking an interest in ms. merkel 's visit to the us ? yes , they are .
ordinary americans are , i think , grateful and relieved , that the situation has changed , that we have a president now who is saying warm things about this new chancellor and has a willingness not only to reach out and work with the chancellor but to reach out and work with the german people in trying to address these international problems that affect both of us . dw-radio 's brian pickering interviewed dan coats send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush and merkel hail new chapter in us-german relations german chancellor angela merkel emerged from talks with president george w. bush in washington friday to say that us-german relations were back on track and that they shared common ground on many issues , including iran .

"
but is the idea really extinct ? dutch foreign minister bernard bot publicly declared what many european leaders had been avoiding saying : that the eu constitution , turned down by dutch and french voters , appears to have gone the way of another extinct object that failed to take flight - the dodo . the dodo was a plump , large bird that could neither run nor fly and which eventually became extinct .

brian pickering talked to senator dan coats , the former us ambassador to germany , about german chancellor angela merkel 's talks with us president george w. bush . during her first visit to the united states since becoming german chancellor , angela merkel held talks with president george w. bush on friday on a wide range of issues .
the two leaders differed on guantanamo bay but vowed to seek a common approach on iran as they opened a new chapter in us-german relations .
president bush 's relationship with merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder , was often stormy because of schröder 's opposition to the us-led invasion of iraq . deutsche welle : senator coats , do you have the impression that germany and the united states countries have made progress in overcoming their differences and moving closer together again ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former us ambassador to germany daniel r. coats dan coats : very much so , this clearly was an indication by both chancellor merkel and the president that they want to open a new chapter in our relationship .
it 's going to be a return to a much more harmonious and united effort to deal with some of the major challenges and i think to respect each others differences in terms of some of the areas where we might not have total agreement .
but it 's clear that the president and chancellor merkel established a very good start . how would you describe the personal chemistry between the two ?
did they hit it off ? i think they clearly hit it off .
i think there is personal chemistry there .
the president referenced it when he said he was touched by the chancellor 's discussion about her upbringing in east germany and her appreciation for freedom from someone coming from a place where that freedom was not available .
i was at a dinner with chancellor merkel where she talked about this also .
i think the most important point that was made and had an impact on those who attended the dinner was that understanding that she had lived in isolation in east germany and of course the incredible rise to become the first woman chancellor of germany .
i think that 's something the president very much appreciated and he clearly wants to establish a working relationship and a good personal relationship with the new chancellor . ms. merkel is still prepared to criticize the united states and only last weekend she raised a few eyebrows in germany by saying that the guantanamo prison camp should not continued to operate indefinitely .
what was the president 's reaction to that criticism ? well , i think his reaction was the appropriate reaction .
that was that one he hopes for understanding in terms of the terrorist threat that exists and the implications of that for a free society .
so i think we 're going to see a president who is responsive to criticism because particularly he knows it is well-meant criticism .
it is criticism of a friend and ally as opposed to someone that may be using for political purposes or simply to gain political favor at home by making negative comments about the united states . at the moment it 's iran and not iraq that 's the focus of world attention .
germany is one of the three eu countries that have called for iran to be referred to the un security council over its decision to resume its nuclear program .
is there broad agreement between the united states and the eu on what action should be taken against iran ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations security council there clearly is broad agreement that has been obtained over the last couple of years as the eu has attempted to use diplomacy and negotiations to seek a favorable resolution to this .
clearly there is now agreement that this should be taken to the un security council and should move to the next step .
now what specific action the security council takes is something that has to be discussed and negotiated .
sanctions , if they are imposed , what kind of support we can get from other nations like china , india and russia to form a united front .
i think all of these still have to be decided .
but we 've taken a very important step forward in saying our best efforts , the eu-3 's best efforts over the past year and a half have not met with success and it is time to up the pressure on iran to take a much more sensible course of action . are ordinary americans taking an interest in ms. merkel 's visit to the us ? yes , they are .
ordinary americans are , i think , grateful and relieved , that the situation has changed , that we have a president now who is saying warm things about this new chancellor and has a willingness not only to reach out and work with the chancellor but to reach out and work with the german people in trying to address these international problems that affect both of us . dw-radio 's brian pickering interviewed dan coats send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush and merkel hail new chapter in us-german relations german chancellor angela merkel emerged from talks with president george w. bush in washington friday to say that us-german relations were back on track and that they shared common ground on many issues , including iran .

brian pickering talked to senator dan coats , the former us ambassador to germany , about german chancellor angela merkel 's talks with us president george w. bush . during her first visit to the united states since becoming german chancellor , angela merkel held talks with president george w. bush on friday on a wide range of issues .
the two leaders differed on guantanamo bay but vowed to seek a common approach on iran as they opened a new chapter in us-german relations .
president bush 's relationship with merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder , was often stormy because of schröder 's opposition to the us-led invasion of iraq . deutsche welle : senator coats , do you have the impression that germany and the united states countries have made progress in overcoming their differences and moving closer together again ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former us ambassador to germany daniel r. coats dan coats : very much so , this clearly was an indication by both chancellor merkel and the president that they want to open a new chapter in our relationship .
it 's going to be a return to a much more harmonious and united effort to deal with some of the major challenges and i think to respect each others differences in terms of some of the areas where we might not have total agreement .
but it 's clear that the president and chancellor merkel established a very good start . how would you describe the personal chemistry between the two ?
did they hit it off ? i think they clearly hit it off .
i think there is personal chemistry there .
the president referenced it when he said he was touched by the chancellor 's discussion about her upbringing in east germany and her appreciation for freedom from someone coming from a place where that freedom was not available .
i was at a dinner with chancellor merkel where she talked about this also .
i think the most important point that was made and had an impact on those who attended the dinner was that understanding that she had lived in isolation in east germany and of course the incredible rise to become the first woman chancellor of germany .
i think that 's something the president very much appreciated and he clearly wants to establish a working relationship and a good personal relationship with the new chancellor . ms. merkel is still prepared to criticize the united states and only last weekend she raised a few eyebrows in germany by saying that the guantanamo prison camp should not continued to operate indefinitely .
what was the president 's reaction to that criticism ? well , i think his reaction was the appropriate reaction .
that was that one he hopes for understanding in terms of the terrorist threat that exists and the implications of that for a free society .
so i think we 're going to see a president who is responsive to criticism because particularly he knows it is well-meant criticism .

but there is a city in germany closely connected to his life - augsburg . he was born in salzburg , austria ; he died in vienna .
but in between , the composer spent time in the hometown of his father leopold , in the bavarian city of augsburg . when leopold mozart recognized the musical talent of his children , wolfgang amadeus and anna maria , known as nannerl , he took them on a european tour , visiting courts and academies in order to present their abilities . on their first trip , they visited munich , vienna , frankfurt and augsburg . and it is in augsburg , where the relationship between father and son will be especially highlighted during the mozart year 2006 .
for two weeks in may , the city will feature works from the pair performed as they would have been during their lifetimes . mozart 's mentor and manager leopold mozart was born in augsburg on nov .
14 , 1719 .
while a talented musician and composer in his own right , he is most well known there today for the fact he was both determined manager and mentor to his exceptionally talented son . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mozart 's great-grandfather lived here for mozart year , the city has spruced up sites connected to the mozart family .
one is the house that leopold mozart was born in at 30 frauentorstrasse . " the rooms are arranged thematically , " said one city official .
" one features a biography ; one illustrates the travels of the family .
above , there is a small multi-media room which has a slide show . " in the walled quarter of city known as the " fuggerei , " there is a stone tablet commemorating the musician 's great-grandfather , franz mozart , who lived for 12 years in what is the world 's oldest public housing project for the poor .
he got into financial trouble and as a result , had a right to live in this quarter established by rich bankers in 1516 . the head of the city 's tourist agency , regina thieme , says the neighborhood retains its atmosphere and its function to this day . " it was seen as a moral duty then , when one was rich , to do good works , " she said .
" and even today , tenants pay a yearly rent of 88 cents . " renaissance gem augsburg , after munich and nürnberg , is bavaria 's third largest city and one of the oldest in germany .
full of roman ruins , it was an international city during the renaissance period and the evidence thereof is plentiful , particularly in the splendid facades of the merchant houses on maximilianstrasse , in the fountain of adriaen de vries and in the sumptuous town hall built by renaissance master elias holl . the famous golden hall is an authentic example of a venue of the time of mozart .
a rococo gem is the schaezler palace with its marvellous staircase , a two-story ballroom with precious wood panelling and venetian chandeliers and mirrors .
it was here that leopold mozart , in 1763 , introduced his two children to augsburg society . thomas weitzel , who heads the culture office of the city , said there are links to leopold mozart everywhere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the town hall is a testament to augsburg rich past " leopold himself want to school here in augsburg , worked as a musician and singer at the jesuiten theater , " he said .
" if we look to the left , we will see the tauf church , where leopold mozart was baptized .
a little further down jesuitengasse , wolfgang amadeus mozart 's cousin " bäsle " lived , his first love affair that has been preserved in letters . " in 1951 , the german mozart society was founded in the city .
the organization mainly researches mozart 's life and work .
they have 17 regional associations around germany and independent members around the world . " we have about 3,000 members , a considerable number of whom are outside germany , " said hansjörg franzius , vice president of the institution .
" they includes universities , associations , libraries and other organizations from almost everywhere around the globe , except china or south africa .
but we hope to welcome them soon , too .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 14.01.2006 flightless eu constitution going the same way as the dodo ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much like the dodo , the eu constitution is an unwieldly beast being hunted to extinction austria 's hopes of breathing new life into the european constitution have had cold water poured over them after the netherlands announced the treaty was " dead . "
but is the idea really extinct ? dutch foreign minister bernard bot publicly declared what many european leaders had been avoiding saying : that the eu constitution , turned down by dutch and french voters , appears to have gone the way of another extinct object that failed to take flight - the dodo . the dodo was a plump , large bird that could neither run nor fly and which eventually became extinct .
the eu constitution is a massive project that took years to put together - and itself failed to lift off when french and dutch voters said " no " to it last year .
the question remains whether it can survive in some form or not . austria , which took over the eu presidency on january 1 pledged to work on reviving the constitution and vienna announced soon after that it would check with the other 24 eu nations by june on how to orchestrate this . bot pronounces constitution dead for the netherlands bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch minister of foreign affairs bernard bot read the last rites over the constitution .
just a few days after that announcement , austria 's foreign minister ursula plassnik met with her dutch counterpart bernard bot in the hague .
bot promptly snuffed out any hopes of a resurrection by saying the european constitution was dead for the netherlands . bot 's statement came just days after the austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel insisted that the constitution was " in the middle of ratification " and that " the constitution is not dead . " jo leinen , the chairman of the constitutional affairs committee in the european parliament , and the german member of the european parliament , shares austria 's desire for the constitution to be kept alive , but warned against renegotiating the text . " i can ’ t see what 's new that needs to be discussed .
we discussed the constitution for four years .

even as germany 's federal intelligence agency denies reports its spies in baghdad helped the us in selecting bombing targets there , jürgen trittin of the opposition green party told dw-world the fog has to be cleared . dw-world : mr trittin do you think it was and is right that the german federal intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- works in iraq ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin , former environment minister and prominent green party member jürgen trittin : it is right that in a situation that leads to such a war , the bnd does n't let the german government - it does n't matter which one - rely alone on information supplied by only one combatant or the other .
that 's why it was also right that members of the secret intelligence agency remained there .
as we know , they were housed in the french embassy - the embassy of a country that displayed a stance similar to germany 's on the iraq war . what do you have to say about the alleged fact that bnd spies did n't just work in iraq , but also supplied information to us troops that helped them to select their bombing targets ? so far there 's only one source for that claim and that 's a member of the american military intelligence community .
the bnd has issued a statement saying that 's not the case .
it seems like a parliamentary enquiry will have to clear up this contradiction .
we are all interested in shedding light on this matter because we ca n't accept that , if it is proved , authorities or even individual members - it does n't matter with whose knowledge - thwarted the political stance of the federal republic of germany on the iraq war by turning into one of the war parties themselves .
i 'm not going to volunteer to weigh the credibility of the different intelligence services against each other .
we have had our experiences with intelligence agencies of the us in the run-up to the iraq war . can you imagine that your own green party , also the party of the former foreign minister joschka fischer , was n't informed about such procedures ? the then-foreign minister -lrb- fischer -rrb- had clearly explained that he was aware that bnd spies stayed in iraq .
that 's right and gets the wholehearted support of the greens .
fischer also made it clear that he was n't aware of activities that the spies had allowed themselves to be dragged into the war .
so , the former foreign minister is also naturally very much in favor of leaving no stone unturned in clearing up the issue . if it turns out that the bnd did work together with the us in iraq , would that be seen as a breaking of the " green " promise to keep germany out of the iraq war ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany refused to be part of the us-led invasion of iraq if that is the case , the bnd would have acted disloyally , not towards a party , but towards the german government which has represented a clear-cut position , nationally as well as internationally , that we consider the war , for one , to be wrong and secondly , that we do n't want to be part of it .
but , as i said , these are speculations and we first want to have facts on the table . there are allegations that the bnd does its own thing because even the parliamentary control commission is n't informed about all its activities .
what do you say to that ? this too has to be examined within the framework of the parliamentary investigation .
what is also true - and also been pointed out by the head of the parliamentary control commission in the past weeks - is that the rights of the board have to be strengthened when it comes to getting access to files and even publishing improper conduct .
that 's apparent even today . the opposition liberal free democrats and the left party are demanding the setting up an investigation committee in parliament .
how do the greens see the move ? the party 's parliamentary leadership has already recommended such an investigation because we do n't see any other way to clear up the matter . the interview was conducted by martin schrader -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the americans want to make clear germany is n't innocent " german intelligence agency expert erich schmidt-eenboom offers his take on the allegations that german secret agents were involved in assessing targets during the us military invasion in iraq .

even as germany 's federal intelligence agency denies reports its spies in baghdad helped the us in selecting bombing targets there , jürgen trittin of the opposition green party told dw-world the fog has to be cleared . dw-world : mr trittin do you think it was and is right that the german federal intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- works in iraq ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin , former environment minister and prominent green party member jürgen trittin : it is right that in a situation that leads to such a war , the bnd does n't let the german government - it does n't matter which one - rely alone on information supplied by only one combatant or the other .
that 's why it was also right that members of the secret intelligence agency remained there .
as we know , they were housed in the french embassy - the embassy of a country that displayed a stance similar to germany 's on the iraq war . what do you have to say about the alleged fact that bnd spies did n't just work in iraq , but also supplied information to us troops that helped them to select their bombing targets ? so far there 's only one source for that claim and that 's a member of the american military intelligence community .
the bnd has issued a statement saying that 's not the case .
it seems like a parliamentary enquiry will have to clear up this contradiction .
we are all interested in shedding light on this matter because we ca n't accept that , if it is proved , authorities or even individual members - it does n't matter with whose knowledge - thwarted the political stance of the federal republic of germany on the iraq war by turning into one of the war parties themselves .
i 'm not going to volunteer to weigh the credibility of the different intelligence services against each other .
we have had our experiences with intelligence agencies of the us in the run-up to the iraq war . can you imagine that your own green party , also the party of the former foreign minister joschka fischer , was n't informed about such procedures ? the then-foreign minister -lrb- fischer -rrb- had clearly explained that he was aware that bnd spies stayed in iraq .
that 's right and gets the wholehearted support of the greens .
fischer also made it clear that he was n't aware of activities that the spies had allowed themselves to be dragged into the war .
so , the former foreign minister is also naturally very much in favor of leaving no stone unturned in clearing up the issue . if it turns out that the bnd did work together with the us in iraq , would that be seen as a breaking of the " green " promise to keep germany out of the iraq war ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany refused to be part of the us-led invasion of iraq if that is the case , the bnd would have acted disloyally , not towards a party , but towards the german government which has represented a clear-cut position , nationally as well as internationally , that we consider the war , for one , to be wrong and secondly , that we do n't want to be part of it .
but , as i said , these are speculations and we first want to have facts on the table . there are allegations that the bnd does its own thing because even the parliamentary control commission is n't informed about all its activities .
what do you say to that ? this too has to be examined within the framework of the parliamentary investigation .
what is also true - and also been pointed out by the head of the parliamentary control commission in the past weeks - is that the rights of the board have to be strengthened when it comes to getting access to files and even publishing improper conduct .
that 's apparent even today . the opposition liberal free democrats and the left party are demanding the setting up an investigation committee in parliament .
how do the greens see the move ? the party 's parliamentary leadership has already recommended such an investigation because we do n't see any other way to clear up the matter . the interview was conducted by martin schrader -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the americans want to make clear germany is n't innocent " german intelligence agency expert erich schmidt-eenboom offers his take on the allegations that german secret agents were involved in assessing targets during the us military invasion in iraq .

speaking in brasilia , mr morales told brazil 's president luiz ignacio lula da silva that bolivia needed and would protect foreign investment .
he reaffirmed his commitment partially to nationalise bolivia 's gas industry - in which brazil has a big stake - but said it would be done in consultation .
mr morales is on a whistle-stop world tour before taking office in a week .
during his election campaign , he stressed his keenness to increase state control over bolivia 's lucrative natural gas industry , to benefit the country 's poor .
but while in brazil , mr morales seemed keen to reassure investors that he would take a business-friendly approach to reform .
as well as two hours of talks with president lula , mr morales also met the head of brazil 's state-owned oil company , petrobras .
speaking afterwards , jose sergio gabrielli said he expected an excellent business climate under the new bolivian government .
petrobas is one of bolivia 's largest foreign investors , controlling 14 % of the country 's huge gas reserves .
addressing a news conference in brasilia , mr morales said : " as with any country , we have the right to manage our own resources .
" this does n't mean expelling foreign companies or expropriating foreign property .
" foreign companies have every right to recover investments and make profits , but profits should be balanced . "
vice president-elect alvaro garcia earlier said foreign oil companies would be welcome in bolivia but would have to renegotiate their contracts with the government .
mr morales ' world tour has also taken in europe , china , south africa and venezuela .
an aymara indian from a poor region in the bolivian highlands , he will become bolivia 's first indigenous leader in its 180-year history when he takes office on 22 january .

speaking in brasilia , mr morales told brazil 's president luiz ignacio lula da silva that bolivia needed and would protect foreign investment .
he reaffirmed his commitment partially to nationalise bolivia 's gas industry - in which brazil has a big stake - but said it would be done in consultation .
mr morales is on a whistle-stop world tour before taking office in a week .
during his election campaign , he stressed his keenness to increase state control over bolivia 's lucrative natural gas industry , to benefit the country 's poor .

as well as two hours of talks with president lula , mr morales also met the head of brazil 's state-owned oil company , petrobras .
mr morales is keen to use bolivia 's natural resources to help the poor speaking afterwards , jose sergio gabrielli said he expected an excellent business climate under the new bolivian government .
petrobas is one of bolivia 's largest foreign investors , controlling 14 % of the country 's huge gas reserves .
addressing a news conference in brasilia , mr morales said : " as with any country , we have the right to manage our own resources .
" this does n't mean expelling foreign companies or expropriating foreign property .
" foreign companies have every right to recover investments and make profits , but profits should be balanced . "
vice president-elect alvaro garcia earlier said foreign oil companies would be welcome in bolivia but would have to renegotiate their contracts with the government .

t & g regional secretary andy richards was part of a delegation with welsh secretary peter hain who met senior managers at the visteon plant .
mr richards said the company was unable to say what work it could attract after existing contracts ended in 2008 .
visteon said it was facing a " difficult business situation " at the plant .
about 100 workers at swansea will transfer to ford 's engine plant at bridgend by the end of march .
the visteon corporation was set up by ford as a stand-alone supplier of components .
mr richards said : " our concerns over the future of the plant remain , albeit that further talks are planned .
" both visteon and ford have an obligation to this plant where the workers have contributed so much and we are strongly resolved to see that these obligations are met .
" we made it clear that we would accept no fait accompli announcement and would oppose plant closure by any means . "
he said the company and unions had agreed to resume negotiations over cost reduction measures at the plant that had been adjourned since october last year .
a spokesman for visteon said the corporation had recently undergone significant restructuring in north america and would continue to review its operations in other parts of the world , including the uk .
" as we take these actions to drive cost competitiveness locally , there is a need to address the challenging financial situation faced by visteon uk ltd , " it said .
" we are progressing a number of actions that include focusing the product portfolio , selling under-utilised assets and working with our employees and unions to improve the competitiveness of the uk business . "

rat catchers from new zealand laid thousands of baits for the brown rodents on canna in the inner hebrides .
they were drafted in by the national trust for scotland , which owns the island , to kill the creatures , which are threatening bird populations .
more than 90 % of the rats have been killed and it is hoped the remainder will be removed by march . "
we are tantalisingly close to have them all off the island " abbie patterson national trust for scotland the rats , which feed on seabirds ' eggs , first arrived on the island on ships about 100 years ago .
they are being blamed for a serious decline over the last 10 years in the bird species which have inhabited canna .
the rodents also pose a threat to the island 's rare wood mice , 130 of which were transferred to edinburgh zoo before the £ 580,000 cull .
as well as harming wildlife on canna , the rats have also caused a nuisance to the island 's 11 residents by breaking into food stores .
abbie patterson , national species recovery officer with the national trust , said the team from wildlife management international -lrb- wmi -rrb- were now targeting the few rats left on canna .
' target timescale ' " at this stage i would say we are tantalisingly close to have them all off the island , " he said .
" we had not set a target timescale to finish the project , because that is difficult to do when you are working with wildlife , but so far we are very pleased with how it has gone .
" the poison being used is quite mild , because we were interested in keeping the damage to other wildlife to a minimum . "
mr patterson added that the mice taken to edinburgh zoo were doing well and they were hoping to reintroduce them to the island later this year .
" we think we will have a lot more mice to re-release , because all the signs show that they are breeding , " he said .
risky project during the operation , which began last september , the new zealand team placed 4,000 baits on the island , which is just four-and-a-half miles long , and used 20 tonnes of rat poison .
the project has proved risky because of the rugged landscape , with the team having to abseil down cliffs to reach some areas .
elizabeth bell of wmi said : " we said when we arrived that we would not be here if we could not do the job and it has gone as well as we could have expected . "
she added that the island would have to be monitored for two years before it could be said to be rat-free .

rat catchers from new zealand laid thousands of baits for the brown rodents on canna in the inner hebrides .
they were drafted in by the national trust for scotland , which owns the island , to kill the creatures , which are threatening bird populations .
more than 90 % of the rats have been killed and it is hoped the remainder will be removed by march .
we are tantalisingly close to have them all off the island abbie patterson national trust for scotland the rats , which feed on seabirds ' eggs , first arrived on the island on ships about 100 years ago .
they are being blamed for a serious decline over the last 10 years in the bird species which have inhabited canna .
the rodents also pose a threat to the island 's rare wood mice , 130 of which were transferred to edinburgh zoo before the £ 580,000 cull .
as well as harming wildlife on canna , the rats have also caused a nuisance to the island 's 11 residents by breaking into food stores .
abbie patterson , national species recovery officer with the national trust , said the team from wildlife management international -lrb- wmi -rrb- were now targeting the few rats left on canna .
' target timescale ' " at this stage i would say we are tantalisingly close to have them all off the island , " he said .
" we had not set a target timescale to finish the project , because that is difficult to do when you are working with wildlife , but so far we are very pleased with how it has gone .
" the poison being used is quite mild , because we were interested in keeping the damage to other wildlife to a minimum . "
mr patterson added that the mice taken to edinburgh zoo were doing well and they were hoping to reintroduce them to the island later this year .
" we think we will have a lot more mice to re-release , because all the signs show that they are breeding , " he said .
risky project during the operation , which began last september , the new zealand team placed 4,000 baits on the island , which is just four-and-a-half miles long , and used 20 tonnes of rat poison .
the project has proved risky because of the rugged landscape , with the team having to abseil down cliffs to reach some areas .

dennis eady , from liberty , said there had been little " realistic defence " for the men in the " extremely quick " trial .
but he said there appeared to be a strong evidence against wichai somkhaoyai , 24 and bualoi posit , 23 .
the body of miss horton , 21 , from cardiff , was found in the sea off the island of koh samui on 2 january .
posit and somkhaoyai admitted rape and conspiracy to kill at the court in surat thani on friday .
the case has been adjourned until next wednesday when the men face sentencing - just over two weeks after the death of miss horton .
mr eady , from the south wales branch of the campaign group , told bbc radio wales : " it has been pushed through extremely quickly and in a context of massive political and commercial pressure .
" i suppose what would concern us is the lack of due process that seems to be taking place here . "
' terrible crime ' he said that from a western perspective he would have liked to have seen the two men have a " clearer defence " .
" it does seem that these people do n't seem to have had a realistic defence at all , " he said .
thailand 's prime minister thaksin shinawatra has declared that the men should face the maximum penalty because of damage done to the country 's image .
mr eady added that liberty was worried about the " plea-bargaining situation " around the death penalty in thailand .
" people who plead guilty are less likely to get the death penalty , " he said .
" that does inevitably create a perverse incentive to plead guilty and someone who is poorly defended might well be inclined to plead guilty simply to save their life , even though they could conceivably be innocent , " he said .
but mr eady said the case was not necessarily a miscarriage of justice .
he added : " the evidence does seem to be strong here ...
clearly this is a terrible crime and we have great sympathy with the family . "

the railway was also used to maintain ottoman rule in more distant provinces my first encounter with the hejaz railway was in clouds of steam along with a pungent smell of hot grease , at kadem station in damascus .
a veteran steam locomotive built in 1914 chuffed past , hauling a goods train towards the jordan border .
from the driver 's cab , two soot streaked faces leaned out to see the iron road ahead .
it was like stepping back a century in railway history .
but i had to remind myself that this was not history , this was now !
the engineer in charge of the 100-year-old maintenance sheds -lrb- two huge stone buildings full of rolling stock and engines -rrb- pointed to the oldest locomotive in service , built in germany in 1898 .
" just one of 11 steam locomotives in service , " he told me with obvious pride .
" if the 60-year-old diesels break down , " he added , " we use steam for the passenger services as well as goods trains . "
armour-plated carriage i walked through a graveyard of abandoned rolling stock and a number of locomotives that were gently falling apart in sidings overgrown with grass and shrubs .
and what i was looking at were the original carriages and engines that made up the first pilgrim trains in 1908 .
one carriage was armour-plated .
it had rifle slits in the sides from which guards on the train could ward off attacks from bedouin tribesmen on the train 's four-day journey through the desert to medina in what is now saudi arabia .
national differences in southern jordan it is a very different railway .
the line followed the ancient pilgrim caravan route across arabia robbed of its rails and sleepers , the embankment stands proud of the desert , like some sort of natural sculpture that has always been there .
the embankment makes a good road until it stops abruptly at a yawning gap where a bridge was washed away by a flash flood perhaps decades ago .
on the saudi stretch of the line there are steam engines that were abandoned after the end of world war i. one was in medain saleh , a big station along the line in saudi .
the locomotive , stripped of every moveable part by the bedouin , was still in its engine shed waiting for maintenance that should have been done 80 or 90 years ago .
the last station in jordan before the saudi border is mudarrawra .
station dwellers peeping out from behind the pillars in front of the ticket office were eight little children , seven girls and one boy who , in the absence of his father , was the spokesman .
passenger and goods trains run between damascus and amman he recited all the names of his siblings and told me through an interpreter that they had lived in the station for 10 years and that very few people like us stopped to ask about the railway .
i could not find any stations on a branch line in southern jordan , closer to amman .
the ottomans had sided with germany in world war i , so the good quality british coal they used in the locomotives from the mines in wales was cut off .
at one stage fuel was so scarce that the engines were being fed furniture and floor boards just to keep running .
as the railway had to burn wood instead of coal , they built this 25-mile-long -lrb- 40km -rrb- branch line into a forest near the crusader castle of shubak to collect it .
a local farmer confirmed that we were at the forest of hisseth - or what was left of it .
people really do believe that the retreating ottoman soldiers buried gold around the stations ueli bellwader , archaeologist " over there , " the farmer pointed to higher ground some distance away , " you can see tree stumps left by the ottoman troops . "
then the jordanian farmer accused my interpreter and me of treasure hunting .
" we could n't even find the railway , let alone any treasure , " i protested .
but the farmer insisted that we open the boot of the car to see if we had spades , shovels and any other incriminating kit .
puzzled , i later consulted an archaeologist in amman who put his head in his hands and said : " treasure hunting is destroying long sections of the railway . "
ueli bellwader explained that the holes all around the stations we saw in the desert were not world war i bomb craters but deep holes dug by treasure hunters .
" it may sound crazy , " he said , " but people really do believe that the retreating ottoman soldiers buried gold around the stations .
" in their frenzy to find it , " he said , " they have mechanical earth-moving equipment that is demolishing buildings and stretches of the embankment . "
and the hunt for the treasure has spawned another profitable sideline for shops in faraway istanbul .
maps of the railway sell for serious money along with a guarantee that the cross on the map is definitely the place to dig for an ottoman pot of gold .

the railway was also used to maintain ottoman rule in more distant provinces my first encounter with the hejaz railway was in clouds of steam along with a pungent smell of hot grease , at kadem station in damascus .
a veteran steam locomotive built in 1914 chuffed past , hauling a goods train towards the jordan border .
from the driver 's cab , two soot streaked faces leaned out to see the iron road ahead .
it was like stepping back a century in railway history .
but i had to remind myself that this was not history , this was now !
the engineer in charge of the 100-year-old maintenance sheds -lrb- two huge stone buildings full of rolling stock and engines -rrb- pointed to the oldest locomotive in service , built in germany in 1898 .
" just one of 11 steam locomotives in service , " he told me with obvious pride .
" if the 60-year-old diesels break down , " he added , " we use steam for the passenger services as well as goods trains . "
armour-plated carriage i walked through a graveyard of abandoned rolling stock and a number of locomotives that were gently falling apart in sidings overgrown with grass and shrubs .
and what i was looking at were the original carriages and engines that made up the first pilgrim trains in 1908 .
one carriage was armour-plated .
it had rifle slits in the sides from which guards on the train could ward off attacks from bedouin tribesmen on the train 's four-day journey through the desert to medina in what is now saudi arabia .
national differences in southern jordan it is a very different railway .
the line followed the ancient pilgrim caravan route across arabia robbed of its rails and sleepers , the embankment stands proud of the desert , like some sort of natural sculpture that has always been there .
the embankment makes a good road until it stops abruptly at a yawning gap where a bridge was washed away by a flash flood perhaps decades ago .
on the saudi stretch of the line there are steam engines that were abandoned after the end of world war i. one was in medain saleh , a big station along the line in saudi .
the locomotive , stripped of every moveable part by the bedouin , was still in its engine shed waiting for maintenance that should have been done 80 or 90 years ago .
the last station in jordan before the saudi border is mudarrawra .
station dwellers peeping out from behind the pillars in front of the ticket office were eight little children , seven girls and one boy who , in the absence of his father , was the spokesman .
passenger and goods trains run between damascus and amman he recited all the names of his siblings and told me through an interpreter that they had lived in the station for 10 years and that very few people like us stopped to ask about the railway .
i could not find any stations on a branch line in southern jordan , closer to amman .
the ottomans had sided with germany in world war i , so the good quality british coal they used in the locomotives from the mines in wales was cut off .
at one stage fuel was so scarce that the engines were being fed furniture and floor boards just to keep running .
as the railway had to burn wood instead of coal , they built this 25-mile-long -lrb- 40km -rrb- branch line into a forest near the crusader castle of shubak to collect it .
a local farmer confirmed that we were at the forest of hisseth - or what was left of it .
people really do believe that the retreating ottoman soldiers buried gold around the stations ueli bellwader , archaeologist " over there , " the farmer pointed to higher ground some distance away , " you can see tree stumps left by the ottoman troops . "
then the jordanian farmer accused my interpreter and me of treasure hunting .
" we could n't even find the railway , let alone any treasure , " i protested .
but the farmer insisted that we open the boot of the car to see if we had spades , shovels and any other incriminating kit .
puzzled , i later consulted an archaeologist in amman who put his head in his hands and said : " treasure hunting is destroying long sections of the railway . "
ueli bellwader explained that the holes all around the stations we saw in the desert were not world war i bomb craters but deep holes dug by treasure hunters .
" it may sound crazy , " he said , " but people really do believe that the retreating ottoman soldiers buried gold around the stations .
" in their frenzy to find it , " he said , " they have mechanical earth-moving equipment that is demolishing buildings and stretches of the embankment . "
and the hunt for the treasure has spawned another profitable sideline for shops in faraway istanbul .
maps of the railway sell for serious money along with a guarantee that the cross on the map is definitely the place to dig for an ottoman pot of gold .

the fife mp said labour supporters should " embrace the union flag " and reclaim it from the far right .
but scottish national party leader alex salmond said britishness " went bust long ago " north of the border .
and he said labour 's opposition to a scottish holiday on st andrew 's day was a " fatal weakness " in the argument .
in his speech to the fabian society in london , mr brown said the modern labour party and its supporters should be unashamedly patriotic .
we should assert that the union flag by definition is a flag for tolerance and inclusion chancellor gordon brown he said this could encompass " progressive " ideas of liberty , fairness and responsibility rather then right-wing beliefs .
" instead of the bnp using it as a symbol of racial division , the flag should be a symbol of unity and part of a modern expression of patriotism too , " said the chancellor .
" all the united kingdom should honour it , not ignore it .
we should assert that the union flag by definition is a flag for tolerance and inclusion . "
mr brown said promoting integration had become even more important since the london bombings .
" we have to be clearer now about how diverse cultures which inevitably contain differences can find the essential common purpose also without which no society can flourish , " he added .
you can not sustain a national identity just because someone wants to be national leader alex salmond snp leader however , mr salmond claimed that the chancellor was motivated by self-interest .
" his repeated attempts to resuscitate british identity are looking increasingly desperate , a necessary move to make himself acceptable as a british prime minister .
" however , you can not sustain a national identity just because someone wants to be national leader , " he said .
" for two generations and more it is scottish identity which has been on the rise .
bulldog brown is waving the wrong flag at scotland . "
he said there was also a renewed sense of englishness rather than britishness south of the border .
public holiday and he added : " to suggest a new british day while his own labour colleagues in scotland oppose the grassroots campaign to celebrate properly st andrew 's day illustrates the fatal weakness in brown and labour 's position . "
last year the scottish parliament voted against a bill to create a new public holiday , instead supporting a move to examine ways in which 30 november could be celebrated without the loss of a day 's work .
former conservative prime minister sir john major agreed with the concept being put forward by mr brown .
but he said the government had damaged britishness by steps such as introducing devolution in scotland .
