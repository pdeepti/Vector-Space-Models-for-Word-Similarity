bird flu psychosis is spreading faster than the virus itself . it was a surprise that germany 's airports were not inundated with fleeing citizens ; fighting each other for the last available seats to safety , panicked to distraction with only thoughts of escape passing through their fear-frazzled minds . " the feathered death - it has landed , " blared a headline in the berliner zeitung newspaper heralding the arrival of bird flu in germany last week along with , if the media were to be believed , the three other horsemen of the apocalypse . adding to the hysteria was the fact that if germany were to empty its borders , where would the escapees flee to ?
pestilence was everywhere .
not a corner of the globe was untouched .
poultry magnates considering the end of their empires must have seriously been considering investing their last euros in space tourism . as the people of europe looked to their leaders for guidance , some like germany 's chancellor merkel could barely hide their concern .
" the situation is very serious , " merkel said after a personal visit to the northern german island of rügen after avian flu struck there . everything seemed to add up to a doomsday scenario , a worldwide crisis which would sell a million copies in paperback if there would be anyone left alive to read it . welcome to the age of bird flu psychosis . the lethal h5n1 virus landed in western europe last week for the first time , littering parts of italy , greece , france , germany and austria with the carcasses of dead migratory birds and those domestic winged victims who were unlucky enough to fraternize with the infected before they quacked their last . a global panic six years in the making bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asia 's harsh lesson should have been learned sooner by europe it should have come as little surprise .
bird flu had been winging its way to europe , slowly but surely , since the disease first emerged in hong kong in 1997 .
it took its time but eventually made it to europe 's borders in october when it claimed a handful of teenage human victims and thousands of feathered fatalities on its way into the eu . six years .
plenty of time , one would imagine , for european leaders and health experts to have some sort of plan ready .
but when the first cases cropped up in italy and greece , the authorities were as shocked as anyone .
when the northern german island of rügen reported a batch of dead swans , it remained that way for some time because of a conflict between federal state and district laws which prevented the authorities from sending in a clean-up team immediately . the fact that governments and health organizations around the world seem to be at a loss to stop the spread of the virus and have no tried and tested means to cure the disease once it is contracted by humans could rightly cause some concern .
but the reactions of the general public , at the moment at least , far outstrip the actual threat . depression , suicide and poultry embargoes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the poultry industry is beginning to feel the heat in italy , for instance , the threat of unemployment due to the poultry industry being hit by panic embargoes on chicken caused one delivery man to kill his wife and child and then himself in a fit of manic depression . " he was very worried because we told him there 'd be less work because of the crisis , " an official from the man ’ s firm told the newspaper la repubblica .
it is by far the most extreme case recorded so far but there is no doubt that a lot more people are concerned to a lesser degree .
since the beginning of last week , the italian health ministry has received more than 13,000 phone calls to a special bird flu hotline to report dead birds or ask for advice . german red tape and insecurity fuels public confusion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin gave its fallen blackbird a guard of honor in germany , citizens have been urged to report dead birds to the police in an attempt to limit the impact after the rügen outbreak spread to the mainland .
such is the concern that a dead blackbird in a berlin suburb required what the attending fire chief called " a full state funeral " when a decontamination team in full bio-suits turned up to remove the corpse .
and help lines in germany have been inundated with calls from concerned people . a spokesperson for the federal ministry of food , agriculture and consumer protection told dw-world that while there were no official caller numbers available , a conservative estimate would be in the " high hundreds . "
all nine hot lines , however , were constantly engaged suggesting the estimate is very conservative . georg alpers , a psychologist at the university of würzburg believes that it is the not knowing which is causing most of the panic .
" we do not know at the moment what the concrete dangers are , how we could protect ourselves from these possible dangers and whether we are actually in danger .
from such insecurity , fear can grow . "
special effort required to catch bird flu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the experts deal with infected birds so you do n't have to while there is little doubt that a human bird flu pandemic is a possibility , scientists are increasingly stressing the ' if ' rather than ' when ' argument - and many believe it is a large ' if ' .
right now , to contract bird flu one would have to visit a contaminated area and have sustained contact with an infected bird or corpse , something most conscientious people would no doubt do their utmost to avoid . if the disease were to mutate into a version that could pass easily from one person to another - the main fear of health experts - then there would be more reason for concern .
a strong form of the virus would send the death rate - and the panic levels - sky high . but the strength of that version of the virus is also a matter of debate .
many scientists believe the human form could be milder than that affecting birds .
also , the disease appears to be treatable with the antiviral drug , tamiflu -lrb- oseltamvir -rrb- , which is known to be effective in the early stages or as a preventative treatment . in the context of world population , infection negligible so far , the virus has infected 169 people in seven countries , killing 91 , according to the world health organization .
despite the mortality rate being just under 50 percent , in relation to the combined population figures of those seven countries , the number of people infected is minute and those who have died even more so . the fact is the threat is real and people have died .
but as the situation stands at the moment , the threat to humans is negligible .

plenty of time , one would imagine , for european leaders and health experts to have some sort of plan ready .
but when the first cases cropped up in italy and greece , the authorities were as shocked as anyone .
when the northern german island of rügen reported a batch of dead swans , it remained that way for some time because of a conflict between federal state and district laws which prevented the authorities from sending in a clean-up team immediately . the fact that governments and health organizations around the world seem to be at a loss to stop the spread of the virus and have no tried and tested means to cure the disease once it is contracted by humans could rightly cause some concern .
but the reactions of the general public , at the moment at least , far outstrip the actual threat . depression , suicide and poultry embargoes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the poultry industry is beginning to feel the heat in italy , for instance , the threat of unemployment due to the poultry industry being hit by panic embargoes on chicken caused one delivery man to kill his wife and child and then himself in a fit of manic depression . " he was very worried because we told him there 'd be less work because of the crisis , " an official from the man ’ s firm told the newspaper la repubblica .
it is by far the most extreme case recorded so far but there is no doubt that a lot more people are concerned to a lesser degree .
since the beginning of last week , the italian health ministry has received more than 13,000 phone calls to a special bird flu hotline to report dead birds or ask for advice . german red tape and insecurity fuels public confusion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin gave its fallen blackbird a guard of honor in germany , citizens have been urged to report dead birds to the police in an attempt to limit the impact after the rügen outbreak spread to the mainland .
such is the concern that a dead blackbird in a berlin suburb required what the attending fire chief called " a full state funeral " when a decontamination team in full bio-suits turned up to remove the corpse .
and help lines in germany have been inundated with calls from concerned people . a spokesperson for the federal ministry of food , agriculture and consumer protection told dw-world that while there were no official caller numbers available , a conservative estimate would be in the " high hundreds . "
all nine hot lines , however , were constantly engaged suggesting the estimate is very conservative . georg alpers , a psychologist at the university of würzburg believes that it is the not knowing which is causing most of the panic .
" we do not know at the moment what the concrete dangers are , how we could protect ourselves from these possible dangers and whether we are actually in danger .
from such insecurity , fear can grow . "
special effort required to catch bird flu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the experts deal with infected birds so you do n't have to while there is little doubt that a human bird flu pandemic is a possibility , scientists are increasingly stressing the ' if ' rather than ' when ' argument - and many believe it is a large ' if ' .
right now , to contract bird flu one would have to visit a contaminated area and have sustained contact with an infected bird or corpse , something most conscientious people would no doubt do their utmost to avoid . if the disease were to mutate into a version that could pass easily from one person to another - the main fear of health experts - then there would be more reason for concern .
a strong form of the virus would send the death rate - and the panic levels - sky high . but the strength of that version of the virus is also a matter of debate .
many scientists believe the human form could be milder than that affecting birds .
also , the disease appears to be treatable with the antiviral drug , tamiflu -lrb- oseltamvir -rrb- , which is known to be effective in the early stages or as a preventative treatment . in the context of world population , infection negligible so far , the virus has infected 169 people in seven countries , killing 91 , according to the world health organization .
despite the mortality rate being just under 50 percent , in relation to the combined population figures of those seven countries , the number of people infected is minute and those who have died even more so . the fact is the threat is real and people have died .

but few people know that two-thirds of them went to army-sponsored athletes . the german army spends 25 million euros -lrb- $ 30 million -rrb- per year on sports training and it certainly seems to be getting its money 's worth . when sylke otto , silke kraushaar and tatjana hüfner won gold , silver and bronze in the luge competition last week , the victory was theirs - and the german army 's . ditto for kati wilhelm , who took a gold in biathlon -lrb- cross-country skiing and target shooting -rrb- , andre lang , who won a gold medal in the two-man bobsled , and the women 's cross-country ski team , which got a silver medal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kati wilhelm got gold for biathlon all of these athletes were competing for germany - but also for the german army , or bundeswehr .
they are all soldiers in the athletics-training department of the army where they prepared for the turin games . ' just one responsibility : training ' a total of 72 bundeswehr athletes are competing in turin .
that 's nearly half of germany 's 161-person team .
petty officer uwe witte , a trainer in the german army 's athletics-training division in the town of warendorf said there 's a reason why the bundeswehr program is so successful . " all their -lrb- the athletes ' -rrb- other responsibilities - school , family , household - disappear . here they can concentrate entirely on their sport .
of course , if you look at their schedule , there is not a lot of extra time to take care of other things . " the army has 22 sports-training departments across germany .
altogether , they support 744 athletes in 70 different sports .
such specialized athletics departments arose out of a decision the german parliament made in 1968 to promote sports in the country and to primarily rope in the army for that purpose . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luge slider sylke otto won a gold medal in turin georg remmert , who is temporarily in charge of the warendorf athletics-training department , said the training programs work both ways . " we are mostly here for the people who ca n't finance their training themselves .
in other words , the army is a kind of social net , " he said .
" it gives the athletes the security to be able to pursue their sport to such a degree of excellence .
in turn it shows the bundeswehr and germany in a good light internationally . " but only those who are already very accomplished athletes can be sponsored .
all those who have already made it to the national squad in their sport can apply .
in other words , the athletes are already very successful when they they are accepted into the army 's program . they are then assigned a trainer and are also meant to start following a normal soldier 's basic training .
later , they only need to fulfill 30 percent of a soldier 's normal duties ; the other 70 percent of their time is free for athletic training . best for winter sports the system seems to work especially well for winter sport athletes .
of 744 army athletes , only 200 are in winter sports , but they rack up the most successes .
much of that has to do with the popularity of winter sports in germany and particulary in the army .
further , athletes also have good infrastructure and training possibilies for winter olympic sports within germany . on top of that , " there are just fewer nations who do these winter sports , " said uwe witte .
" in turin , 84 countries are competing .
in contrast , there are 200 countries competing in the summer olympics .
-lrb- in summer -rrb- the spectrum of competing athletes is much bigger . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weight training rooms are used by regular soldiers too witte added that the bundeswehr placed great emphasis on supporting young , up-and-coming athletes .
" here , young people are pushed to be top in their field , in contrast to sponsorship by large companies , which is mostly aimed at a few very top athletes , " he said . josef nehren , head of the sports department of the bundeswehr , has high expectations for germany 's success in turin .
in salt lake city , in 2002 , soldiers took 25 of the total 35 medals that went to germany . " that is definitely good publicity .
but for me it is more important that it shows that our system is good , and that it works well when it is used right .
it also shows that money is being used well , " he said . julia spurzem -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de winter olympics in turin the 20th winter olympics kicked off on feb .

but few people know that two-thirds of them went to army-sponsored athletes . the german army spends 25 million euros -lrb- $ 30 million -rrb- per year on sports training and it certainly seems to be getting its money 's worth . when sylke otto , silke kraushaar and tatjana hüfner won gold , silver and bronze in the luge competition last week , the victory was theirs - and the german army 's . ditto for kati wilhelm , who took a gold in biathlon -lrb- cross-country skiing and target shooting -rrb- , andre lang , who won a gold medal in the two-man bobsled , and the women 's cross-country ski team , which got a silver medal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kati wilhelm got gold for biathlon all of these athletes were competing for germany - but also for the german army , or bundeswehr .
they are all soldiers in the athletics-training department of the army where they prepared for the turin games . ' just one responsibility : training ' a total of 72 bundeswehr athletes are competing in turin .
that 's nearly half of germany 's 161-person team .
petty officer uwe witte , a trainer in the german army 's athletics-training division in the town of warendorf said there 's a reason why the bundeswehr program is so successful . " all their -lrb- the athletes ' -rrb- other responsibilities - school , family , household - disappear . here they can concentrate entirely on their sport .
of course , if you look at their schedule , there is not a lot of extra time to take care of other things . " the army has 22 sports-training departments across germany .
altogether , they support 744 athletes in 70 different sports .
such specialized athletics departments arose out of a decision the german parliament made in 1968 to promote sports in the country and to primarily rope in the army for that purpose . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luge slider sylke otto won a gold medal in turin georg remmert , who is temporarily in charge of the warendorf athletics-training department , said the training programs work both ways . " we are mostly here for the people who ca n't finance their training themselves .
in other words , the army is a kind of social net , " he said .
" it gives the athletes the security to be able to pursue their sport to such a degree of excellence .
in turn it shows the bundeswehr and germany in a good light internationally . " but only those who are already very accomplished athletes can be sponsored .
all those who have already made it to the national squad in their sport can apply .
in other words , the athletes are already very successful when they they are accepted into the army 's program . they are then assigned a trainer and are also meant to start following a normal soldier 's basic training .
later , they only need to fulfill 30 percent of a soldier 's normal duties ; the other 70 percent of their time is free for athletic training . best for winter sports the system seems to work especially well for winter sport athletes .
of 744 army athletes , only 200 are in winter sports , but they rack up the most successes .
much of that has to do with the popularity of winter sports in germany and particulary in the army .
further , athletes also have good infrastructure and training possibilies for winter olympic sports within germany . on top of that , " there are just fewer nations who do these winter sports , " said uwe witte .
" in turin , 84 countries are competing .
in contrast , there are 200 countries competing in the summer olympics .
-lrb- in summer -rrb- the spectrum of competing athletes is much bigger . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weight training rooms are used by regular soldiers too witte added that the bundeswehr placed great emphasis on supporting young , up-and-coming athletes .
" here , young people are pushed to be top in their field , in contrast to sponsorship by large companies , which is mostly aimed at a few very top athletes , " he said . josef nehren , head of the sports department of the bundeswehr , has high expectations for germany 's success in turin .
in salt lake city , in 2002 , soldiers took 25 of the total 35 medals that went to germany . " that is definitely good publicity .
but for me it is more important that it shows that our system is good , and that it works well when it is used right .
it also shows that money is being used well , " he said . julia spurzem -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de winter olympics in turin the 20th winter olympics kicked off on feb .

traditionally , no topic is sacred during this time .
but the ongoing controversy over caricatures of the prophet mohammed will stay out of the festivities . a carnival skit poking fun at pope benedict xvi has raised a debate on just how far political cabaret can satirize certain topics . the carnival gala stunksitzung plans to show the sketch in which pope benedict xvi as a pop star and the archbishop of cologne , cardinal joachim meisner , as a wannabe pop star lie in a bed together .
the two end up smooching . a private citizen has now pressed charges against the stunksitzung for " disrupting religious peace . "
public television channel wdr , which will broadcast the gala on saturday , has decided to cut out the controversial part .
the station said its policies prescribed respect of religious feelings , which they said would have been hurt if the skit was broadcast . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should satire be allowed to present the pope as a pop star ? winni rau , spokesman for the stunksitzung , said the skit was an interpretation of the pope 's pop star qualities during world youth day , which took place in cologne last summer .
he said he did n't agree with wdr 's decision . " what is satire allowed to do in the western world ? "
rau said .
" we can debate this issue , but not forbid it . " rau said he wished wdr would have had " more courage . "
" i really think it 's a shame , " he said .
" it could have showed that we here in the west can also mock our own culture and religion . " people have to be able to handle satire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rote funken are a popular carnival society the stunksitzung is an alternative to the traditional galas , which mainly take place in the german karneval strongholds cologne , düsseldorf and mainz .
the galas are a regular part of the so-called " fifth season " between its kick-off on nov .
11 and the actual carnival week , which starts on the thursday before ash wednesday .
they include singing and dancing , but also orators , who address various political and societal topics . rau said the stunksitzung considers itself political cabaret . " this satire can and should also be directed against the church or political topics , " rau said .
" in the case of cabaret or satire , people have to be able to take it .
it is part of our culture . " cologne just wants to have fun bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you 'll find more happy than sad clowns in cologne in cologne , though , political and socio-critical issues have never been at the top of the carnival agenda , and they wo n't be this year either . " our philosophy is that carnival should be fun and friendly , " said sigrid krebs , spokeswoman for the city 's carnival committee . krebs said there would be satirical floats in the rosenmontag parade on carnival monday , one of the highlights of the " fifth season . " " but they have never been aimed at harming or offending people nor will they in the future , " krebs said . düsseldorf wants to avoid religious provocation just 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- further north , in düsseldorf , political and religious critique have been much more common in the past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this float had the motto " fostering tradition " last year , a float showed cardinal meisner striking a match to a woman tied to the stake , the words " i had an abortion " written on her .
in 2003 , the düsseldorf procession showed angela merkel , today 's chancellor , coming out of uncle sam 's behind - a statement on her support for the us invasion of iraq . bernd jost , spokesman for the düsseldorf carnival committee , said there would not be any floats dealing with religion this year . " in view of the current debate , we will be keeping very clear of things related to muslims , " jost said .
" we do n't want to fuel hatred . " according to jost , the well-being of the parade spectators was the top priority for the committee . the cartoon controversy is also not an issue on the agenda in the third carnival stronghold , mainz .
local and national issues are more a priority in the city 's rosenmontag parade . turning the world on its head karneval has its origins in the middle ages and is traditionally a roman catholic celebration .
it is closely associated with easter , as it always ends on ash wednesday , marking the beginning of lent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a so-called mullahburger , shown in düsseldorf last year , does not reflect carnival tradition parody and mockery are part of its tradition , said matthias von der bank , a historian from cologne 's carnival museum . " but it was n't satire like we have today , " von der bank said . " in the middle ages , carnival was a festival of reverse worlds and a playful expression of this , " von der bank said .
" so christian symbols , for example , were turned upside down . " but , he added , slandering the church was and is not part of carnival 's festivities . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de young carnival prince is also integration success story this year , the town of wesseling has dubbed a tunisian boy its traditional carnival prince .

the foreign minister pointed out that the present government grand coalition of social democrats and christian democrats were in favor of deciding the issue on a european level . at the same time steinmeier added that germany already had one of the strictest export restrictions in the eu and added that even a lifting of the eu arms embargo would n't lead to " a more liberal approach -lrb- towards china -rrb- in germany . "
the latter was also one of former chancellor schröder 's main arguments as he pushed for the eu to drop the existing arms ban . business high on the agenda but , away from the arms embargo issue , which is unlikely to go down well with chinese leaders , much of steinmeier 's visit is likely to be consumed by business talk . germany and china have cooperated closely in the areas of culture , science , environmental protection .
the two countries are engaged in a dialogue about the rule of law and - last but not least - have established strong business ties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view of the shanghai skyline germany is china 's strongest european economic partner and china remains germany 's most important market in asia .
former german chancellor gerhard schröder has played a central role in promoting these ties : during his time in office , he traveled to the country six times , a large delegation of german business leaders in tow . steinmeier will also visit china with a group of representatives from german companies - albeit mid-sized ones .
as he already announced when taking over the foreign office from his predecessor , joschka fischer , steinmeier seems to see the support of german business interests as one of his ministry 's duties . more pushy tha n schröder ? while steinmeier served as schröder 's chief-of-staff and was likely supportive of the latter 's pragmatic approach towards china and russia when it came to addressing human rights , as foreign minister , he 's not going to be able to avoid the issue , according to experts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor schröder inspects a traditonal chinese dragon " he knows that this is an important element of german domestic politics , " said eberhard sandschneider , an expert on china at the german council on foreign relations .
" the german public expects a german politician to address this sensitive topic .
but frank-walter steinmeier is experienced enough to know that he will not be able to bring about any immediate changes this way . " members of china 's opposition in germany still have high hopes for the new german government .
last week , they sent a letter to the foreign ministry to inform the minister about the human rights situation in china . urgi n g more participatio n as global player but apart from this rather unpleasant topic for steinmeier 's hosts , the foreign minister will also try and encourage china 's leaders to step up to the plate when it comes to taking on responsibility as a world power . " such an emerging giant needs to take on global responsibilities , " said steinmeiner , who will also prepare chancellor angela merkel 's visit that 's likely to take place in july . " he really means the question of how to deal with iran , " sandschneider said .
" china has a very , very important role to play - in case of a vote in the un security council , for example .
getting china to actively cooperate with the west in this respect is an important goal . " the problem of copyright protectio n copyright protection will be another item high on steinmeier 's agenda as the chinese are known not to take this too seriously .
german companies meanwhile lose billions each year because of product piracy .
and only last week , china announced plans to build its own high speed train based on the german-made transrapid magnet rail , pushing the problem if technology theft in the foreground yet again . " it 's a very difficult issue for many german companies and german foreign policy , " sanschneider said .
" it will certainly be discussed , but the chinese answer is already clear : the government will signal that it is working to improve the situation , but that it will take years for this to happen .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 21.02.2006 opinion : turkish film makes waves in germany - unnecessarily großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reactions to the movie have been explosive in germany a turkish action film about the iraq war , " valley of the wolves , " has unleashed a wave of outrage in germany .
but as baha güngör observes , both positive and negative reactions to the movie are over the top . the most expensive turkish movie of all time , " valley of the wolves , " does nothing to contribute to an inter-cultural dialogue .
it can neither be interpreted as pro-european nor deemed to promote the integration of turks and muslims in germany or other eu countries .
but that was never the film 's intention . " valley of the wolves " is an action film , which uses anti-american cliches to build on a very real political sentiment .
and it does n't stop there .
besides the americans who are portrayed as the main bad guys , it flirts with an anti-semitic cliche in the form of a jewish doctor who works alongside trigger-happy americans in the human organ trade .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the film is ranked five at german box offices the film has drawn excited enthusiasm among turkish viewers and harsh criticism from elsewhere .
both are exaggerated .
germany 's conservatives have slammed the film as " morally harmful for young people " and a threat to societal harmony .
there have even been calls for the film to be withdrawn from general release , but they serve only to heighten interest therein . seen it all before foolish is the high praise lavished on the film - which is based on a true story deemed degrading in turkey - by turkish state and government representatives .
" valley of the wolves " tells the tale of the arrest of a turkish special unit by us troops in the kurdish region of northern iraq .
but beyond that , it is a fictitious action film that is of no greater artistic merit than many us kick-boxing and rambo pictures which frequently discredit other countries and peoples .
there are hundreds of such films which simplify entire cultural circles , depicting them in a negative light , as aggressive , dangerous or even murderous . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from valley of the wolves even the turks have felt disparaged by such movies , the most prominent example being the film " midnight express " from 1978 .
it showed the humiliating treatment of people in turkish jail and had countless turks on the warpath .
the depiction was no lie , but that did n't make the movie politically challenging .
" midnight express " belongs in the category " unavoidable , " like so many other films that , for example , show the horror of atrocities committed by former european colonial powers across the world . the truth is , in this global age , in which bans can only ever be imposed within national boundaries , we have to live with films like " valley of the wolves . "
not least because us policy on iraq is a constant source of good material for filmmakers with an interest in the subject . baha güngör -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german calls to ban controversial turkish movie on iraq german political leaders and jewish community representatives have demanded the boycott of a hit turkish action movie that casts us soldiers in iraq as villains .

but germany is hoping a state visit to japan will boost long-standing economic ties with that country . even though china has become the most important trade partner for german business in asia , german investors are keen on japan .
and for its part , japanese business appreciates germany as an " environmentally conscious " country . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier visited tokyo on tuesday , on his first asia tour since taking office in november under chancellor angela merkel .
steinmeier , who heads wednesday to beijing on a three-nation tour that began in south korea , called china 's rising clout on the world economic and political stage " a new challenge . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier met with his japanese counterpart , taro aso , on tuesday yet in talks with japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi , he stressed that japan , the world 's second-largest economy , and third-ranked germany could work together on a range of fields .
seeking cooperation " there are many common concerns between germany and japan .
we must tighten our relationship of cooperation , " he said .
" japan and germany can work together to set example for other countries . " in general , german business seems to agree with him .
for many years , japan was germany 's most important trade partner in the asia-pacific region - until china began opening its economy , hitting the world market like a tornado . at the end of 2002 , the volume of german-chinese trade overtook that of germany and japan .
today , german-japanese trade is worth around 43 billion euros -lrb- $ 51.2 billion -rrb- compared to 50 billion in china .
while in 2002 german direct investment in japan still outpaced that of china , by 2004 that had changed .
germany invested 653 million euros in japan in 2004 , according to germany 's foreign ministry , while the investment in china reached 1.06 billion for the same period , according to china 's foreign trade office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if both countries work together , perhaps everyone can make some money yet despite the lure of china and its massive market potential , many german companies have n't lost interest in japan . " a german company that is active in japan does n't get into the chinese market , " said wolfgang klenner , an east asia expert from the ruhr university in bochum . for one thing , the markets are entirely different .
" in japan , you can only get anywhere if you have the newest technologies and patents .
in china , the danger of piracy is too great , " he said .
klenner posits that the reason so many germans stick to investing in japan is that country 's reliable - and familiar - legal system . different markets business prospects for investors in japan are particularly good in the energy and environmental sectors .
japan needs to import nearly all its raw materials . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is a leader in wind power technology " in terms of energy production , japan is interested in anything that can make it more independent and stronger , " said markus taube of the east asia institute at the university of duisberg-essen .
this provides an opportunity for german business : the japanese are world leaders in solar energy , and germany leads in other areas of alternative energy production . wind energy , for example , is an area that japan wants to expand .
the country is on a mission to expand its wind-energy production eightfold , up to 3,000 megawatts by 2010 . germany 's environmental image germany is also a preferred partner for the japanese when it comes to environmental protection . " germany has the clear image in japan of an environmentally conscious country , " said friederike bosse of the association of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- .
scientific exchange in this area is also strong , and bosse said she believes german-japanese economic relations will benefit in the future from much of the academic cooperation that is currently underway . given these common interests , german business should take care not to lose sight of japan as a strategic economic partner , according to bochum university 's klenner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's growth is legendary , as is its building boom " japan is always underestimated , " klenner said .
" even if everyone is always talking about china , the real giant in asia and the world economy is japan . " it is an opinion that markus taube shares .
as soon as the german and japanese economies recover , and consumer spending increases , trade between the two nations will increase as well , he said . until then , however , china is the ideal land for racking up sales , both for japan and germany .
bosse , of the german industry association , said this brings up another trend worth looking at - german-japanese joint ventures in china . match made in heaven ? " germans and japanese are increasingly forming joint ventures .
they want to see if together , they can succeed in the chinese market . " it could be a match made in heaven , bosse believes .
unlike the japanese , the germans were not historical enemies of the chinese .
and the japanese can understand the asian market better . sonja lindenberg -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g4 knocks on security council doors again along with japan , brazil and india , german foreign minister fischer on thursday renewed calls for permanent security council membership , on the sidelines of the un world summit in new york .

it added that the german agents refused to be drawn in , but that 25 of 125 bnd reports were officially passed on to the us . according to the paper , the parliamentary control commission , which is charged with reviewing certain secret service activities , has all the information in the confidential report and will meet in berlin on wednesday to debate just how much of it should be made public . that decision could cause the opposition green party , which was the junior partner in schröder 's government , to rethink its objection to a parliamentary inquiry over the role of the bnd during the war , the newspaper wrote .

to do this , it plans to modernize its manifesto .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a weak election result forced the cdu to govern with the spd by claiming a phrase historically associated with workers ' parties and the opposing social democrats - solidarity - the cdu is seen to be angling for more support after a razor-thin win at the polls last year .
' solidarity is patriotism ' solidarity needs to be seen on a par with basic values like freedom and justice , in order to keep germany on the right path , merkel said .
sounding more like the leader of a workers ' union than a conservative government , merkel said : " we have to remain in a country where solidarity is practiced without asking about the material gains . "
" freedom and solidarity - for us , this combination is not unattainable , " merkel told the party faithful .
" the ability to exercise solidarity is perhaps one of the most important patriotic abilities . "
questioning the social-market economy the most important thing is for the cdu to take a new look at germany 's social-market economy , merkel said .
in her first big party speech since being elected to office nearly 100 days ago , merkel noted that the party 's current manifesto , created in 1994 , " fails to answer a whole array " of modern-day questions .
that is especially true when it comes to social and economic policies , she said .
" we want to secure the future of the social-market economy .
but we realize that with globalization , certain basic conditions have changed , " she said .
as a result , people are rejecting germany 's current economic model .
" only a minority considers the social-market economy to be fair , " merkel said .
christianity at the base party members and committees will meet repeatedly to discuss the new manifesto between now and late 2007 , when it will be put up for a vote .
merkel said the basis of the cdu manifesto needs to be christian values , and warned that the party has to " figure out what it can absolutely not afford to lose . "
she urged the cdu to discuss basic values with people from other countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heiner geißler of the cdu the party also unveiled a new motto , " new justice through more freedom . " ex-cdu general secretary heiner geißler told the express newspaper he thought the motto was " backwards , " adding that freedom alone can not bring about justice . and michael sommer , head of the association of german unions , told the kölner stadt anzeiger that the cdu seemed to be on a course of " basic social renovation . "
the discussion " reflects the fact that in germany , you ca n't get a majority of votes with neo-liberal rhetoric , " he said . a number of active members concentrated on the idea that the cdu should stress its roots in christian belief and values .
the head of the cdu 's workers ' wing , karl laumann , told the passauer neuen presse that the cdu " needs to unconditionally stand up for christian social teachings and social justice .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 21.02.2006 despite china , germany keeps eye on japanese business großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany hopes to boost economic ties to japan these days , china is the first country everyone thinks of when the topic is asian trade .
but germany is hoping a state visit to japan will boost long-standing economic ties with that country . even though china has become the most important trade partner for german business in asia , german investors are keen on japan .
and for its part , japanese business appreciates germany as an " environmentally conscious " country . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier visited tokyo on tuesday , on his first asia tour since taking office in november under chancellor angela merkel .
steinmeier , who heads wednesday to beijing on a three-nation tour that began in south korea , called china 's rising clout on the world economic and political stage " a new challenge . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier met with his japanese counterpart , taro aso , on tuesday yet in talks with japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi , he stressed that japan , the world 's second-largest economy , and third-ranked germany could work together on a range of fields .
seeking cooperation " there are many common concerns between germany and japan .
we must tighten our relationship of cooperation , " he said .
" japan and germany can work together to set example for other countries . " in general , german business seems to agree with him .
for many years , japan was germany 's most important trade partner in the asia-pacific region - until china began opening its economy , hitting the world market like a tornado . at the end of 2002 , the volume of german-chinese trade overtook that of germany and japan .
today , german-japanese trade is worth around 43 billion euros -lrb- $ 51.2 billion -rrb- compared to 50 billion in china .
while in 2002 german direct investment in japan still outpaced that of china , by 2004 that had changed .
germany invested 653 million euros in japan in 2004 , according to germany 's foreign ministry , while the investment in china reached 1.06 billion for the same period , according to china 's foreign trade office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if both countries work together , perhaps everyone can make some money yet despite the lure of china and its massive market potential , many german companies have n't lost interest in japan . " a german company that is active in japan does n't get into the chinese market , " said wolfgang klenner , an east asia expert from the ruhr university in bochum . for one thing , the markets are entirely different .
" in japan , you can only get anywhere if you have the newest technologies and patents .
in china , the danger of piracy is too great , " he said .
klenner posits that the reason so many germans stick to investing in japan is that country 's reliable - and familiar - legal system . different markets business prospects for investors in japan are particularly good in the energy and environmental sectors .
japan needs to import nearly all its raw materials . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is a leader in wind power technology " in terms of energy production , japan is interested in anything that can make it more independent and stronger , " said markus taube of the east asia institute at the university of duisberg-essen .
this provides an opportunity for german business : the japanese are world leaders in solar energy , and germany leads in other areas of alternative energy production . wind energy , for example , is an area that japan wants to expand .
the country is on a mission to expand its wind-energy production eightfold , up to 3,000 megawatts by 2010 . germany 's environmental image germany is also a preferred partner for the japanese when it comes to environmental protection . " germany has the clear image in japan of an environmentally conscious country , " said friederike bosse of the association of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- .
scientific exchange in this area is also strong , and bosse said she believes german-japanese economic relations will benefit in the future from much of the academic cooperation that is currently underway . given these common interests , german business should take care not to lose sight of japan as a strategic economic partner , according to bochum university 's klenner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's growth is legendary , as is its building boom " japan is always underestimated , " klenner said .
" even if everyone is always talking about china , the real giant in asia and the world economy is japan . " it is an opinion that markus taube shares .
as soon as the german and japanese economies recover , and consumer spending increases , trade between the two nations will increase as well , he said . until then , however , china is the ideal land for racking up sales , both for japan and germany .
bosse , of the german industry association , said this brings up another trend worth looking at - german-japanese joint ventures in china . match made in heaven ? " germans and japanese are increasingly forming joint ventures .
they want to see if together , they can succeed in the chinese market . " it could be a match made in heaven , bosse believes .
unlike the japanese , the germans were not historical enemies of the chinese .
and the japanese can understand the asian market better . sonja lindenberg -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g4 knocks on security council doors again along with japan , brazil and india , german foreign minister fischer on thursday renewed calls for permanent security council membership , on the sidelines of the un world summit in new york .

the foreign minister pointed out that the present government grand coalition of social democrats and christian democrats were in favor of deciding the issue on a european level . at the same time steinmeier added that germany already had one of the strictest export restrictions in the eu and added that even a lifting of the eu arms embargo would n't lead to " a more liberal approach -lrb- towards china -rrb- in germany . "
the latter was also one of former chancellor schröder 's main arguments as he pushed for the eu to drop the existing arms ban . business high on the agenda but , away from the arms embargo issue , which is unlikely to go down well with chinese leaders , much of steinmeier 's visit is likely to be consumed by business talk . germany and china have cooperated closely in the areas of culture , science , environmental protection .
the two countries are engaged in a dialogue about the rule of law and - last but not least - have established strong business ties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view of the shanghai skyline germany is china 's strongest european economic partner and china remains germany 's most important market in asia .
former german chancellor gerhard schröder has played a central role in promoting these ties : during his time in office , he traveled to the country six times , a large delegation of german business leaders in tow . steinmeier will also visit china with a group of representatives from german companies - albeit mid-sized ones .
as he already announced when taking over the foreign office from his predecessor , joschka fischer , steinmeier seems to see the support of german business interests as one of his ministry 's duties . more pushy tha n schröder ? while steinmeier served as schröder 's chief-of-staff and was likely supportive of the latter 's pragmatic approach towards china and russia when it came to addressing human rights , as foreign minister , he 's not going to be able to avoid the issue , according to experts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor schröder inspects a traditonal chinese dragon " he knows that this is an important element of german domestic politics , " said eberhard sandschneider , an expert on china at the german council on foreign relations .
" the german public expects a german politician to address this sensitive topic .
but frank-walter steinmeier is experienced enough to know that he will not be able to bring about any immediate changes this way . " members of china 's opposition in germany still have high hopes for the new german government .
last week , they sent a letter to the foreign ministry to inform the minister about the human rights situation in china . urgi n g more participatio n as global player but apart from this rather unpleasant topic for steinmeier 's hosts , the foreign minister will also try and encourage china 's leaders to step up to the plate when it comes to taking on responsibility as a world power . " such an emerging giant needs to take on global responsibilities , " said steinmeiner , who will also prepare chancellor angela merkel 's visit that 's likely to take place in july . " he really means the question of how to deal with iran , " sandschneider said .
" china has a very , very important role to play - in case of a vote in the un security council , for example .
getting china to actively cooperate with the west in this respect is an important goal . " the problem of copyright protectio n copyright protection will be another item high on steinmeier 's agenda as the chinese are known not to take this too seriously .
german companies meanwhile lose billions each year because of product piracy .
and only last week , china announced plans to build its own high speed train based on the german-made transrapid magnet rail , pushing the problem if technology theft in the foreground yet again . " it 's a very difficult issue for many german companies and german foreign policy , " sanschneider said .
" it will certainly be discussed , but the chinese answer is already clear : the government will signal that it is working to improve the situation , but that it will take years for this to happen .

but germany is hoping a state visit to japan will boost long-standing economic ties with that country . even though china has become the most important trade partner for german business in asia , german investors are keen on japan .
and for its part , japanese business appreciates germany as an " environmentally conscious " country . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier visited tokyo on tuesday , on his first asia tour since taking office in november under chancellor angela merkel .
steinmeier , who heads wednesday to beijing on a three-nation tour that began in south korea , called china 's rising clout on the world economic and political stage " a new challenge . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier met with his japanese counterpart , taro aso , on tuesday yet in talks with japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi , he stressed that japan , the world 's second-largest economy , and third-ranked germany could work together on a range of fields .
seeking cooperation " there are many common concerns between germany and japan .
we must tighten our relationship of cooperation , " he said .
" japan and germany can work together to set example for other countries . " in general , german business seems to agree with him .
for many years , japan was germany 's most important trade partner in the asia-pacific region - until china began opening its economy , hitting the world market like a tornado . at the end of 2002 , the volume of german-chinese trade overtook that of germany and japan .
today , german-japanese trade is worth around 43 billion euros -lrb- $ 51.2 billion -rrb- compared to 50 billion in china .
while in 2002 german direct investment in japan still outpaced that of china , by 2004 that had changed .
germany invested 653 million euros in japan in 2004 , according to germany 's foreign ministry , while the investment in china reached 1.06 billion for the same period , according to china 's foreign trade office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if both countries work together , perhaps everyone can make some money yet despite the lure of china and its massive market potential , many german companies have n't lost interest in japan . " a german company that is active in japan does n't get into the chinese market , " said wolfgang klenner , an east asia expert from the ruhr university in bochum . for one thing , the markets are entirely different .
" in japan , you can only get anywhere if you have the newest technologies and patents .
in china , the danger of piracy is too great , " he said .
klenner posits that the reason so many germans stick to investing in japan is that country 's reliable - and familiar - legal system . different markets business prospects for investors in japan are particularly good in the energy and environmental sectors .
japan needs to import nearly all its raw materials . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is a leader in wind power technology " in terms of energy production , japan is interested in anything that can make it more independent and stronger , " said markus taube of the east asia institute at the university of duisberg-essen .
this provides an opportunity for german business : the japanese are world leaders in solar energy , and germany leads in other areas of alternative energy production . wind energy , for example , is an area that japan wants to expand .
the country is on a mission to expand its wind-energy production eightfold , up to 3,000 megawatts by 2010 . germany 's environmental image germany is also a preferred partner for the japanese when it comes to environmental protection . " germany has the clear image in japan of an environmentally conscious country , " said friederike bosse of the association of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- .
scientific exchange in this area is also strong , and bosse said she believes german-japanese economic relations will benefit in the future from much of the academic cooperation that is currently underway . given these common interests , german business should take care not to lose sight of japan as a strategic economic partner , according to bochum university 's klenner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's growth is legendary , as is its building boom " japan is always underestimated , " klenner said .

" some 800 participants attended a small party conference in berlin monday , where the topic on hand was a reassessment of the ruling christian democratic union 's values .
cdu leader angela merkel took the opportunity to call for fundamental change , but stressed the need to keep christian values at the core of the party 's ideology . in a debate that is expected to go on for two years , the cdu wants to refine its image within the " grand coalition " government -lrb- it currently shares power with the the social democrats . -rrb-
to do this , it plans to modernize its manifesto .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a weak election result forced the cdu to govern with the spd by claiming a phrase historically associated with workers ' parties and the opposing social democrats - solidarity - the cdu is seen to be angling for more support after a razor-thin win at the polls last year .
' solidarity is patriotism ' solidarity needs to be seen on a par with basic values like freedom and justice , in order to keep germany on the right path , merkel said .
sounding more like the leader of a workers ' union than a conservative government , merkel said : " we have to remain in a country where solidarity is practiced without asking about the material gains . "
" freedom and solidarity - for us , this combination is not unattainable , " merkel told the party faithful .
" the ability to exercise solidarity is perhaps one of the most important patriotic abilities . "
questioning the social-market economy the most important thing is for the cdu to take a new look at germany 's social-market economy , merkel said .
in her first big party speech since being elected to office nearly 100 days ago , merkel noted that the party 's current manifesto , created in 1994 , " fails to answer a whole array " of modern-day questions .
that is especially true when it comes to social and economic policies , she said .
" we want to secure the future of the social-market economy .
but we realize that with globalization , certain basic conditions have changed , " she said .
as a result , people are rejecting germany 's current economic model .
" only a minority considers the social-market economy to be fair , " merkel said .
christianity at the base party members and committees will meet repeatedly to discuss the new manifesto between now and late 2007 , when it will be put up for a vote .
merkel said the basis of the cdu manifesto needs to be christian values , and warned that the party has to " figure out what it can absolutely not afford to lose . "
she urged the cdu to discuss basic values with people from other countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heiner geißler of the cdu the party also unveiled a new motto , " new justice through more freedom . " ex-cdu general secretary heiner geißler told the express newspaper he thought the motto was " backwards , " adding that freedom alone can not bring about justice . and michael sommer , head of the association of german unions , told the kölner stadt anzeiger that the cdu seemed to be on a course of " basic social renovation . "
the discussion " reflects the fact that in germany , you ca n't get a majority of votes with neo-liberal rhetoric , " he said . a number of active members concentrated on the idea that the cdu should stress its roots in christian belief and values .
the head of the cdu 's workers ' wing , karl laumann , told the passauer neuen presse that the cdu " needs to unconditionally stand up for christian social teachings and social justice .

but as baha güngör observes , both positive and negative reactions to the movie are over the top . the most expensive turkish movie of all time , " valley of the wolves , " does nothing to contribute to an inter-cultural dialogue .
it can neither be interpreted as pro-european nor deemed to promote the integration of turks and muslims in germany or other eu countries .

" valley of the wolves " tells the tale of the arrest of a turkish special unit by us troops in the kurdish region of northern iraq .

a german newspaper has written that us intelligence services spied on two german agents who remained in iraq during the us-led war in 2003 . citing a confidential government paper , the leipziger volkszeitung daily said that reports from the two german federal intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- agents stationed in baghdad to the services headquarters near munich may have been intercepted by us sources using a satellite telephone . the newspaper said that , in addition the two agents - who are currently involved in a controversy over their exact role during the war to which then chancellor gerhard schröder was so vehemently opposed - were " repeatedly pressed " to provide war intelligence from baghdad to the us commando headquarters in qatar .
it added that the german agents refused to be drawn in , but that 25 of 125 bnd reports were officially passed on to the us . according to the paper , the parliamentary control commission , which is charged with reviewing certain secret service activities , has all the information in the confidential report and will meet in berlin on wednesday to debate just how much of it should be made public . that decision could cause the opposition green party , which was the junior partner in schröder 's government , to rethink its objection to a parliamentary inquiry over the role of the bnd during the war , the newspaper wrote .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 21.02.2006 opinion : turkish film makes waves in germany - unnecessarily großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reactions to the movie have been explosive in germany a turkish action film about the iraq war , " valley of the wolves , " has unleashed a wave of outrage in germany .
but as baha güngör observes , both positive and negative reactions to the movie are over the top . the most expensive turkish movie of all time , " valley of the wolves , " does nothing to contribute to an inter-cultural dialogue .
it can neither be interpreted as pro-european nor deemed to promote the integration of turks and muslims in germany or other eu countries .
but that was never the film 's intention . " valley of the wolves " is an action film , which uses anti-american cliches to build on a very real political sentiment .
and it does n't stop there .
besides the americans who are portrayed as the main bad guys , it flirts with an anti-semitic cliche in the form of a jewish doctor who works alongside trigger-happy americans in the human organ trade .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the film is ranked five at german box offices the film has drawn excited enthusiasm among turkish viewers and harsh criticism from elsewhere .
both are exaggerated .
germany 's conservatives have slammed the film as " morally harmful for young people " and a threat to societal harmony .
there have even been calls for the film to be withdrawn from general release , but they serve only to heighten interest therein . seen it all before foolish is the high praise lavished on the film - which is based on a true story deemed degrading in turkey - by turkish state and government representatives .
" valley of the wolves " tells the tale of the arrest of a turkish special unit by us troops in the kurdish region of northern iraq .
but beyond that , it is a fictitious action film that is of no greater artistic merit than many us kick-boxing and rambo pictures which frequently discredit other countries and peoples .
there are hundreds of such films which simplify entire cultural circles , depicting them in a negative light , as aggressive , dangerous or even murderous . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from valley of the wolves even the turks have felt disparaged by such movies , the most prominent example being the film " midnight express " from 1978 .
it showed the humiliating treatment of people in turkish jail and had countless turks on the warpath .
the depiction was no lie , but that did n't make the movie politically challenging .
" midnight express " belongs in the category " unavoidable , " like so many other films that , for example , show the horror of atrocities committed by former european colonial powers across the world . the truth is , in this global age , in which bans can only ever be imposed within national boundaries , we have to live with films like " valley of the wolves . "

in iran nuclear crisis , all eyes turn to russia world powers split over iran nuclear program iran calls un referral " the end of diplomacy " europe -pipe- 21.02.2006 iran hopeful about russian nuclear compromise plan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian officials will visit iran 's bushehr nuclear plant thursday iranian officials said tuesday they were hopeful a russian compromise to end the crisis over iran 's nuclear program would bear fruit , also hinting that they attached greater weight to it than to talks with the eu-3 . ali hosseini-tash , the deputy secretary of iran 's supreme national security council , said the negotiations in moscow had been positive and " give us the hope of reaching an agreement . " " the main question is the creation of a more normal situation and to reduce this tension so that we wo n't have people making unreasonable demands of each other , " he said before leaving for iran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sergey lavrov but russian foreign minister sergei lavrov was markedly more cautious . " i think it would be premature to use terms such as failure or success , " he told reporters . russia , as a veto-wielding member of the un security council with traditionally close ties to iran , has long tried to mediate in the long-running dispute over its partner 's nuclear program .
its proposal is to create a joint venture that would enrich uranium for tehran 's energy needs on russian soil . russia sees it as a means of getting iran to reinstate its moratorium on uranium enrichment work , after tehran broke seals at three nuclear facilities last month and signaled its intention to resume nuclear work . iran stresses talks with russia , not eu the proposal by moscow has been cautiously welcomed by western countries , which suspect iran 's stated intention to develop peaceful nuclear energy is simply a cover for developing atomic weapons . iranian officials have also hinted that they attach greater significance to negotiations with moscow rather than with the eu troika of germany , france and britain who have been holding on-and-off talks with teheran for over two years . " our contacts with the european union will for the moment not be held only with the eu-3 , but also in a unilateral manner with the different countries of the european union , " mottaki told reporters following talks on monday with eu officials in brussels . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said on a visit to japan that diplomacy can still work in resolving the iranian nuclear standoff even though economic sanctions can not be ruled out .
" the issue of a military option does not arise , " steinmeier told a news conference .
" we must show imagination and take advantage of different diplomatic possibilities . "
" i do not believe economic sanctions are imminent .
but we can not completely rule out imposing sanctions , " he said . russians to visit iranian nuclear plant bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : technical staff at the isfahan uranium conversion facility in central iran russian negotiators continued to press iran at the talks to stop enrichment work , russian foreign ministry spokesman mikhail kamynin said . moscow called on iran " to return to a moratorium regime on all types on work on uranium enrichment including scientific research and construction work , " kamynin was quoted by the official itar-tass news agency as saying . the talks in moscow are to be followed up with a visit to iran on thursday by the head of russia 's atomic energy agency rosatom , sergei kiriyenko .
he is due to meet senior iranian officials and to visit a nuclear power station that russia is building for iran at bushehr , in southern iran . bildunterschrift : un security council however iran has shown no sign of willingness to restore a moratorium on uranium enrichment at home , a key demand of the west . iran has been reported to the un security council over its nuclear activities , and a march 6 meeting of the un 's international atomic energy agency will be vital in determining how the world body responds . moscow has repeatedly cautioned against a possible imposition of sanctions . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran issues enrichment threat but considers russian proposal iran said monday that it would restart uranium enrichment work despite international objections .

traditionally , no topic is sacred during this time .
but the ongoing controversy over caricatures of the prophet mohammed will stay out of the festivities . a carnival skit poking fun at pope benedict xvi has raised a debate on just how far political cabaret can satirize certain topics . the carnival gala stunksitzung plans to show the sketch in which pope benedict xvi as a pop star and the archbishop of cologne , cardinal joachim meisner , as a wannabe pop star lie in a bed together .
the two end up smooching . a private citizen has now pressed charges against the stunksitzung for " disrupting religious peace . "
public television channel wdr , which will broadcast the gala on saturday , has decided to cut out the controversial part .
the station said its policies prescribed respect of religious feelings , which they said would have been hurt if the skit was broadcast . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should satire be allowed to present the pope as a pop star ? winni rau , spokesman for the stunksitzung , said the skit was an interpretation of the pope 's pop star qualities during world youth day , which took place in cologne last summer .
he said he did n't agree with wdr 's decision . " what is satire allowed to do in the western world ? "
rau said .
" we can debate this issue , but not forbid it . " rau said he wished wdr would have had " more courage . "
" i really think it 's a shame , " he said .
" it could have showed that we here in the west can also mock our own culture and religion . " people have to be able to handle satire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rote funken are a popular carnival society the stunksitzung is an alternative to the traditional galas , which mainly take place in the german karneval strongholds cologne , düsseldorf and mainz .
the galas are a regular part of the so-called " fifth season " between its kick-off on nov .
11 and the actual carnival week , which starts on the thursday before ash wednesday .
they include singing and dancing , but also orators , who address various political and societal topics . rau said the stunksitzung considers itself political cabaret . " this satire can and should also be directed against the church or political topics , " rau said .
" in the case of cabaret or satire , people have to be able to take it .
it is part of our culture . " cologne just wants to have fun bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you 'll find more happy than sad clowns in cologne in cologne , though , political and socio-critical issues have never been at the top of the carnival agenda , and they wo n't be this year either . " our philosophy is that carnival should be fun and friendly , " said sigrid krebs , spokeswoman for the city 's carnival committee . krebs said there would be satirical floats in the rosenmontag parade on carnival monday , one of the highlights of the " fifth season . " " but they have never been aimed at harming or offending people nor will they in the future , " krebs said . düsseldorf wants to avoid religious provocation just 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- further north , in düsseldorf , political and religious critique have been much more common in the past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this float had the motto " fostering tradition " last year , a float showed cardinal meisner striking a match to a woman tied to the stake , the words " i had an abortion " written on her .
in 2003 , the düsseldorf procession showed angela merkel , today 's chancellor , coming out of uncle sam 's behind - a statement on her support for the us invasion of iraq . bernd jost , spokesman for the düsseldorf carnival committee , said there would not be any floats dealing with religion this year . " in view of the current debate , we will be keeping very clear of things related to muslims , " jost said .
" we do n't want to fuel hatred . " according to jost , the well-being of the parade spectators was the top priority for the committee . the cartoon controversy is also not an issue on the agenda in the third carnival stronghold , mainz .

" some 800 participants attended a small party conference in berlin monday , where the topic on hand was a reassessment of the ruling christian democratic union 's values .
cdu leader angela merkel took the opportunity to call for fundamental change , but stressed the need to keep christian values at the core of the party 's ideology . in a debate that is expected to go on for two years , the cdu wants to refine its image within the " grand coalition " government -lrb- it currently shares power with the the social democrats . -rrb-
to do this , it plans to modernize its manifesto .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a weak election result forced the cdu to govern with the spd by claiming a phrase historically associated with workers ' parties and the opposing social democrats - solidarity - the cdu is seen to be angling for more support after a razor-thin win at the polls last year .
' solidarity is patriotism ' solidarity needs to be seen on a par with basic values like freedom and justice , in order to keep germany on the right path , merkel said .
sounding more like the leader of a workers ' union than a conservative government , merkel said : " we have to remain in a country where solidarity is practiced without asking about the material gains . "
" freedom and solidarity - for us , this combination is not unattainable , " merkel told the party faithful .
" the ability to exercise solidarity is perhaps one of the most important patriotic abilities . "
questioning the social-market economy the most important thing is for the cdu to take a new look at germany 's social-market economy , merkel said .
in her first big party speech since being elected to office nearly 100 days ago , merkel noted that the party 's current manifesto , created in 1994 , " fails to answer a whole array " of modern-day questions .
that is especially true when it comes to social and economic policies , she said .
" we want to secure the future of the social-market economy .
but we realize that with globalization , certain basic conditions have changed , " she said .
as a result , people are rejecting germany 's current economic model .

traditionally , no topic is sacred during this time .
but the ongoing controversy over caricatures of the prophet mohammed will stay out of the festivities . a carnival skit poking fun at pope benedict xvi has raised a debate on just how far political cabaret can satirize certain topics . the carnival gala stunksitzung plans to show the sketch in which pope benedict xvi as a pop star and the archbishop of cologne , cardinal joachim meisner , as a wannabe pop star lie in a bed together .
the two end up smooching . a private citizen has now pressed charges against the stunksitzung for " disrupting religious peace . "
public television channel wdr , which will broadcast the gala on saturday , has decided to cut out the controversial part .
the station said its policies prescribed respect of religious feelings , which they said would have been hurt if the skit was broadcast . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should satire be allowed to present the pope as a pop star ? winni rau , spokesman for the stunksitzung , said the skit was an interpretation of the pope 's pop star qualities during world youth day , which took place in cologne last summer .
he said he did n't agree with wdr 's decision . " what is satire allowed to do in the western world ? "
rau said .
" we can debate this issue , but not forbid it . " rau said he wished wdr would have had " more courage . "
" i really think it 's a shame , " he said .
" it could have showed that we here in the west can also mock our own culture and religion . " people have to be able to handle satire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rote funken are a popular carnival society the stunksitzung is an alternative to the traditional galas , which mainly take place in the german karneval strongholds cologne , düsseldorf and mainz .
the galas are a regular part of the so-called " fifth season " between its kick-off on nov .
11 and the actual carnival week , which starts on the thursday before ash wednesday .
they include singing and dancing , but also orators , who address various political and societal topics . rau said the stunksitzung considers itself political cabaret . " this satire can and should also be directed against the church or political topics , " rau said .
" in the case of cabaret or satire , people have to be able to take it .
it is part of our culture . " cologne just wants to have fun bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you 'll find more happy than sad clowns in cologne in cologne , though , political and socio-critical issues have never been at the top of the carnival agenda , and they wo n't be this year either . " our philosophy is that carnival should be fun and friendly , " said sigrid krebs , spokeswoman for the city 's carnival committee . krebs said there would be satirical floats in the rosenmontag parade on carnival monday , one of the highlights of the " fifth season . " " but they have never been aimed at harming or offending people nor will they in the future , " krebs said . düsseldorf wants to avoid religious provocation just 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- further north , in düsseldorf , political and religious critique have been much more common in the past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this float had the motto " fostering tradition " last year , a float showed cardinal meisner striking a match to a woman tied to the stake , the words " i had an abortion " written on her .
in 2003 , the düsseldorf procession showed angela merkel , today 's chancellor , coming out of uncle sam 's behind - a statement on her support for the us invasion of iraq . bernd jost , spokesman for the düsseldorf carnival committee , said there would not be any floats dealing with religion this year . " in view of the current debate , we will be keeping very clear of things related to muslims , " jost said .
" we do n't want to fuel hatred . " according to jost , the well-being of the parade spectators was the top priority for the committee . the cartoon controversy is also not an issue on the agenda in the third carnival stronghold , mainz .
local and national issues are more a priority in the city 's rosenmontag parade . turning the world on its head karneval has its origins in the middle ages and is traditionally a roman catholic celebration .
it is closely associated with easter , as it always ends on ash wednesday , marking the beginning of lent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a so-called mullahburger , shown in düsseldorf last year , does not reflect carnival tradition parody and mockery are part of its tradition , said matthias von der bank , a historian from cologne 's carnival museum . " but it was n't satire like we have today , " von der bank said . " in the middle ages , carnival was a festival of reverse worlds and a playful expression of this , " von der bank said .
" so christian symbols , for example , were turned upside down . " but , he added , slandering the church was and is not part of carnival 's festivities . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de young carnival prince is also integration success story this year , the town of wesseling has dubbed a tunisian boy its traditional carnival prince .

in iran nuclear crisis , all eyes turn to russia world powers split over iran nuclear program iran calls un referral " the end of diplomacy " europe -pipe- 21.02.2006 iran hopeful about russian nuclear compromise plan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian officials will visit iran 's bushehr nuclear plant thursday iranian officials said tuesday they were hopeful a russian compromise to end the crisis over iran 's nuclear program would bear fruit , also hinting that they attached greater weight to it than to talks with the eu-3 . ali hosseini-tash , the deputy secretary of iran 's supreme national security council , said the negotiations in moscow had been positive and " give us the hope of reaching an agreement . " " the main question is the creation of a more normal situation and to reduce this tension so that we wo n't have people making unreasonable demands of each other , " he said before leaving for iran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sergey lavrov but russian foreign minister sergei lavrov was markedly more cautious . " i think it would be premature to use terms such as failure or success , " he told reporters . russia , as a veto-wielding member of the un security council with traditionally close ties to iran , has long tried to mediate in the long-running dispute over its partner 's nuclear program .
its proposal is to create a joint venture that would enrich uranium for tehran 's energy needs on russian soil . russia sees it as a means of getting iran to reinstate its moratorium on uranium enrichment work , after tehran broke seals at three nuclear facilities last month and signaled its intention to resume nuclear work . iran stresses talks with russia , not eu the proposal by moscow has been cautiously welcomed by western countries , which suspect iran 's stated intention to develop peaceful nuclear energy is simply a cover for developing atomic weapons . iranian officials have also hinted that they attach greater significance to negotiations with moscow rather than with the eu troika of germany , france and britain who have been holding on-and-off talks with teheran for over two years . " our contacts with the european union will for the moment not be held only with the eu-3 , but also in a unilateral manner with the different countries of the european union , " mottaki told reporters following talks on monday with eu officials in brussels . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said on a visit to japan that diplomacy can still work in resolving the iranian nuclear standoff even though economic sanctions can not be ruled out .
" the issue of a military option does not arise , " steinmeier told a news conference .
" we must show imagination and take advantage of different diplomatic possibilities . "

he is due to meet senior iranian officials and to visit a nuclear power station that russia is building for iran at bushehr , in southern iran . bildunterschrift : un security council however iran has shown no sign of willingness to restore a moratorium on uranium enrichment at home , a key demand of the west . iran has been reported to the un security council over its nuclear activities , and a march 6 meeting of the un 's international atomic energy agency will be vital in determining how the world body responds . moscow has repeatedly cautioned against a possible imposition of sanctions . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran issues enrichment threat but considers russian proposal iran said monday that it would restart uranium enrichment work despite international objections .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 21.02.2006 merkel asks cdu to start soul-searching großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian values must be at the heart of a cdu manifesto , merkel said german chancellor angela merkel has called for her party to review its basic beliefs and renew its emphasis , appealing for more " solidarity . " some 800 participants attended a small party conference in berlin monday , where the topic on hand was a reassessment of the ruling christian democratic union 's values .
cdu leader angela merkel took the opportunity to call for fundamental change , but stressed the need to keep christian values at the core of the party 's ideology . in a debate that is expected to go on for two years , the cdu wants to refine its image within the " grand coalition " government -lrb- it currently shares power with the the social democrats . -rrb-
to do this , it plans to modernize its manifesto .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a weak election result forced the cdu to govern with the spd by claiming a phrase historically associated with workers ' parties and the opposing social democrats - solidarity - the cdu is seen to be angling for more support after a razor-thin win at the polls last year .
' solidarity is patriotism ' solidarity needs to be seen on a par with basic values like freedom and justice , in order to keep germany on the right path , merkel said .
sounding more like the leader of a workers ' union than a conservative government , merkel said : " we have to remain in a country where solidarity is practiced without asking about the material gains . "
" freedom and solidarity - for us , this combination is not unattainable , " merkel told the party faithful .
" the ability to exercise solidarity is perhaps one of the most important patriotic abilities . "
questioning the social-market economy the most important thing is for the cdu to take a new look at germany 's social-market economy , merkel said .
in her first big party speech since being elected to office nearly 100 days ago , merkel noted that the party 's current manifesto , created in 1994 , " fails to answer a whole array " of modern-day questions .
that is especially true when it comes to social and economic policies , she said .
" we want to secure the future of the social-market economy .
but we realize that with globalization , certain basic conditions have changed , " she said .
as a result , people are rejecting germany 's current economic model .
" only a minority considers the social-market economy to be fair , " merkel said .
christianity at the base party members and committees will meet repeatedly to discuss the new manifesto between now and late 2007 , when it will be put up for a vote .
merkel said the basis of the cdu manifesto needs to be christian values , and warned that the party has to " figure out what it can absolutely not afford to lose . "
she urged the cdu to discuss basic values with people from other countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heiner geißler of the cdu the party also unveiled a new motto , " new justice through more freedom . " ex-cdu general secretary heiner geißler told the express newspaper he thought the motto was " backwards , " adding that freedom alone can not bring about justice . and michael sommer , head of the association of german unions , told the kölner stadt anzeiger that the cdu seemed to be on a course of " basic social renovation . "
the discussion " reflects the fact that in germany , you ca n't get a majority of votes with neo-liberal rhetoric , " he said . a number of active members concentrated on the idea that the cdu should stress its roots in christian belief and values .
the head of the cdu 's workers ' wing , karl laumann , told the passauer neuen presse that the cdu " needs to unconditionally stand up for christian social teachings and social justice .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 21.02.2006 merkel asks cdu to start soul-searching großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian values must be at the heart of a cdu manifesto , merkel said german chancellor angela merkel has called for her party to review its basic beliefs and renew its emphasis , appealing for more " solidarity . " some 800 participants attended a small party conference in berlin monday , where the topic on hand was a reassessment of the ruling christian democratic union 's values .
cdu leader angela merkel took the opportunity to call for fundamental change , but stressed the need to keep christian values at the core of the party 's ideology . in a debate that is expected to go on for two years , the cdu wants to refine its image within the " grand coalition " government -lrb- it currently shares power with the the social democrats . -rrb-
to do this , it plans to modernize its manifesto .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a weak election result forced the cdu to govern with the spd by claiming a phrase historically associated with workers ' parties and the opposing social democrats - solidarity - the cdu is seen to be angling for more support after a razor-thin win at the polls last year .
' solidarity is patriotism ' solidarity needs to be seen on a par with basic values like freedom and justice , in order to keep germany on the right path , merkel said .
sounding more like the leader of a workers ' union than a conservative government , merkel said : " we have to remain in a country where solidarity is practiced without asking about the material gains . "
" freedom and solidarity - for us , this combination is not unattainable , " merkel told the party faithful .
" the ability to exercise solidarity is perhaps one of the most important patriotic abilities . "
questioning the social-market economy the most important thing is for the cdu to take a new look at germany 's social-market economy , merkel said .
in her first big party speech since being elected to office nearly 100 days ago , merkel noted that the party 's current manifesto , created in 1994 , " fails to answer a whole array " of modern-day questions .
that is especially true when it comes to social and economic policies , she said .
" we want to secure the future of the social-market economy .
but we realize that with globalization , certain basic conditions have changed , " she said .
as a result , people are rejecting germany 's current economic model .
" only a minority considers the social-market economy to be fair , " merkel said .
christianity at the base party members and committees will meet repeatedly to discuss the new manifesto between now and late 2007 , when it will be put up for a vote .
merkel said the basis of the cdu manifesto needs to be christian values , and warned that the party has to " figure out what it can absolutely not afford to lose . "
she urged the cdu to discuss basic values with people from other countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heiner geißler of the cdu the party also unveiled a new motto , " new justice through more freedom . " ex-cdu general secretary heiner geißler told the express newspaper he thought the motto was " backwards , " adding that freedom alone can not bring about justice . and michael sommer , head of the association of german unions , told the kölner stadt anzeiger that the cdu seemed to be on a course of " basic social renovation . "
the discussion " reflects the fact that in germany , you ca n't get a majority of votes with neo-liberal rhetoric , " he said . a number of active members concentrated on the idea that the cdu should stress its roots in christian belief and values .
the head of the cdu 's workers ' wing , karl laumann , told the passauer neuen presse that the cdu " needs to unconditionally stand up for christian social teachings and social justice .

they are all soldiers in the athletics-training department of the army where they prepared for the turin games . ' just one responsibility : training ' a total of 72 bundeswehr athletes are competing in turin .
that 's nearly half of germany 's 161-person team .
petty officer uwe witte , a trainer in the german army 's athletics-training division in the town of warendorf said there 's a reason why the bundeswehr program is so successful . " all their -lrb- the athletes ' -rrb- other responsibilities - school , family , household - disappear . here they can concentrate entirely on their sport .
of course , if you look at their schedule , there is not a lot of extra time to take care of other things . " the army has 22 sports-training departments across germany .
altogether , they support 744 athletes in 70 different sports .
such specialized athletics departments arose out of a decision the german parliament made in 1968 to promote sports in the country and to primarily rope in the army for that purpose . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luge slider sylke otto won a gold medal in turin georg remmert , who is temporarily in charge of the warendorf athletics-training department , said the training programs work both ways .

in turn it shows the bundeswehr and germany in a good light internationally . " but only those who are already very accomplished athletes can be sponsored .
all those who have already made it to the national squad in their sport can apply .
in other words , the athletes are already very successful when they they are accepted into the army 's program . they are then assigned a trainer and are also meant to start following a normal soldier 's basic training .
later , they only need to fulfill 30 percent of a soldier 's normal duties ; the other 70 percent of their time is free for athletic training . best for winter sports the system seems to work especially well for winter sport athletes .
of 744 army athletes , only 200 are in winter sports , but they rack up the most successes .
much of that has to do with the popularity of winter sports in germany and particulary in the army .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 21.02.2006 german foreign minister to walk diplomatic tightrope in china großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : talks in china aren likely to prove pretty taxing for steinmeier stressing germany 's stance against lifting the eu arms embargo , talking tough on human rights and deepening business ties - foreign minister steinmeier will have his hands full when he visits china wednesday . it 's frank-walter steinmeier 's first visit to china since taking office last year and he 's already ensured that he wo n't be merely echoing former chancellor gerhard schröder 's foreign policy stance towards beijing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier , right , with his japanese counterpart taro aso speaking at an event at the national japanese press club in tokyo on tuesday , steinmeier said germany was no longer explicitly in favor of lifting the eu arms embargo on china .
the foreign minister pointed out that the present government grand coalition of social democrats and christian democrats were in favor of deciding the issue on a european level . at the same time steinmeier added that germany already had one of the strictest export restrictions in the eu and added that even a lifting of the eu arms embargo would n't lead to " a more liberal approach -lrb- towards china -rrb- in germany . "
the latter was also one of former chancellor schröder 's main arguments as he pushed for the eu to drop the existing arms ban . business high on the agenda but , away from the arms embargo issue , which is unlikely to go down well with chinese leaders , much of steinmeier 's visit is likely to be consumed by business talk . germany and china have cooperated closely in the areas of culture , science , environmental protection .

the foreign minister pointed out that the present government grand coalition of social democrats and christian democrats were in favor of deciding the issue on a european level . at the same time steinmeier added that germany already had one of the strictest export restrictions in the eu and added that even a lifting of the eu arms embargo would n't lead to " a more liberal approach -lrb- towards china -rrb- in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : bird flu : the continuing threat germany 's media tangle with bird flu bird flu talks hailed a success after securing $ 1.9 billion the westward migration of bird flu bird flu : the facts germany -pipe- 21.02.2006 fear borders on hysteria as bird flu hits europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paranoia is rife as dead birds turn up in europe while european governments are n't hitting the panic button as yet , the spread of bird flu has definitely got a lot of people fearing that the end is nigh .
bird flu psychosis is spreading faster than the virus itself . it was a surprise that germany 's airports were not inundated with fleeing citizens ; fighting each other for the last available seats to safety , panicked to distraction with only thoughts of escape passing through their fear-frazzled minds . " the feathered death - it has landed , " blared a headline in the berliner zeitung newspaper heralding the arrival of bird flu in germany last week along with , if the media were to be believed , the three other horsemen of the apocalypse . adding to the hysteria was the fact that if germany were to empty its borders , where would the escapees flee to ?
pestilence was everywhere .
not a corner of the globe was untouched .
poultry magnates considering the end of their empires must have seriously been considering investing their last euros in space tourism . as the people of europe looked to their leaders for guidance , some like germany 's chancellor merkel could barely hide their concern .
" the situation is very serious , " merkel said after a personal visit to the northern german island of rügen after avian flu struck there . everything seemed to add up to a doomsday scenario , a worldwide crisis which would sell a million copies in paperback if there would be anyone left alive to read it . welcome to the age of bird flu psychosis . the lethal h5n1 virus landed in western europe last week for the first time , littering parts of italy , greece , france , germany and austria with the carcasses of dead migratory birds and those domestic winged victims who were unlucky enough to fraternize with the infected before they quacked their last . a global panic six years in the making bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asia 's harsh lesson should have been learned sooner by europe it should have come as little surprise .
bird flu had been winging its way to europe , slowly but surely , since the disease first emerged in hong kong in 1997 .
it took its time but eventually made it to europe 's borders in october when it claimed a handful of teenage human victims and thousands of feathered fatalities on its way into the eu . six years .
plenty of time , one would imagine , for european leaders and health experts to have some sort of plan ready .
but when the first cases cropped up in italy and greece , the authorities were as shocked as anyone .
when the northern german island of rügen reported a batch of dead swans , it remained that way for some time because of a conflict between federal state and district laws which prevented the authorities from sending in a clean-up team immediately . the fact that governments and health organizations around the world seem to be at a loss to stop the spread of the virus and have no tried and tested means to cure the disease once it is contracted by humans could rightly cause some concern .
but the reactions of the general public , at the moment at least , far outstrip the actual threat . depression , suicide and poultry embargoes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the poultry industry is beginning to feel the heat in italy , for instance , the threat of unemployment due to the poultry industry being hit by panic embargoes on chicken caused one delivery man to kill his wife and child and then himself in a fit of manic depression . " he was very worried because we told him there 'd be less work because of the crisis , " an official from the man ’ s firm told the newspaper la repubblica .
it is by far the most extreme case recorded so far but there is no doubt that a lot more people are concerned to a lesser degree .
since the beginning of last week , the italian health ministry has received more than 13,000 phone calls to a special bird flu hotline to report dead birds or ask for advice . german red tape and insecurity fuels public confusion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin gave its fallen blackbird a guard of honor in germany , citizens have been urged to report dead birds to the police in an attempt to limit the impact after the rügen outbreak spread to the mainland .
such is the concern that a dead blackbird in a berlin suburb required what the attending fire chief called " a full state funeral " when a decontamination team in full bio-suits turned up to remove the corpse .
and help lines in germany have been inundated with calls from concerned people . a spokesperson for the federal ministry of food , agriculture and consumer protection told dw-world that while there were no official caller numbers available , a conservative estimate would be in the " high hundreds . "
all nine hot lines , however , were constantly engaged suggesting the estimate is very conservative . georg alpers , a psychologist at the university of würzburg believes that it is the not knowing which is causing most of the panic .
" we do not know at the moment what the concrete dangers are , how we could protect ourselves from these possible dangers and whether we are actually in danger .
from such insecurity , fear can grow . "
special effort required to catch bird flu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the experts deal with infected birds so you do n't have to while there is little doubt that a human bird flu pandemic is a possibility , scientists are increasingly stressing the ' if ' rather than ' when ' argument - and many believe it is a large ' if ' .
right now , to contract bird flu one would have to visit a contaminated area and have sustained contact with an infected bird or corpse , something most conscientious people would no doubt do their utmost to avoid . if the disease were to mutate into a version that could pass easily from one person to another - the main fear of health experts - then there would be more reason for concern .
a strong form of the virus would send the death rate - and the panic levels - sky high . but the strength of that version of the virus is also a matter of debate .
many scientists believe the human form could be milder than that affecting birds .
also , the disease appears to be treatable with the antiviral drug , tamiflu -lrb- oseltamvir -rrb- , which is known to be effective in the early stages or as a preventative treatment . in the context of world population , infection negligible so far , the virus has infected 169 people in seven countries , killing 91 , according to the world health organization .
despite the mortality rate being just under 50 percent , in relation to the combined population figures of those seven countries , the number of people infected is minute and those who have died even more so . the fact is the threat is real and people have died .
but as the situation stands at the moment , the threat to humans is negligible .

it is by far the most extreme case recorded so far but there is no doubt that a lot more people are concerned to a lesser degree .
since the beginning of last week , the italian health ministry has received more than 13,000 phone calls to a special bird flu hotline to report dead birds or ask for advice . german red tape and insecurity fuels public confusion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin gave its fallen blackbird a guard of honor in germany , citizens have been urged to report dead birds to the police in an attempt to limit the impact after the rügen outbreak spread to the mainland .
such is the concern that a dead blackbird in a berlin suburb required what the attending fire chief called " a full state funeral " when a decontamination team in full bio-suits turned up to remove the corpse .
and help lines in germany have been inundated with calls from concerned people . a spokesperson for the federal ministry of food , agriculture and consumer protection told dw-world that while there were no official caller numbers available , a conservative estimate would be in the " high hundreds . "
all nine hot lines , however , were constantly engaged suggesting the estimate is very conservative . georg alpers , a psychologist at the university of würzburg believes that it is the not knowing which is causing most of the panic .
" we do not know at the moment what the concrete dangers are , how we could protect ourselves from these possible dangers and whether we are actually in danger .
from such insecurity , fear can grow . "

right now , to contract bird flu one would have to visit a contaminated area and have sustained contact with an infected bird or corpse , something most conscientious people would no doubt do their utmost to avoid . if the disease were to mutate into a version that could pass easily from one person to another - the main fear of health experts - then there would be more reason for concern .
a strong form of the virus would send the death rate - and the panic levels - sky high . but the strength of that version of the virus is also a matter of debate .

despite the mortality rate being just under 50 percent , in relation to the combined population figures of those seven countries , the number of people infected is minute and those who have died even more so . the fact is the threat is real and people have died .

" the feathered death - it has landed , " blared a headline in the berliner zeitung newspaper heralding the arrival of bird flu in germany last week along with , if the media were to be believed , the three other horsemen of the apocalypse . adding to the hysteria was the fact that if germany were to empty its borders , where would the escapees flee to ?
pestilence was everywhere .
not a corner of the globe was untouched .
poultry magnates considering the end of their empires must have seriously been considering investing their last euros in space tourism . as the people of europe looked to their leaders for guidance , some like germany 's chancellor merkel could barely hide their concern .
" the situation is very serious , " merkel said after a personal visit to the northern german island of rügen after avian flu struck there . everything seemed to add up to a doomsday scenario , a worldwide crisis which would sell a million copies in paperback if there would be anyone left alive to read it . welcome to the age of bird flu psychosis . the lethal h5n1 virus landed in western europe last week for the first time , littering parts of italy , greece , france , germany and austria with the carcasses of dead migratory birds and those domestic winged victims who were unlucky enough to fraternize with the infected before they quacked their last . a global panic six years in the making bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asia 's harsh lesson should have been learned sooner by europe it should have come as little surprise .
bird flu had been winging its way to europe , slowly but surely , since the disease first emerged in hong kong in 1997 .
it took its time but eventually made it to europe 's borders in october when it claimed a handful of teenage human victims and thousands of feathered fatalities on its way into the eu . six years .
plenty of time , one would imagine , for european leaders and health experts to have some sort of plan ready .
but when the first cases cropped up in italy and greece , the authorities were as shocked as anyone .
when the northern german island of rügen reported a batch of dead swans , it remained that way for some time because of a conflict between federal state and district laws which prevented the authorities from sending in a clean-up team immediately . the fact that governments and health organizations around the world seem to be at a loss to stop the spread of the virus and have no tried and tested means to cure the disease once it is contracted by humans could rightly cause some concern .
but the reactions of the general public , at the moment at least , far outstrip the actual threat . depression , suicide and poultry embargoes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the poultry industry is beginning to feel the heat in italy , for instance , the threat of unemployment due to the poultry industry being hit by panic embargoes on chicken caused one delivery man to kill his wife and child and then himself in a fit of manic depression . " he was very worried because we told him there 'd be less work because of the crisis , " an official from the man ’ s firm told the newspaper la repubblica .
it is by far the most extreme case recorded so far but there is no doubt that a lot more people are concerned to a lesser degree .
since the beginning of last week , the italian health ministry has received more than 13,000 phone calls to a special bird flu hotline to report dead birds or ask for advice . german red tape and insecurity fuels public confusion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin gave its fallen blackbird a guard of honor in germany , citizens have been urged to report dead birds to the police in an attempt to limit the impact after the rügen outbreak spread to the mainland .
such is the concern that a dead blackbird in a berlin suburb required what the attending fire chief called " a full state funeral " when a decontamination team in full bio-suits turned up to remove the corpse .
and help lines in germany have been inundated with calls from concerned people . a spokesperson for the federal ministry of food , agriculture and consumer protection told dw-world that while there were no official caller numbers available , a conservative estimate would be in the " high hundreds . "
all nine hot lines , however , were constantly engaged suggesting the estimate is very conservative . georg alpers , a psychologist at the university of würzburg believes that it is the not knowing which is causing most of the panic .
" we do not know at the moment what the concrete dangers are , how we could protect ourselves from these possible dangers and whether we are actually in danger .
from such insecurity , fear can grow . "
special effort required to catch bird flu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the experts deal with infected birds so you do n't have to while there is little doubt that a human bird flu pandemic is a possibility , scientists are increasingly stressing the ' if ' rather than ' when ' argument - and many believe it is a large ' if ' .
right now , to contract bird flu one would have to visit a contaminated area and have sustained contact with an infected bird or corpse , something most conscientious people would no doubt do their utmost to avoid . if the disease were to mutate into a version that could pass easily from one person to another - the main fear of health experts - then there would be more reason for concern .

traditionally , no topic is sacred during this time .
but the ongoing controversy over caricatures of the prophet mohammed will stay out of the festivities . a carnival skit poking fun at pope benedict xvi has raised a debate on just how far political cabaret can satirize certain topics . the carnival gala stunksitzung plans to show the sketch in which pope benedict xvi as a pop star and the archbishop of cologne , cardinal joachim meisner , as a wannabe pop star lie in a bed together .
the two end up smooching . a private citizen has now pressed charges against the stunksitzung for " disrupting religious peace . "
public television channel wdr , which will broadcast the gala on saturday , has decided to cut out the controversial part .
the station said its policies prescribed respect of religious feelings , which they said would have been hurt if the skit was broadcast . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should satire be allowed to present the pope as a pop star ? winni rau , spokesman for the stunksitzung , said the skit was an interpretation of the pope 's pop star qualities during world youth day , which took place in cologne last summer .
he said he did n't agree with wdr 's decision . " what is satire allowed to do in the western world ? "
rau said .
" we can debate this issue , but not forbid it . " rau said he wished wdr would have had " more courage . "
" i really think it 's a shame , " he said .
" it could have showed that we here in the west can also mock our own culture and religion . " people have to be able to handle satire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rote funken are a popular carnival society the stunksitzung is an alternative to the traditional galas , which mainly take place in the german karneval strongholds cologne , düsseldorf and mainz .
the galas are a regular part of the so-called " fifth season " between its kick-off on nov .
11 and the actual carnival week , which starts on the thursday before ash wednesday .
they include singing and dancing , but also orators , who address various political and societal topics . rau said the stunksitzung considers itself political cabaret . " this satire can and should also be directed against the church or political topics , " rau said .
" in the case of cabaret or satire , people have to be able to take it .
it is part of our culture . " cologne just wants to have fun bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you 'll find more happy than sad clowns in cologne in cologne , though , political and socio-critical issues have never been at the top of the carnival agenda , and they wo n't be this year either . " our philosophy is that carnival should be fun and friendly , " said sigrid krebs , spokeswoman for the city 's carnival committee . krebs said there would be satirical floats in the rosenmontag parade on carnival monday , one of the highlights of the " fifth season . " " but they have never been aimed at harming or offending people nor will they in the future , " krebs said . düsseldorf wants to avoid religious provocation just 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- further north , in düsseldorf , political and religious critique have been much more common in the past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this float had the motto " fostering tradition " last year , a float showed cardinal meisner striking a match to a woman tied to the stake , the words " i had an abortion " written on her .
in 2003 , the düsseldorf procession showed angela merkel , today 's chancellor , coming out of uncle sam 's behind - a statement on her support for the us invasion of iraq . bernd jost , spokesman for the düsseldorf carnival committee , said there would not be any floats dealing with religion this year . " in view of the current debate , we will be keeping very clear of things related to muslims , " jost said .
" we do n't want to fuel hatred . " according to jost , the well-being of the parade spectators was the top priority for the committee . the cartoon controversy is also not an issue on the agenda in the third carnival stronghold , mainz .
local and national issues are more a priority in the city 's rosenmontag parade . turning the world on its head karneval has its origins in the middle ages and is traditionally a roman catholic celebration .
it is closely associated with easter , as it always ends on ash wednesday , marking the beginning of lent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a so-called mullahburger , shown in düsseldorf last year , does not reflect carnival tradition parody and mockery are part of its tradition , said matthias von der bank , a historian from cologne 's carnival museum . " but it was n't satire like we have today , " von der bank said . " in the middle ages , carnival was a festival of reverse worlds and a playful expression of this , " von der bank said .
" so christian symbols , for example , were turned upside down . " but , he added , slandering the church was and is not part of carnival 's festivities . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de young carnival prince is also integration success story this year , the town of wesseling has dubbed a tunisian boy its traditional carnival prince .

traditionally , no topic is sacred during this time .
but the ongoing controversy over caricatures of the prophet mohammed will stay out of the festivities . a carnival skit poking fun at pope benedict xvi has raised a debate on just how far political cabaret can satirize certain topics . the carnival gala stunksitzung plans to show the sketch in which pope benedict xvi as a pop star and the archbishop of cologne , cardinal joachim meisner , as a wannabe pop star lie in a bed together .
the two end up smooching . a private citizen has now pressed charges against the stunksitzung for " disrupting religious peace . "
public television channel wdr , which will broadcast the gala on saturday , has decided to cut out the controversial part .
the station said its policies prescribed respect of religious feelings , which they said would have been hurt if the skit was broadcast . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should satire be allowed to present the pope as a pop star ? winni rau , spokesman for the stunksitzung , said the skit was an interpretation of the pope 's pop star qualities during world youth day , which took place in cologne last summer .
he said he did n't agree with wdr 's decision . " what is satire allowed to do in the western world ? "
rau said .
" we can debate this issue , but not forbid it . " rau said he wished wdr would have had " more courage . "
" i really think it 's a shame , " he said .
" it could have showed that we here in the west can also mock our own culture and religion . " people have to be able to handle satire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rote funken are a popular carnival society the stunksitzung is an alternative to the traditional galas , which mainly take place in the german karneval strongholds cologne , düsseldorf and mainz .
the galas are a regular part of the so-called " fifth season " between its kick-off on nov .
11 and the actual carnival week , which starts on the thursday before ash wednesday .
they include singing and dancing , but also orators , who address various political and societal topics . rau said the stunksitzung considers itself political cabaret . " this satire can and should also be directed against the church or political topics , " rau said .
" in the case of cabaret or satire , people have to be able to take it .
it is part of our culture . " cologne just wants to have fun bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you 'll find more happy than sad clowns in cologne in cologne , though , political and socio-critical issues have never been at the top of the carnival agenda , and they wo n't be this year either . " our philosophy is that carnival should be fun and friendly , " said sigrid krebs , spokeswoman for the city 's carnival committee . krebs said there would be satirical floats in the rosenmontag parade on carnival monday , one of the highlights of the " fifth season . " " but they have never been aimed at harming or offending people nor will they in the future , " krebs said . düsseldorf wants to avoid religious provocation just 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- further north , in düsseldorf , political and religious critique have been much more common in the past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this float had the motto " fostering tradition " last year , a float showed cardinal meisner striking a match to a woman tied to the stake , the words " i had an abortion " written on her .
in 2003 , the düsseldorf procession showed angela merkel , today 's chancellor , coming out of uncle sam 's behind - a statement on her support for the us invasion of iraq . bernd jost , spokesman for the düsseldorf carnival committee , said there would not be any floats dealing with religion this year . " in view of the current debate , we will be keeping very clear of things related to muslims , " jost said .
" we do n't want to fuel hatred . " according to jost , the well-being of the parade spectators was the top priority for the committee . the cartoon controversy is also not an issue on the agenda in the third carnival stronghold , mainz .
local and national issues are more a priority in the city 's rosenmontag parade . turning the world on its head karneval has its origins in the middle ages and is traditionally a roman catholic celebration .
it is closely associated with easter , as it always ends on ash wednesday , marking the beginning of lent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a so-called mullahburger , shown in düsseldorf last year , does not reflect carnival tradition parody and mockery are part of its tradition , said matthias von der bank , a historian from cologne 's carnival museum . " but it was n't satire like we have today , " von der bank said . " in the middle ages , carnival was a festival of reverse worlds and a playful expression of this , " von der bank said .
" so christian symbols , for example , were turned upside down . " but , he added , slandering the church was and is not part of carnival 's festivities . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de young carnival prince is also integration success story this year , the town of wesseling has dubbed a tunisian boy its traditional carnival prince .

and for its part , japanese business appreciates germany as an " environmentally conscious " country . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier visited tokyo on tuesday , on his first asia tour since taking office in november under chancellor angela merkel .

" in japan , you can only get anywhere if you have the newest technologies and patents .
in china , the danger of piracy is too great , " he said .

but germany is hoping a state visit to japan will boost long-standing economic ties with that country . even though china has become the most important trade partner for german business in asia , german investors are keen on japan .
and for its part , japanese business appreciates germany as an " environmentally conscious " country . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier visited tokyo on tuesday , on his first asia tour since taking office in november under chancellor angela merkel .
steinmeier , who heads wednesday to beijing on a three-nation tour that began in south korea , called china 's rising clout on the world economic and political stage " a new challenge . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier met with his japanese counterpart , taro aso , on tuesday yet in talks with japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi , he stressed that japan , the world 's second-largest economy , and third-ranked germany could work together on a range of fields .
seeking cooperation " there are many common concerns between germany and japan .
we must tighten our relationship of cooperation , " he said .
" japan and germany can work together to set example for other countries . " in general , german business seems to agree with him .
for many years , japan was germany 's most important trade partner in the asia-pacific region - until china began opening its economy , hitting the world market like a tornado . at the end of 2002 , the volume of german-chinese trade overtook that of germany and japan .
today , german-japanese trade is worth around 43 billion euros -lrb- $ 51.2 billion -rrb- compared to 50 billion in china .
while in 2002 german direct investment in japan still outpaced that of china , by 2004 that had changed .
germany invested 653 million euros in japan in 2004 , according to germany 's foreign ministry , while the investment in china reached 1.06 billion for the same period , according to china 's foreign trade office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if both countries work together , perhaps everyone can make some money yet despite the lure of china and its massive market potential , many german companies have n't lost interest in japan . " a german company that is active in japan does n't get into the chinese market , " said wolfgang klenner , an east asia expert from the ruhr university in bochum . for one thing , the markets are entirely different .
" in japan , you can only get anywhere if you have the newest technologies and patents .
in china , the danger of piracy is too great , " he said .
klenner posits that the reason so many germans stick to investing in japan is that country 's reliable - and familiar - legal system . different markets business prospects for investors in japan are particularly good in the energy and environmental sectors .
japan needs to import nearly all its raw materials . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is a leader in wind power technology " in terms of energy production , japan is interested in anything that can make it more independent and stronger , " said markus taube of the east asia institute at the university of duisberg-essen .
this provides an opportunity for german business : the japanese are world leaders in solar energy , and germany leads in other areas of alternative energy production . wind energy , for example , is an area that japan wants to expand .
the country is on a mission to expand its wind-energy production eightfold , up to 3,000 megawatts by 2010 . germany 's environmental image germany is also a preferred partner for the japanese when it comes to environmental protection . " germany has the clear image in japan of an environmentally conscious country , " said friederike bosse of the association of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- .
scientific exchange in this area is also strong , and bosse said she believes german-japanese economic relations will benefit in the future from much of the academic cooperation that is currently underway . given these common interests , german business should take care not to lose sight of japan as a strategic economic partner , according to bochum university 's klenner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's growth is legendary , as is its building boom " japan is always underestimated , " klenner said .
" even if everyone is always talking about china , the real giant in asia and the world economy is japan . " it is an opinion that markus taube shares .
as soon as the german and japanese economies recover , and consumer spending increases , trade between the two nations will increase as well , he said . until then , however , china is the ideal land for racking up sales , both for japan and germany .
bosse , of the german industry association , said this brings up another trend worth looking at - german-japanese joint ventures in china . match made in heaven ? " germans and japanese are increasingly forming joint ventures .
they want to see if together , they can succeed in the chinese market . " it could be a match made in heaven , bosse believes .
unlike the japanese , the germans were not historical enemies of the chinese .
and the japanese can understand the asian market better . sonja lindenberg -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g4 knocks on security council doors again along with japan , brazil and india , german foreign minister fischer on thursday renewed calls for permanent security council membership , on the sidelines of the un world summit in new york .

a german newspaper has written that us intelligence services spied on two german agents who remained in iraq during the us-led war in 2003 . citing a confidential government paper , the leipziger volkszeitung daily said that reports from the two german federal intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- agents stationed in baghdad to the services headquarters near munich may have been intercepted by us sources using a satellite telephone . the newspaper said that , in addition the two agents - who are currently involved in a controversy over their exact role during the war to which then chancellor gerhard schröder was so vehemently opposed - were " repeatedly pressed " to provide war intelligence from baghdad to the us commando headquarters in qatar .
it added that the german agents refused to be drawn in , but that 25 of 125 bnd reports were officially passed on to the us . according to the paper , the parliamentary control commission , which is charged with reviewing certain secret service activities , has all the information in the confidential report and will meet in berlin on wednesday to debate just how much of it should be made public . that decision could cause the opposition green party , which was the junior partner in schröder 's government , to rethink its objection to a parliamentary inquiry over the role of the bnd during the war , the newspaper wrote .

a german newspaper has written that us intelligence services spied on two german agents who remained in iraq during the us-led war in 2003 . citing a confidential government paper , the leipziger volkszeitung daily said that reports from the two german federal intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- agents stationed in baghdad to the services headquarters near munich may have been intercepted by us sources using a satellite telephone . the newspaper said that , in addition the two agents - who are currently involved in a controversy over their exact role during the war to which then chancellor gerhard schröder was so vehemently opposed - were " repeatedly pressed " to provide war intelligence from baghdad to the us commando headquarters in qatar .
it added that the german agents refused to be drawn in , but that 25 of 125 bnd reports were officially passed on to the us . according to the paper , the parliamentary control commission , which is charged with reviewing certain secret service activities , has all the information in the confidential report and will meet in berlin on wednesday to debate just how much of it should be made public . that decision could cause the opposition green party , which was the junior partner in schröder 's government , to rethink its objection to a parliamentary inquiry over the role of the bnd during the war , the newspaper wrote .

but as baha güngör observes , both positive and negative reactions to the movie are over the top . the most expensive turkish movie of all time , " valley of the wolves , " does nothing to contribute to an inter-cultural dialogue .
it can neither be interpreted as pro-european nor deemed to promote the integration of turks and muslims in germany or other eu countries .
but that was never the film 's intention . " valley of the wolves " is an action film , which uses anti-american cliches to build on a very real political sentiment .
and it does n't stop there .
besides the americans who are portrayed as the main bad guys , it flirts with an anti-semitic cliche in the form of a jewish doctor who works alongside trigger-happy americans in the human organ trade .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the film is ranked five at german box offices the film has drawn excited enthusiasm among turkish viewers and harsh criticism from elsewhere .
both are exaggerated .
germany 's conservatives have slammed the film as " morally harmful for young people " and a threat to societal harmony .
there have even been calls for the film to be withdrawn from general release , but they serve only to heighten interest therein . seen it all before foolish is the high praise lavished on the film - which is based on a true story deemed degrading in turkey - by turkish state and government representatives .
" valley of the wolves " tells the tale of the arrest of a turkish special unit by us troops in the kurdish region of northern iraq .
but beyond that , it is a fictitious action film that is of no greater artistic merit than many us kick-boxing and rambo pictures which frequently discredit other countries and peoples .
there are hundreds of such films which simplify entire cultural circles , depicting them in a negative light , as aggressive , dangerous or even murderous . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from valley of the wolves even the turks have felt disparaged by such movies , the most prominent example being the film " midnight express " from 1978 .
it showed the humiliating treatment of people in turkish jail and had countless turks on the warpath .
the depiction was no lie , but that did n't make the movie politically challenging .
" midnight express " belongs in the category " unavoidable , " like so many other films that , for example , show the horror of atrocities committed by former european colonial powers across the world . the truth is , in this global age , in which bans can only ever be imposed within national boundaries , we have to live with films like " valley of the wolves .

but as baha güngör observes , both positive and negative reactions to the movie are over the top . the most expensive turkish movie of all time , " valley of the wolves , " does nothing to contribute to an inter-cultural dialogue .
it can neither be interpreted as pro-european nor deemed to promote the integration of turks and muslims in germany or other eu countries .
but that was never the film 's intention . " valley of the wolves " is an action film , which uses anti-american cliches to build on a very real political sentiment .
and it does n't stop there .
besides the americans who are portrayed as the main bad guys , it flirts with an anti-semitic cliche in the form of a jewish doctor who works alongside trigger-happy americans in the human organ trade .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the film is ranked five at german box offices the film has drawn excited enthusiasm among turkish viewers and harsh criticism from elsewhere .
both are exaggerated .
germany 's conservatives have slammed the film as " morally harmful for young people " and a threat to societal harmony .
there have even been calls for the film to be withdrawn from general release , but they serve only to heighten interest therein . seen it all before foolish is the high praise lavished on the film - which is based on a true story deemed degrading in turkey - by turkish state and government representatives .
" valley of the wolves " tells the tale of the arrest of a turkish special unit by us troops in the kurdish region of northern iraq .
but beyond that , it is a fictitious action film that is of no greater artistic merit than many us kick-boxing and rambo pictures which frequently discredit other countries and peoples .
there are hundreds of such films which simplify entire cultural circles , depicting them in a negative light , as aggressive , dangerous or even murderous . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from valley of the wolves even the turks have felt disparaged by such movies , the most prominent example being the film " midnight express " from 1978 .
it showed the humiliating treatment of people in turkish jail and had countless turks on the warpath .
the depiction was no lie , but that did n't make the movie politically challenging .
" midnight express " belongs in the category " unavoidable , " like so many other films that , for example , show the horror of atrocities committed by former european colonial powers across the world . the truth is , in this global age , in which bans can only ever be imposed within national boundaries , we have to live with films like " valley of the wolves . "
not least because us policy on iraq is a constant source of good material for filmmakers with an interest in the subject . baha güngör -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german calls to ban controversial turkish movie on iraq german political leaders and jewish community representatives have demanded the boycott of a hit turkish action movie that casts us soldiers in iraq as villains .

in iran nuclear crisis , all eyes turn to russia world powers split over iran nuclear program iran calls un referral " the end of diplomacy " europe -pipe- 21.02.2006 iran hopeful about russian nuclear compromise plan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian officials will visit iran 's bushehr nuclear plant thursday iranian officials said tuesday they were hopeful a russian compromise to end the crisis over iran 's nuclear program would bear fruit , also hinting that they attached greater weight to it than to talks with the eu-3 . ali hosseini-tash , the deputy secretary of iran 's supreme national security council , said the negotiations in moscow had been positive and " give us the hope of reaching an agreement . " " the main question is the creation of a more normal situation and to reduce this tension so that we wo n't have people making unreasonable demands of each other , " he said before leaving for iran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sergey lavrov but russian foreign minister sergei lavrov was markedly more cautious . " i think it would be premature to use terms such as failure or success , " he told reporters . russia , as a veto-wielding member of the un security council with traditionally close ties to iran , has long tried to mediate in the long-running dispute over its partner 's nuclear program .
its proposal is to create a joint venture that would enrich uranium for tehran 's energy needs on russian soil . russia sees it as a means of getting iran to reinstate its moratorium on uranium enrichment work , after tehran broke seals at three nuclear facilities last month and signaled its intention to resume nuclear work . iran stresses talks with russia , not eu the proposal by moscow has been cautiously welcomed by western countries , which suspect iran 's stated intention to develop peaceful nuclear energy is simply a cover for developing atomic weapons . iranian officials have also hinted that they attach greater significance to negotiations with moscow rather than with the eu troika of germany , france and britain who have been holding on-and-off talks with teheran for over two years . " our contacts with the european union will for the moment not be held only with the eu-3 , but also in a unilateral manner with the different countries of the european union , " mottaki told reporters following talks on monday with eu officials in brussels . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said on a visit to japan that diplomacy can still work in resolving the iranian nuclear standoff even though economic sanctions can not be ruled out .
" the issue of a military option does not arise , " steinmeier told a news conference .

he is due to meet senior iranian officials and to visit a nuclear power station that russia is building for iran at bushehr , in southern iran . bildunterschrift : un security council however iran has shown no sign of willingness to restore a moratorium on uranium enrichment at home , a key demand of the west . iran has been reported to the un security council over its nuclear activities , and a march 6 meeting of the un 's international atomic energy agency will be vital in determining how the world body responds . moscow has repeatedly cautioned against a possible imposition of sanctions . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran issues enrichment threat but considers russian proposal iran said monday that it would restart uranium enrichment work despite international objections .

in iran nuclear crisis , all eyes turn to russia world powers split over iran nuclear program iran calls un referral " the end of diplomacy " europe -pipe- 21.02.2006 iran hopeful about russian nuclear compromise plan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian officials will visit iran 's bushehr nuclear plant thursday iranian officials said tuesday they were hopeful a russian compromise to end the crisis over iran 's nuclear program would bear fruit , also hinting that they attached greater weight to it than to talks with the eu-3 . ali hosseini-tash , the deputy secretary of iran 's supreme national security council , said the negotiations in moscow had been positive and " give us the hope of reaching an agreement . " " the main question is the creation of a more normal situation and to reduce this tension so that we wo n't have people making unreasonable demands of each other , " he said before leaving for iran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sergey lavrov but russian foreign minister sergei lavrov was markedly more cautious . " i think it would be premature to use terms such as failure or success , " he told reporters . russia , as a veto-wielding member of the un security council with traditionally close ties to iran , has long tried to mediate in the long-running dispute over its partner 's nuclear program .
its proposal is to create a joint venture that would enrich uranium for tehran 's energy needs on russian soil . russia sees it as a means of getting iran to reinstate its moratorium on uranium enrichment work , after tehran broke seals at three nuclear facilities last month and signaled its intention to resume nuclear work . iran stresses talks with russia , not eu the proposal by moscow has been cautiously welcomed by western countries , which suspect iran 's stated intention to develop peaceful nuclear energy is simply a cover for developing atomic weapons . iranian officials have also hinted that they attach greater significance to negotiations with moscow rather than with the eu troika of germany , france and britain who have been holding on-and-off talks with teheran for over two years . " our contacts with the european union will for the moment not be held only with the eu-3 , but also in a unilateral manner with the different countries of the european union , " mottaki told reporters following talks on monday with eu officials in brussels . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said on a visit to japan that diplomacy can still work in resolving the iranian nuclear standoff even though economic sanctions can not be ruled out .
" the issue of a military option does not arise , " steinmeier told a news conference .
" we must show imagination and take advantage of different diplomatic possibilities . "
" i do not believe economic sanctions are imminent .
but we can not completely rule out imposing sanctions , " he said . russians to visit iranian nuclear plant bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : technical staff at the isfahan uranium conversion facility in central iran russian negotiators continued to press iran at the talks to stop enrichment work , russian foreign ministry spokesman mikhail kamynin said . moscow called on iran " to return to a moratorium regime on all types on work on uranium enrichment including scientific research and construction work , " kamynin was quoted by the official itar-tass news agency as saying . the talks in moscow are to be followed up with a visit to iran on thursday by the head of russia 's atomic energy agency rosatom , sergei kiriyenko .
he is due to meet senior iranian officials and to visit a nuclear power station that russia is building for iran at bushehr , in southern iran . bildunterschrift : un security council however iran has shown no sign of willingness to restore a moratorium on uranium enrichment at home , a key demand of the west . iran has been reported to the un security council over its nuclear activities , and a march 6 meeting of the un 's international atomic energy agency will be vital in determining how the world body responds . moscow has repeatedly cautioned against a possible imposition of sanctions . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran issues enrichment threat but considers russian proposal iran said monday that it would restart uranium enrichment work despite international objections .

they are all soldiers in the athletics-training department of the army where they prepared for the turin games . ' just one responsibility : training ' a total of 72 bundeswehr athletes are competing in turin .
that 's nearly half of germany 's 161-person team .
petty officer uwe witte , a trainer in the german army 's athletics-training division in the town of warendorf said there 's a reason why the bundeswehr program is so successful . " all their -lrb- the athletes ' -rrb- other responsibilities - school , family , household - disappear . here they can concentrate entirely on their sport .
of course , if you look at their schedule , there is not a lot of extra time to take care of other things . " the army has 22 sports-training departments across germany .
altogether , they support 744 athletes in 70 different sports .
such specialized athletics departments arose out of a decision the german parliament made in 1968 to promote sports in the country and to primarily rope in the army for that purpose . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luge slider sylke otto won a gold medal in turin georg remmert , who is temporarily in charge of the warendorf athletics-training department , said the training programs work both ways . " we are mostly here for the people who ca n't finance their training themselves .

" it gives the athletes the security to be able to pursue their sport to such a degree of excellence .
in turn it shows the bundeswehr and germany in a good light internationally . " but only those who are already very accomplished athletes can be sponsored .
all those who have already made it to the national squad in their sport can apply .
in other words , the athletes are already very successful when they they are accepted into the army 's program . they are then assigned a trainer and are also meant to start following a normal soldier 's basic training .
later , they only need to fulfill 30 percent of a soldier 's normal duties ; the other 70 percent of their time is free for athletic training . best for winter sports the system seems to work especially well for winter sport athletes .
of 744 army athletes , only 200 are in winter sports , but they rack up the most successes .
much of that has to do with the popularity of winter sports in germany and particulary in the army .
further , athletes also have good infrastructure and training possibilies for winter olympic sports within germany . on top of that , " there are just fewer nations who do these winter sports , " said uwe witte .

bird flu psychosis is spreading faster than the virus itself . it was a surprise that germany 's airports were not inundated with fleeing citizens ; fighting each other for the last available seats to safety , panicked to distraction with only thoughts of escape passing through their fear-frazzled minds . " the feathered death - it has landed , " blared a headline in the berliner zeitung newspaper heralding the arrival of bird flu in germany last week along with , if the media were to be believed , the three other horsemen of the apocalypse . adding to the hysteria was the fact that if germany were to empty its borders , where would the escapees flee to ?
pestilence was everywhere .
not a corner of the globe was untouched .
poultry magnates considering the end of their empires must have seriously been considering investing their last euros in space tourism . as the people of europe looked to their leaders for guidance , some like germany 's chancellor merkel could barely hide their concern .
" the situation is very serious , " merkel said after a personal visit to the northern german island of rügen after avian flu struck there . everything seemed to add up to a doomsday scenario , a worldwide crisis which would sell a million copies in paperback if there would be anyone left alive to read it . welcome to the age of bird flu psychosis . the lethal h5n1 virus landed in western europe last week for the first time , littering parts of italy , greece , france , germany and austria with the carcasses of dead migratory birds and those domestic winged victims who were unlucky enough to fraternize with the infected before they quacked their last . a global panic six years in the making bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asia 's harsh lesson should have been learned sooner by europe it should have come as little surprise .
bird flu had been winging its way to europe , slowly but surely , since the disease first emerged in hong kong in 1997 .
it took its time but eventually made it to europe 's borders in october when it claimed a handful of teenage human victims and thousands of feathered fatalities on its way into the eu . six years .
plenty of time , one would imagine , for european leaders and health experts to have some sort of plan ready .
but when the first cases cropped up in italy and greece , the authorities were as shocked as anyone .
when the northern german island of rügen reported a batch of dead swans , it remained that way for some time because of a conflict between federal state and district laws which prevented the authorities from sending in a clean-up team immediately . the fact that governments and health organizations around the world seem to be at a loss to stop the spread of the virus and have no tried and tested means to cure the disease once it is contracted by humans could rightly cause some concern .
but the reactions of the general public , at the moment at least , far outstrip the actual threat . depression , suicide and poultry embargoes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the poultry industry is beginning to feel the heat in italy , for instance , the threat of unemployment due to the poultry industry being hit by panic embargoes on chicken caused one delivery man to kill his wife and child and then himself in a fit of manic depression . " he was very worried because we told him there 'd be less work because of the crisis , " an official from the man ’ s firm told the newspaper la repubblica .
it is by far the most extreme case recorded so far but there is no doubt that a lot more people are concerned to a lesser degree .
since the beginning of last week , the italian health ministry has received more than 13,000 phone calls to a special bird flu hotline to report dead birds or ask for advice . german red tape and insecurity fuels public confusion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin gave its fallen blackbird a guard of honor in germany , citizens have been urged to report dead birds to the police in an attempt to limit the impact after the rügen outbreak spread to the mainland .
such is the concern that a dead blackbird in a berlin suburb required what the attending fire chief called " a full state funeral " when a decontamination team in full bio-suits turned up to remove the corpse .
and help lines in germany have been inundated with calls from concerned people . a spokesperson for the federal ministry of food , agriculture and consumer protection told dw-world that while there were no official caller numbers available , a conservative estimate would be in the " high hundreds . "
all nine hot lines , however , were constantly engaged suggesting the estimate is very conservative . georg alpers , a psychologist at the university of würzburg believes that it is the not knowing which is causing most of the panic .
" we do not know at the moment what the concrete dangers are , how we could protect ourselves from these possible dangers and whether we are actually in danger .
from such insecurity , fear can grow . "
special effort required to catch bird flu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the experts deal with infected birds so you do n't have to while there is little doubt that a human bird flu pandemic is a possibility , scientists are increasingly stressing the ' if ' rather than ' when ' argument - and many believe it is a large ' if ' .
right now , to contract bird flu one would have to visit a contaminated area and have sustained contact with an infected bird or corpse , something most conscientious people would no doubt do their utmost to avoid . if the disease were to mutate into a version that could pass easily from one person to another - the main fear of health experts - then there would be more reason for concern .
a strong form of the virus would send the death rate - and the panic levels - sky high . but the strength of that version of the virus is also a matter of debate .
many scientists believe the human form could be milder than that affecting birds .
also , the disease appears to be treatable with the antiviral drug , tamiflu -lrb- oseltamvir -rrb- , which is known to be effective in the early stages or as a preventative treatment . in the context of world population , infection negligible so far , the virus has infected 169 people in seven countries , killing 91 , according to the world health organization .
despite the mortality rate being just under 50 percent , in relation to the combined population figures of those seven countries , the number of people infected is minute and those who have died even more so . the fact is the threat is real and people have died .
but as the situation stands at the moment , the threat to humans is negligible .

bird flu psychosis is spreading faster than the virus itself . it was a surprise that germany 's airports were not inundated with fleeing citizens ; fighting each other for the last available seats to safety , panicked to distraction with only thoughts of escape passing through their fear-frazzled minds . " the feathered death - it has landed , " blared a headline in the berliner zeitung newspaper heralding the arrival of bird flu in germany last week along with , if the media were to be believed , the three other horsemen of the apocalypse . adding to the hysteria was the fact that if germany were to empty its borders , where would the escapees flee to ?
pestilence was everywhere .
not a corner of the globe was untouched .
poultry magnates considering the end of their empires must have seriously been considering investing their last euros in space tourism . as the people of europe looked to their leaders for guidance , some like germany 's chancellor merkel could barely hide their concern .
" the situation is very serious , " merkel said after a personal visit to the northern german island of rügen after avian flu struck there . everything seemed to add up to a doomsday scenario , a worldwide crisis which would sell a million copies in paperback if there would be anyone left alive to read it . welcome to the age of bird flu psychosis . the lethal h5n1 virus landed in western europe last week for the first time , littering parts of italy , greece , france , germany and austria with the carcasses of dead migratory birds and those domestic winged victims who were unlucky enough to fraternize with the infected before they quacked their last . a global panic six years in the making bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asia 's harsh lesson should have been learned sooner by europe it should have come as little surprise .
bird flu had been winging its way to europe , slowly but surely , since the disease first emerged in hong kong in 1997 .
it took its time but eventually made it to europe 's borders in october when it claimed a handful of teenage human victims and thousands of feathered fatalities on its way into the eu . six years .
plenty of time , one would imagine , for european leaders and health experts to have some sort of plan ready .
but when the first cases cropped up in italy and greece , the authorities were as shocked as anyone .
when the northern german island of rügen reported a batch of dead swans , it remained that way for some time because of a conflict between federal state and district laws which prevented the authorities from sending in a clean-up team immediately . the fact that governments and health organizations around the world seem to be at a loss to stop the spread of the virus and have no tried and tested means to cure the disease once it is contracted by humans could rightly cause some concern .
but the reactions of the general public , at the moment at least , far outstrip the actual threat . depression , suicide and poultry embargoes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the poultry industry is beginning to feel the heat in italy , for instance , the threat of unemployment due to the poultry industry being hit by panic embargoes on chicken caused one delivery man to kill his wife and child and then himself in a fit of manic depression . " he was very worried because we told him there 'd be less work because of the crisis , " an official from the man ’ s firm told the newspaper la repubblica .
it is by far the most extreme case recorded so far but there is no doubt that a lot more people are concerned to a lesser degree .
since the beginning of last week , the italian health ministry has received more than 13,000 phone calls to a special bird flu hotline to report dead birds or ask for advice . german red tape and insecurity fuels public confusion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin gave its fallen blackbird a guard of honor in germany , citizens have been urged to report dead birds to the police in an attempt to limit the impact after the rügen outbreak spread to the mainland .
such is the concern that a dead blackbird in a berlin suburb required what the attending fire chief called " a full state funeral " when a decontamination team in full bio-suits turned up to remove the corpse .
and help lines in germany have been inundated with calls from concerned people . a spokesperson for the federal ministry of food , agriculture and consumer protection told dw-world that while there were no official caller numbers available , a conservative estimate would be in the " high hundreds . "
all nine hot lines , however , were constantly engaged suggesting the estimate is very conservative . georg alpers , a psychologist at the university of würzburg believes that it is the not knowing which is causing most of the panic .
" we do not know at the moment what the concrete dangers are , how we could protect ourselves from these possible dangers and whether we are actually in danger .
from such insecurity , fear can grow . "
special effort required to catch bird flu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the experts deal with infected birds so you do n't have to while there is little doubt that a human bird flu pandemic is a possibility , scientists are increasingly stressing the ' if ' rather than ' when ' argument - and many believe it is a large ' if ' .
right now , to contract bird flu one would have to visit a contaminated area and have sustained contact with an infected bird or corpse , something most conscientious people would no doubt do their utmost to avoid . if the disease were to mutate into a version that could pass easily from one person to another - the main fear of health experts - then there would be more reason for concern .
a strong form of the virus would send the death rate - and the panic levels - sky high . but the strength of that version of the virus is also a matter of debate .
many scientists believe the human form could be milder than that affecting birds .
also , the disease appears to be treatable with the antiviral drug , tamiflu -lrb- oseltamvir -rrb- , which is known to be effective in the early stages or as a preventative treatment . in the context of world population , infection negligible so far , the virus has infected 169 people in seven countries , killing 91 , according to the world health organization .
despite the mortality rate being just under 50 percent , in relation to the combined population figures of those seven countries , the number of people infected is minute and those who have died even more so . the fact is the threat is real and people have died .
but as the situation stands at the moment , the threat to humans is negligible .

not a corner of the globe was untouched .
poultry magnates considering the end of their empires must have seriously been considering investing their last euros in space tourism . as the people of europe looked to their leaders for guidance , some like germany 's chancellor merkel could barely hide their concern .
" the situation is very serious , " merkel said after a personal visit to the northern german island of rügen after avian flu struck there . everything seemed to add up to a doomsday scenario , a worldwide crisis which would sell a million copies in paperback if there would be anyone left alive to read it . welcome to the age of bird flu psychosis . the lethal h5n1 virus landed in western europe last week for the first time , littering parts of italy , greece , france , germany and austria with the carcasses of dead migratory birds and those domestic winged victims who were unlucky enough to fraternize with the infected before they quacked their last . a global panic six years in the making bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asia 's harsh lesson should have been learned sooner by europe it should have come as little surprise .
bird flu had been winging its way to europe , slowly but surely , since the disease first emerged in hong kong in 1997 .
it took its time but eventually made it to europe 's borders in october when it claimed a handful of teenage human victims and thousands of feathered fatalities on its way into the eu . six years .
plenty of time , one would imagine , for european leaders and health experts to have some sort of plan ready .
but when the first cases cropped up in italy and greece , the authorities were as shocked as anyone .
when the northern german island of rügen reported a batch of dead swans , it remained that way for some time because of a conflict between federal state and district laws which prevented the authorities from sending in a clean-up team immediately . the fact that governments and health organizations around the world seem to be at a loss to stop the spread of the virus and have no tried and tested means to cure the disease once it is contracted by humans could rightly cause some concern .
but the reactions of the general public , at the moment at least , far outstrip the actual threat . depression , suicide and poultry embargoes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the poultry industry is beginning to feel the heat in italy , for instance , the threat of unemployment due to the poultry industry being hit by panic embargoes on chicken caused one delivery man to kill his wife and child and then himself in a fit of manic depression . " he was very worried because we told him there 'd be less work because of the crisis , " an official from the man ’ s firm told the newspaper la repubblica .
it is by far the most extreme case recorded so far but there is no doubt that a lot more people are concerned to a lesser degree .
since the beginning of last week , the italian health ministry has received more than 13,000 phone calls to a special bird flu hotline to report dead birds or ask for advice . german red tape and insecurity fuels public confusion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin gave its fallen blackbird a guard of honor in germany , citizens have been urged to report dead birds to the police in an attempt to limit the impact after the rügen outbreak spread to the mainland .
such is the concern that a dead blackbird in a berlin suburb required what the attending fire chief called " a full state funeral " when a decontamination team in full bio-suits turned up to remove the corpse .
and help lines in germany have been inundated with calls from concerned people . a spokesperson for the federal ministry of food , agriculture and consumer protection told dw-world that while there were no official caller numbers available , a conservative estimate would be in the " high hundreds . "
all nine hot lines , however , were constantly engaged suggesting the estimate is very conservative . georg alpers , a psychologist at the university of würzburg believes that it is the not knowing which is causing most of the panic .
" we do not know at the moment what the concrete dangers are , how we could protect ourselves from these possible dangers and whether we are actually in danger .
from such insecurity , fear can grow . "
special effort required to catch bird flu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the experts deal with infected birds so you do n't have to while there is little doubt that a human bird flu pandemic is a possibility , scientists are increasingly stressing the ' if ' rather than ' when ' argument - and many believe it is a large ' if ' .
right now , to contract bird flu one would have to visit a contaminated area and have sustained contact with an infected bird or corpse , something most conscientious people would no doubt do their utmost to avoid . if the disease were to mutate into a version that could pass easily from one person to another - the main fear of health experts - then there would be more reason for concern .
a strong form of the virus would send the death rate - and the panic levels - sky high . but the strength of that version of the virus is also a matter of debate .
many scientists believe the human form could be milder than that affecting birds .
also , the disease appears to be treatable with the antiviral drug , tamiflu -lrb- oseltamvir -rrb- , which is known to be effective in the early stages or as a preventative treatment . in the context of world population , infection negligible so far , the virus has infected 169 people in seven countries , killing 91 , according to the world health organization .
despite the mortality rate being just under 50 percent , in relation to the combined population figures of those seven countries , the number of people infected is minute and those who have died even more so . the fact is the threat is real and people have died .

" some 800 participants attended a small party conference in berlin monday , where the topic on hand was a reassessment of the ruling christian democratic union 's values .
cdu leader angela merkel took the opportunity to call for fundamental change , but stressed the need to keep christian values at the core of the party 's ideology . in a debate that is expected to go on for two years , the cdu wants to refine its image within the " grand coalition " government -lrb- it currently shares power with the the social democrats . -rrb-
to do this , it plans to modernize its manifesto .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a weak election result forced the cdu to govern with the spd by claiming a phrase historically associated with workers ' parties and the opposing social democrats - solidarity - the cdu is seen to be angling for more support after a razor-thin win at the polls last year .
' solidarity is patriotism ' solidarity needs to be seen on a par with basic values like freedom and justice , in order to keep germany on the right path , merkel said .
sounding more like the leader of a workers ' union than a conservative government , merkel said : " we have to remain in a country where solidarity is practiced without asking about the material gains . "
" freedom and solidarity - for us , this combination is not unattainable , " merkel told the party faithful .
" the ability to exercise solidarity is perhaps one of the most important patriotic abilities . "
questioning the social-market economy the most important thing is for the cdu to take a new look at germany 's social-market economy , merkel said .
in her first big party speech since being elected to office nearly 100 days ago , merkel noted that the party 's current manifesto , created in 1994 , " fails to answer a whole array " of modern-day questions .
that is especially true when it comes to social and economic policies , she said .
" we want to secure the future of the social-market economy .
but we realize that with globalization , certain basic conditions have changed , " she said .
as a result , people are rejecting germany 's current economic model .
" only a minority considers the social-market economy to be fair , " merkel said .
christianity at the base party members and committees will meet repeatedly to discuss the new manifesto between now and late 2007 , when it will be put up for a vote .
merkel said the basis of the cdu manifesto needs to be christian values , and warned that the party has to " figure out what it can absolutely not afford to lose . "
she urged the cdu to discuss basic values with people from other countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heiner geißler of the cdu the party also unveiled a new motto , " new justice through more freedom . " ex-cdu general secretary heiner geißler told the express newspaper he thought the motto was " backwards , " adding that freedom alone can not bring about justice . and michael sommer , head of the association of german unions , told the kölner stadt anzeiger that the cdu seemed to be on a course of " basic social renovation . "
the discussion " reflects the fact that in germany , you ca n't get a majority of votes with neo-liberal rhetoric , " he said . a number of active members concentrated on the idea that the cdu should stress its roots in christian belief and values .

but few people know that two-thirds of them went to army-sponsored athletes . the german army spends 25 million euros -lrb- $ 30 million -rrb- per year on sports training and it certainly seems to be getting its money 's worth . when sylke otto , silke kraushaar and tatjana hüfner won gold , silver and bronze in the luge competition last week , the victory was theirs - and the german army 's . ditto for kati wilhelm , who took a gold in biathlon -lrb- cross-country skiing and target shooting -rrb- , andre lang , who won a gold medal in the two-man bobsled , and the women 's cross-country ski team , which got a silver medal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kati wilhelm got gold for biathlon all of these athletes were competing for germany - but also for the german army , or bundeswehr .
they are all soldiers in the athletics-training department of the army where they prepared for the turin games . ' just one responsibility : training ' a total of 72 bundeswehr athletes are competing in turin .
that 's nearly half of germany 's 161-person team .
petty officer uwe witte , a trainer in the german army 's athletics-training division in the town of warendorf said there 's a reason why the bundeswehr program is so successful . " all their -lrb- the athletes ' -rrb- other responsibilities - school , family , household - disappear . here they can concentrate entirely on their sport .
of course , if you look at their schedule , there is not a lot of extra time to take care of other things . " the army has 22 sports-training departments across germany .
altogether , they support 744 athletes in 70 different sports .
such specialized athletics departments arose out of a decision the german parliament made in 1968 to promote sports in the country and to primarily rope in the army for that purpose . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luge slider sylke otto won a gold medal in turin georg remmert , who is temporarily in charge of the warendorf athletics-training department , said the training programs work both ways . " we are mostly here for the people who ca n't finance their training themselves .
in other words , the army is a kind of social net , " he said .
" it gives the athletes the security to be able to pursue their sport to such a degree of excellence .
in turn it shows the bundeswehr and germany in a good light internationally . " but only those who are already very accomplished athletes can be sponsored .
all those who have already made it to the national squad in their sport can apply .
in other words , the athletes are already very successful when they they are accepted into the army 's program . they are then assigned a trainer and are also meant to start following a normal soldier 's basic training .
later , they only need to fulfill 30 percent of a soldier 's normal duties ; the other 70 percent of their time is free for athletic training . best for winter sports the system seems to work especially well for winter sport athletes .
of 744 army athletes , only 200 are in winter sports , but they rack up the most successes .
much of that has to do with the popularity of winter sports in germany and particulary in the army .
further , athletes also have good infrastructure and training possibilies for winter olympic sports within germany . on top of that , " there are just fewer nations who do these winter sports , " said uwe witte .
" in turin , 84 countries are competing .
in contrast , there are 200 countries competing in the summer olympics .
-lrb- in summer -rrb- the spectrum of competing athletes is much bigger . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weight training rooms are used by regular soldiers too witte added that the bundeswehr placed great emphasis on supporting young , up-and-coming athletes .
" here , young people are pushed to be top in their field , in contrast to sponsorship by large companies , which is mostly aimed at a few very top athletes , " he said . josef nehren , head of the sports department of the bundeswehr , has high expectations for germany 's success in turin .
in salt lake city , in 2002 , soldiers took 25 of the total 35 medals that went to germany . " that is definitely good publicity .
but for me it is more important that it shows that our system is good , and that it works well when it is used right .
it also shows that money is being used well , " he said . julia spurzem -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de winter olympics in turin the 20th winter olympics kicked off on feb .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 21.02.2006 opinion : turkish film makes waves in germany - unnecessarily großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reactions to the movie have been explosive in germany a turkish action film about the iraq war , " valley of the wolves , " has unleashed a wave of outrage in germany .
but as baha güngör observes , both positive and negative reactions to the movie are over the top . the most expensive turkish movie of all time , " valley of the wolves , " does nothing to contribute to an inter-cultural dialogue .
it can neither be interpreted as pro-european nor deemed to promote the integration of turks and muslims in germany or other eu countries .
but that was never the film 's intention . " valley of the wolves " is an action film , which uses anti-american cliches to build on a very real political sentiment .
and it does n't stop there .
besides the americans who are portrayed as the main bad guys , it flirts with an anti-semitic cliche in the form of a jewish doctor who works alongside trigger-happy americans in the human organ trade .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the film is ranked five at german box offices the film has drawn excited enthusiasm among turkish viewers and harsh criticism from elsewhere .
both are exaggerated .
germany 's conservatives have slammed the film as " morally harmful for young people " and a threat to societal harmony .
there have even been calls for the film to be withdrawn from general release , but they serve only to heighten interest therein . seen it all before foolish is the high praise lavished on the film - which is based on a true story deemed degrading in turkey - by turkish state and government representatives .
" valley of the wolves " tells the tale of the arrest of a turkish special unit by us troops in the kurdish region of northern iraq .
but beyond that , it is a fictitious action film that is of no greater artistic merit than many us kick-boxing and rambo pictures which frequently discredit other countries and peoples .
there are hundreds of such films which simplify entire cultural circles , depicting them in a negative light , as aggressive , dangerous or even murderous . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from valley of the wolves even the turks have felt disparaged by such movies , the most prominent example being the film " midnight express " from 1978 .
it showed the humiliating treatment of people in turkish jail and had countless turks on the warpath .
the depiction was no lie , but that did n't make the movie politically challenging .
" midnight express " belongs in the category " unavoidable , " like so many other films that , for example , show the horror of atrocities committed by former european colonial powers across the world . the truth is , in this global age , in which bans can only ever be imposed within national boundaries , we have to live with films like " valley of the wolves . "
not least because us policy on iraq is a constant source of good material for filmmakers with an interest in the subject . baha güngör -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german calls to ban controversial turkish movie on iraq german political leaders and jewish community representatives have demanded the boycott of a hit turkish action movie that casts us soldiers in iraq as villains .

in iran nuclear crisis , all eyes turn to russia world powers split over iran nuclear program iran calls un referral " the end of diplomacy " europe -pipe- 21.02.2006 iran hopeful about russian nuclear compromise plan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian officials will visit iran 's bushehr nuclear plant thursday iranian officials said tuesday they were hopeful a russian compromise to end the crisis over iran 's nuclear program would bear fruit , also hinting that they attached greater weight to it than to talks with the eu-3 . ali hosseini-tash , the deputy secretary of iran 's supreme national security council , said the negotiations in moscow had been positive and " give us the hope of reaching an agreement . " " the main question is the creation of a more normal situation and to reduce this tension so that we wo n't have people making unreasonable demands of each other , " he said before leaving for iran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sergey lavrov but russian foreign minister sergei lavrov was markedly more cautious . " i think it would be premature to use terms such as failure or success , " he told reporters . russia , as a veto-wielding member of the un security council with traditionally close ties to iran , has long tried to mediate in the long-running dispute over its partner 's nuclear program .
its proposal is to create a joint venture that would enrich uranium for tehran 's energy needs on russian soil . russia sees it as a means of getting iran to reinstate its moratorium on uranium enrichment work , after tehran broke seals at three nuclear facilities last month and signaled its intention to resume nuclear work . iran stresses talks with russia , not eu the proposal by moscow has been cautiously welcomed by western countries , which suspect iran 's stated intention to develop peaceful nuclear energy is simply a cover for developing atomic weapons . iranian officials have also hinted that they attach greater significance to negotiations with moscow rather than with the eu troika of germany , france and britain who have been holding on-and-off talks with teheran for over two years . " our contacts with the european union will for the moment not be held only with the eu-3 , but also in a unilateral manner with the different countries of the european union , " mottaki told reporters following talks on monday with eu officials in brussels . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said on a visit to japan that diplomacy can still work in resolving the iranian nuclear standoff even though economic sanctions can not be ruled out .
" the issue of a military option does not arise , " steinmeier told a news conference .
" we must show imagination and take advantage of different diplomatic possibilities . "
" i do not believe economic sanctions are imminent .
but we can not completely rule out imposing sanctions , " he said . russians to visit iranian nuclear plant bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : technical staff at the isfahan uranium conversion facility in central iran russian negotiators continued to press iran at the talks to stop enrichment work , russian foreign ministry spokesman mikhail kamynin said . moscow called on iran " to return to a moratorium regime on all types on work on uranium enrichment including scientific research and construction work , " kamynin was quoted by the official itar-tass news agency as saying . the talks in moscow are to be followed up with a visit to iran on thursday by the head of russia 's atomic energy agency rosatom , sergei kiriyenko .
he is due to meet senior iranian officials and to visit a nuclear power station that russia is building for iran at bushehr , in southern iran . bildunterschrift : un security council however iran has shown no sign of willingness to restore a moratorium on uranium enrichment at home , a key demand of the west . iran has been reported to the un security council over its nuclear activities , and a march 6 meeting of the un 's international atomic energy agency will be vital in determining how the world body responds . moscow has repeatedly cautioned against a possible imposition of sanctions . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran issues enrichment threat but considers russian proposal iran said monday that it would restart uranium enrichment work despite international objections .

traditionally , no topic is sacred during this time .
but the ongoing controversy over caricatures of the prophet mohammed will stay out of the festivities . a carnival skit poking fun at pope benedict xvi has raised a debate on just how far political cabaret can satirize certain topics . the carnival gala stunksitzung plans to show the sketch in which pope benedict xvi as a pop star and the archbishop of cologne , cardinal joachim meisner , as a wannabe pop star lie in a bed together .
the two end up smooching . a private citizen has now pressed charges against the stunksitzung for " disrupting religious peace . "
public television channel wdr , which will broadcast the gala on saturday , has decided to cut out the controversial part .
the station said its policies prescribed respect of religious feelings , which they said would have been hurt if the skit was broadcast . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should satire be allowed to present the pope as a pop star ? winni rau , spokesman for the stunksitzung , said the skit was an interpretation of the pope 's pop star qualities during world youth day , which took place in cologne last summer .
he said he did n't agree with wdr 's decision . " what is satire allowed to do in the western world ? "
rau said .
" we can debate this issue , but not forbid it . " rau said he wished wdr would have had " more courage . "
" i really think it 's a shame , " he said .
" it could have showed that we here in the west can also mock our own culture and religion . " people have to be able to handle satire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rote funken are a popular carnival society the stunksitzung is an alternative to the traditional galas , which mainly take place in the german karneval strongholds cologne , düsseldorf and mainz .
the galas are a regular part of the so-called " fifth season " between its kick-off on nov .
11 and the actual carnival week , which starts on the thursday before ash wednesday .
they include singing and dancing , but also orators , who address various political and societal topics . rau said the stunksitzung considers itself political cabaret . " this satire can and should also be directed against the church or political topics , " rau said .
" in the case of cabaret or satire , people have to be able to take it .
it is part of our culture . " cologne just wants to have fun bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you 'll find more happy than sad clowns in cologne in cologne , though , political and socio-critical issues have never been at the top of the carnival agenda , and they wo n't be this year either . " our philosophy is that carnival should be fun and friendly , " said sigrid krebs , spokeswoman for the city 's carnival committee . krebs said there would be satirical floats in the rosenmontag parade on carnival monday , one of the highlights of the " fifth season . " " but they have never been aimed at harming or offending people nor will they in the future , " krebs said . düsseldorf wants to avoid religious provocation just 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- further north , in düsseldorf , political and religious critique have been much more common in the past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this float had the motto " fostering tradition " last year , a float showed cardinal meisner striking a match to a woman tied to the stake , the words " i had an abortion " written on her .
in 2003 , the düsseldorf procession showed angela merkel , today 's chancellor , coming out of uncle sam 's behind - a statement on her support for the us invasion of iraq . bernd jost , spokesman for the düsseldorf carnival committee , said there would not be any floats dealing with religion this year . " in view of the current debate , we will be keeping very clear of things related to muslims , " jost said .
" we do n't want to fuel hatred . " according to jost , the well-being of the parade spectators was the top priority for the committee . the cartoon controversy is also not an issue on the agenda in the third carnival stronghold , mainz .
local and national issues are more a priority in the city 's rosenmontag parade . turning the world on its head karneval has its origins in the middle ages and is traditionally a roman catholic celebration .
it is closely associated with easter , as it always ends on ash wednesday , marking the beginning of lent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a so-called mullahburger , shown in düsseldorf last year , does not reflect carnival tradition parody and mockery are part of its tradition , said matthias von der bank , a historian from cologne 's carnival museum . " but it was n't satire like we have today , " von der bank said . " in the middle ages , carnival was a festival of reverse worlds and a playful expression of this , " von der bank said .
" so christian symbols , for example , were turned upside down .

" some 800 participants attended a small party conference in berlin monday , where the topic on hand was a reassessment of the ruling christian democratic union 's values .
cdu leader angela merkel took the opportunity to call for fundamental change , but stressed the need to keep christian values at the core of the party 's ideology . in a debate that is expected to go on for two years , the cdu wants to refine its image within the " grand coalition " government -lrb- it currently shares power with the the social democrats . -rrb-
to do this , it plans to modernize its manifesto .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a weak election result forced the cdu to govern with the spd by claiming a phrase historically associated with workers ' parties and the opposing social democrats - solidarity - the cdu is seen to be angling for more support after a razor-thin win at the polls last year .
' solidarity is patriotism ' solidarity needs to be seen on a par with basic values like freedom and justice , in order to keep germany on the right path , merkel said .
sounding more like the leader of a workers ' union than a conservative government , merkel said : " we have to remain in a country where solidarity is practiced without asking about the material gains . "
" freedom and solidarity - for us , this combination is not unattainable , " merkel told the party faithful .
" the ability to exercise solidarity is perhaps one of the most important patriotic abilities . "
questioning the social-market economy the most important thing is for the cdu to take a new look at germany 's social-market economy , merkel said .
in her first big party speech since being elected to office nearly 100 days ago , merkel noted that the party 's current manifesto , created in 1994 , " fails to answer a whole array " of modern-day questions .
that is especially true when it comes to social and economic policies , she said .
" we want to secure the future of the social-market economy .
but we realize that with globalization , certain basic conditions have changed , " she said .
as a result , people are rejecting germany 's current economic model .
" only a minority considers the social-market economy to be fair , " merkel said .
christianity at the base party members and committees will meet repeatedly to discuss the new manifesto between now and late 2007 , when it will be put up for a vote .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 21.02.2006 merkel asks cdu to start soul-searching großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian values must be at the heart of a cdu manifesto , merkel said german chancellor angela merkel has called for her party to review its basic beliefs and renew its emphasis , appealing for more " solidarity . " some 800 participants attended a small party conference in berlin monday , where the topic on hand was a reassessment of the ruling christian democratic union 's values .
cdu leader angela merkel took the opportunity to call for fundamental change , but stressed the need to keep christian values at the core of the party 's ideology . in a debate that is expected to go on for two years , the cdu wants to refine its image within the " grand coalition " government -lrb- it currently shares power with the the social democrats . -rrb-
to do this , it plans to modernize its manifesto .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a weak election result forced the cdu to govern with the spd by claiming a phrase historically associated with workers ' parties and the opposing social democrats - solidarity - the cdu is seen to be angling for more support after a razor-thin win at the polls last year .
' solidarity is patriotism ' solidarity needs to be seen on a par with basic values like freedom and justice , in order to keep germany on the right path , merkel said .
sounding more like the leader of a workers ' union than a conservative government , merkel said : " we have to remain in a country where solidarity is practiced without asking about the material gains . "
" freedom and solidarity - for us , this combination is not unattainable , " merkel told the party faithful .
" the ability to exercise solidarity is perhaps one of the most important patriotic abilities . "
questioning the social-market economy the most important thing is for the cdu to take a new look at germany 's social-market economy , merkel said .
in her first big party speech since being elected to office nearly 100 days ago , merkel noted that the party 's current manifesto , created in 1994 , " fails to answer a whole array " of modern-day questions .
that is especially true when it comes to social and economic policies , she said .
" we want to secure the future of the social-market economy .
but we realize that with globalization , certain basic conditions have changed , " she said .
as a result , people are rejecting germany 's current economic model .
" only a minority considers the social-market economy to be fair , " merkel said .
christianity at the base party members and committees will meet repeatedly to discuss the new manifesto between now and late 2007 , when it will be put up for a vote .
merkel said the basis of the cdu manifesto needs to be christian values , and warned that the party has to " figure out what it can absolutely not afford to lose . "
she urged the cdu to discuss basic values with people from other countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heiner geißler of the cdu the party also unveiled a new motto , " new justice through more freedom . " ex-cdu general secretary heiner geißler told the express newspaper he thought the motto was " backwards , " adding that freedom alone can not bring about justice . and michael sommer , head of the association of german unions , told the kölner stadt anzeiger that the cdu seemed to be on a course of " basic social renovation . "
the discussion " reflects the fact that in germany , you ca n't get a majority of votes with neo-liberal rhetoric , " he said . a number of active members concentrated on the idea that the cdu should stress its roots in christian belief and values .
the head of the cdu 's workers ' wing , karl laumann , told the passauer neuen presse that the cdu " needs to unconditionally stand up for christian social teachings and social justice .

but the ongoing controversy over caricatures of the prophet mohammed will stay out of the festivities . a carnival skit poking fun at pope benedict xvi has raised a debate on just how far political cabaret can satirize certain topics . the carnival gala stunksitzung plans to show the sketch in which pope benedict xvi as a pop star and the archbishop of cologne , cardinal joachim meisner , as a wannabe pop star lie in a bed together .
the two end up smooching . a private citizen has now pressed charges against the stunksitzung for " disrupting religious peace . "

but germany is hoping a state visit to japan will boost long-standing economic ties with that country . even though china has become the most important trade partner for german business in asia , german investors are keen on japan .
and for its part , japanese business appreciates germany as an " environmentally conscious " country . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier visited tokyo on tuesday , on his first asia tour since taking office in november under chancellor angela merkel .
steinmeier , who heads wednesday to beijing on a three-nation tour that began in south korea , called china 's rising clout on the world economic and political stage " a new challenge . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier met with his japanese counterpart , taro aso , on tuesday yet in talks with japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi , he stressed that japan , the world 's second-largest economy , and third-ranked germany could work together on a range of fields .
seeking cooperation " there are many common concerns between germany and japan .
we must tighten our relationship of cooperation , " he said .
" japan and germany can work together to set example for other countries . " in general , german business seems to agree with him .
for many years , japan was germany 's most important trade partner in the asia-pacific region - until china began opening its economy , hitting the world market like a tornado . at the end of 2002 , the volume of german-chinese trade overtook that of germany and japan .
today , german-japanese trade is worth around 43 billion euros -lrb- $ 51.2 billion -rrb- compared to 50 billion in china .
while in 2002 german direct investment in japan still outpaced that of china , by 2004 that had changed .
germany invested 653 million euros in japan in 2004 , according to germany 's foreign ministry , while the investment in china reached 1.06 billion for the same period , according to china 's foreign trade office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if both countries work together , perhaps everyone can make some money yet despite the lure of china and its massive market potential , many german companies have n't lost interest in japan . " a german company that is active in japan does n't get into the chinese market , " said wolfgang klenner , an east asia expert from the ruhr university in bochum . for one thing , the markets are entirely different .
" in japan , you can only get anywhere if you have the newest technologies and patents .
in china , the danger of piracy is too great , " he said .
klenner posits that the reason so many germans stick to investing in japan is that country 's reliable - and familiar - legal system . different markets business prospects for investors in japan are particularly good in the energy and environmental sectors .
japan needs to import nearly all its raw materials . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is a leader in wind power technology " in terms of energy production , japan is interested in anything that can make it more independent and stronger , " said markus taube of the east asia institute at the university of duisberg-essen .
this provides an opportunity for german business : the japanese are world leaders in solar energy , and germany leads in other areas of alternative energy production . wind energy , for example , is an area that japan wants to expand .
the country is on a mission to expand its wind-energy production eightfold , up to 3,000 megawatts by 2010 . germany 's environmental image germany is also a preferred partner for the japanese when it comes to environmental protection . " germany has the clear image in japan of an environmentally conscious country , " said friederike bosse of the association of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- .
scientific exchange in this area is also strong , and bosse said she believes german-japanese economic relations will benefit in the future from much of the academic cooperation that is currently underway . given these common interests , german business should take care not to lose sight of japan as a strategic economic partner , according to bochum university 's klenner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's growth is legendary , as is its building boom " japan is always underestimated , " klenner said .
" even if everyone is always talking about china , the real giant in asia and the world economy is japan . " it is an opinion that markus taube shares .
as soon as the german and japanese economies recover , and consumer spending increases , trade between the two nations will increase as well , he said . until then , however , china is the ideal land for racking up sales , both for japan and germany .
bosse , of the german industry association , said this brings up another trend worth looking at - german-japanese joint ventures in china . match made in heaven ? " germans and japanese are increasingly forming joint ventures .
they want to see if together , they can succeed in the chinese market . " it could be a match made in heaven , bosse believes .

traditionally , no topic is sacred during this time .
but the ongoing controversy over caricatures of the prophet mohammed will stay out of the festivities . a carnival skit poking fun at pope benedict xvi has raised a debate on just how far political cabaret can satirize certain topics . the carnival gala stunksitzung plans to show the sketch in which pope benedict xvi as a pop star and the archbishop of cologne , cardinal joachim meisner , as a wannabe pop star lie in a bed together .
the two end up smooching . a private citizen has now pressed charges against the stunksitzung for " disrupting religious peace . "
public television channel wdr , which will broadcast the gala on saturday , has decided to cut out the controversial part .
the station said its policies prescribed respect of religious feelings , which they said would have been hurt if the skit was broadcast . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should satire be allowed to present the pope as a pop star ? winni rau , spokesman for the stunksitzung , said the skit was an interpretation of the pope 's pop star qualities during world youth day , which took place in cologne last summer .
he said he did n't agree with wdr 's decision . " what is satire allowed to do in the western world ? "
rau said .
" we can debate this issue , but not forbid it . " rau said he wished wdr would have had " more courage . "
" i really think it 's a shame , " he said .
" it could have showed that we here in the west can also mock our own culture and religion . " people have to be able to handle satire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rote funken are a popular carnival society the stunksitzung is an alternative to the traditional galas , which mainly take place in the german karneval strongholds cologne , düsseldorf and mainz .
the galas are a regular part of the so-called " fifth season " between its kick-off on nov .
11 and the actual carnival week , which starts on the thursday before ash wednesday .
they include singing and dancing , but also orators , who address various political and societal topics . rau said the stunksitzung considers itself political cabaret . " this satire can and should also be directed against the church or political topics , " rau said .
" in the case of cabaret or satire , people have to be able to take it .
it is part of our culture . " cologne just wants to have fun bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you 'll find more happy than sad clowns in cologne in cologne , though , political and socio-critical issues have never been at the top of the carnival agenda , and they wo n't be this year either . " our philosophy is that carnival should be fun and friendly , " said sigrid krebs , spokeswoman for the city 's carnival committee . krebs said there would be satirical floats in the rosenmontag parade on carnival monday , one of the highlights of the " fifth season . " " but they have never been aimed at harming or offending people nor will they in the future , " krebs said . düsseldorf wants to avoid religious provocation just 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- further north , in düsseldorf , political and religious critique have been much more common in the past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this float had the motto " fostering tradition " last year , a float showed cardinal meisner striking a match to a woman tied to the stake , the words " i had an abortion " written on her .
in 2003 , the düsseldorf procession showed angela merkel , today 's chancellor , coming out of uncle sam 's behind - a statement on her support for the us invasion of iraq . bernd jost , spokesman for the düsseldorf carnival committee , said there would not be any floats dealing with religion this year . " in view of the current debate , we will be keeping very clear of things related to muslims , " jost said .
" we do n't want to fuel hatred . " according to jost , the well-being of the parade spectators was the top priority for the committee . the cartoon controversy is also not an issue on the agenda in the third carnival stronghold , mainz .
local and national issues are more a priority in the city 's rosenmontag parade . turning the world on its head karneval has its origins in the middle ages and is traditionally a roman catholic celebration .
it is closely associated with easter , as it always ends on ash wednesday , marking the beginning of lent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a so-called mullahburger , shown in düsseldorf last year , does not reflect carnival tradition parody and mockery are part of its tradition , said matthias von der bank , a historian from cologne 's carnival museum . " but it was n't satire like we have today , " von der bank said . " in the middle ages , carnival was a festival of reverse worlds and a playful expression of this , " von der bank said .
" so christian symbols , for example , were turned upside down . " but , he added , slandering the church was and is not part of carnival 's festivities . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de young carnival prince is also integration success story this year , the town of wesseling has dubbed a tunisian boy its traditional carnival prince .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 21.02.2006 opinion : turkish film makes waves in germany - unnecessarily großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reactions to the movie have been explosive in germany a turkish action film about the iraq war , " valley of the wolves , " has unleashed a wave of outrage in germany .
but as baha güngör observes , both positive and negative reactions to the movie are over the top . the most expensive turkish movie of all time , " valley of the wolves , " does nothing to contribute to an inter-cultural dialogue .
it can neither be interpreted as pro-european nor deemed to promote the integration of turks and muslims in germany or other eu countries .
but that was never the film 's intention . " valley of the wolves " is an action film , which uses anti-american cliches to build on a very real political sentiment .
and it does n't stop there .
besides the americans who are portrayed as the main bad guys , it flirts with an anti-semitic cliche in the form of a jewish doctor who works alongside trigger-happy americans in the human organ trade .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the film is ranked five at german box offices the film has drawn excited enthusiasm among turkish viewers and harsh criticism from elsewhere .
both are exaggerated .
germany 's conservatives have slammed the film as " morally harmful for young people " and a threat to societal harmony .
there have even been calls for the film to be withdrawn from general release , but they serve only to heighten interest therein . seen it all before foolish is the high praise lavished on the film - which is based on a true story deemed degrading in turkey - by turkish state and government representatives .
" valley of the wolves " tells the tale of the arrest of a turkish special unit by us troops in the kurdish region of northern iraq .
but beyond that , it is a fictitious action film that is of no greater artistic merit than many us kick-boxing and rambo pictures which frequently discredit other countries and peoples .
there are hundreds of such films which simplify entire cultural circles , depicting them in a negative light , as aggressive , dangerous or even murderous . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from valley of the wolves even the turks have felt disparaged by such movies , the most prominent example being the film " midnight express " from 1978 .
it showed the humiliating treatment of people in turkish jail and had countless turks on the warpath .
the depiction was no lie , but that did n't make the movie politically challenging .
" midnight express " belongs in the category " unavoidable , " like so many other films that , for example , show the horror of atrocities committed by former european colonial powers across the world . the truth is , in this global age , in which bans can only ever be imposed within national boundaries , we have to live with films like " valley of the wolves . "
not least because us policy on iraq is a constant source of good material for filmmakers with an interest in the subject . baha güngör -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german calls to ban controversial turkish movie on iraq german political leaders and jewish community representatives have demanded the boycott of a hit turkish action movie that casts us soldiers in iraq as villains .

traditionally , no topic is sacred during this time .
but the ongoing controversy over caricatures of the prophet mohammed will stay out of the festivities . a carnival skit poking fun at pope benedict xvi has raised a debate on just how far political cabaret can satirize certain topics . the carnival gala stunksitzung plans to show the sketch in which pope benedict xvi as a pop star and the archbishop of cologne , cardinal joachim meisner , as a wannabe pop star lie in a bed together .
the two end up smooching . a private citizen has now pressed charges against the stunksitzung for " disrupting religious peace . "
public television channel wdr , which will broadcast the gala on saturday , has decided to cut out the controversial part .
the station said its policies prescribed respect of religious feelings , which they said would have been hurt if the skit was broadcast . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should satire be allowed to present the pope as a pop star ? winni rau , spokesman for the stunksitzung , said the skit was an interpretation of the pope 's pop star qualities during world youth day , which took place in cologne last summer .
he said he did n't agree with wdr 's decision . " what is satire allowed to do in the western world ? "
rau said .
" we can debate this issue , but not forbid it . " rau said he wished wdr would have had " more courage . "
" i really think it 's a shame , " he said .
" it could have showed that we here in the west can also mock our own culture and religion . " people have to be able to handle satire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rote funken are a popular carnival society the stunksitzung is an alternative to the traditional galas , which mainly take place in the german karneval strongholds cologne , düsseldorf and mainz .
the galas are a regular part of the so-called " fifth season " between its kick-off on nov .
11 and the actual carnival week , which starts on the thursday before ash wednesday .
they include singing and dancing , but also orators , who address various political and societal topics . rau said the stunksitzung considers itself political cabaret . " this satire can and should also be directed against the church or political topics , " rau said .
" in the case of cabaret or satire , people have to be able to take it .
it is part of our culture . " cologne just wants to have fun bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you 'll find more happy than sad clowns in cologne in cologne , though , political and socio-critical issues have never been at the top of the carnival agenda , and they wo n't be this year either . " our philosophy is that carnival should be fun and friendly , " said sigrid krebs , spokeswoman for the city 's carnival committee . krebs said there would be satirical floats in the rosenmontag parade on carnival monday , one of the highlights of the " fifth season . " " but they have never been aimed at harming or offending people nor will they in the future , " krebs said . düsseldorf wants to avoid religious provocation just 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- further north , in düsseldorf , political and religious critique have been much more common in the past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this float had the motto " fostering tradition " last year , a float showed cardinal meisner striking a match to a woman tied to the stake , the words " i had an abortion " written on her .
in 2003 , the düsseldorf procession showed angela merkel , today 's chancellor , coming out of uncle sam 's behind - a statement on her support for the us invasion of iraq . bernd jost , spokesman for the düsseldorf carnival committee , said there would not be any floats dealing with religion this year . " in view of the current debate , we will be keeping very clear of things related to muslims , " jost said .
" we do n't want to fuel hatred . " according to jost , the well-being of the parade spectators was the top priority for the committee . the cartoon controversy is also not an issue on the agenda in the third carnival stronghold , mainz .
local and national issues are more a priority in the city 's rosenmontag parade . turning the world on its head karneval has its origins in the middle ages and is traditionally a roman catholic celebration .
it is closely associated with easter , as it always ends on ash wednesday , marking the beginning of lent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a so-called mullahburger , shown in düsseldorf last year , does not reflect carnival tradition parody and mockery are part of its tradition , said matthias von der bank , a historian from cologne 's carnival museum . " but it was n't satire like we have today , " von der bank said . " in the middle ages , carnival was a festival of reverse worlds and a playful expression of this , " von der bank said .
" so christian symbols , for example , were turned upside down . " but , he added , slandering the church was and is not part of carnival 's festivities . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de young carnival prince is also integration success story this year , the town of wesseling has dubbed a tunisian boy its traditional carnival prince .

but germany is hoping a state visit to japan will boost long-standing economic ties with that country . even though china has become the most important trade partner for german business in asia , german investors are keen on japan .
and for its part , japanese business appreciates germany as an " environmentally conscious " country . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier visited tokyo on tuesday , on his first asia tour since taking office in november under chancellor angela merkel .
steinmeier , who heads wednesday to beijing on a three-nation tour that began in south korea , called china 's rising clout on the world economic and political stage " a new challenge . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier met with his japanese counterpart , taro aso , on tuesday yet in talks with japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi , he stressed that japan , the world 's second-largest economy , and third-ranked germany could work together on a range of fields .
seeking cooperation " there are many common concerns between germany and japan .
we must tighten our relationship of cooperation , " he said .
" japan and germany can work together to set example for other countries . " in general , german business seems to agree with him .
for many years , japan was germany 's most important trade partner in the asia-pacific region - until china began opening its economy , hitting the world market like a tornado . at the end of 2002 , the volume of german-chinese trade overtook that of germany and japan .
today , german-japanese trade is worth around 43 billion euros -lrb- $ 51.2 billion -rrb- compared to 50 billion in china .
while in 2002 german direct investment in japan still outpaced that of china , by 2004 that had changed .
germany invested 653 million euros in japan in 2004 , according to germany 's foreign ministry , while the investment in china reached 1.06 billion for the same period , according to china 's foreign trade office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if both countries work together , perhaps everyone can make some money yet despite the lure of china and its massive market potential , many german companies have n't lost interest in japan . " a german company that is active in japan does n't get into the chinese market , " said wolfgang klenner , an east asia expert from the ruhr university in bochum . for one thing , the markets are entirely different .
" in japan , you can only get anywhere if you have the newest technologies and patents .
in china , the danger of piracy is too great , " he said .
klenner posits that the reason so many germans stick to investing in japan is that country 's reliable - and familiar - legal system . different markets business prospects for investors in japan are particularly good in the energy and environmental sectors .
japan needs to import nearly all its raw materials . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is a leader in wind power technology " in terms of energy production , japan is interested in anything that can make it more independent and stronger , " said markus taube of the east asia institute at the university of duisberg-essen .
this provides an opportunity for german business : the japanese are world leaders in solar energy , and germany leads in other areas of alternative energy production . wind energy , for example , is an area that japan wants to expand .
the country is on a mission to expand its wind-energy production eightfold , up to 3,000 megawatts by 2010 . germany 's environmental image germany is also a preferred partner for the japanese when it comes to environmental protection . " germany has the clear image in japan of an environmentally conscious country , " said friederike bosse of the association of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- .
scientific exchange in this area is also strong , and bosse said she believes german-japanese economic relations will benefit in the future from much of the academic cooperation that is currently underway . given these common interests , german business should take care not to lose sight of japan as a strategic economic partner , according to bochum university 's klenner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's growth is legendary , as is its building boom " japan is always underestimated , " klenner said .
" even if everyone is always talking about china , the real giant in asia and the world economy is japan . " it is an opinion that markus taube shares .
as soon as the german and japanese economies recover , and consumer spending increases , trade between the two nations will increase as well , he said . until then , however , china is the ideal land for racking up sales , both for japan and germany .
bosse , of the german industry association , said this brings up another trend worth looking at - german-japanese joint ventures in china . match made in heaven ? " germans and japanese are increasingly forming joint ventures .
they want to see if together , they can succeed in the chinese market . " it could be a match made in heaven , bosse believes .
unlike the japanese , the germans were not historical enemies of the chinese .
and the japanese can understand the asian market better . sonja lindenberg -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g4 knocks on security council doors again along with japan , brazil and india , german foreign minister fischer on thursday renewed calls for permanent security council membership , on the sidelines of the un world summit in new york .

traditionally , no topic is sacred during this time .
but the ongoing controversy over caricatures of the prophet mohammed will stay out of the festivities . a carnival skit poking fun at pope benedict xvi has raised a debate on just how far political cabaret can satirize certain topics . the carnival gala stunksitzung plans to show the sketch in which pope benedict xvi as a pop star and the archbishop of cologne , cardinal joachim meisner , as a wannabe pop star lie in a bed together .
the two end up smooching . a private citizen has now pressed charges against the stunksitzung for " disrupting religious peace . "
public television channel wdr , which will broadcast the gala on saturday , has decided to cut out the controversial part .
the station said its policies prescribed respect of religious feelings , which they said would have been hurt if the skit was broadcast . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should satire be allowed to present the pope as a pop star ? winni rau , spokesman for the stunksitzung , said the skit was an interpretation of the pope 's pop star qualities during world youth day , which took place in cologne last summer .
he said he did n't agree with wdr 's decision . " what is satire allowed to do in the western world ? "
rau said .
" we can debate this issue , but not forbid it . " rau said he wished wdr would have had " more courage . "

a german newspaper has written that us intelligence services spied on two german agents who remained in iraq during the us-led war in 2003 . citing a confidential government paper , the leipziger volkszeitung daily said that reports from the two german federal intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- agents stationed in baghdad to the services headquarters near munich may have been intercepted by us sources using a satellite telephone . the newspaper said that , in addition the two agents - who are currently involved in a controversy over their exact role during the war to which then chancellor gerhard schröder was so vehemently opposed - were " repeatedly pressed " to provide war intelligence from baghdad to the us commando headquarters in qatar .
it added that the german agents refused to be drawn in , but that 25 of 125 bnd reports were officially passed on to the us . according to the paper , the parliamentary control commission , which is charged with reviewing certain secret service activities , has all the information in the confidential report and will meet in berlin on wednesday to debate just how much of it should be made public . that decision could cause the opposition green party , which was the junior partner in schröder 's government , to rethink its objection to a parliamentary inquiry over the role of the bnd during the war , the newspaper wrote .
while the liberal fdp and the left party are both in favor of the inquiry , their votes are not enough to make it happen .

but germany is hoping a state visit to japan will boost long-standing economic ties with that country . even though china has become the most important trade partner for german business in asia , german investors are keen on japan .
and for its part , japanese business appreciates germany as an " environmentally conscious " country . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier visited tokyo on tuesday , on his first asia tour since taking office in november under chancellor angela merkel .
steinmeier , who heads wednesday to beijing on a three-nation tour that began in south korea , called china 's rising clout on the world economic and political stage " a new challenge . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 21.02.2006 opinion : turkish film makes waves in germany - unnecessarily großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reactions to the movie have been explosive in germany a turkish action film about the iraq war , " valley of the wolves , " has unleashed a wave of outrage in germany .
but as baha güngör observes , both positive and negative reactions to the movie are over the top . the most expensive turkish movie of all time , " valley of the wolves , " does nothing to contribute to an inter-cultural dialogue .
it can neither be interpreted as pro-european nor deemed to promote the integration of turks and muslims in germany or other eu countries .
but that was never the film 's intention . " valley of the wolves " is an action film , which uses anti-american cliches to build on a very real political sentiment .

but as baha güngör observes , both positive and negative reactions to the movie are over the top . the most expensive turkish movie of all time , " valley of the wolves , " does nothing to contribute to an inter-cultural dialogue .
it can neither be interpreted as pro-european nor deemed to promote the integration of turks and muslims in germany or other eu countries .
but that was never the film 's intention . " valley of the wolves " is an action film , which uses anti-american cliches to build on a very real political sentiment .
and it does n't stop there .
besides the americans who are portrayed as the main bad guys , it flirts with an anti-semitic cliche in the form of a jewish doctor who works alongside trigger-happy americans in the human organ trade .

but few people know that two-thirds of them went to army-sponsored athletes . the german army spends 25 million euros -lrb- $ 30 million -rrb- per year on sports training and it certainly seems to be getting its money 's worth . when sylke otto , silke kraushaar and tatjana hüfner won gold , silver and bronze in the luge competition last week , the victory was theirs - and the german army 's . ditto for kati wilhelm , who took a gold in biathlon -lrb- cross-country skiing and target shooting -rrb- , andre lang , who won a gold medal in the two-man bobsled , and the women 's cross-country ski team , which got a silver medal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kati wilhelm got gold for biathlon all of these athletes were competing for germany - but also for the german army , or bundeswehr .
they are all soldiers in the athletics-training department of the army where they prepared for the turin games . ' just one responsibility : training ' a total of 72 bundeswehr athletes are competing in turin .
that 's nearly half of germany 's 161-person team .
petty officer uwe witte , a trainer in the german army 's athletics-training division in the town of warendorf said there 's a reason why the bundeswehr program is so successful . " all their -lrb- the athletes ' -rrb- other responsibilities - school , family , household - disappear . here they can concentrate entirely on their sport .
of course , if you look at their schedule , there is not a lot of extra time to take care of other things . " the army has 22 sports-training departments across germany .
altogether , they support 744 athletes in 70 different sports .
such specialized athletics departments arose out of a decision the german parliament made in 1968 to promote sports in the country and to primarily rope in the army for that purpose . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luge slider sylke otto won a gold medal in turin georg remmert , who is temporarily in charge of the warendorf athletics-training department , said the training programs work both ways . " we are mostly here for the people who ca n't finance their training themselves .
in other words , the army is a kind of social net , " he said .
" it gives the athletes the security to be able to pursue their sport to such a degree of excellence .
in turn it shows the bundeswehr and germany in a good light internationally . " but only those who are already very accomplished athletes can be sponsored .
all those who have already made it to the national squad in their sport can apply .
in other words , the athletes are already very successful when they they are accepted into the army 's program . they are then assigned a trainer and are also meant to start following a normal soldier 's basic training .
later , they only need to fulfill 30 percent of a soldier 's normal duties ; the other 70 percent of their time is free for athletic training . best for winter sports the system seems to work especially well for winter sport athletes .
of 744 army athletes , only 200 are in winter sports , but they rack up the most successes .
much of that has to do with the popularity of winter sports in germany and particulary in the army .
further , athletes also have good infrastructure and training possibilies for winter olympic sports within germany . on top of that , " there are just fewer nations who do these winter sports , " said uwe witte .
" in turin , 84 countries are competing .
in contrast , there are 200 countries competing in the summer olympics .
-lrb- in summer -rrb- the spectrum of competing athletes is much bigger . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weight training rooms are used by regular soldiers too witte added that the bundeswehr placed great emphasis on supporting young , up-and-coming athletes .
" here , young people are pushed to be top in their field , in contrast to sponsorship by large companies , which is mostly aimed at a few very top athletes , " he said . josef nehren , head of the sports department of the bundeswehr , has high expectations for germany 's success in turin .
in salt lake city , in 2002 , soldiers took 25 of the total 35 medals that went to germany . " that is definitely good publicity .
but for me it is more important that it shows that our system is good , and that it works well when it is used right .
it also shows that money is being used well , " he said . julia spurzem -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de winter olympics in turin the 20th winter olympics kicked off on feb .

a german newspaper has written that us intelligence services spied on two german agents who remained in iraq during the us-led war in 2003 . citing a confidential government paper , the leipziger volkszeitung daily said that reports from the two german federal intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- agents stationed in baghdad to the services headquarters near munich may have been intercepted by us sources using a satellite telephone . the newspaper said that , in addition the two agents - who are currently involved in a controversy over their exact role during the war to which then chancellor gerhard schröder was so vehemently opposed - were " repeatedly pressed " to provide war intelligence from baghdad to the us commando headquarters in qatar .
it added that the german agents refused to be drawn in , but that 25 of 125 bnd reports were officially passed on to the us . according to the paper , the parliamentary control commission , which is charged with reviewing certain secret service activities , has all the information in the confidential report and will meet in berlin on wednesday to debate just how much of it should be made public . that decision could cause the opposition green party , which was the junior partner in schröder 's government , to rethink its objection to a parliamentary inquiry over the role of the bnd during the war , the newspaper wrote .

a german newspaper has written that us intelligence services spied on two german agents who remained in iraq during the us-led war in 2003 . citing a confidential government paper , the leipziger volkszeitung daily said that reports from the two german federal intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- agents stationed in baghdad to the services headquarters near munich may have been intercepted by us sources using a satellite telephone . the newspaper said that , in addition the two agents - who are currently involved in a controversy over their exact role during the war to which then chancellor gerhard schröder was so vehemently opposed - were " repeatedly pressed " to provide war intelligence from baghdad to the us commando headquarters in qatar .
it added that the german agents refused to be drawn in , but that 25 of 125 bnd reports were officially passed on to the us . according to the paper , the parliamentary control commission , which is charged with reviewing certain secret service activities , has all the information in the confidential report and will meet in berlin on wednesday to debate just how much of it should be made public . that decision could cause the opposition green party , which was the junior partner in schröder 's government , to rethink its objection to a parliamentary inquiry over the role of the bnd during the war , the newspaper wrote .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 21.02.2006 merkel asks cdu to start soul-searching großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian values must be at the heart of a cdu manifesto , merkel said german chancellor angela merkel has called for her party to review its basic beliefs and renew its emphasis , appealing for more " solidarity . " some 800 participants attended a small party conference in berlin monday , where the topic on hand was a reassessment of the ruling christian democratic union 's values .
cdu leader angela merkel took the opportunity to call for fundamental change , but stressed the need to keep christian values at the core of the party 's ideology . in a debate that is expected to go on for two years , the cdu wants to refine its image within the " grand coalition " government -lrb- it currently shares power with the the social democrats . -rrb-
to do this , it plans to modernize its manifesto .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a weak election result forced the cdu to govern with the spd by claiming a phrase historically associated with workers ' parties and the opposing social democrats - solidarity - the cdu is seen to be angling for more support after a razor-thin win at the polls last year .
' solidarity is patriotism ' solidarity needs to be seen on a par with basic values like freedom and justice , in order to keep germany on the right path , merkel said .
sounding more like the leader of a workers ' union than a conservative government , merkel said : " we have to remain in a country where solidarity is practiced without asking about the material gains . "
" freedom and solidarity - for us , this combination is not unattainable , " merkel told the party faithful .
" the ability to exercise solidarity is perhaps one of the most important patriotic abilities . "
questioning the social-market economy the most important thing is for the cdu to take a new look at germany 's social-market economy , merkel said .
in her first big party speech since being elected to office nearly 100 days ago , merkel noted that the party 's current manifesto , created in 1994 , " fails to answer a whole array " of modern-day questions .
that is especially true when it comes to social and economic policies , she said .
" we want to secure the future of the social-market economy .
but we realize that with globalization , certain basic conditions have changed , " she said .
as a result , people are rejecting germany 's current economic model .
" only a minority considers the social-market economy to be fair , " merkel said .
christianity at the base party members and committees will meet repeatedly to discuss the new manifesto between now and late 2007 , when it will be put up for a vote .
merkel said the basis of the cdu manifesto needs to be christian values , and warned that the party has to " figure out what it can absolutely not afford to lose . "
she urged the cdu to discuss basic values with people from other countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heiner geißler of the cdu the party also unveiled a new motto , " new justice through more freedom . " ex-cdu general secretary heiner geißler told the express newspaper he thought the motto was " backwards , " adding that freedom alone can not bring about justice . and michael sommer , head of the association of german unions , told the kölner stadt anzeiger that the cdu seemed to be on a course of " basic social renovation . "
the discussion " reflects the fact that in germany , you ca n't get a majority of votes with neo-liberal rhetoric , " he said . a number of active members concentrated on the idea that the cdu should stress its roots in christian belief and values .
the head of the cdu 's workers ' wing , karl laumann , told the passauer neuen presse that the cdu " needs to unconditionally stand up for christian social teachings and social justice .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 21.02.2006 merkel asks cdu to start soul-searching großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian values must be at the heart of a cdu manifesto , merkel said german chancellor angela merkel has called for her party to review its basic beliefs and renew its emphasis , appealing for more " solidarity . " some 800 participants attended a small party conference in berlin monday , where the topic on hand was a reassessment of the ruling christian democratic union 's values .
cdu leader angela merkel took the opportunity to call for fundamental change , but stressed the need to keep christian values at the core of the party 's ideology . in a debate that is expected to go on for two years , the cdu wants to refine its image within the " grand coalition " government -lrb- it currently shares power with the the social democrats . -rrb-
to do this , it plans to modernize its manifesto .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a weak election result forced the cdu to govern with the spd by claiming a phrase historically associated with workers ' parties and the opposing social democrats - solidarity - the cdu is seen to be angling for more support after a razor-thin win at the polls last year .
' solidarity is patriotism ' solidarity needs to be seen on a par with basic values like freedom and justice , in order to keep germany on the right path , merkel said .
sounding more like the leader of a workers ' union than a conservative government , merkel said : " we have to remain in a country where solidarity is practiced without asking about the material gains . "
" freedom and solidarity - for us , this combination is not unattainable , " merkel told the party faithful .
" the ability to exercise solidarity is perhaps one of the most important patriotic abilities . "
questioning the social-market economy the most important thing is for the cdu to take a new look at germany 's social-market economy , merkel said .
in her first big party speech since being elected to office nearly 100 days ago , merkel noted that the party 's current manifesto , created in 1994 , " fails to answer a whole array " of modern-day questions .
that is especially true when it comes to social and economic policies , she said .
" we want to secure the future of the social-market economy .
but we realize that with globalization , certain basic conditions have changed , " she said .
as a result , people are rejecting germany 's current economic model .
" only a minority considers the social-market economy to be fair , " merkel said .
christianity at the base party members and committees will meet repeatedly to discuss the new manifesto between now and late 2007 , when it will be put up for a vote .
merkel said the basis of the cdu manifesto needs to be christian values , and warned that the party has to " figure out what it can absolutely not afford to lose . "
she urged the cdu to discuss basic values with people from other countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heiner geißler of the cdu the party also unveiled a new motto , " new justice through more freedom . " ex-cdu general secretary heiner geißler told the express newspaper he thought the motto was " backwards , " adding that freedom alone can not bring about justice . and michael sommer , head of the association of german unions , told the kölner stadt anzeiger that the cdu seemed to be on a course of " basic social renovation . "
the discussion " reflects the fact that in germany , you ca n't get a majority of votes with neo-liberal rhetoric , " he said . a number of active members concentrated on the idea that the cdu should stress its roots in christian belief and values .
the head of the cdu 's workers ' wing , karl laumann , told the passauer neuen presse that the cdu " needs to unconditionally stand up for christian social teachings and social justice .

but germany is hoping a state visit to japan will boost long-standing economic ties with that country . even though china has become the most important trade partner for german business in asia , german investors are keen on japan .
and for its part , japanese business appreciates germany as an " environmentally conscious " country . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier visited tokyo on tuesday , on his first asia tour since taking office in november under chancellor angela merkel .
steinmeier , who heads wednesday to beijing on a three-nation tour that began in south korea , called china 's rising clout on the world economic and political stage " a new challenge . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier met with his japanese counterpart , taro aso , on tuesday yet in talks with japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi , he stressed that japan , the world 's second-largest economy , and third-ranked germany could work together on a range of fields .
seeking cooperation " there are many common concerns between germany and japan .
we must tighten our relationship of cooperation , " he said .
" japan and germany can work together to set example for other countries . " in general , german business seems to agree with him .
for many years , japan was germany 's most important trade partner in the asia-pacific region - until china began opening its economy , hitting the world market like a tornado . at the end of 2002 , the volume of german-chinese trade overtook that of germany and japan .
today , german-japanese trade is worth around 43 billion euros -lrb- $ 51.2 billion -rrb- compared to 50 billion in china .
while in 2002 german direct investment in japan still outpaced that of china , by 2004 that had changed .
germany invested 653 million euros in japan in 2004 , according to germany 's foreign ministry , while the investment in china reached 1.06 billion for the same period , according to china 's foreign trade office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if both countries work together , perhaps everyone can make some money yet despite the lure of china and its massive market potential , many german companies have n't lost interest in japan . " a german company that is active in japan does n't get into the chinese market , " said wolfgang klenner , an east asia expert from the ruhr university in bochum . for one thing , the markets are entirely different .
" in japan , you can only get anywhere if you have the newest technologies and patents .
in china , the danger of piracy is too great , " he said .
klenner posits that the reason so many germans stick to investing in japan is that country 's reliable - and familiar - legal system . different markets business prospects for investors in japan are particularly good in the energy and environmental sectors .
japan needs to import nearly all its raw materials . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is a leader in wind power technology " in terms of energy production , japan is interested in anything that can make it more independent and stronger , " said markus taube of the east asia institute at the university of duisberg-essen .
this provides an opportunity for german business : the japanese are world leaders in solar energy , and germany leads in other areas of alternative energy production . wind energy , for example , is an area that japan wants to expand .
the country is on a mission to expand its wind-energy production eightfold , up to 3,000 megawatts by 2010 . germany 's environmental image germany is also a preferred partner for the japanese when it comes to environmental protection . " germany has the clear image in japan of an environmentally conscious country , " said friederike bosse of the association of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- .
scientific exchange in this area is also strong , and bosse said she believes german-japanese economic relations will benefit in the future from much of the academic cooperation that is currently underway . given these common interests , german business should take care not to lose sight of japan as a strategic economic partner , according to bochum university 's klenner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's growth is legendary , as is its building boom " japan is always underestimated , " klenner said .
" even if everyone is always talking about china , the real giant in asia and the world economy is japan . " it is an opinion that markus taube shares .
as soon as the german and japanese economies recover , and consumer spending increases , trade between the two nations will increase as well , he said . until then , however , china is the ideal land for racking up sales , both for japan and germany .
bosse , of the german industry association , said this brings up another trend worth looking at - german-japanese joint ventures in china . match made in heaven ? " germans and japanese are increasingly forming joint ventures .

" " the main question is the creation of a more normal situation and to reduce this tension so that we wo n't have people making unreasonable demands of each other , " he said before leaving for iran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sergey lavrov but russian foreign minister sergei lavrov was markedly more cautious . " i think it would be premature to use terms such as failure or success , " he told reporters . russia , as a veto-wielding member of the un security council with traditionally close ties to iran , has long tried to mediate in the long-running dispute over its partner 's nuclear program .
its proposal is to create a joint venture that would enrich uranium for tehran 's energy needs on russian soil . russia sees it as a means of getting iran to reinstate its moratorium on uranium enrichment work , after tehran broke seals at three nuclear facilities last month and signaled its intention to resume nuclear work . iran stresses talks with russia , not eu the proposal by moscow has been cautiously welcomed by western countries , which suspect iran 's stated intention to develop peaceful nuclear energy is simply a cover for developing atomic weapons . iranian officials have also hinted that they attach greater significance to negotiations with moscow rather than with the eu troika of germany , france and britain who have been holding on-and-off talks with teheran for over two years . " our contacts with the european union will for the moment not be held only with the eu-3 , but also in a unilateral manner with the different countries of the european union , " mottaki told reporters following talks on monday with eu officials in brussels . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said on a visit to japan that diplomacy can still work in resolving the iranian nuclear standoff even though economic sanctions can not be ruled out .
" the issue of a military option does not arise , " steinmeier told a news conference .

he is due to meet senior iranian officials and to visit a nuclear power station that russia is building for iran at bushehr , in southern iran . bildunterschrift : un security council however iran has shown no sign of willingness to restore a moratorium on uranium enrichment at home , a key demand of the west . iran has been reported to the un security council over its nuclear activities , and a march 6 meeting of the un 's international atomic energy agency will be vital in determining how the world body responds . moscow has repeatedly cautioned against a possible imposition of sanctions . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran issues enrichment threat but considers russian proposal iran said monday that it would restart uranium enrichment work despite international objections .

but few people know that two-thirds of them went to army-sponsored athletes . the german army spends 25 million euros -lrb- $ 30 million -rrb- per year on sports training and it certainly seems to be getting its money 's worth . when sylke otto , silke kraushaar and tatjana hüfner won gold , silver and bronze in the luge competition last week , the victory was theirs - and the german army 's . ditto for kati wilhelm , who took a gold in biathlon -lrb- cross-country skiing and target shooting -rrb- , andre lang , who won a gold medal in the two-man bobsled , and the women 's cross-country ski team , which got a silver medal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kati wilhelm got gold for biathlon all of these athletes were competing for germany - but also for the german army , or bundeswehr .
they are all soldiers in the athletics-training department of the army where they prepared for the turin games . ' just one responsibility : training ' a total of 72 bundeswehr athletes are competing in turin .
that 's nearly half of germany 's 161-person team .
petty officer uwe witte , a trainer in the german army 's athletics-training division in the town of warendorf said there 's a reason why the bundeswehr program is so successful . " all their -lrb- the athletes ' -rrb- other responsibilities - school , family , household - disappear . here they can concentrate entirely on their sport .
of course , if you look at their schedule , there is not a lot of extra time to take care of other things . " the army has 22 sports-training departments across germany .
altogether , they support 744 athletes in 70 different sports .
such specialized athletics departments arose out of a decision the german parliament made in 1968 to promote sports in the country and to primarily rope in the army for that purpose . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luge slider sylke otto won a gold medal in turin georg remmert , who is temporarily in charge of the warendorf athletics-training department , said the training programs work both ways . " we are mostly here for the people who ca n't finance their training themselves .
in other words , the army is a kind of social net , " he said .
" it gives the athletes the security to be able to pursue their sport to such a degree of excellence .
in turn it shows the bundeswehr and germany in a good light internationally . " but only those who are already very accomplished athletes can be sponsored .
all those who have already made it to the national squad in their sport can apply .
in other words , the athletes are already very successful when they they are accepted into the army 's program . they are then assigned a trainer and are also meant to start following a normal soldier 's basic training .
later , they only need to fulfill 30 percent of a soldier 's normal duties ; the other 70 percent of their time is free for athletic training . best for winter sports the system seems to work especially well for winter sport athletes .
of 744 army athletes , only 200 are in winter sports , but they rack up the most successes .
much of that has to do with the popularity of winter sports in germany and particulary in the army .
further , athletes also have good infrastructure and training possibilies for winter olympic sports within germany . on top of that , " there are just fewer nations who do these winter sports , " said uwe witte .
" in turin , 84 countries are competing .
in contrast , there are 200 countries competing in the summer olympics .
-lrb- in summer -rrb- the spectrum of competing athletes is much bigger . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weight training rooms are used by regular soldiers too witte added that the bundeswehr placed great emphasis on supporting young , up-and-coming athletes .
" here , young people are pushed to be top in their field , in contrast to sponsorship by large companies , which is mostly aimed at a few very top athletes , " he said . josef nehren , head of the sports department of the bundeswehr , has high expectations for germany 's success in turin .
in salt lake city , in 2002 , soldiers took 25 of the total 35 medals that went to germany . " that is definitely good publicity .
but for me it is more important that it shows that our system is good , and that it works well when it is used right .
it also shows that money is being used well , " he said . julia spurzem -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de winter olympics in turin the 20th winter olympics kicked off on feb .

the foreign minister pointed out that the present government grand coalition of social democrats and christian democrats were in favor of deciding the issue on a european level . at the same time steinmeier added that germany already had one of the strictest export restrictions in the eu and added that even a lifting of the eu arms embargo would n't lead to " a more liberal approach -lrb- towards china -rrb- in germany . "
the latter was also one of former chancellor schröder 's main arguments as he pushed for the eu to drop the existing arms ban . business high on the agenda but , away from the arms embargo issue , which is unlikely to go down well with chinese leaders , much of steinmeier 's visit is likely to be consumed by business talk . germany and china have cooperated closely in the areas of culture , science , environmental protection .
the two countries are engaged in a dialogue about the rule of law and - last but not least - have established strong business ties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view of the shanghai skyline germany is china 's strongest european economic partner and china remains germany 's most important market in asia .
former german chancellor gerhard schröder has played a central role in promoting these ties : during his time in office , he traveled to the country six times , a large delegation of german business leaders in tow . steinmeier will also visit china with a group of representatives from german companies - albeit mid-sized ones .
as he already announced when taking over the foreign office from his predecessor , joschka fischer , steinmeier seems to see the support of german business interests as one of his ministry 's duties . more pushy tha n schröder ? while steinmeier served as schröder 's chief-of-staff and was likely supportive of the latter 's pragmatic approach towards china and russia when it came to addressing human rights , as foreign minister , he 's not going to be able to avoid the issue , according to experts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor schröder inspects a traditonal chinese dragon " he knows that this is an important element of german domestic politics , " said eberhard sandschneider , an expert on china at the german council on foreign relations .
" the german public expects a german politician to address this sensitive topic .
but frank-walter steinmeier is experienced enough to know that he will not be able to bring about any immediate changes this way . " members of china 's opposition in germany still have high hopes for the new german government .
last week , they sent a letter to the foreign ministry to inform the minister about the human rights situation in china . urgi n g more participatio n as global player but apart from this rather unpleasant topic for steinmeier 's hosts , the foreign minister will also try and encourage china 's leaders to step up to the plate when it comes to taking on responsibility as a world power . " such an emerging giant needs to take on global responsibilities , " said steinmeiner , who will also prepare chancellor angela merkel 's visit that 's likely to take place in july . " he really means the question of how to deal with iran , " sandschneider said .
" china has a very , very important role to play - in case of a vote in the un security council , for example .
getting china to actively cooperate with the west in this respect is an important goal . " the problem of copyright protectio n copyright protection will be another item high on steinmeier 's agenda as the chinese are known not to take this too seriously .
german companies meanwhile lose billions each year because of product piracy .
and only last week , china announced plans to build its own high speed train based on the german-made transrapid magnet rail , pushing the problem if technology theft in the foreground yet again . " it 's a very difficult issue for many german companies and german foreign policy , " sanschneider said .
" it will certainly be discussed , but the chinese answer is already clear : the government will signal that it is working to improve the situation , but that it will take years for this to happen .

traditionally , no topic is sacred during this time .
but the ongoing controversy over caricatures of the prophet mohammed will stay out of the festivities . a carnival skit poking fun at pope benedict xvi has raised a debate on just how far political cabaret can satirize certain topics . the carnival gala stunksitzung plans to show the sketch in which pope benedict xvi as a pop star and the archbishop of cologne , cardinal joachim meisner , as a wannabe pop star lie in a bed together .
the two end up smooching . a private citizen has now pressed charges against the stunksitzung for " disrupting religious peace . "
public television channel wdr , which will broadcast the gala on saturday , has decided to cut out the controversial part .
the station said its policies prescribed respect of religious feelings , which they said would have been hurt if the skit was broadcast . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should satire be allowed to present the pope as a pop star ? winni rau , spokesman for the stunksitzung , said the skit was an interpretation of the pope 's pop star qualities during world youth day , which took place in cologne last summer .
he said he did n't agree with wdr 's decision . " what is satire allowed to do in the western world ? "
rau said .
" we can debate this issue , but not forbid it . " rau said he wished wdr would have had " more courage . "
" i really think it 's a shame , " he said .
" it could have showed that we here in the west can also mock our own culture and religion . " people have to be able to handle satire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rote funken are a popular carnival society the stunksitzung is an alternative to the traditional galas , which mainly take place in the german karneval strongholds cologne , düsseldorf and mainz .
the galas are a regular part of the so-called " fifth season " between its kick-off on nov .
11 and the actual carnival week , which starts on the thursday before ash wednesday .
they include singing and dancing , but also orators , who address various political and societal topics . rau said the stunksitzung considers itself political cabaret . " this satire can and should also be directed against the church or political topics , " rau said .
" in the case of cabaret or satire , people have to be able to take it .
it is part of our culture . " cologne just wants to have fun bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you 'll find more happy than sad clowns in cologne in cologne , though , political and socio-critical issues have never been at the top of the carnival agenda , and they wo n't be this year either . " our philosophy is that carnival should be fun and friendly , " said sigrid krebs , spokeswoman for the city 's carnival committee . krebs said there would be satirical floats in the rosenmontag parade on carnival monday , one of the highlights of the " fifth season . " " but they have never been aimed at harming or offending people nor will they in the future , " krebs said . düsseldorf wants to avoid religious provocation just 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- further north , in düsseldorf , political and religious critique have been much more common in the past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this float had the motto " fostering tradition " last year , a float showed cardinal meisner striking a match to a woman tied to the stake , the words " i had an abortion " written on her .

bird flu psychosis is spreading faster than the virus itself . it was a surprise that germany 's airports were not inundated with fleeing citizens ; fighting each other for the last available seats to safety , panicked to distraction with only thoughts of escape passing through their fear-frazzled minds . " the feathered death - it has landed , " blared a headline in the berliner zeitung newspaper heralding the arrival of bird flu in germany last week along with , if the media were to be believed , the three other horsemen of the apocalypse . adding to the hysteria was the fact that if germany were to empty its borders , where would the escapees flee to ?
pestilence was everywhere .
not a corner of the globe was untouched .
poultry magnates considering the end of their empires must have seriously been considering investing their last euros in space tourism . as the people of europe looked to their leaders for guidance , some like germany 's chancellor merkel could barely hide their concern .
" the situation is very serious , " merkel said after a personal visit to the northern german island of rügen after avian flu struck there . everything seemed to add up to a doomsday scenario , a worldwide crisis which would sell a million copies in paperback if there would be anyone left alive to read it . welcome to the age of bird flu psychosis . the lethal h5n1 virus landed in western europe last week for the first time , littering parts of italy , greece , france , germany and austria with the carcasses of dead migratory birds and those domestic winged victims who were unlucky enough to fraternize with the infected before they quacked their last . a global panic six years in the making bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asia 's harsh lesson should have been learned sooner by europe it should have come as little surprise .
bird flu had been winging its way to europe , slowly but surely , since the disease first emerged in hong kong in 1997 .
it took its time but eventually made it to europe 's borders in october when it claimed a handful of teenage human victims and thousands of feathered fatalities on its way into the eu . six years .
plenty of time , one would imagine , for european leaders and health experts to have some sort of plan ready .
but when the first cases cropped up in italy and greece , the authorities were as shocked as anyone .
when the northern german island of rügen reported a batch of dead swans , it remained that way for some time because of a conflict between federal state and district laws which prevented the authorities from sending in a clean-up team immediately . the fact that governments and health organizations around the world seem to be at a loss to stop the spread of the virus and have no tried and tested means to cure the disease once it is contracted by humans could rightly cause some concern .
but the reactions of the general public , at the moment at least , far outstrip the actual threat . depression , suicide and poultry embargoes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the poultry industry is beginning to feel the heat in italy , for instance , the threat of unemployment due to the poultry industry being hit by panic embargoes on chicken caused one delivery man to kill his wife and child and then himself in a fit of manic depression . " he was very worried because we told him there 'd be less work because of the crisis , " an official from the man ’ s firm told the newspaper la repubblica .
it is by far the most extreme case recorded so far but there is no doubt that a lot more people are concerned to a lesser degree .
since the beginning of last week , the italian health ministry has received more than 13,000 phone calls to a special bird flu hotline to report dead birds or ask for advice . german red tape and insecurity fuels public confusion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin gave its fallen blackbird a guard of honor in germany , citizens have been urged to report dead birds to the police in an attempt to limit the impact after the rügen outbreak spread to the mainland .
such is the concern that a dead blackbird in a berlin suburb required what the attending fire chief called " a full state funeral " when a decontamination team in full bio-suits turned up to remove the corpse .
and help lines in germany have been inundated with calls from concerned people . a spokesperson for the federal ministry of food , agriculture and consumer protection told dw-world that while there were no official caller numbers available , a conservative estimate would be in the " high hundreds . "
all nine hot lines , however , were constantly engaged suggesting the estimate is very conservative . georg alpers , a psychologist at the university of würzburg believes that it is the not knowing which is causing most of the panic .
" we do not know at the moment what the concrete dangers are , how we could protect ourselves from these possible dangers and whether we are actually in danger .
from such insecurity , fear can grow . "

a strong form of the virus would send the death rate - and the panic levels - sky high . but the strength of that version of the virus is also a matter of debate .
many scientists believe the human form could be milder than that affecting birds .
also , the disease appears to be treatable with the antiviral drug , tamiflu -lrb- oseltamvir -rrb- , which is known to be effective in the early stages or as a preventative treatment . in the context of world population , infection negligible so far , the virus has infected 169 people in seven countries , killing 91 , according to the world health organization .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : winter olympics in turin germany 's hopefuls at the winter olympics court decision paves olympics way for stasi-linked coach many potential security threats as winter olympics kick off doping allegations tarnish olympics opening olympics -pipe- 21.02.2006 soldier-athletes lead germany to medals großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german women 's cross country ski team are silver medalists - and soldiers germany has already clinched some 18 medals at the winter olympics underway in turin .
but few people know that two-thirds of them went to army-sponsored athletes . the german army spends 25 million euros -lrb- $ 30 million -rrb- per year on sports training and it certainly seems to be getting its money 's worth . when sylke otto , silke kraushaar and tatjana hüfner won gold , silver and bronze in the luge competition last week , the victory was theirs - and the german army 's . ditto for kati wilhelm , who took a gold in biathlon -lrb- cross-country skiing and target shooting -rrb- , andre lang , who won a gold medal in the two-man bobsled , and the women 's cross-country ski team , which got a silver medal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kati wilhelm got gold for biathlon all of these athletes were competing for germany - but also for the german army , or bundeswehr .
they are all soldiers in the athletics-training department of the army where they prepared for the turin games . ' just one responsibility : training ' a total of 72 bundeswehr athletes are competing in turin .
that 's nearly half of germany 's 161-person team .
petty officer uwe witte , a trainer in the german army 's athletics-training division in the town of warendorf said there 's a reason why the bundeswehr program is so successful . " all their -lrb- the athletes ' -rrb- other responsibilities - school , family , household - disappear . here they can concentrate entirely on their sport .
of course , if you look at their schedule , there is not a lot of extra time to take care of other things . " the army has 22 sports-training departments across germany .
altogether , they support 744 athletes in 70 different sports .
such specialized athletics departments arose out of a decision the german parliament made in 1968 to promote sports in the country and to primarily rope in the army for that purpose . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luge slider sylke otto won a gold medal in turin georg remmert , who is temporarily in charge of the warendorf athletics-training department , said the training programs work both ways . " we are mostly here for the people who ca n't finance their training themselves .
in other words , the army is a kind of social net , " he said .
" it gives the athletes the security to be able to pursue their sport to such a degree of excellence .
in turn it shows the bundeswehr and germany in a good light internationally . " but only those who are already very accomplished athletes can be sponsored .
all those who have already made it to the national squad in their sport can apply .
in other words , the athletes are already very successful when they they are accepted into the army 's program . they are then assigned a trainer and are also meant to start following a normal soldier 's basic training .
later , they only need to fulfill 30 percent of a soldier 's normal duties ; the other 70 percent of their time is free for athletic training . best for winter sports the system seems to work especially well for winter sport athletes .
of 744 army athletes , only 200 are in winter sports , but they rack up the most successes .
much of that has to do with the popularity of winter sports in germany and particulary in the army .
further , athletes also have good infrastructure and training possibilies for winter olympic sports within germany . on top of that , " there are just fewer nations who do these winter sports , " said uwe witte .
" in turin , 84 countries are competing .
in contrast , there are 200 countries competing in the summer olympics .
-lrb- in summer -rrb- the spectrum of competing athletes is much bigger . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weight training rooms are used by regular soldiers too witte added that the bundeswehr placed great emphasis on supporting young , up-and-coming athletes .
" here , young people are pushed to be top in their field , in contrast to sponsorship by large companies , which is mostly aimed at a few very top athletes , " he said . josef nehren , head of the sports department of the bundeswehr , has high expectations for germany 's success in turin .
in salt lake city , in 2002 , soldiers took 25 of the total 35 medals that went to germany . " that is definitely good publicity .
but for me it is more important that it shows that our system is good , and that it works well when it is used right .
it also shows that money is being used well , " he said . julia spurzem -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de winter olympics in turin the 20th winter olympics kicked off on feb .

bird flu psychosis is spreading faster than the virus itself . it was a surprise that germany 's airports were not inundated with fleeing citizens ; fighting each other for the last available seats to safety , panicked to distraction with only thoughts of escape passing through their fear-frazzled minds . " the feathered death - it has landed , " blared a headline in the berliner zeitung newspaper heralding the arrival of bird flu in germany last week along with , if the media were to be believed , the three other horsemen of the apocalypse . adding to the hysteria was the fact that if germany were to empty its borders , where would the escapees flee to ?
pestilence was everywhere .
not a corner of the globe was untouched .
poultry magnates considering the end of their empires must have seriously been considering investing their last euros in space tourism . as the people of europe looked to their leaders for guidance , some like germany 's chancellor merkel could barely hide their concern .
" the situation is very serious , " merkel said after a personal visit to the northern german island of rügen after avian flu struck there . everything seemed to add up to a doomsday scenario , a worldwide crisis which would sell a million copies in paperback if there would be anyone left alive to read it . welcome to the age of bird flu psychosis . the lethal h5n1 virus landed in western europe last week for the first time , littering parts of italy , greece , france , germany and austria with the carcasses of dead migratory birds and those domestic winged victims who were unlucky enough to fraternize with the infected before they quacked their last . a global panic six years in the making bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asia 's harsh lesson should have been learned sooner by europe it should have come as little surprise .
bird flu had been winging its way to europe , slowly but surely , since the disease first emerged in hong kong in 1997 .
it took its time but eventually made it to europe 's borders in october when it claimed a handful of teenage human victims and thousands of feathered fatalities on its way into the eu . six years .
plenty of time , one would imagine , for european leaders and health experts to have some sort of plan ready .
but when the first cases cropped up in italy and greece , the authorities were as shocked as anyone .
when the northern german island of rügen reported a batch of dead swans , it remained that way for some time because of a conflict between federal state and district laws which prevented the authorities from sending in a clean-up team immediately . the fact that governments and health organizations around the world seem to be at a loss to stop the spread of the virus and have no tried and tested means to cure the disease once it is contracted by humans could rightly cause some concern .
but the reactions of the general public , at the moment at least , far outstrip the actual threat . depression , suicide and poultry embargoes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the poultry industry is beginning to feel the heat in italy , for instance , the threat of unemployment due to the poultry industry being hit by panic embargoes on chicken caused one delivery man to kill his wife and child and then himself in a fit of manic depression . " he was very worried because we told him there 'd be less work because of the crisis , " an official from the man ’ s firm told the newspaper la repubblica .
it is by far the most extreme case recorded so far but there is no doubt that a lot more people are concerned to a lesser degree .
since the beginning of last week , the italian health ministry has received more than 13,000 phone calls to a special bird flu hotline to report dead birds or ask for advice . german red tape and insecurity fuels public confusion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin gave its fallen blackbird a guard of honor in germany , citizens have been urged to report dead birds to the police in an attempt to limit the impact after the rügen outbreak spread to the mainland .
such is the concern that a dead blackbird in a berlin suburb required what the attending fire chief called " a full state funeral " when a decontamination team in full bio-suits turned up to remove the corpse .
and help lines in germany have been inundated with calls from concerned people . a spokesperson for the federal ministry of food , agriculture and consumer protection told dw-world that while there were no official caller numbers available , a conservative estimate would be in the " high hundreds . "
all nine hot lines , however , were constantly engaged suggesting the estimate is very conservative . georg alpers , a psychologist at the university of würzburg believes that it is the not knowing which is causing most of the panic .
" we do not know at the moment what the concrete dangers are , how we could protect ourselves from these possible dangers and whether we are actually in danger .
from such insecurity , fear can grow . "
special effort required to catch bird flu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the experts deal with infected birds so you do n't have to while there is little doubt that a human bird flu pandemic is a possibility , scientists are increasingly stressing the ' if ' rather than ' when ' argument - and many believe it is a large ' if ' .
right now , to contract bird flu one would have to visit a contaminated area and have sustained contact with an infected bird or corpse , something most conscientious people would no doubt do their utmost to avoid . if the disease were to mutate into a version that could pass easily from one person to another - the main fear of health experts - then there would be more reason for concern .
a strong form of the virus would send the death rate - and the panic levels - sky high . but the strength of that version of the virus is also a matter of debate .
many scientists believe the human form could be milder than that affecting birds .
also , the disease appears to be treatable with the antiviral drug , tamiflu -lrb- oseltamvir -rrb- , which is known to be effective in the early stages or as a preventative treatment . in the context of world population , infection negligible so far , the virus has infected 169 people in seven countries , killing 91 , according to the world health organization .
despite the mortality rate being just under 50 percent , in relation to the combined population figures of those seven countries , the number of people infected is minute and those who have died even more so . the fact is the threat is real and people have died .
but as the situation stands at the moment , the threat to humans is negligible .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 21.02.2006 german carnival steers clear of religious topics großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's carnival float-makers are comfortable with controversy carnival kicks off across germany this week .
traditionally , no topic is sacred during this time .
but the ongoing controversy over caricatures of the prophet mohammed will stay out of the festivities . a carnival skit poking fun at pope benedict xvi has raised a debate on just how far political cabaret can satirize certain topics . the carnival gala stunksitzung plans to show the sketch in which pope benedict xvi as a pop star and the archbishop of cologne , cardinal joachim meisner , as a wannabe pop star lie in a bed together .
the two end up smooching . a private citizen has now pressed charges against the stunksitzung for " disrupting religious peace . "
public television channel wdr , which will broadcast the gala on saturday , has decided to cut out the controversial part .
the station said its policies prescribed respect of religious feelings , which they said would have been hurt if the skit was broadcast . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should satire be allowed to present the pope as a pop star ? winni rau , spokesman for the stunksitzung , said the skit was an interpretation of the pope 's pop star qualities during world youth day , which took place in cologne last summer .
he said he did n't agree with wdr 's decision . " what is satire allowed to do in the western world ? "
rau said .
" we can debate this issue , but not forbid it . " rau said he wished wdr would have had " more courage . "
" i really think it 's a shame , " he said .
" it could have showed that we here in the west can also mock our own culture and religion . " people have to be able to handle satire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rote funken are a popular carnival society the stunksitzung is an alternative to the traditional galas , which mainly take place in the german karneval strongholds cologne , düsseldorf and mainz .
the galas are a regular part of the so-called " fifth season " between its kick-off on nov .
11 and the actual carnival week , which starts on the thursday before ash wednesday .
they include singing and dancing , but also orators , who address various political and societal topics . rau said the stunksitzung considers itself political cabaret . " this satire can and should also be directed against the church or political topics , " rau said .
" in the case of cabaret or satire , people have to be able to take it .
it is part of our culture . " cologne just wants to have fun bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you 'll find more happy than sad clowns in cologne in cologne , though , political and socio-critical issues have never been at the top of the carnival agenda , and they wo n't be this year either . " our philosophy is that carnival should be fun and friendly , " said sigrid krebs , spokeswoman for the city 's carnival committee . krebs said there would be satirical floats in the rosenmontag parade on carnival monday , one of the highlights of the " fifth season . " " but they have never been aimed at harming or offending people nor will they in the future , " krebs said . düsseldorf wants to avoid religious provocation just 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- further north , in düsseldorf , political and religious critique have been much more common in the past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this float had the motto " fostering tradition " last year , a float showed cardinal meisner striking a match to a woman tied to the stake , the words " i had an abortion " written on her .
in 2003 , the düsseldorf procession showed angela merkel , today 's chancellor , coming out of uncle sam 's behind - a statement on her support for the us invasion of iraq . bernd jost , spokesman for the düsseldorf carnival committee , said there would not be any floats dealing with religion this year . " in view of the current debate , we will be keeping very clear of things related to muslims , " jost said .
" we do n't want to fuel hatred . " according to jost , the well-being of the parade spectators was the top priority for the committee . the cartoon controversy is also not an issue on the agenda in the third carnival stronghold , mainz .
local and national issues are more a priority in the city 's rosenmontag parade . turning the world on its head karneval has its origins in the middle ages and is traditionally a roman catholic celebration .
it is closely associated with easter , as it always ends on ash wednesday , marking the beginning of lent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a so-called mullahburger , shown in düsseldorf last year , does not reflect carnival tradition parody and mockery are part of its tradition , said matthias von der bank , a historian from cologne 's carnival museum . " but it was n't satire like we have today , " von der bank said . " in the middle ages , carnival was a festival of reverse worlds and a playful expression of this , " von der bank said .
" so christian symbols , for example , were turned upside down . " but , he added , slandering the church was and is not part of carnival 's festivities . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de young carnival prince is also integration success story this year , the town of wesseling has dubbed a tunisian boy its traditional carnival prince .

such is the concern that a dead blackbird in a berlin suburb required what the attending fire chief called " a full state funeral " when a decontamination team in full bio-suits turned up to remove the corpse .
and help lines in germany have been inundated with calls from concerned people . a spokesperson for the federal ministry of food , agriculture and consumer protection told dw-world that while there were no official caller numbers available , a conservative estimate would be in the " high hundreds . "
all nine hot lines , however , were constantly engaged suggesting the estimate is very conservative . georg alpers , a psychologist at the university of würzburg believes that it is the not knowing which is causing most of the panic .
" we do not know at the moment what the concrete dangers are , how we could protect ourselves from these possible dangers and whether we are actually in danger .
from such insecurity , fear can grow . "
special effort required to catch bird flu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the experts deal with infected birds so you do n't have to while there is little doubt that a human bird flu pandemic is a possibility , scientists are increasingly stressing the ' if ' rather than ' when ' argument - and many believe it is a large ' if ' .
right now , to contract bird flu one would have to visit a contaminated area and have sustained contact with an infected bird or corpse , something most conscientious people would no doubt do their utmost to avoid . if the disease were to mutate into a version that could pass easily from one person to another - the main fear of health experts - then there would be more reason for concern .
a strong form of the virus would send the death rate - and the panic levels - sky high . but the strength of that version of the virus is also a matter of debate .
many scientists believe the human form could be milder than that affecting birds .
also , the disease appears to be treatable with the antiviral drug , tamiflu -lrb- oseltamvir -rrb- , which is known to be effective in the early stages or as a preventative treatment . in the context of world population , infection negligible so far , the virus has infected 169 people in seven countries , killing 91 , according to the world health organization .
despite the mortality rate being just under 50 percent , in relation to the combined population figures of those seven countries , the number of people infected is minute and those who have died even more so . the fact is the threat is real and people have died .
but as the situation stands at the moment , the threat to humans is negligible .

the foreign minister pointed out that the present government grand coalition of social democrats and christian democrats were in favor of deciding the issue on a european level . at the same time steinmeier added that germany already had one of the strictest export restrictions in the eu and added that even a lifting of the eu arms embargo would n't lead to " a more liberal approach -lrb- towards china -rrb- in germany . "
the latter was also one of former chancellor schröder 's main arguments as he pushed for the eu to drop the existing arms ban . business high on the agenda but , away from the arms embargo issue , which is unlikely to go down well with chinese leaders , much of steinmeier 's visit is likely to be consumed by business talk . germany and china have cooperated closely in the areas of culture , science , environmental protection .
the two countries are engaged in a dialogue about the rule of law and - last but not least - have established strong business ties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view of the shanghai skyline germany is china 's strongest european economic partner and china remains germany 's most important market in asia .
former german chancellor gerhard schröder has played a central role in promoting these ties : during his time in office , he traveled to the country six times , a large delegation of german business leaders in tow . steinmeier will also visit china with a group of representatives from german companies - albeit mid-sized ones .
as he already announced when taking over the foreign office from his predecessor , joschka fischer , steinmeier seems to see the support of german business interests as one of his ministry 's duties . more pushy tha n schröder ? while steinmeier served as schröder 's chief-of-staff and was likely supportive of the latter 's pragmatic approach towards china and russia when it came to addressing human rights , as foreign minister , he 's not going to be able to avoid the issue , according to experts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor schröder inspects a traditonal chinese dragon " he knows that this is an important element of german domestic politics , " said eberhard sandschneider , an expert on china at the german council on foreign relations .
" the german public expects a german politician to address this sensitive topic .
but frank-walter steinmeier is experienced enough to know that he will not be able to bring about any immediate changes this way . " members of china 's opposition in germany still have high hopes for the new german government .
last week , they sent a letter to the foreign ministry to inform the minister about the human rights situation in china . urgi n g more participatio n as global player but apart from this rather unpleasant topic for steinmeier 's hosts , the foreign minister will also try and encourage china 's leaders to step up to the plate when it comes to taking on responsibility as a world power . " such an emerging giant needs to take on global responsibilities , " said steinmeiner , who will also prepare chancellor angela merkel 's visit that 's likely to take place in july . " he really means the question of how to deal with iran , " sandschneider said .
" china has a very , very important role to play - in case of a vote in the un security council , for example .
getting china to actively cooperate with the west in this respect is an important goal . " the problem of copyright protectio n copyright protection will be another item high on steinmeier 's agenda as the chinese are known not to take this too seriously .

traditionally , no topic is sacred during this time .
but the ongoing controversy over caricatures of the prophet mohammed will stay out of the festivities . a carnival skit poking fun at pope benedict xvi has raised a debate on just how far political cabaret can satirize certain topics . the carnival gala stunksitzung plans to show the sketch in which pope benedict xvi as a pop star and the archbishop of cologne , cardinal joachim meisner , as a wannabe pop star lie in a bed together .
the two end up smooching . a private citizen has now pressed charges against the stunksitzung for " disrupting religious peace . "
public television channel wdr , which will broadcast the gala on saturday , has decided to cut out the controversial part .
the station said its policies prescribed respect of religious feelings , which they said would have been hurt if the skit was broadcast . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should satire be allowed to present the pope as a pop star ? winni rau , spokesman for the stunksitzung , said the skit was an interpretation of the pope 's pop star qualities during world youth day , which took place in cologne last summer .
he said he did n't agree with wdr 's decision . " what is satire allowed to do in the western world ? "
rau said .
" we can debate this issue , but not forbid it . " rau said he wished wdr would have had " more courage . "
" i really think it 's a shame , " he said .
" it could have showed that we here in the west can also mock our own culture and religion . " people have to be able to handle satire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rote funken are a popular carnival society the stunksitzung is an alternative to the traditional galas , which mainly take place in the german karneval strongholds cologne , düsseldorf and mainz .
the galas are a regular part of the so-called " fifth season " between its kick-off on nov .
11 and the actual carnival week , which starts on the thursday before ash wednesday .
they include singing and dancing , but also orators , who address various political and societal topics . rau said the stunksitzung considers itself political cabaret . " this satire can and should also be directed against the church or political topics , " rau said .
" in the case of cabaret or satire , people have to be able to take it .
it is part of our culture . " cologne just wants to have fun bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you 'll find more happy than sad clowns in cologne in cologne , though , political and socio-critical issues have never been at the top of the carnival agenda , and they wo n't be this year either . " our philosophy is that carnival should be fun and friendly , " said sigrid krebs , spokeswoman for the city 's carnival committee . krebs said there would be satirical floats in the rosenmontag parade on carnival monday , one of the highlights of the " fifth season . " " but they have never been aimed at harming or offending people nor will they in the future , " krebs said . düsseldorf wants to avoid religious provocation just 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- further north , in düsseldorf , political and religious critique have been much more common in the past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this float had the motto " fostering tradition " last year , a float showed cardinal meisner striking a match to a woman tied to the stake , the words " i had an abortion " written on her .
in 2003 , the düsseldorf procession showed angela merkel , today 's chancellor , coming out of uncle sam 's behind - a statement on her support for the us invasion of iraq . bernd jost , spokesman for the düsseldorf carnival committee , said there would not be any floats dealing with religion this year . " in view of the current debate , we will be keeping very clear of things related to muslims , " jost said .
" we do n't want to fuel hatred . " according to jost , the well-being of the parade spectators was the top priority for the committee . the cartoon controversy is also not an issue on the agenda in the third carnival stronghold , mainz .
local and national issues are more a priority in the city 's rosenmontag parade . turning the world on its head karneval has its origins in the middle ages and is traditionally a roman catholic celebration .
it is closely associated with easter , as it always ends on ash wednesday , marking the beginning of lent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a so-called mullahburger , shown in düsseldorf last year , does not reflect carnival tradition parody and mockery are part of its tradition , said matthias von der bank , a historian from cologne 's carnival museum . " but it was n't satire like we have today , " von der bank said . " in the middle ages , carnival was a festival of reverse worlds and a playful expression of this , " von der bank said .
" so christian symbols , for example , were turned upside down . " but , he added , slandering the church was and is not part of carnival 's festivities . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de young carnival prince is also integration success story this year , the town of wesseling has dubbed a tunisian boy its traditional carnival prince .

but few people know that two-thirds of them went to army-sponsored athletes . the german army spends 25 million euros -lrb- $ 30 million -rrb- per year on sports training and it certainly seems to be getting its money 's worth . when sylke otto , silke kraushaar and tatjana hüfner won gold , silver and bronze in the luge competition last week , the victory was theirs - and the german army 's . ditto for kati wilhelm , who took a gold in biathlon -lrb- cross-country skiing and target shooting -rrb- , andre lang , who won a gold medal in the two-man bobsled , and the women 's cross-country ski team , which got a silver medal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kati wilhelm got gold for biathlon all of these athletes were competing for germany - but also for the german army , or bundeswehr .
they are all soldiers in the athletics-training department of the army where they prepared for the turin games . ' just one responsibility : training ' a total of 72 bundeswehr athletes are competing in turin .
that 's nearly half of germany 's 161-person team .
petty officer uwe witte , a trainer in the german army 's athletics-training division in the town of warendorf said there 's a reason why the bundeswehr program is so successful . " all their -lrb- the athletes ' -rrb- other responsibilities - school , family , household - disappear . here they can concentrate entirely on their sport .
of course , if you look at their schedule , there is not a lot of extra time to take care of other things . " the army has 22 sports-training departments across germany .
altogether , they support 744 athletes in 70 different sports .
such specialized athletics departments arose out of a decision the german parliament made in 1968 to promote sports in the country and to primarily rope in the army for that purpose . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luge slider sylke otto won a gold medal in turin georg remmert , who is temporarily in charge of the warendorf athletics-training department , said the training programs work both ways . " we are mostly here for the people who ca n't finance their training themselves .

the foreign minister pointed out that the present government grand coalition of social democrats and christian democrats were in favor of deciding the issue on a european level . at the same time steinmeier added that germany already had one of the strictest export restrictions in the eu and added that even a lifting of the eu arms embargo would n't lead to " a more liberal approach -lrb- towards china -rrb- in germany . "
the latter was also one of former chancellor schröder 's main arguments as he pushed for the eu to drop the existing arms ban . business high on the agenda but , away from the arms embargo issue , which is unlikely to go down well with chinese leaders , much of steinmeier 's visit is likely to be consumed by business talk . germany and china have cooperated closely in the areas of culture , science , environmental protection .
the two countries are engaged in a dialogue about the rule of law and - last but not least - have established strong business ties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view of the shanghai skyline germany is china 's strongest european economic partner and china remains germany 's most important market in asia .
former german chancellor gerhard schröder has played a central role in promoting these ties : during his time in office , he traveled to the country six times , a large delegation of german business leaders in tow . steinmeier will also visit china with a group of representatives from german companies - albeit mid-sized ones .
as he already announced when taking over the foreign office from his predecessor , joschka fischer , steinmeier seems to see the support of german business interests as one of his ministry 's duties . more pushy tha n schröder ? while steinmeier served as schröder 's chief-of-staff and was likely supportive of the latter 's pragmatic approach towards china and russia when it came to addressing human rights , as foreign minister , he 's not going to be able to avoid the issue , according to experts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor schröder inspects a traditonal chinese dragon " he knows that this is an important element of german domestic politics , " said eberhard sandschneider , an expert on china at the german council on foreign relations .
" the german public expects a german politician to address this sensitive topic .
but frank-walter steinmeier is experienced enough to know that he will not be able to bring about any immediate changes this way . " members of china 's opposition in germany still have high hopes for the new german government .
last week , they sent a letter to the foreign ministry to inform the minister about the human rights situation in china . urgi n g more participatio n as global player but apart from this rather unpleasant topic for steinmeier 's hosts , the foreign minister will also try and encourage china 's leaders to step up to the plate when it comes to taking on responsibility as a world power . " such an emerging giant needs to take on global responsibilities , " said steinmeiner , who will also prepare chancellor angela merkel 's visit that 's likely to take place in july . " he really means the question of how to deal with iran , " sandschneider said .
" china has a very , very important role to play - in case of a vote in the un security council , for example .
getting china to actively cooperate with the west in this respect is an important goal . " the problem of copyright protectio n copyright protection will be another item high on steinmeier 's agenda as the chinese are known not to take this too seriously .
german companies meanwhile lose billions each year because of product piracy .

in iran nuclear crisis , all eyes turn to russia world powers split over iran nuclear program iran calls un referral " the end of diplomacy " europe -pipe- 21.02.2006 iran hopeful about russian nuclear compromise plan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian officials will visit iran 's bushehr nuclear plant thursday iranian officials said tuesday they were hopeful a russian compromise to end the crisis over iran 's nuclear program would bear fruit , also hinting that they attached greater weight to it than to talks with the eu-3 . ali hosseini-tash , the deputy secretary of iran 's supreme national security council , said the negotiations in moscow had been positive and " give us the hope of reaching an agreement . " " the main question is the creation of a more normal situation and to reduce this tension so that we wo n't have people making unreasonable demands of each other , " he said before leaving for iran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sergey lavrov but russian foreign minister sergei lavrov was markedly more cautious . " i think it would be premature to use terms such as failure or success , " he told reporters . russia , as a veto-wielding member of the un security council with traditionally close ties to iran , has long tried to mediate in the long-running dispute over its partner 's nuclear program .
its proposal is to create a joint venture that would enrich uranium for tehran 's energy needs on russian soil . russia sees it as a means of getting iran to reinstate its moratorium on uranium enrichment work , after tehran broke seals at three nuclear facilities last month and signaled its intention to resume nuclear work . iran stresses talks with russia , not eu the proposal by moscow has been cautiously welcomed by western countries , which suspect iran 's stated intention to develop peaceful nuclear energy is simply a cover for developing atomic weapons . iranian officials have also hinted that they attach greater significance to negotiations with moscow rather than with the eu troika of germany , france and britain who have been holding on-and-off talks with teheran for over two years . " our contacts with the european union will for the moment not be held only with the eu-3 , but also in a unilateral manner with the different countries of the european union , " mottaki told reporters following talks on monday with eu officials in brussels . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said on a visit to japan that diplomacy can still work in resolving the iranian nuclear standoff even though economic sanctions can not be ruled out .
" the issue of a military option does not arise , " steinmeier told a news conference .
" we must show imagination and take advantage of different diplomatic possibilities . "
" i do not believe economic sanctions are imminent .
but we can not completely rule out imposing sanctions , " he said . russians to visit iranian nuclear plant bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : technical staff at the isfahan uranium conversion facility in central iran russian negotiators continued to press iran at the talks to stop enrichment work , russian foreign ministry spokesman mikhail kamynin said . moscow called on iran " to return to a moratorium regime on all types on work on uranium enrichment including scientific research and construction work , " kamynin was quoted by the official itar-tass news agency as saying . the talks in moscow are to be followed up with a visit to iran on thursday by the head of russia 's atomic energy agency rosatom , sergei kiriyenko .
he is due to meet senior iranian officials and to visit a nuclear power station that russia is building for iran at bushehr , in southern iran . bildunterschrift : un security council however iran has shown no sign of willingness to restore a moratorium on uranium enrichment at home , a key demand of the west . iran has been reported to the un security council over its nuclear activities , and a march 6 meeting of the un 's international atomic energy agency will be vital in determining how the world body responds . moscow has repeatedly cautioned against a possible imposition of sanctions . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran issues enrichment threat but considers russian proposal iran said monday that it would restart uranium enrichment work despite international objections .

they are all soldiers in the athletics-training department of the army where they prepared for the turin games . ' just one responsibility : training ' a total of 72 bundeswehr athletes are competing in turin .
that 's nearly half of germany 's 161-person team .
petty officer uwe witte , a trainer in the german army 's athletics-training division in the town of warendorf said there 's a reason why the bundeswehr program is so successful . " all their -lrb- the athletes ' -rrb- other responsibilities - school , family , household - disappear . here they can concentrate entirely on their sport .
of course , if you look at their schedule , there is not a lot of extra time to take care of other things . " the army has 22 sports-training departments across germany .
altogether , they support 744 athletes in 70 different sports .
such specialized athletics departments arose out of a decision the german parliament made in 1968 to promote sports in the country and to primarily rope in the army for that purpose . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luge slider sylke otto won a gold medal in turin georg remmert , who is temporarily in charge of the warendorf athletics-training department , said the training programs work both ways .

but few people know that two-thirds of them went to army-sponsored athletes . the german army spends 25 million euros -lrb- $ 30 million -rrb- per year on sports training and it certainly seems to be getting its money 's worth . when sylke otto , silke kraushaar and tatjana hüfner won gold , silver and bronze in the luge competition last week , the victory was theirs - and the german army 's . ditto for kati wilhelm , who took a gold in biathlon -lrb- cross-country skiing and target shooting -rrb- , andre lang , who won a gold medal in the two-man bobsled , and the women 's cross-country ski team , which got a silver medal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kati wilhelm got gold for biathlon all of these athletes were competing for germany - but also for the german army , or bundeswehr .
they are all soldiers in the athletics-training department of the army where they prepared for the turin games . ' just one responsibility : training ' a total of 72 bundeswehr athletes are competing in turin .
that 's nearly half of germany 's 161-person team .
petty officer uwe witte , a trainer in the german army 's athletics-training division in the town of warendorf said there 's a reason why the bundeswehr program is so successful . " all their -lrb- the athletes ' -rrb- other responsibilities - school , family , household - disappear . here they can concentrate entirely on their sport .
of course , if you look at their schedule , there is not a lot of extra time to take care of other things . " the army has 22 sports-training departments across germany .
altogether , they support 744 athletes in 70 different sports .
such specialized athletics departments arose out of a decision the german parliament made in 1968 to promote sports in the country and to primarily rope in the army for that purpose . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luge slider sylke otto won a gold medal in turin georg remmert , who is temporarily in charge of the warendorf athletics-training department , said the training programs work both ways . " we are mostly here for the people who ca n't finance their training themselves .
in other words , the army is a kind of social net , " he said .
" it gives the athletes the security to be able to pursue their sport to such a degree of excellence .
in turn it shows the bundeswehr and germany in a good light internationally . " but only those who are already very accomplished athletes can be sponsored .
all those who have already made it to the national squad in their sport can apply .
in other words , the athletes are already very successful when they they are accepted into the army 's program . they are then assigned a trainer and are also meant to start following a normal soldier 's basic training .
later , they only need to fulfill 30 percent of a soldier 's normal duties ; the other 70 percent of their time is free for athletic training . best for winter sports the system seems to work especially well for winter sport athletes .
of 744 army athletes , only 200 are in winter sports , but they rack up the most successes .
much of that has to do with the popularity of winter sports in germany and particulary in the army .
further , athletes also have good infrastructure and training possibilies for winter olympic sports within germany . on top of that , " there are just fewer nations who do these winter sports , " said uwe witte .
" in turin , 84 countries are competing .
in contrast , there are 200 countries competing in the summer olympics .
-lrb- in summer -rrb- the spectrum of competing athletes is much bigger . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weight training rooms are used by regular soldiers too witte added that the bundeswehr placed great emphasis on supporting young , up-and-coming athletes .
" here , young people are pushed to be top in their field , in contrast to sponsorship by large companies , which is mostly aimed at a few very top athletes , " he said . josef nehren , head of the sports department of the bundeswehr , has high expectations for germany 's success in turin .
in salt lake city , in 2002 , soldiers took 25 of the total 35 medals that went to germany . " that is definitely good publicity .
but for me it is more important that it shows that our system is good , and that it works well when it is used right .
it also shows that money is being used well , " he said . julia spurzem -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de winter olympics in turin the 20th winter olympics kicked off on feb .

but germany is hoping a state visit to japan will boost long-standing economic ties with that country . even though china has become the most important trade partner for german business in asia , german investors are keen on japan .
and for its part , japanese business appreciates germany as an " environmentally conscious " country . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier visited tokyo on tuesday , on his first asia tour since taking office in november under chancellor angela merkel .
steinmeier , who heads wednesday to beijing on a three-nation tour that began in south korea , called china 's rising clout on the world economic and political stage " a new challenge . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier met with his japanese counterpart , taro aso , on tuesday yet in talks with japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi , he stressed that japan , the world 's second-largest economy , and third-ranked germany could work together on a range of fields .
seeking cooperation " there are many common concerns between germany and japan .
we must tighten our relationship of cooperation , " he said .
" japan and germany can work together to set example for other countries . " in general , german business seems to agree with him .
for many years , japan was germany 's most important trade partner in the asia-pacific region - until china began opening its economy , hitting the world market like a tornado . at the end of 2002 , the volume of german-chinese trade overtook that of germany and japan .
today , german-japanese trade is worth around 43 billion euros -lrb- $ 51.2 billion -rrb- compared to 50 billion in china .
while in 2002 german direct investment in japan still outpaced that of china , by 2004 that had changed .
germany invested 653 million euros in japan in 2004 , according to germany 's foreign ministry , while the investment in china reached 1.06 billion for the same period , according to china 's foreign trade office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if both countries work together , perhaps everyone can make some money yet despite the lure of china and its massive market potential , many german companies have n't lost interest in japan . " a german company that is active in japan does n't get into the chinese market , " said wolfgang klenner , an east asia expert from the ruhr university in bochum . for one thing , the markets are entirely different .
" in japan , you can only get anywhere if you have the newest technologies and patents .
in china , the danger of piracy is too great , " he said .
klenner posits that the reason so many germans stick to investing in japan is that country 's reliable - and familiar - legal system . different markets business prospects for investors in japan are particularly good in the energy and environmental sectors .
japan needs to import nearly all its raw materials . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is a leader in wind power technology " in terms of energy production , japan is interested in anything that can make it more independent and stronger , " said markus taube of the east asia institute at the university of duisberg-essen .
this provides an opportunity for german business : the japanese are world leaders in solar energy , and germany leads in other areas of alternative energy production . wind energy , for example , is an area that japan wants to expand .
the country is on a mission to expand its wind-energy production eightfold , up to 3,000 megawatts by 2010 . germany 's environmental image germany is also a preferred partner for the japanese when it comes to environmental protection . " germany has the clear image in japan of an environmentally conscious country , " said friederike bosse of the association of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- .
scientific exchange in this area is also strong , and bosse said she believes german-japanese economic relations will benefit in the future from much of the academic cooperation that is currently underway . given these common interests , german business should take care not to lose sight of japan as a strategic economic partner , according to bochum university 's klenner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's growth is legendary , as is its building boom " japan is always underestimated , " klenner said .
" even if everyone is always talking about china , the real giant in asia and the world economy is japan . " it is an opinion that markus taube shares .
as soon as the german and japanese economies recover , and consumer spending increases , trade between the two nations will increase as well , he said . until then , however , china is the ideal land for racking up sales , both for japan and germany .

traditionally , no topic is sacred during this time .
but the ongoing controversy over caricatures of the prophet mohammed will stay out of the festivities . a carnival skit poking fun at pope benedict xvi has raised a debate on just how far political cabaret can satirize certain topics . the carnival gala stunksitzung plans to show the sketch in which pope benedict xvi as a pop star and the archbishop of cologne , cardinal joachim meisner , as a wannabe pop star lie in a bed together .
the two end up smooching . a private citizen has now pressed charges against the stunksitzung for " disrupting religious peace . "
public television channel wdr , which will broadcast the gala on saturday , has decided to cut out the controversial part .
the station said its policies prescribed respect of religious feelings , which they said would have been hurt if the skit was broadcast . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should satire be allowed to present the pope as a pop star ? winni rau , spokesman for the stunksitzung , said the skit was an interpretation of the pope 's pop star qualities during world youth day , which took place in cologne last summer .
he said he did n't agree with wdr 's decision . " what is satire allowed to do in the western world ? "
rau said .
" we can debate this issue , but not forbid it . " rau said he wished wdr would have had " more courage . "
" i really think it 's a shame , " he said .
" it could have showed that we here in the west can also mock our own culture and religion . " people have to be able to handle satire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rote funken are a popular carnival society the stunksitzung is an alternative to the traditional galas , which mainly take place in the german karneval strongholds cologne , düsseldorf and mainz .
the galas are a regular part of the so-called " fifth season " between its kick-off on nov .
11 and the actual carnival week , which starts on the thursday before ash wednesday .
they include singing and dancing , but also orators , who address various political and societal topics . rau said the stunksitzung considers itself political cabaret . " this satire can and should also be directed against the church or political topics , " rau said .
" in the case of cabaret or satire , people have to be able to take it .
it is part of our culture . " cologne just wants to have fun bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you 'll find more happy than sad clowns in cologne in cologne , though , political and socio-critical issues have never been at the top of the carnival agenda , and they wo n't be this year either . " our philosophy is that carnival should be fun and friendly , " said sigrid krebs , spokeswoman for the city 's carnival committee . krebs said there would be satirical floats in the rosenmontag parade on carnival monday , one of the highlights of the " fifth season . " " but they have never been aimed at harming or offending people nor will they in the future , " krebs said . düsseldorf wants to avoid religious provocation just 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- further north , in düsseldorf , political and religious critique have been much more common in the past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this float had the motto " fostering tradition " last year , a float showed cardinal meisner striking a match to a woman tied to the stake , the words " i had an abortion " written on her .
in 2003 , the düsseldorf procession showed angela merkel , today 's chancellor , coming out of uncle sam 's behind - a statement on her support for the us invasion of iraq . bernd jost , spokesman for the düsseldorf carnival committee , said there would not be any floats dealing with religion this year . " in view of the current debate , we will be keeping very clear of things related to muslims , " jost said .
" we do n't want to fuel hatred . " according to jost , the well-being of the parade spectators was the top priority for the committee . the cartoon controversy is also not an issue on the agenda in the third carnival stronghold , mainz .
local and national issues are more a priority in the city 's rosenmontag parade . turning the world on its head karneval has its origins in the middle ages and is traditionally a roman catholic celebration .
it is closely associated with easter , as it always ends on ash wednesday , marking the beginning of lent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a so-called mullahburger , shown in düsseldorf last year , does not reflect carnival tradition parody and mockery are part of its tradition , said matthias von der bank , a historian from cologne 's carnival museum . " but it was n't satire like we have today , " von der bank said . " in the middle ages , carnival was a festival of reverse worlds and a playful expression of this , " von der bank said .
" so christian symbols , for example , were turned upside down . " but , he added , slandering the church was and is not part of carnival 's festivities . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de young carnival prince is also integration success story this year , the town of wesseling has dubbed a tunisian boy its traditional carnival prince .

a german newspaper has written that us intelligence services spied on two german agents who remained in iraq during the us-led war in 2003 . citing a confidential government paper , the leipziger volkszeitung daily said that reports from the two german federal intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- agents stationed in baghdad to the services headquarters near munich may have been intercepted by us sources using a satellite telephone . the newspaper said that , in addition the two agents - who are currently involved in a controversy over their exact role during the war to which then chancellor gerhard schröder was so vehemently opposed - were " repeatedly pressed " to provide war intelligence from baghdad to the us commando headquarters in qatar .
it added that the german agents refused to be drawn in , but that 25 of 125 bnd reports were officially passed on to the us . according to the paper , the parliamentary control commission , which is charged with reviewing certain secret service activities , has all the information in the confidential report and will meet in berlin on wednesday to debate just how much of it should be made public . that decision could cause the opposition green party , which was the junior partner in schröder 's government , to rethink its objection to a parliamentary inquiry over the role of the bnd during the war , the newspaper wrote .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 21.02.2006 merkel asks cdu to start soul-searching großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian values must be at the heart of a cdu manifesto , merkel said german chancellor angela merkel has called for her party to review its basic beliefs and renew its emphasis , appealing for more " solidarity . " some 800 participants attended a small party conference in berlin monday , where the topic on hand was a reassessment of the ruling christian democratic union 's values .
cdu leader angela merkel took the opportunity to call for fundamental change , but stressed the need to keep christian values at the core of the party 's ideology . in a debate that is expected to go on for two years , the cdu wants to refine its image within the " grand coalition " government -lrb- it currently shares power with the the social democrats . -rrb-
to do this , it plans to modernize its manifesto .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a weak election result forced the cdu to govern with the spd by claiming a phrase historically associated with workers ' parties and the opposing social democrats - solidarity - the cdu is seen to be angling for more support after a razor-thin win at the polls last year .
' solidarity is patriotism ' solidarity needs to be seen on a par with basic values like freedom and justice , in order to keep germany on the right path , merkel said .
sounding more like the leader of a workers ' union than a conservative government , merkel said : " we have to remain in a country where solidarity is practiced without asking about the material gains . "
" freedom and solidarity - for us , this combination is not unattainable , " merkel told the party faithful .
" the ability to exercise solidarity is perhaps one of the most important patriotic abilities . "
questioning the social-market economy the most important thing is for the cdu to take a new look at germany 's social-market economy , merkel said .
in her first big party speech since being elected to office nearly 100 days ago , merkel noted that the party 's current manifesto , created in 1994 , " fails to answer a whole array " of modern-day questions .
that is especially true when it comes to social and economic policies , she said .
" we want to secure the future of the social-market economy .
but we realize that with globalization , certain basic conditions have changed , " she said .
as a result , people are rejecting germany 's current economic model .
" only a minority considers the social-market economy to be fair , " merkel said .
christianity at the base party members and committees will meet repeatedly to discuss the new manifesto between now and late 2007 , when it will be put up for a vote .
merkel said the basis of the cdu manifesto needs to be christian values , and warned that the party has to " figure out what it can absolutely not afford to lose . "
she urged the cdu to discuss basic values with people from other countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heiner geißler of the cdu the party also unveiled a new motto , " new justice through more freedom . " ex-cdu general secretary heiner geißler told the express newspaper he thought the motto was " backwards , " adding that freedom alone can not bring about justice . and michael sommer , head of the association of german unions , told the kölner stadt anzeiger that the cdu seemed to be on a course of " basic social renovation . "
the discussion " reflects the fact that in germany , you ca n't get a majority of votes with neo-liberal rhetoric , " he said . a number of active members concentrated on the idea that the cdu should stress its roots in christian belief and values .
the head of the cdu 's workers ' wing , karl laumann , told the passauer neuen presse that the cdu " needs to unconditionally stand up for christian social teachings and social justice .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 21.02.2006 merkel asks cdu to start soul-searching großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian values must be at the heart of a cdu manifesto , merkel said german chancellor angela merkel has called for her party to review its basic beliefs and renew its emphasis , appealing for more " solidarity . " some 800 participants attended a small party conference in berlin monday , where the topic on hand was a reassessment of the ruling christian democratic union 's values .
cdu leader angela merkel took the opportunity to call for fundamental change , but stressed the need to keep christian values at the core of the party 's ideology . in a debate that is expected to go on for two years , the cdu wants to refine its image within the " grand coalition " government -lrb- it currently shares power with the the social democrats . -rrb-
to do this , it plans to modernize its manifesto .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a weak election result forced the cdu to govern with the spd by claiming a phrase historically associated with workers ' parties and the opposing social democrats - solidarity - the cdu is seen to be angling for more support after a razor-thin win at the polls last year .
' solidarity is patriotism ' solidarity needs to be seen on a par with basic values like freedom and justice , in order to keep germany on the right path , merkel said .
sounding more like the leader of a workers ' union than a conservative government , merkel said : " we have to remain in a country where solidarity is practiced without asking about the material gains . "
" freedom and solidarity - for us , this combination is not unattainable , " merkel told the party faithful .
" the ability to exercise solidarity is perhaps one of the most important patriotic abilities . "
questioning the social-market economy the most important thing is for the cdu to take a new look at germany 's social-market economy , merkel said .
in her first big party speech since being elected to office nearly 100 days ago , merkel noted that the party 's current manifesto , created in 1994 , " fails to answer a whole array " of modern-day questions .
that is especially true when it comes to social and economic policies , she said .
" we want to secure the future of the social-market economy .
but we realize that with globalization , certain basic conditions have changed , " she said .
as a result , people are rejecting germany 's current economic model .
" only a minority considers the social-market economy to be fair , " merkel said .
christianity at the base party members and committees will meet repeatedly to discuss the new manifesto between now and late 2007 , when it will be put up for a vote .
merkel said the basis of the cdu manifesto needs to be christian values , and warned that the party has to " figure out what it can absolutely not afford to lose . "
she urged the cdu to discuss basic values with people from other countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heiner geißler of the cdu the party also unveiled a new motto , " new justice through more freedom . " ex-cdu general secretary heiner geißler told the express newspaper he thought the motto was " backwards , " adding that freedom alone can not bring about justice . and michael sommer , head of the association of german unions , told the kölner stadt anzeiger that the cdu seemed to be on a course of " basic social renovation . "
the discussion " reflects the fact that in germany , you ca n't get a majority of votes with neo-liberal rhetoric , " he said . a number of active members concentrated on the idea that the cdu should stress its roots in christian belief and values .
the head of the cdu 's workers ' wing , karl laumann , told the passauer neuen presse that the cdu " needs to unconditionally stand up for christian social teachings and social justice .

" some 800 participants attended a small party conference in berlin monday , where the topic on hand was a reassessment of the ruling christian democratic union 's values .
cdu leader angela merkel took the opportunity to call for fundamental change , but stressed the need to keep christian values at the core of the party 's ideology . in a debate that is expected to go on for two years , the cdu wants to refine its image within the " grand coalition " government -lrb- it currently shares power with the the social democrats . -rrb-
to do this , it plans to modernize its manifesto .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a weak election result forced the cdu to govern with the spd by claiming a phrase historically associated with workers ' parties and the opposing social democrats - solidarity - the cdu is seen to be angling for more support after a razor-thin win at the polls last year .
' solidarity is patriotism ' solidarity needs to be seen on a par with basic values like freedom and justice , in order to keep germany on the right path , merkel said .
sounding more like the leader of a workers ' union than a conservative government , merkel said : " we have to remain in a country where solidarity is practiced without asking about the material gains . "
" freedom and solidarity - for us , this combination is not unattainable , " merkel told the party faithful .
" the ability to exercise solidarity is perhaps one of the most important patriotic abilities . "
questioning the social-market economy the most important thing is for the cdu to take a new look at germany 's social-market economy , merkel said .
in her first big party speech since being elected to office nearly 100 days ago , merkel noted that the party 's current manifesto , created in 1994 , " fails to answer a whole array " of modern-day questions .
that is especially true when it comes to social and economic policies , she said .
" we want to secure the future of the social-market economy .
but we realize that with globalization , certain basic conditions have changed , " she said .
as a result , people are rejecting germany 's current economic model .
" only a minority considers the social-market economy to be fair , " merkel said .
christianity at the base party members and committees will meet repeatedly to discuss the new manifesto between now and late 2007 , when it will be put up for a vote .
merkel said the basis of the cdu manifesto needs to be christian values , and warned that the party has to " figure out what it can absolutely not afford to lose . "
she urged the cdu to discuss basic values with people from other countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heiner geißler of the cdu the party also unveiled a new motto , " new justice through more freedom . " ex-cdu general secretary heiner geißler told the express newspaper he thought the motto was " backwards , " adding that freedom alone can not bring about justice . and michael sommer , head of the association of german unions , told the kölner stadt anzeiger that the cdu seemed to be on a course of " basic social renovation . "
the discussion " reflects the fact that in germany , you ca n't get a majority of votes with neo-liberal rhetoric , " he said . a number of active members concentrated on the idea that the cdu should stress its roots in christian belief and values .
the head of the cdu 's workers ' wing , karl laumann , told the passauer neuen presse that the cdu " needs to unconditionally stand up for christian social teachings and social justice .

but germany is hoping a state visit to japan will boost long-standing economic ties with that country . even though china has become the most important trade partner for german business in asia , german investors are keen on japan .
and for its part , japanese business appreciates germany as an " environmentally conscious " country . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier visited tokyo on tuesday , on his first asia tour since taking office in november under chancellor angela merkel .
steinmeier , who heads wednesday to beijing on a three-nation tour that began in south korea , called china 's rising clout on the world economic and political stage " a new challenge . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier met with his japanese counterpart , taro aso , on tuesday yet in talks with japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi , he stressed that japan , the world 's second-largest economy , and third-ranked germany could work together on a range of fields .
seeking cooperation " there are many common concerns between germany and japan .
we must tighten our relationship of cooperation , " he said .
" japan and germany can work together to set example for other countries . " in general , german business seems to agree with him .
for many years , japan was germany 's most important trade partner in the asia-pacific region - until china began opening its economy , hitting the world market like a tornado . at the end of 2002 , the volume of german-chinese trade overtook that of germany and japan .
today , german-japanese trade is worth around 43 billion euros -lrb- $ 51.2 billion -rrb- compared to 50 billion in china .
while in 2002 german direct investment in japan still outpaced that of china , by 2004 that had changed .
germany invested 653 million euros in japan in 2004 , according to germany 's foreign ministry , while the investment in china reached 1.06 billion for the same period , according to china 's foreign trade office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if both countries work together , perhaps everyone can make some money yet despite the lure of china and its massive market potential , many german companies have n't lost interest in japan . " a german company that is active in japan does n't get into the chinese market , " said wolfgang klenner , an east asia expert from the ruhr university in bochum . for one thing , the markets are entirely different .
" in japan , you can only get anywhere if you have the newest technologies and patents .
in china , the danger of piracy is too great , " he said .
klenner posits that the reason so many germans stick to investing in japan is that country 's reliable - and familiar - legal system . different markets business prospects for investors in japan are particularly good in the energy and environmental sectors .
japan needs to import nearly all its raw materials . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is a leader in wind power technology " in terms of energy production , japan is interested in anything that can make it more independent and stronger , " said markus taube of the east asia institute at the university of duisberg-essen .
this provides an opportunity for german business : the japanese are world leaders in solar energy , and germany leads in other areas of alternative energy production . wind energy , for example , is an area that japan wants to expand .
the country is on a mission to expand its wind-energy production eightfold , up to 3,000 megawatts by 2010 . germany 's environmental image germany is also a preferred partner for the japanese when it comes to environmental protection . " germany has the clear image in japan of an environmentally conscious country , " said friederike bosse of the association of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- .
scientific exchange in this area is also strong , and bosse said she believes german-japanese economic relations will benefit in the future from much of the academic cooperation that is currently underway . given these common interests , german business should take care not to lose sight of japan as a strategic economic partner , according to bochum university 's klenner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's growth is legendary , as is its building boom " japan is always underestimated , " klenner said .
" even if everyone is always talking about china , the real giant in asia and the world economy is japan . " it is an opinion that markus taube shares .
as soon as the german and japanese economies recover , and consumer spending increases , trade between the two nations will increase as well , he said . until then , however , china is the ideal land for racking up sales , both for japan and germany .
bosse , of the german industry association , said this brings up another trend worth looking at - german-japanese joint ventures in china . match made in heaven ? " germans and japanese are increasingly forming joint ventures .
they want to see if together , they can succeed in the chinese market . " it could be a match made in heaven , bosse believes .
unlike the japanese , the germans were not historical enemies of the chinese .

in iran nuclear crisis , all eyes turn to russia world powers split over iran nuclear program iran calls un referral " the end of diplomacy " europe -pipe- 21.02.2006 iran hopeful about russian nuclear compromise plan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian officials will visit iran 's bushehr nuclear plant thursday iranian officials said tuesday they were hopeful a russian compromise to end the crisis over iran 's nuclear program would bear fruit , also hinting that they attached greater weight to it than to talks with the eu-3 . ali hosseini-tash , the deputy secretary of iran 's supreme national security council , said the negotiations in moscow had been positive and " give us the hope of reaching an agreement . " " the main question is the creation of a more normal situation and to reduce this tension so that we wo n't have people making unreasonable demands of each other , " he said before leaving for iran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sergey lavrov but russian foreign minister sergei lavrov was markedly more cautious . " i think it would be premature to use terms such as failure or success , " he told reporters . russia , as a veto-wielding member of the un security council with traditionally close ties to iran , has long tried to mediate in the long-running dispute over its partner 's nuclear program .
its proposal is to create a joint venture that would enrich uranium for tehran 's energy needs on russian soil . russia sees it as a means of getting iran to reinstate its moratorium on uranium enrichment work , after tehran broke seals at three nuclear facilities last month and signaled its intention to resume nuclear work . iran stresses talks with russia , not eu the proposal by moscow has been cautiously welcomed by western countries , which suspect iran 's stated intention to develop peaceful nuclear energy is simply a cover for developing atomic weapons . iranian officials have also hinted that they attach greater significance to negotiations with moscow rather than with the eu troika of germany , france and britain who have been holding on-and-off talks with teheran for over two years .

bird flu psychosis is spreading faster than the virus itself . it was a surprise that germany 's airports were not inundated with fleeing citizens ; fighting each other for the last available seats to safety , panicked to distraction with only thoughts of escape passing through their fear-frazzled minds . " the feathered death - it has landed , " blared a headline in the berliner zeitung newspaper heralding the arrival of bird flu in germany last week along with , if the media were to be believed , the three other horsemen of the apocalypse . adding to the hysteria was the fact that if germany were to empty its borders , where would the escapees flee to ?
pestilence was everywhere .
not a corner of the globe was untouched .
poultry magnates considering the end of their empires must have seriously been considering investing their last euros in space tourism . as the people of europe looked to their leaders for guidance , some like germany 's chancellor merkel could barely hide their concern .
" the situation is very serious , " merkel said after a personal visit to the northern german island of rügen after avian flu struck there . everything seemed to add up to a doomsday scenario , a worldwide crisis which would sell a million copies in paperback if there would be anyone left alive to read it . welcome to the age of bird flu psychosis . the lethal h5n1 virus landed in western europe last week for the first time , littering parts of italy , greece , france , germany and austria with the carcasses of dead migratory birds and those domestic winged victims who were unlucky enough to fraternize with the infected before they quacked their last . a global panic six years in the making bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asia 's harsh lesson should have been learned sooner by europe it should have come as little surprise .
bird flu had been winging its way to europe , slowly but surely , since the disease first emerged in hong kong in 1997 .
it took its time but eventually made it to europe 's borders in october when it claimed a handful of teenage human victims and thousands of feathered fatalities on its way into the eu . six years .
plenty of time , one would imagine , for european leaders and health experts to have some sort of plan ready .
but when the first cases cropped up in italy and greece , the authorities were as shocked as anyone .
when the northern german island of rügen reported a batch of dead swans , it remained that way for some time because of a conflict between federal state and district laws which prevented the authorities from sending in a clean-up team immediately . the fact that governments and health organizations around the world seem to be at a loss to stop the spread of the virus and have no tried and tested means to cure the disease once it is contracted by humans could rightly cause some concern .
but the reactions of the general public , at the moment at least , far outstrip the actual threat . depression , suicide and poultry embargoes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the poultry industry is beginning to feel the heat in italy , for instance , the threat of unemployment due to the poultry industry being hit by panic embargoes on chicken caused one delivery man to kill his wife and child and then himself in a fit of manic depression . " he was very worried because we told him there 'd be less work because of the crisis , " an official from the man ’ s firm told the newspaper la repubblica .
it is by far the most extreme case recorded so far but there is no doubt that a lot more people are concerned to a lesser degree .
since the beginning of last week , the italian health ministry has received more than 13,000 phone calls to a special bird flu hotline to report dead birds or ask for advice . german red tape and insecurity fuels public confusion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin gave its fallen blackbird a guard of honor in germany , citizens have been urged to report dead birds to the police in an attempt to limit the impact after the rügen outbreak spread to the mainland .
such is the concern that a dead blackbird in a berlin suburb required what the attending fire chief called " a full state funeral " when a decontamination team in full bio-suits turned up to remove the corpse .
and help lines in germany have been inundated with calls from concerned people . a spokesperson for the federal ministry of food , agriculture and consumer protection told dw-world that while there were no official caller numbers available , a conservative estimate would be in the " high hundreds . "
all nine hot lines , however , were constantly engaged suggesting the estimate is very conservative . georg alpers , a psychologist at the university of würzburg believes that it is the not knowing which is causing most of the panic .
" we do not know at the moment what the concrete dangers are , how we could protect ourselves from these possible dangers and whether we are actually in danger .
from such insecurity , fear can grow . "
special effort required to catch bird flu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the experts deal with infected birds so you do n't have to while there is little doubt that a human bird flu pandemic is a possibility , scientists are increasingly stressing the ' if ' rather than ' when ' argument - and many believe it is a large ' if ' .
right now , to contract bird flu one would have to visit a contaminated area and have sustained contact with an infected bird or corpse , something most conscientious people would no doubt do their utmost to avoid . if the disease were to mutate into a version that could pass easily from one person to another - the main fear of health experts - then there would be more reason for concern .
a strong form of the virus would send the death rate - and the panic levels - sky high . but the strength of that version of the virus is also a matter of debate .
many scientists believe the human form could be milder than that affecting birds .
also , the disease appears to be treatable with the antiviral drug , tamiflu -lrb- oseltamvir -rrb- , which is known to be effective in the early stages or as a preventative treatment . in the context of world population , infection negligible so far , the virus has infected 169 people in seven countries , killing 91 , according to the world health organization .
despite the mortality rate being just under 50 percent , in relation to the combined population figures of those seven countries , the number of people infected is minute and those who have died even more so . the fact is the threat is real and people have died .
but as the situation stands at the moment , the threat to humans is negligible .

but when the first cases cropped up in italy and greece , the authorities were as shocked as anyone .
when the northern german island of rügen reported a batch of dead swans , it remained that way for some time because of a conflict between federal state and district laws which prevented the authorities from sending in a clean-up team immediately . the fact that governments and health organizations around the world seem to be at a loss to stop the spread of the virus and have no tried and tested means to cure the disease once it is contracted by humans could rightly cause some concern .
but the reactions of the general public , at the moment at least , far outstrip the actual threat . depression , suicide and poultry embargoes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the poultry industry is beginning to feel the heat in italy , for instance , the threat of unemployment due to the poultry industry being hit by panic embargoes on chicken caused one delivery man to kill his wife and child and then himself in a fit of manic depression . " he was very worried because we told him there 'd be less work because of the crisis , " an official from the man ’ s firm told the newspaper la repubblica .
it is by far the most extreme case recorded so far but there is no doubt that a lot more people are concerned to a lesser degree .
since the beginning of last week , the italian health ministry has received more than 13,000 phone calls to a special bird flu hotline to report dead birds or ask for advice . german red tape and insecurity fuels public confusion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin gave its fallen blackbird a guard of honor in germany , citizens have been urged to report dead birds to the police in an attempt to limit the impact after the rügen outbreak spread to the mainland .
such is the concern that a dead blackbird in a berlin suburb required what the attending fire chief called " a full state funeral " when a decontamination team in full bio-suits turned up to remove the corpse .
and help lines in germany have been inundated with calls from concerned people . a spokesperson for the federal ministry of food , agriculture and consumer protection told dw-world that while there were no official caller numbers available , a conservative estimate would be in the " high hundreds . "
all nine hot lines , however , were constantly engaged suggesting the estimate is very conservative . georg alpers , a psychologist at the university of würzburg believes that it is the not knowing which is causing most of the panic .
" we do not know at the moment what the concrete dangers are , how we could protect ourselves from these possible dangers and whether we are actually in danger .
from such insecurity , fear can grow . "

right now , to contract bird flu one would have to visit a contaminated area and have sustained contact with an infected bird or corpse , something most conscientious people would no doubt do their utmost to avoid . if the disease were to mutate into a version that could pass easily from one person to another - the main fear of health experts - then there would be more reason for concern .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 21.02.2006 german foreign minister to walk diplomatic tightrope in china großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : talks in china aren likely to prove pretty taxing for steinmeier stressing germany 's stance against lifting the eu arms embargo , talking tough on human rights and deepening business ties - foreign minister steinmeier will have his hands full when he visits china wednesday . it 's frank-walter steinmeier 's first visit to china since taking office last year and he 's already ensured that he wo n't be merely echoing former chancellor gerhard schröder 's foreign policy stance towards beijing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier , right , with his japanese counterpart taro aso speaking at an event at the national japanese press club in tokyo on tuesday , steinmeier said germany was no longer explicitly in favor of lifting the eu arms embargo on china .
the foreign minister pointed out that the present government grand coalition of social democrats and christian democrats were in favor of deciding the issue on a european level . at the same time steinmeier added that germany already had one of the strictest export restrictions in the eu and added that even a lifting of the eu arms embargo would n't lead to " a more liberal approach -lrb- towards china -rrb- in germany . "
the latter was also one of former chancellor schröder 's main arguments as he pushed for the eu to drop the existing arms ban . business high on the agenda but , away from the arms embargo issue , which is unlikely to go down well with chinese leaders , much of steinmeier 's visit is likely to be consumed by business talk . germany and china have cooperated closely in the areas of culture , science , environmental protection .
the two countries are engaged in a dialogue about the rule of law and - last but not least - have established strong business ties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view of the shanghai skyline germany is china 's strongest european economic partner and china remains germany 's most important market in asia .
former german chancellor gerhard schröder has played a central role in promoting these ties : during his time in office , he traveled to the country six times , a large delegation of german business leaders in tow . steinmeier will also visit china with a group of representatives from german companies - albeit mid-sized ones .
as he already announced when taking over the foreign office from his predecessor , joschka fischer , steinmeier seems to see the support of german business interests as one of his ministry 's duties . more pushy tha n schröder ? while steinmeier served as schröder 's chief-of-staff and was likely supportive of the latter 's pragmatic approach towards china and russia when it came to addressing human rights , as foreign minister , he 's not going to be able to avoid the issue , according to experts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor schröder inspects a traditonal chinese dragon " he knows that this is an important element of german domestic politics , " said eberhard sandschneider , an expert on china at the german council on foreign relations .
" the german public expects a german politician to address this sensitive topic .
but frank-walter steinmeier is experienced enough to know that he will not be able to bring about any immediate changes this way . " members of china 's opposition in germany still have high hopes for the new german government .
last week , they sent a letter to the foreign ministry to inform the minister about the human rights situation in china . urgi n g more participatio n as global player but apart from this rather unpleasant topic for steinmeier 's hosts , the foreign minister will also try and encourage china 's leaders to step up to the plate when it comes to taking on responsibility as a world power . " such an emerging giant needs to take on global responsibilities , " said steinmeiner , who will also prepare chancellor angela merkel 's visit that 's likely to take place in july . " he really means the question of how to deal with iran , " sandschneider said .
" china has a very , very important role to play - in case of a vote in the un security council , for example .
getting china to actively cooperate with the west in this respect is an important goal . " the problem of copyright protectio n copyright protection will be another item high on steinmeier 's agenda as the chinese are known not to take this too seriously .
german companies meanwhile lose billions each year because of product piracy .
and only last week , china announced plans to build its own high speed train based on the german-made transrapid magnet rail , pushing the problem if technology theft in the foreground yet again . " it 's a very difficult issue for many german companies and german foreign policy , " sanschneider said .
" it will certainly be discussed , but the chinese answer is already clear : the government will signal that it is working to improve the situation , but that it will take years for this to happen .

the foreign minister pointed out that the present government grand coalition of social democrats and christian democrats were in favor of deciding the issue on a european level . at the same time steinmeier added that germany already had one of the strictest export restrictions in the eu and added that even a lifting of the eu arms embargo would n't lead to " a more liberal approach -lrb- towards china -rrb- in germany . "
the latter was also one of former chancellor schröder 's main arguments as he pushed for the eu to drop the existing arms ban . business high on the agenda but , away from the arms embargo issue , which is unlikely to go down well with chinese leaders , much of steinmeier 's visit is likely to be consumed by business talk . germany and china have cooperated closely in the areas of culture , science , environmental protection .

" such an emerging giant needs to take on global responsibilities , " said steinmeiner , who will also prepare chancellor angela merkel 's visit that 's likely to take place in july . " he really means the question of how to deal with iran , " sandschneider said .
" china has a very , very important role to play - in case of a vote in the un security council , for example .
getting china to actively cooperate with the west in this respect is an important goal . " the problem of copyright protectio n copyright protection will be another item high on steinmeier 's agenda as the chinese are known not to take this too seriously .

the foreign minister pointed out that the present government grand coalition of social democrats and christian democrats were in favor of deciding the issue on a european level . at the same time steinmeier added that germany already had one of the strictest export restrictions in the eu and added that even a lifting of the eu arms embargo would n't lead to " a more liberal approach -lrb- towards china -rrb- in germany . "
the latter was also one of former chancellor schröder 's main arguments as he pushed for the eu to drop the existing arms ban . business high on the agenda but , away from the arms embargo issue , which is unlikely to go down well with chinese leaders , much of steinmeier 's visit is likely to be consumed by business talk . germany and china have cooperated closely in the areas of culture , science , environmental protection .
the two countries are engaged in a dialogue about the rule of law and - last but not least - have established strong business ties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view of the shanghai skyline germany is china 's strongest european economic partner and china remains germany 's most important market in asia .
former german chancellor gerhard schröder has played a central role in promoting these ties : during his time in office , he traveled to the country six times , a large delegation of german business leaders in tow . steinmeier will also visit china with a group of representatives from german companies - albeit mid-sized ones .
as he already announced when taking over the foreign office from his predecessor , joschka fischer , steinmeier seems to see the support of german business interests as one of his ministry 's duties . more pushy tha n schröder ? while steinmeier served as schröder 's chief-of-staff and was likely supportive of the latter 's pragmatic approach towards china and russia when it came to addressing human rights , as foreign minister , he 's not going to be able to avoid the issue , according to experts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor schröder inspects a traditonal chinese dragon " he knows that this is an important element of german domestic politics , " said eberhard sandschneider , an expert on china at the german council on foreign relations .
" the german public expects a german politician to address this sensitive topic .
but frank-walter steinmeier is experienced enough to know that he will not be able to bring about any immediate changes this way . " members of china 's opposition in germany still have high hopes for the new german government .
last week , they sent a letter to the foreign ministry to inform the minister about the human rights situation in china . urgi n g more participatio n as global player but apart from this rather unpleasant topic for steinmeier 's hosts , the foreign minister will also try and encourage china 's leaders to step up to the plate when it comes to taking on responsibility as a world power . " such an emerging giant needs to take on global responsibilities , " said steinmeiner , who will also prepare chancellor angela merkel 's visit that 's likely to take place in july . " he really means the question of how to deal with iran , " sandschneider said .
" china has a very , very important role to play - in case of a vote in the un security council , for example .
getting china to actively cooperate with the west in this respect is an important goal . " the problem of copyright protectio n copyright protection will be another item high on steinmeier 's agenda as the chinese are known not to take this too seriously .
german companies meanwhile lose billions each year because of product piracy .
and only last week , china announced plans to build its own high speed train based on the german-made transrapid magnet rail , pushing the problem if technology theft in the foreground yet again . " it 's a very difficult issue for many german companies and german foreign policy , " sanschneider said .
" it will certainly be discussed , but the chinese answer is already clear : the government will signal that it is working to improve the situation , but that it will take years for this to happen .

in iran nuclear crisis , all eyes turn to russia world powers split over iran nuclear program iran calls un referral " the end of diplomacy " europe -pipe- 21.02.2006 iran hopeful about russian nuclear compromise plan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian officials will visit iran 's bushehr nuclear plant thursday iranian officials said tuesday they were hopeful a russian compromise to end the crisis over iran 's nuclear program would bear fruit , also hinting that they attached greater weight to it than to talks with the eu-3 . ali hosseini-tash , the deputy secretary of iran 's supreme national security council , said the negotiations in moscow had been positive and " give us the hope of reaching an agreement . " " the main question is the creation of a more normal situation and to reduce this tension so that we wo n't have people making unreasonable demands of each other , " he said before leaving for iran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sergey lavrov but russian foreign minister sergei lavrov was markedly more cautious . " i think it would be premature to use terms such as failure or success , " he told reporters . russia , as a veto-wielding member of the un security council with traditionally close ties to iran , has long tried to mediate in the long-running dispute over its partner 's nuclear program .
its proposal is to create a joint venture that would enrich uranium for tehran 's energy needs on russian soil . russia sees it as a means of getting iran to reinstate its moratorium on uranium enrichment work , after tehran broke seals at three nuclear facilities last month and signaled its intention to resume nuclear work . iran stresses talks with russia , not eu the proposal by moscow has been cautiously welcomed by western countries , which suspect iran 's stated intention to develop peaceful nuclear energy is simply a cover for developing atomic weapons . iranian officials have also hinted that they attach greater significance to negotiations with moscow rather than with the eu troika of germany , france and britain who have been holding on-and-off talks with teheran for over two years . " our contacts with the european union will for the moment not be held only with the eu-3 , but also in a unilateral manner with the different countries of the european union , " mottaki told reporters following talks on monday with eu officials in brussels . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said on a visit to japan that diplomacy can still work in resolving the iranian nuclear standoff even though economic sanctions can not be ruled out .
" the issue of a military option does not arise , " steinmeier told a news conference .
" we must show imagination and take advantage of different diplomatic possibilities . "
" i do not believe economic sanctions are imminent .
but we can not completely rule out imposing sanctions , " he said . russians to visit iranian nuclear plant bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : technical staff at the isfahan uranium conversion facility in central iran russian negotiators continued to press iran at the talks to stop enrichment work , russian foreign ministry spokesman mikhail kamynin said . moscow called on iran " to return to a moratorium regime on all types on work on uranium enrichment including scientific research and construction work , " kamynin was quoted by the official itar-tass news agency as saying . the talks in moscow are to be followed up with a visit to iran on thursday by the head of russia 's atomic energy agency rosatom , sergei kiriyenko .
he is due to meet senior iranian officials and to visit a nuclear power station that russia is building for iran at bushehr , in southern iran . bildunterschrift : un security council however iran has shown no sign of willingness to restore a moratorium on uranium enrichment at home , a key demand of the west . iran has been reported to the un security council over its nuclear activities , and a march 6 meeting of the un 's international atomic energy agency will be vital in determining how the world body responds . moscow has repeatedly cautioned against a possible imposition of sanctions . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran issues enrichment threat but considers russian proposal iran said monday that it would restart uranium enrichment work despite international objections .

" we think that the two sides should respect each other and follow the principle of equality and properly handle the issue in accordance with world trade organization regulations , " chinese foreign ministry spokesman liu jianchao said . liu was responding to a european commission announcement monday that it was poised to take anti-dumping action against chinese and vietnamese shoemakers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter mandelson eu trade chief peter mandelson is to propose a course of action to member states this week , his spokesman said , which an eu source said could result in a 20 percent tariff on imports of chinese and vietnamese shoes with leather uppers . pointing to a similar row between the two sides last year over textiles that was eventually fixed through negotiations , liu indicated the disputes were an unavoidable part of trade that could be resolved amicably .

but few people know that two-thirds of them went to army-sponsored athletes . the german army spends 25 million euros -lrb- $ 30 million -rrb- per year on sports training and it certainly seems to be getting its money 's worth . when sylke otto , silke kraushaar and tatjana hüfner won gold , silver and bronze in the luge competition last week , the victory was theirs - and the german army 's . ditto for kati wilhelm , who took a gold in biathlon -lrb- cross-country skiing and target shooting -rrb- , andre lang , who won a gold medal in the two-man bobsled , and the women 's cross-country ski team , which got a silver medal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kati wilhelm got gold for biathlon all of these athletes were competing for germany - but also for the german army , or bundeswehr .
they are all soldiers in the athletics-training department of the army where they prepared for the turin games . ' just one responsibility : training ' a total of 72 bundeswehr athletes are competing in turin .
that 's nearly half of germany 's 161-person team .
petty officer uwe witte , a trainer in the german army 's athletics-training division in the town of warendorf said there 's a reason why the bundeswehr program is so successful . " all their -lrb- the athletes ' -rrb- other responsibilities - school , family , household - disappear . here they can concentrate entirely on their sport .
of course , if you look at their schedule , there is not a lot of extra time to take care of other things . " the army has 22 sports-training departments across germany .
altogether , they support 744 athletes in 70 different sports .
such specialized athletics departments arose out of a decision the german parliament made in 1968 to promote sports in the country and to primarily rope in the army for that purpose . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luge slider sylke otto won a gold medal in turin georg remmert , who is temporarily in charge of the warendorf athletics-training department , said the training programs work both ways . " we are mostly here for the people who ca n't finance their training themselves .
in other words , the army is a kind of social net , " he said .
" it gives the athletes the security to be able to pursue their sport to such a degree of excellence .
in turn it shows the bundeswehr and germany in a good light internationally . " but only those who are already very accomplished athletes can be sponsored .
all those who have already made it to the national squad in their sport can apply .
in other words , the athletes are already very successful when they they are accepted into the army 's program . they are then assigned a trainer and are also meant to start following a normal soldier 's basic training .
later , they only need to fulfill 30 percent of a soldier 's normal duties ; the other 70 percent of their time is free for athletic training . best for winter sports the system seems to work especially well for winter sport athletes .
of 744 army athletes , only 200 are in winter sports , but they rack up the most successes .
much of that has to do with the popularity of winter sports in germany and particulary in the army .
further , athletes also have good infrastructure and training possibilies for winter olympic sports within germany . on top of that , " there are just fewer nations who do these winter sports , " said uwe witte .
" in turin , 84 countries are competing .
in contrast , there are 200 countries competing in the summer olympics .
-lrb- in summer -rrb- the spectrum of competing athletes is much bigger . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weight training rooms are used by regular soldiers too witte added that the bundeswehr placed great emphasis on supporting young , up-and-coming athletes .
" here , young people are pushed to be top in their field , in contrast to sponsorship by large companies , which is mostly aimed at a few very top athletes , " he said . josef nehren , head of the sports department of the bundeswehr , has high expectations for germany 's success in turin .
in salt lake city , in 2002 , soldiers took 25 of the total 35 medals that went to germany . " that is definitely good publicity .
but for me it is more important that it shows that our system is good , and that it works well when it is used right .
it also shows that money is being used well , " he said . julia spurzem -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de winter olympics in turin the 20th winter olympics kicked off on feb .

but germany is hoping a state visit to japan will boost long-standing economic ties with that country . even though china has become the most important trade partner for german business in asia , german investors are keen on japan .
and for its part , japanese business appreciates germany as an " environmentally conscious " country . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier visited tokyo on tuesday , on his first asia tour since taking office in november under chancellor angela merkel .
steinmeier , who heads wednesday to beijing on a three-nation tour that began in south korea , called china 's rising clout on the world economic and political stage " a new challenge . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier met with his japanese counterpart , taro aso , on tuesday yet in talks with japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi , he stressed that japan , the world 's second-largest economy , and third-ranked germany could work together on a range of fields .
seeking cooperation " there are many common concerns between germany and japan .
we must tighten our relationship of cooperation , " he said .
" japan and germany can work together to set example for other countries . " in general , german business seems to agree with him .
for many years , japan was germany 's most important trade partner in the asia-pacific region - until china began opening its economy , hitting the world market like a tornado . at the end of 2002 , the volume of german-chinese trade overtook that of germany and japan .
today , german-japanese trade is worth around 43 billion euros -lrb- $ 51.2 billion -rrb- compared to 50 billion in china .
while in 2002 german direct investment in japan still outpaced that of china , by 2004 that had changed .
germany invested 653 million euros in japan in 2004 , according to germany 's foreign ministry , while the investment in china reached 1.06 billion for the same period , according to china 's foreign trade office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if both countries work together , perhaps everyone can make some money yet despite the lure of china and its massive market potential , many german companies have n't lost interest in japan . " a german company that is active in japan does n't get into the chinese market , " said wolfgang klenner , an east asia expert from the ruhr university in bochum . for one thing , the markets are entirely different .
" in japan , you can only get anywhere if you have the newest technologies and patents .
in china , the danger of piracy is too great , " he said .
klenner posits that the reason so many germans stick to investing in japan is that country 's reliable - and familiar - legal system . different markets business prospects for investors in japan are particularly good in the energy and environmental sectors .
japan needs to import nearly all its raw materials . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is a leader in wind power technology " in terms of energy production , japan is interested in anything that can make it more independent and stronger , " said markus taube of the east asia institute at the university of duisberg-essen .
this provides an opportunity for german business : the japanese are world leaders in solar energy , and germany leads in other areas of alternative energy production . wind energy , for example , is an area that japan wants to expand .
the country is on a mission to expand its wind-energy production eightfold , up to 3,000 megawatts by 2010 . germany 's environmental image germany is also a preferred partner for the japanese when it comes to environmental protection . " germany has the clear image in japan of an environmentally conscious country , " said friederike bosse of the association of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- .
scientific exchange in this area is also strong , and bosse said she believes german-japanese economic relations will benefit in the future from much of the academic cooperation that is currently underway . given these common interests , german business should take care not to lose sight of japan as a strategic economic partner , according to bochum university 's klenner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's growth is legendary , as is its building boom " japan is always underestimated , " klenner said .
" even if everyone is always talking about china , the real giant in asia and the world economy is japan . " it is an opinion that markus taube shares .
as soon as the german and japanese economies recover , and consumer spending increases , trade between the two nations will increase as well , he said . until then , however , china is the ideal land for racking up sales , both for japan and germany .
bosse , of the german industry association , said this brings up another trend worth looking at - german-japanese joint ventures in china . match made in heaven ? " germans and japanese are increasingly forming joint ventures .

but as baha güngör observes , both positive and negative reactions to the movie are over the top . the most expensive turkish movie of all time , " valley of the wolves , " does nothing to contribute to an inter-cultural dialogue .
it can neither be interpreted as pro-european nor deemed to promote the integration of turks and muslims in germany or other eu countries .
but that was never the film 's intention . " valley of the wolves " is an action film , which uses anti-american cliches to build on a very real political sentiment .

" valley of the wolves " tells the tale of the arrest of a turkish special unit by us troops in the kurdish region of northern iraq .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 21.02.2006 despite china , germany keeps eye on japanese business großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany hopes to boost economic ties to japan these days , china is the first country everyone thinks of when the topic is asian trade .
but germany is hoping a state visit to japan will boost long-standing economic ties with that country . even though china has become the most important trade partner for german business in asia , german investors are keen on japan .
and for its part , japanese business appreciates germany as an " environmentally conscious " country . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier visited tokyo on tuesday , on his first asia tour since taking office in november under chancellor angela merkel .
steinmeier , who heads wednesday to beijing on a three-nation tour that began in south korea , called china 's rising clout on the world economic and political stage " a new challenge . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier met with his japanese counterpart , taro aso , on tuesday yet in talks with japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi , he stressed that japan , the world 's second-largest economy , and third-ranked germany could work together on a range of fields .
seeking cooperation " there are many common concerns between germany and japan .
we must tighten our relationship of cooperation , " he said .
" japan and germany can work together to set example for other countries . " in general , german business seems to agree with him .
for many years , japan was germany 's most important trade partner in the asia-pacific region - until china began opening its economy , hitting the world market like a tornado . at the end of 2002 , the volume of german-chinese trade overtook that of germany and japan .
today , german-japanese trade is worth around 43 billion euros -lrb- $ 51.2 billion -rrb- compared to 50 billion in china .
while in 2002 german direct investment in japan still outpaced that of china , by 2004 that had changed .
germany invested 653 million euros in japan in 2004 , according to germany 's foreign ministry , while the investment in china reached 1.06 billion for the same period , according to china 's foreign trade office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if both countries work together , perhaps everyone can make some money yet despite the lure of china and its massive market potential , many german companies have n't lost interest in japan . " a german company that is active in japan does n't get into the chinese market , " said wolfgang klenner , an east asia expert from the ruhr university in bochum . for one thing , the markets are entirely different .
" in japan , you can only get anywhere if you have the newest technologies and patents .
in china , the danger of piracy is too great , " he said .
klenner posits that the reason so many germans stick to investing in japan is that country 's reliable - and familiar - legal system . different markets business prospects for investors in japan are particularly good in the energy and environmental sectors .
japan needs to import nearly all its raw materials . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is a leader in wind power technology " in terms of energy production , japan is interested in anything that can make it more independent and stronger , " said markus taube of the east asia institute at the university of duisberg-essen .
this provides an opportunity for german business : the japanese are world leaders in solar energy , and germany leads in other areas of alternative energy production . wind energy , for example , is an area that japan wants to expand .
the country is on a mission to expand its wind-energy production eightfold , up to 3,000 megawatts by 2010 . germany 's environmental image germany is also a preferred partner for the japanese when it comes to environmental protection . " germany has the clear image in japan of an environmentally conscious country , " said friederike bosse of the association of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- .
scientific exchange in this area is also strong , and bosse said she believes german-japanese economic relations will benefit in the future from much of the academic cooperation that is currently underway . given these common interests , german business should take care not to lose sight of japan as a strategic economic partner , according to bochum university 's klenner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's growth is legendary , as is its building boom " japan is always underestimated , " klenner said .
" even if everyone is always talking about china , the real giant in asia and the world economy is japan . " it is an opinion that markus taube shares .
as soon as the german and japanese economies recover , and consumer spending increases , trade between the two nations will increase as well , he said . until then , however , china is the ideal land for racking up sales , both for japan and germany .
bosse , of the german industry association , said this brings up another trend worth looking at - german-japanese joint ventures in china . match made in heaven ? " germans and japanese are increasingly forming joint ventures .
they want to see if together , they can succeed in the chinese market . " it could be a match made in heaven , bosse believes .
unlike the japanese , the germans were not historical enemies of the chinese .
and the japanese can understand the asian market better . sonja lindenberg -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g4 knocks on security council doors again along with japan , brazil and india , german foreign minister fischer on thursday renewed calls for permanent security council membership , on the sidelines of the un world summit in new york .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 21.02.2006 merkel asks cdu to start soul-searching großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian values must be at the heart of a cdu manifesto , merkel said german chancellor angela merkel has called for her party to review its basic beliefs and renew its emphasis , appealing for more " solidarity . " some 800 participants attended a small party conference in berlin monday , where the topic on hand was a reassessment of the ruling christian democratic union 's values .
cdu leader angela merkel took the opportunity to call for fundamental change , but stressed the need to keep christian values at the core of the party 's ideology . in a debate that is expected to go on for two years , the cdu wants to refine its image within the " grand coalition " government -lrb- it currently shares power with the the social democrats . -rrb-
to do this , it plans to modernize its manifesto .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a weak election result forced the cdu to govern with the spd by claiming a phrase historically associated with workers ' parties and the opposing social democrats - solidarity - the cdu is seen to be angling for more support after a razor-thin win at the polls last year .
' solidarity is patriotism ' solidarity needs to be seen on a par with basic values like freedom and justice , in order to keep germany on the right path , merkel said .
sounding more like the leader of a workers ' union than a conservative government , merkel said : " we have to remain in a country where solidarity is practiced without asking about the material gains . "
" freedom and solidarity - for us , this combination is not unattainable , " merkel told the party faithful .
" the ability to exercise solidarity is perhaps one of the most important patriotic abilities . "
questioning the social-market economy the most important thing is for the cdu to take a new look at germany 's social-market economy , merkel said .
in her first big party speech since being elected to office nearly 100 days ago , merkel noted that the party 's current manifesto , created in 1994 , " fails to answer a whole array " of modern-day questions .
that is especially true when it comes to social and economic policies , she said .
" we want to secure the future of the social-market economy .
but we realize that with globalization , certain basic conditions have changed , " she said .
as a result , people are rejecting germany 's current economic model .
" only a minority considers the social-market economy to be fair , " merkel said .
christianity at the base party members and committees will meet repeatedly to discuss the new manifesto between now and late 2007 , when it will be put up for a vote .
merkel said the basis of the cdu manifesto needs to be christian values , and warned that the party has to " figure out what it can absolutely not afford to lose . "
she urged the cdu to discuss basic values with people from other countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heiner geißler of the cdu the party also unveiled a new motto , " new justice through more freedom . " ex-cdu general secretary heiner geißler told the express newspaper he thought the motto was " backwards , " adding that freedom alone can not bring about justice . and michael sommer , head of the association of german unions , told the kölner stadt anzeiger that the cdu seemed to be on a course of " basic social renovation . "
the discussion " reflects the fact that in germany , you ca n't get a majority of votes with neo-liberal rhetoric , " he said . a number of active members concentrated on the idea that the cdu should stress its roots in christian belief and values .
the head of the cdu 's workers ' wing , karl laumann , told the passauer neuen presse that the cdu " needs to unconditionally stand up for christian social teachings and social justice .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 21.02.2006 merkel asks cdu to start soul-searching großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian values must be at the heart of a cdu manifesto , merkel said german chancellor angela merkel has called for her party to review its basic beliefs and renew its emphasis , appealing for more " solidarity . " some 800 participants attended a small party conference in berlin monday , where the topic on hand was a reassessment of the ruling christian democratic union 's values .
cdu leader angela merkel took the opportunity to call for fundamental change , but stressed the need to keep christian values at the core of the party 's ideology . in a debate that is expected to go on for two years , the cdu wants to refine its image within the " grand coalition " government -lrb- it currently shares power with the the social democrats . -rrb-
to do this , it plans to modernize its manifesto .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a weak election result forced the cdu to govern with the spd by claiming a phrase historically associated with workers ' parties and the opposing social democrats - solidarity - the cdu is seen to be angling for more support after a razor-thin win at the polls last year .
' solidarity is patriotism ' solidarity needs to be seen on a par with basic values like freedom and justice , in order to keep germany on the right path , merkel said .
sounding more like the leader of a workers ' union than a conservative government , merkel said : " we have to remain in a country where solidarity is practiced without asking about the material gains . "
" freedom and solidarity - for us , this combination is not unattainable , " merkel told the party faithful .
" the ability to exercise solidarity is perhaps one of the most important patriotic abilities . "
questioning the social-market economy the most important thing is for the cdu to take a new look at germany 's social-market economy , merkel said .
in her first big party speech since being elected to office nearly 100 days ago , merkel noted that the party 's current manifesto , created in 1994 , " fails to answer a whole array " of modern-day questions .
that is especially true when it comes to social and economic policies , she said .
" we want to secure the future of the social-market economy .
but we realize that with globalization , certain basic conditions have changed , " she said .
as a result , people are rejecting germany 's current economic model .
" only a minority considers the social-market economy to be fair , " merkel said .
christianity at the base party members and committees will meet repeatedly to discuss the new manifesto between now and late 2007 , when it will be put up for a vote .
merkel said the basis of the cdu manifesto needs to be christian values , and warned that the party has to " figure out what it can absolutely not afford to lose . "
she urged the cdu to discuss basic values with people from other countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heiner geißler of the cdu the party also unveiled a new motto , " new justice through more freedom . " ex-cdu general secretary heiner geißler told the express newspaper he thought the motto was " backwards , " adding that freedom alone can not bring about justice . and michael sommer , head of the association of german unions , told the kölner stadt anzeiger that the cdu seemed to be on a course of " basic social renovation . "
the discussion " reflects the fact that in germany , you ca n't get a majority of votes with neo-liberal rhetoric , " he said . a number of active members concentrated on the idea that the cdu should stress its roots in christian belief and values .
the head of the cdu 's workers ' wing , karl laumann , told the passauer neuen presse that the cdu " needs to unconditionally stand up for christian social teachings and social justice .

a german newspaper has written that us intelligence services spied on two german agents who remained in iraq during the us-led war in 2003 . citing a confidential government paper , the leipziger volkszeitung daily said that reports from the two german federal intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- agents stationed in baghdad to the services headquarters near munich may have been intercepted by us sources using a satellite telephone . the newspaper said that , in addition the two agents - who are currently involved in a controversy over their exact role during the war to which then chancellor gerhard schröder was so vehemently opposed - were " repeatedly pressed " to provide war intelligence from baghdad to the us commando headquarters in qatar .
it added that the german agents refused to be drawn in , but that 25 of 125 bnd reports were officially passed on to the us . according to the paper , the parliamentary control commission , which is charged with reviewing certain secret service activities , has all the information in the confidential report and will meet in berlin on wednesday to debate just how much of it should be made public . that decision could cause the opposition green party , which was the junior partner in schröder 's government , to rethink its objection to a parliamentary inquiry over the role of the bnd during the war , the newspaper wrote .

a german newspaper has written that us intelligence services spied on two german agents who remained in iraq during the us-led war in 2003 . citing a confidential government paper , the leipziger volkszeitung daily said that reports from the two german federal intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- agents stationed in baghdad to the services headquarters near munich may have been intercepted by us sources using a satellite telephone . the newspaper said that , in addition the two agents - who are currently involved in a controversy over their exact role during the war to which then chancellor gerhard schröder was so vehemently opposed - were " repeatedly pressed " to provide war intelligence from baghdad to the us commando headquarters in qatar .
it added that the german agents refused to be drawn in , but that 25 of 125 bnd reports were officially passed on to the us . according to the paper , the parliamentary control commission , which is charged with reviewing certain secret service activities , has all the information in the confidential report and will meet in berlin on wednesday to debate just how much of it should be made public . that decision could cause the opposition green party , which was the junior partner in schröder 's government , to rethink its objection to a parliamentary inquiry over the role of the bnd during the war , the newspaper wrote .

in iran nuclear crisis , all eyes turn to russia world powers split over iran nuclear program iran calls un referral " the end of diplomacy " europe -pipe- 21.02.2006 iran hopeful about russian nuclear compromise plan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian officials will visit iran 's bushehr nuclear plant thursday iranian officials said tuesday they were hopeful a russian compromise to end the crisis over iran 's nuclear program would bear fruit , also hinting that they attached greater weight to it than to talks with the eu-3 . ali hosseini-tash , the deputy secretary of iran 's supreme national security council , said the negotiations in moscow had been positive and " give us the hope of reaching an agreement . " " the main question is the creation of a more normal situation and to reduce this tension so that we wo n't have people making unreasonable demands of each other , " he said before leaving for iran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sergey lavrov but russian foreign minister sergei lavrov was markedly more cautious . " i think it would be premature to use terms such as failure or success , " he told reporters . russia , as a veto-wielding member of the un security council with traditionally close ties to iran , has long tried to mediate in the long-running dispute over its partner 's nuclear program .
its proposal is to create a joint venture that would enrich uranium for tehran 's energy needs on russian soil . russia sees it as a means of getting iran to reinstate its moratorium on uranium enrichment work , after tehran broke seals at three nuclear facilities last month and signaled its intention to resume nuclear work . iran stresses talks with russia , not eu the proposal by moscow has been cautiously welcomed by western countries , which suspect iran 's stated intention to develop peaceful nuclear energy is simply a cover for developing atomic weapons . iranian officials have also hinted that they attach greater significance to negotiations with moscow rather than with the eu troika of germany , france and britain who have been holding on-and-off talks with teheran for over two years . " our contacts with the european union will for the moment not be held only with the eu-3 , but also in a unilateral manner with the different countries of the european union , " mottaki told reporters following talks on monday with eu officials in brussels . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said on a visit to japan that diplomacy can still work in resolving the iranian nuclear standoff even though economic sanctions can not be ruled out .
" the issue of a military option does not arise , " steinmeier told a news conference .
" we must show imagination and take advantage of different diplomatic possibilities . "
" i do not believe economic sanctions are imminent .
but we can not completely rule out imposing sanctions , " he said . russians to visit iranian nuclear plant bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : technical staff at the isfahan uranium conversion facility in central iran russian negotiators continued to press iran at the talks to stop enrichment work , russian foreign ministry spokesman mikhail kamynin said . moscow called on iran " to return to a moratorium regime on all types on work on uranium enrichment including scientific research and construction work , " kamynin was quoted by the official itar-tass news agency as saying . the talks in moscow are to be followed up with a visit to iran on thursday by the head of russia 's atomic energy agency rosatom , sergei kiriyenko .
he is due to meet senior iranian officials and to visit a nuclear power station that russia is building for iran at bushehr , in southern iran . bildunterschrift : un security council however iran has shown no sign of willingness to restore a moratorium on uranium enrichment at home , a key demand of the west . iran has been reported to the un security council over its nuclear activities , and a march 6 meeting of the un 's international atomic energy agency will be vital in determining how the world body responds . moscow has repeatedly cautioned against a possible imposition of sanctions . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran issues enrichment threat but considers russian proposal iran said monday that it would restart uranium enrichment work despite international objections .

traditionally , no topic is sacred during this time .
but the ongoing controversy over caricatures of the prophet mohammed will stay out of the festivities . a carnival skit poking fun at pope benedict xvi has raised a debate on just how far political cabaret can satirize certain topics . the carnival gala stunksitzung plans to show the sketch in which pope benedict xvi as a pop star and the archbishop of cologne , cardinal joachim meisner , as a wannabe pop star lie in a bed together .
the two end up smooching . a private citizen has now pressed charges against the stunksitzung for " disrupting religious peace . "
public television channel wdr , which will broadcast the gala on saturday , has decided to cut out the controversial part .
the station said its policies prescribed respect of religious feelings , which they said would have been hurt if the skit was broadcast . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should satire be allowed to present the pope as a pop star ? winni rau , spokesman for the stunksitzung , said the skit was an interpretation of the pope 's pop star qualities during world youth day , which took place in cologne last summer .
he said he did n't agree with wdr 's decision . " what is satire allowed to do in the western world ? "
rau said .
" we can debate this issue , but not forbid it . " rau said he wished wdr would have had " more courage . "
" i really think it 's a shame , " he said .
" it could have showed that we here in the west can also mock our own culture and religion . " people have to be able to handle satire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rote funken are a popular carnival society the stunksitzung is an alternative to the traditional galas , which mainly take place in the german karneval strongholds cologne , düsseldorf and mainz .
the galas are a regular part of the so-called " fifth season " between its kick-off on nov .
11 and the actual carnival week , which starts on the thursday before ash wednesday .
they include singing and dancing , but also orators , who address various political and societal topics . rau said the stunksitzung considers itself political cabaret . " this satire can and should also be directed against the church or political topics , " rau said .
" in the case of cabaret or satire , people have to be able to take it .
it is part of our culture . " cologne just wants to have fun bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you 'll find more happy than sad clowns in cologne in cologne , though , political and socio-critical issues have never been at the top of the carnival agenda , and they wo n't be this year either . " our philosophy is that carnival should be fun and friendly , " said sigrid krebs , spokeswoman for the city 's carnival committee . krebs said there would be satirical floats in the rosenmontag parade on carnival monday , one of the highlights of the " fifth season . " " but they have never been aimed at harming or offending people nor will they in the future , " krebs said . düsseldorf wants to avoid religious provocation just 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- further north , in düsseldorf , political and religious critique have been much more common in the past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this float had the motto " fostering tradition " last year , a float showed cardinal meisner striking a match to a woman tied to the stake , the words " i had an abortion " written on her .
in 2003 , the düsseldorf procession showed angela merkel , today 's chancellor , coming out of uncle sam 's behind - a statement on her support for the us invasion of iraq . bernd jost , spokesman for the düsseldorf carnival committee , said there would not be any floats dealing with religion this year . " in view of the current debate , we will be keeping very clear of things related to muslims , " jost said .
" we do n't want to fuel hatred . " according to jost , the well-being of the parade spectators was the top priority for the committee . the cartoon controversy is also not an issue on the agenda in the third carnival stronghold , mainz .
local and national issues are more a priority in the city 's rosenmontag parade . turning the world on its head karneval has its origins in the middle ages and is traditionally a roman catholic celebration .
it is closely associated with easter , as it always ends on ash wednesday , marking the beginning of lent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a so-called mullahburger , shown in düsseldorf last year , does not reflect carnival tradition parody and mockery are part of its tradition , said matthias von der bank , a historian from cologne 's carnival museum . " but it was n't satire like we have today , " von der bank said . " in the middle ages , carnival was a festival of reverse worlds and a playful expression of this , " von der bank said .
" so christian symbols , for example , were turned upside down . " but , he added , slandering the church was and is not part of carnival 's festivities . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de young carnival prince is also integration success story this year , the town of wesseling has dubbed a tunisian boy its traditional carnival prince .

but the ongoing controversy over caricatures of the prophet mohammed will stay out of the festivities . a carnival skit poking fun at pope benedict xvi has raised a debate on just how far political cabaret can satirize certain topics . the carnival gala stunksitzung plans to show the sketch in which pope benedict xvi as a pop star and the archbishop of cologne , cardinal joachim meisner , as a wannabe pop star lie in a bed together .
the two end up smooching . a private citizen has now pressed charges against the stunksitzung for " disrupting religious peace . "
public television channel wdr , which will broadcast the gala on saturday , has decided to cut out the controversial part .
the station said its policies prescribed respect of religious feelings , which they said would have been hurt if the skit was broadcast . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should satire be allowed to present the pope as a pop star ? winni rau , spokesman for the stunksitzung , said the skit was an interpretation of the pope 's pop star qualities during world youth day , which took place in cologne last summer .
he said he did n't agree with wdr 's decision . " what is satire allowed to do in the western world ? "
rau said .
" we can debate this issue , but not forbid it . " rau said he wished wdr would have had " more courage . "
" i really think it 's a shame , " he said .
" it could have showed that we here in the west can also mock our own culture and religion . " people have to be able to handle satire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rote funken are a popular carnival society the stunksitzung is an alternative to the traditional galas , which mainly take place in the german karneval strongholds cologne , düsseldorf and mainz .
the galas are a regular part of the so-called " fifth season " between its kick-off on nov .
11 and the actual carnival week , which starts on the thursday before ash wednesday .
they include singing and dancing , but also orators , who address various political and societal topics . rau said the stunksitzung considers itself political cabaret . " this satire can and should also be directed against the church or political topics , " rau said .
" in the case of cabaret or satire , people have to be able to take it .
it is part of our culture . " cologne just wants to have fun bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you 'll find more happy than sad clowns in cologne in cologne , though , political and socio-critical issues have never been at the top of the carnival agenda , and they wo n't be this year either . " our philosophy is that carnival should be fun and friendly , " said sigrid krebs , spokeswoman for the city 's carnival committee . krebs said there would be satirical floats in the rosenmontag parade on carnival monday , one of the highlights of the " fifth season . " " but they have never been aimed at harming or offending people nor will they in the future , " krebs said . düsseldorf wants to avoid religious provocation just 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- further north , in düsseldorf , political and religious critique have been much more common in the past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this float had the motto " fostering tradition " last year , a float showed cardinal meisner striking a match to a woman tied to the stake , the words " i had an abortion " written on her .
in 2003 , the düsseldorf procession showed angela merkel , today 's chancellor , coming out of uncle sam 's behind - a statement on her support for the us invasion of iraq . bernd jost , spokesman for the düsseldorf carnival committee , said there would not be any floats dealing with religion this year . " in view of the current debate , we will be keeping very clear of things related to muslims , " jost said .
" we do n't want to fuel hatred . " according to jost , the well-being of the parade spectators was the top priority for the committee . the cartoon controversy is also not an issue on the agenda in the third carnival stronghold , mainz .
local and national issues are more a priority in the city 's rosenmontag parade . turning the world on its head karneval has its origins in the middle ages and is traditionally a roman catholic celebration .
it is closely associated with easter , as it always ends on ash wednesday , marking the beginning of lent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a so-called mullahburger , shown in düsseldorf last year , does not reflect carnival tradition parody and mockery are part of its tradition , said matthias von der bank , a historian from cologne 's carnival museum . " but it was n't satire like we have today , " von der bank said . " in the middle ages , carnival was a festival of reverse worlds and a playful expression of this , " von der bank said .
" so christian symbols , for example , were turned upside down . " but , he added , slandering the church was and is not part of carnival 's festivities . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de young carnival prince is also integration success story this year , the town of wesseling has dubbed a tunisian boy its traditional carnival prince .

" we think that the two sides should respect each other and follow the principle of equality and properly handle the issue in accordance with world trade organization regulations , " chinese foreign ministry spokesman liu jianchao said . liu was responding to a european commission announcement monday that it was poised to take anti-dumping action against chinese and vietnamese shoemakers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter mandelson eu trade chief peter mandelson is to propose a course of action to member states this week , his spokesman said , which an eu source said could result in a 20 percent tariff on imports of chinese and vietnamese shoes with leather uppers . pointing to a similar row between the two sides last year over textiles that was eventually fixed through negotiations , liu indicated the disputes were an unavoidable part of trade that could be resolved amicably . " last year we had trade negotiations that successfully resolved some issues , " he said .
" as sino-eu relations develop and expand new problems will continue to appear . " according to chinese statistics , china-eu trade was valued at $ 217.3 billion -lrb- 182.7 billion euros -rrb- in 2005 , up by 22.6 percent over the previous year .

" some 800 participants attended a small party conference in berlin monday , where the topic on hand was a reassessment of the ruling christian democratic union 's values .
cdu leader angela merkel took the opportunity to call for fundamental change , but stressed the need to keep christian values at the core of the party 's ideology . in a debate that is expected to go on for two years , the cdu wants to refine its image within the " grand coalition " government -lrb- it currently shares power with the the social democrats . -rrb-
to do this , it plans to modernize its manifesto .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a weak election result forced the cdu to govern with the spd by claiming a phrase historically associated with workers ' parties and the opposing social democrats - solidarity - the cdu is seen to be angling for more support after a razor-thin win at the polls last year .
' solidarity is patriotism ' solidarity needs to be seen on a par with basic values like freedom and justice , in order to keep germany on the right path , merkel said .
sounding more like the leader of a workers ' union than a conservative government , merkel said : " we have to remain in a country where solidarity is practiced without asking about the material gains . "
" freedom and solidarity - for us , this combination is not unattainable , " merkel told the party faithful .
" the ability to exercise solidarity is perhaps one of the most important patriotic abilities . "
questioning the social-market economy the most important thing is for the cdu to take a new look at germany 's social-market economy , merkel said .
in her first big party speech since being elected to office nearly 100 days ago , merkel noted that the party 's current manifesto , created in 1994 , " fails to answer a whole array " of modern-day questions .
that is especially true when it comes to social and economic policies , she said .
" we want to secure the future of the social-market economy .
but we realize that with globalization , certain basic conditions have changed , " she said .
as a result , people are rejecting germany 's current economic model .
" only a minority considers the social-market economy to be fair , " merkel said .
christianity at the base party members and committees will meet repeatedly to discuss the new manifesto between now and late 2007 , when it will be put up for a vote .
merkel said the basis of the cdu manifesto needs to be christian values , and warned that the party has to " figure out what it can absolutely not afford to lose . "
she urged the cdu to discuss basic values with people from other countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heiner geißler of the cdu the party also unveiled a new motto , " new justice through more freedom . " ex-cdu general secretary heiner geißler told the express newspaper he thought the motto was " backwards , " adding that freedom alone can not bring about justice . and michael sommer , head of the association of german unions , told the kölner stadt anzeiger that the cdu seemed to be on a course of " basic social renovation . "
the discussion " reflects the fact that in germany , you ca n't get a majority of votes with neo-liberal rhetoric , " he said . a number of active members concentrated on the idea that the cdu should stress its roots in christian belief and values .

the latter was also one of former chancellor schröder 's main arguments as he pushed for the eu to drop the existing arms ban . business high on the agenda but , away from the arms embargo issue , which is unlikely to go down well with chinese leaders , much of steinmeier 's visit is likely to be consumed by business talk . germany and china have cooperated closely in the areas of culture , science , environmental protection .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 21.02.2006 german carnival steers clear of religious topics großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's carnival float-makers are comfortable with controversy carnival kicks off across germany this week .
traditionally , no topic is sacred during this time .
but the ongoing controversy over caricatures of the prophet mohammed will stay out of the festivities . a carnival skit poking fun at pope benedict xvi has raised a debate on just how far political cabaret can satirize certain topics . the carnival gala stunksitzung plans to show the sketch in which pope benedict xvi as a pop star and the archbishop of cologne , cardinal joachim meisner , as a wannabe pop star lie in a bed together .
the two end up smooching . a private citizen has now pressed charges against the stunksitzung for " disrupting religious peace . "
public television channel wdr , which will broadcast the gala on saturday , has decided to cut out the controversial part .
the station said its policies prescribed respect of religious feelings , which they said would have been hurt if the skit was broadcast . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should satire be allowed to present the pope as a pop star ? winni rau , spokesman for the stunksitzung , said the skit was an interpretation of the pope 's pop star qualities during world youth day , which took place in cologne last summer .
he said he did n't agree with wdr 's decision . " what is satire allowed to do in the western world ? "
rau said .
" we can debate this issue , but not forbid it . " rau said he wished wdr would have had " more courage . "
" i really think it 's a shame , " he said .
" it could have showed that we here in the west can also mock our own culture and religion . " people have to be able to handle satire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rote funken are a popular carnival society the stunksitzung is an alternative to the traditional galas , which mainly take place in the german karneval strongholds cologne , düsseldorf and mainz .
the galas are a regular part of the so-called " fifth season " between its kick-off on nov .
11 and the actual carnival week , which starts on the thursday before ash wednesday .
they include singing and dancing , but also orators , who address various political and societal topics . rau said the stunksitzung considers itself political cabaret . " this satire can and should also be directed against the church or political topics , " rau said .
" in the case of cabaret or satire , people have to be able to take it .
it is part of our culture . " cologne just wants to have fun bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you 'll find more happy than sad clowns in cologne in cologne , though , political and socio-critical issues have never been at the top of the carnival agenda , and they wo n't be this year either . " our philosophy is that carnival should be fun and friendly , " said sigrid krebs , spokeswoman for the city 's carnival committee . krebs said there would be satirical floats in the rosenmontag parade on carnival monday , one of the highlights of the " fifth season . " " but they have never been aimed at harming or offending people nor will they in the future , " krebs said . düsseldorf wants to avoid religious provocation just 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- further north , in düsseldorf , political and religious critique have been much more common in the past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this float had the motto " fostering tradition " last year , a float showed cardinal meisner striking a match to a woman tied to the stake , the words " i had an abortion " written on her .
in 2003 , the düsseldorf procession showed angela merkel , today 's chancellor , coming out of uncle sam 's behind - a statement on her support for the us invasion of iraq . bernd jost , spokesman for the düsseldorf carnival committee , said there would not be any floats dealing with religion this year . " in view of the current debate , we will be keeping very clear of things related to muslims , " jost said .
" we do n't want to fuel hatred . " according to jost , the well-being of the parade spectators was the top priority for the committee . the cartoon controversy is also not an issue on the agenda in the third carnival stronghold , mainz .
local and national issues are more a priority in the city 's rosenmontag parade . turning the world on its head karneval has its origins in the middle ages and is traditionally a roman catholic celebration .
it is closely associated with easter , as it always ends on ash wednesday , marking the beginning of lent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a so-called mullahburger , shown in düsseldorf last year , does not reflect carnival tradition parody and mockery are part of its tradition , said matthias von der bank , a historian from cologne 's carnival museum . " but it was n't satire like we have today , " von der bank said . " in the middle ages , carnival was a festival of reverse worlds and a playful expression of this , " von der bank said .
" so christian symbols , for example , were turned upside down . " but , he added , slandering the church was and is not part of carnival 's festivities . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de young carnival prince is also integration success story this year , the town of wesseling has dubbed a tunisian boy its traditional carnival prince .

a german newspaper has written that us intelligence services spied on two german agents who remained in iraq during the us-led war in 2003 . citing a confidential government paper , the leipziger volkszeitung daily said that reports from the two german federal intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- agents stationed in baghdad to the services headquarters near munich may have been intercepted by us sources using a satellite telephone . the newspaper said that , in addition the two agents - who are currently involved in a controversy over their exact role during the war to which then chancellor gerhard schröder was so vehemently opposed - were " repeatedly pressed " to provide war intelligence from baghdad to the us commando headquarters in qatar .
it added that the german agents refused to be drawn in , but that 25 of 125 bnd reports were officially passed on to the us . according to the paper , the parliamentary control commission , which is charged with reviewing certain secret service activities , has all the information in the confidential report and will meet in berlin on wednesday to debate just how much of it should be made public . that decision could cause the opposition green party , which was the junior partner in schröder 's government , to rethink its objection to a parliamentary inquiry over the role of the bnd during the war , the newspaper wrote .

a german newspaper has written that us intelligence services spied on two german agents who remained in iraq during the us-led war in 2003 . citing a confidential government paper , the leipziger volkszeitung daily said that reports from the two german federal intelligence agency -lrb- bnd -rrb- agents stationed in baghdad to the services headquarters near munich may have been intercepted by us sources using a satellite telephone . the newspaper said that , in addition the two agents - who are currently involved in a controversy over their exact role during the war to which then chancellor gerhard schröder was so vehemently opposed - were " repeatedly pressed " to provide war intelligence from baghdad to the us commando headquarters in qatar .
it added that the german agents refused to be drawn in , but that 25 of 125 bnd reports were officially passed on to the us . according to the paper , the parliamentary control commission , which is charged with reviewing certain secret service activities , has all the information in the confidential report and will meet in berlin on wednesday to debate just how much of it should be made public . that decision could cause the opposition green party , which was the junior partner in schröder 's government , to rethink its objection to a parliamentary inquiry over the role of the bnd during the war , the newspaper wrote .

" we think that the two sides should respect each other and follow the principle of equality and properly handle the issue in accordance with world trade organization regulations , " chinese foreign ministry spokesman liu jianchao said . liu was responding to a european commission announcement monday that it was poised to take anti-dumping action against chinese and vietnamese shoemakers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter mandelson eu trade chief peter mandelson is to propose a course of action to member states this week , his spokesman said , which an eu source said could result in a 20 percent tariff on imports of chinese and vietnamese shoes with leather uppers . pointing to a similar row between the two sides last year over textiles that was eventually fixed through negotiations , liu indicated the disputes were an unavoidable part of trade that could be resolved amicably . " last year we had trade negotiations that successfully resolved some issues , " he said .
" as sino-eu relations develop and expand new problems will continue to appear . " according to chinese statistics , china-eu trade was valued at $ 217.3 billion -lrb- 182.7 billion euros -rrb- in 2005 , up by 22.6 percent over the previous year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 21.02.2006 merkel asks cdu to start soul-searching großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian values must be at the heart of a cdu manifesto , merkel said german chancellor angela merkel has called for her party to review its basic beliefs and renew its emphasis , appealing for more " solidarity . " some 800 participants attended a small party conference in berlin monday , where the topic on hand was a reassessment of the ruling christian democratic union 's values .
cdu leader angela merkel took the opportunity to call for fundamental change , but stressed the need to keep christian values at the core of the party 's ideology . in a debate that is expected to go on for two years , the cdu wants to refine its image within the " grand coalition " government -lrb- it currently shares power with the the social democrats . -rrb-
to do this , it plans to modernize its manifesto .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a weak election result forced the cdu to govern with the spd by claiming a phrase historically associated with workers ' parties and the opposing social democrats - solidarity - the cdu is seen to be angling for more support after a razor-thin win at the polls last year .
' solidarity is patriotism ' solidarity needs to be seen on a par with basic values like freedom and justice , in order to keep germany on the right path , merkel said .
sounding more like the leader of a workers ' union than a conservative government , merkel said : " we have to remain in a country where solidarity is practiced without asking about the material gains . "
" freedom and solidarity - for us , this combination is not unattainable , " merkel told the party faithful .
" the ability to exercise solidarity is perhaps one of the most important patriotic abilities . "
questioning the social-market economy the most important thing is for the cdu to take a new look at germany 's social-market economy , merkel said .
in her first big party speech since being elected to office nearly 100 days ago , merkel noted that the party 's current manifesto , created in 1994 , " fails to answer a whole array " of modern-day questions .
that is especially true when it comes to social and economic policies , she said .
" we want to secure the future of the social-market economy .
but we realize that with globalization , certain basic conditions have changed , " she said .
as a result , people are rejecting germany 's current economic model .
" only a minority considers the social-market economy to be fair , " merkel said .
christianity at the base party members and committees will meet repeatedly to discuss the new manifesto between now and late 2007 , when it will be put up for a vote .
merkel said the basis of the cdu manifesto needs to be christian values , and warned that the party has to " figure out what it can absolutely not afford to lose . "
she urged the cdu to discuss basic values with people from other countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heiner geißler of the cdu the party also unveiled a new motto , " new justice through more freedom . " ex-cdu general secretary heiner geißler told the express newspaper he thought the motto was " backwards , " adding that freedom alone can not bring about justice . and michael sommer , head of the association of german unions , told the kölner stadt anzeiger that the cdu seemed to be on a course of " basic social renovation . "
the discussion " reflects the fact that in germany , you ca n't get a majority of votes with neo-liberal rhetoric , " he said . a number of active members concentrated on the idea that the cdu should stress its roots in christian belief and values .
the head of the cdu 's workers ' wing , karl laumann , told the passauer neuen presse that the cdu " needs to unconditionally stand up for christian social teachings and social justice .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 21.02.2006 opinion : turkish film makes waves in germany - unnecessarily großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reactions to the movie have been explosive in germany a turkish action film about the iraq war , " valley of the wolves , " has unleashed a wave of outrage in germany .
but as baha güngör observes , both positive and negative reactions to the movie are over the top . the most expensive turkish movie of all time , " valley of the wolves , " does nothing to contribute to an inter-cultural dialogue .
it can neither be interpreted as pro-european nor deemed to promote the integration of turks and muslims in germany or other eu countries .
but that was never the film 's intention . " valley of the wolves " is an action film , which uses anti-american cliches to build on a very real political sentiment .
and it does n't stop there .
besides the americans who are portrayed as the main bad guys , it flirts with an anti-semitic cliche in the form of a jewish doctor who works alongside trigger-happy americans in the human organ trade .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the film is ranked five at german box offices the film has drawn excited enthusiasm among turkish viewers and harsh criticism from elsewhere .
both are exaggerated .
germany 's conservatives have slammed the film as " morally harmful for young people " and a threat to societal harmony .
there have even been calls for the film to be withdrawn from general release , but they serve only to heighten interest therein . seen it all before foolish is the high praise lavished on the film - which is based on a true story deemed degrading in turkey - by turkish state and government representatives .
" valley of the wolves " tells the tale of the arrest of a turkish special unit by us troops in the kurdish region of northern iraq .
but beyond that , it is a fictitious action film that is of no greater artistic merit than many us kick-boxing and rambo pictures which frequently discredit other countries and peoples .
there are hundreds of such films which simplify entire cultural circles , depicting them in a negative light , as aggressive , dangerous or even murderous . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from valley of the wolves even the turks have felt disparaged by such movies , the most prominent example being the film " midnight express " from 1978 .

in iran nuclear crisis , all eyes turn to russia world powers split over iran nuclear program iran calls un referral " the end of diplomacy " europe -pipe- 21.02.2006 iran hopeful about russian nuclear compromise plan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian officials will visit iran 's bushehr nuclear plant thursday iranian officials said tuesday they were hopeful a russian compromise to end the crisis over iran 's nuclear program would bear fruit , also hinting that they attached greater weight to it than to talks with the eu-3 . ali hosseini-tash , the deputy secretary of iran 's supreme national security council , said the negotiations in moscow had been positive and " give us the hope of reaching an agreement . " " the main question is the creation of a more normal situation and to reduce this tension so that we wo n't have people making unreasonable demands of each other , " he said before leaving for iran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sergey lavrov but russian foreign minister sergei lavrov was markedly more cautious . " i think it would be premature to use terms such as failure or success , " he told reporters . russia , as a veto-wielding member of the un security council with traditionally close ties to iran , has long tried to mediate in the long-running dispute over its partner 's nuclear program .
its proposal is to create a joint venture that would enrich uranium for tehran 's energy needs on russian soil . russia sees it as a means of getting iran to reinstate its moratorium on uranium enrichment work , after tehran broke seals at three nuclear facilities last month and signaled its intention to resume nuclear work . iran stresses talks with russia , not eu the proposal by moscow has been cautiously welcomed by western countries , which suspect iran 's stated intention to develop peaceful nuclear energy is simply a cover for developing atomic weapons . iranian officials have also hinted that they attach greater significance to negotiations with moscow rather than with the eu troika of germany , france and britain who have been holding on-and-off talks with teheran for over two years . " our contacts with the european union will for the moment not be held only with the eu-3 , but also in a unilateral manner with the different countries of the european union , " mottaki told reporters following talks on monday with eu officials in brussels . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said on a visit to japan that diplomacy can still work in resolving the iranian nuclear standoff even though economic sanctions can not be ruled out .
" the issue of a military option does not arise , " steinmeier told a news conference .
" we must show imagination and take advantage of different diplomatic possibilities . "
" i do not believe economic sanctions are imminent .
but we can not completely rule out imposing sanctions , " he said . russians to visit iranian nuclear plant bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : technical staff at the isfahan uranium conversion facility in central iran russian negotiators continued to press iran at the talks to stop enrichment work , russian foreign ministry spokesman mikhail kamynin said . moscow called on iran " to return to a moratorium regime on all types on work on uranium enrichment including scientific research and construction work , " kamynin was quoted by the official itar-tass news agency as saying . the talks in moscow are to be followed up with a visit to iran on thursday by the head of russia 's atomic energy agency rosatom , sergei kiriyenko .
he is due to meet senior iranian officials and to visit a nuclear power station that russia is building for iran at bushehr , in southern iran . bildunterschrift : un security council however iran has shown no sign of willingness to restore a moratorium on uranium enrichment at home , a key demand of the west . iran has been reported to the un security council over its nuclear activities , and a march 6 meeting of the un 's international atomic energy agency will be vital in determining how the world body responds . moscow has repeatedly cautioned against a possible imposition of sanctions . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran issues enrichment threat but considers russian proposal iran said monday that it would restart uranium enrichment work despite international objections .

its proposal is to create a joint venture that would enrich uranium for tehran 's energy needs on russian soil . russia sees it as a means of getting iran to reinstate its moratorium on uranium enrichment work , after tehran broke seals at three nuclear facilities last month and signaled its intention to resume nuclear work . iran stresses talks with russia , not eu the proposal by moscow has been cautiously welcomed by western countries , which suspect iran 's stated intention to develop peaceful nuclear energy is simply a cover for developing atomic weapons . iranian officials have also hinted that they attach greater significance to negotiations with moscow rather than with the eu troika of germany , france and britain who have been holding on-and-off talks with teheran for over two years .

bird flu psychosis is spreading faster than the virus itself . it was a surprise that germany 's airports were not inundated with fleeing citizens ; fighting each other for the last available seats to safety , panicked to distraction with only thoughts of escape passing through their fear-frazzled minds . " the feathered death - it has landed , " blared a headline in the berliner zeitung newspaper heralding the arrival of bird flu in germany last week along with , if the media were to be believed , the three other horsemen of the apocalypse . adding to the hysteria was the fact that if germany were to empty its borders , where would the escapees flee to ?
pestilence was everywhere .
not a corner of the globe was untouched .
poultry magnates considering the end of their empires must have seriously been considering investing their last euros in space tourism . as the people of europe looked to their leaders for guidance , some like germany 's chancellor merkel could barely hide their concern .
" the situation is very serious , " merkel said after a personal visit to the northern german island of rügen after avian flu struck there . everything seemed to add up to a doomsday scenario , a worldwide crisis which would sell a million copies in paperback if there would be anyone left alive to read it . welcome to the age of bird flu psychosis . the lethal h5n1 virus landed in western europe last week for the first time , littering parts of italy , greece , france , germany and austria with the carcasses of dead migratory birds and those domestic winged victims who were unlucky enough to fraternize with the infected before they quacked their last . a global panic six years in the making bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asia 's harsh lesson should have been learned sooner by europe it should have come as little surprise .
bird flu had been winging its way to europe , slowly but surely , since the disease first emerged in hong kong in 1997 .
it took its time but eventually made it to europe 's borders in october when it claimed a handful of teenage human victims and thousands of feathered fatalities on its way into the eu . six years .
plenty of time , one would imagine , for european leaders and health experts to have some sort of plan ready .
but when the first cases cropped up in italy and greece , the authorities were as shocked as anyone .
when the northern german island of rügen reported a batch of dead swans , it remained that way for some time because of a conflict between federal state and district laws which prevented the authorities from sending in a clean-up team immediately . the fact that governments and health organizations around the world seem to be at a loss to stop the spread of the virus and have no tried and tested means to cure the disease once it is contracted by humans could rightly cause some concern .
but the reactions of the general public , at the moment at least , far outstrip the actual threat . depression , suicide and poultry embargoes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the poultry industry is beginning to feel the heat in italy , for instance , the threat of unemployment due to the poultry industry being hit by panic embargoes on chicken caused one delivery man to kill his wife and child and then himself in a fit of manic depression . " he was very worried because we told him there 'd be less work because of the crisis , " an official from the man ’ s firm told the newspaper la repubblica .
it is by far the most extreme case recorded so far but there is no doubt that a lot more people are concerned to a lesser degree .
since the beginning of last week , the italian health ministry has received more than 13,000 phone calls to a special bird flu hotline to report dead birds or ask for advice . german red tape and insecurity fuels public confusion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin gave its fallen blackbird a guard of honor in germany , citizens have been urged to report dead birds to the police in an attempt to limit the impact after the rügen outbreak spread to the mainland .
such is the concern that a dead blackbird in a berlin suburb required what the attending fire chief called " a full state funeral " when a decontamination team in full bio-suits turned up to remove the corpse .
and help lines in germany have been inundated with calls from concerned people . a spokesperson for the federal ministry of food , agriculture and consumer protection told dw-world that while there were no official caller numbers available , a conservative estimate would be in the " high hundreds . "
all nine hot lines , however , were constantly engaged suggesting the estimate is very conservative . georg alpers , a psychologist at the university of würzburg believes that it is the not knowing which is causing most of the panic .
" we do not know at the moment what the concrete dangers are , how we could protect ourselves from these possible dangers and whether we are actually in danger .
from such insecurity , fear can grow . "
special effort required to catch bird flu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the experts deal with infected birds so you do n't have to while there is little doubt that a human bird flu pandemic is a possibility , scientists are increasingly stressing the ' if ' rather than ' when ' argument - and many believe it is a large ' if ' .
right now , to contract bird flu one would have to visit a contaminated area and have sustained contact with an infected bird or corpse , something most conscientious people would no doubt do their utmost to avoid . if the disease were to mutate into a version that could pass easily from one person to another - the main fear of health experts - then there would be more reason for concern .
a strong form of the virus would send the death rate - and the panic levels - sky high . but the strength of that version of the virus is also a matter of debate .
many scientists believe the human form could be milder than that affecting birds .
also , the disease appears to be treatable with the antiviral drug , tamiflu -lrb- oseltamvir -rrb- , which is known to be effective in the early stages or as a preventative treatment . in the context of world population , infection negligible so far , the virus has infected 169 people in seven countries , killing 91 , according to the world health organization .
despite the mortality rate being just under 50 percent , in relation to the combined population figures of those seven countries , the number of people infected is minute and those who have died even more so . the fact is the threat is real and people have died .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : bird flu : the continuing threat germany 's media tangle with bird flu bird flu talks hailed a success after securing $ 1.9 billion the westward migration of bird flu bird flu : the facts germany -pipe- 21.02.2006 fear borders on hysteria as bird flu hits europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paranoia is rife as dead birds turn up in europe while european governments are n't hitting the panic button as yet , the spread of bird flu has definitely got a lot of people fearing that the end is nigh .
bird flu psychosis is spreading faster than the virus itself . it was a surprise that germany 's airports were not inundated with fleeing citizens ; fighting each other for the last available seats to safety , panicked to distraction with only thoughts of escape passing through their fear-frazzled minds . " the feathered death - it has landed , " blared a headline in the berliner zeitung newspaper heralding the arrival of bird flu in germany last week along with , if the media were to be believed , the three other horsemen of the apocalypse . adding to the hysteria was the fact that if germany were to empty its borders , where would the escapees flee to ?
pestilence was everywhere .
not a corner of the globe was untouched .
poultry magnates considering the end of their empires must have seriously been considering investing their last euros in space tourism . as the people of europe looked to their leaders for guidance , some like germany 's chancellor merkel could barely hide their concern .
" the situation is very serious , " merkel said after a personal visit to the northern german island of rügen after avian flu struck there . everything seemed to add up to a doomsday scenario , a worldwide crisis which would sell a million copies in paperback if there would be anyone left alive to read it . welcome to the age of bird flu psychosis . the lethal h5n1 virus landed in western europe last week for the first time , littering parts of italy , greece , france , germany and austria with the carcasses of dead migratory birds and those domestic winged victims who were unlucky enough to fraternize with the infected before they quacked their last . a global panic six years in the making bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asia 's harsh lesson should have been learned sooner by europe it should have come as little surprise .
bird flu had been winging its way to europe , slowly but surely , since the disease first emerged in hong kong in 1997 .
it took its time but eventually made it to europe 's borders in october when it claimed a handful of teenage human victims and thousands of feathered fatalities on its way into the eu . six years .
plenty of time , one would imagine , for european leaders and health experts to have some sort of plan ready .
but when the first cases cropped up in italy and greece , the authorities were as shocked as anyone .
when the northern german island of rügen reported a batch of dead swans , it remained that way for some time because of a conflict between federal state and district laws which prevented the authorities from sending in a clean-up team immediately . the fact that governments and health organizations around the world seem to be at a loss to stop the spread of the virus and have no tried and tested means to cure the disease once it is contracted by humans could rightly cause some concern .
but the reactions of the general public , at the moment at least , far outstrip the actual threat . depression , suicide and poultry embargoes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the poultry industry is beginning to feel the heat in italy , for instance , the threat of unemployment due to the poultry industry being hit by panic embargoes on chicken caused one delivery man to kill his wife and child and then himself in a fit of manic depression . " he was very worried because we told him there 'd be less work because of the crisis , " an official from the man ’ s firm told the newspaper la repubblica .
it is by far the most extreme case recorded so far but there is no doubt that a lot more people are concerned to a lesser degree .
since the beginning of last week , the italian health ministry has received more than 13,000 phone calls to a special bird flu hotline to report dead birds or ask for advice . german red tape and insecurity fuels public confusion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin gave its fallen blackbird a guard of honor in germany , citizens have been urged to report dead birds to the police in an attempt to limit the impact after the rügen outbreak spread to the mainland .
such is the concern that a dead blackbird in a berlin suburb required what the attending fire chief called " a full state funeral " when a decontamination team in full bio-suits turned up to remove the corpse .
and help lines in germany have been inundated with calls from concerned people . a spokesperson for the federal ministry of food , agriculture and consumer protection told dw-world that while there were no official caller numbers available , a conservative estimate would be in the " high hundreds . "
all nine hot lines , however , were constantly engaged suggesting the estimate is very conservative . georg alpers , a psychologist at the university of würzburg believes that it is the not knowing which is causing most of the panic .
" we do not know at the moment what the concrete dangers are , how we could protect ourselves from these possible dangers and whether we are actually in danger .
from such insecurity , fear can grow . "
special effort required to catch bird flu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the experts deal with infected birds so you do n't have to while there is little doubt that a human bird flu pandemic is a possibility , scientists are increasingly stressing the ' if ' rather than ' when ' argument - and many believe it is a large ' if ' .
right now , to contract bird flu one would have to visit a contaminated area and have sustained contact with an infected bird or corpse , something most conscientious people would no doubt do their utmost to avoid . if the disease were to mutate into a version that could pass easily from one person to another - the main fear of health experts - then there would be more reason for concern .
a strong form of the virus would send the death rate - and the panic levels - sky high . but the strength of that version of the virus is also a matter of debate .
many scientists believe the human form could be milder than that affecting birds .
also , the disease appears to be treatable with the antiviral drug , tamiflu -lrb- oseltamvir -rrb- , which is known to be effective in the early stages or as a preventative treatment . in the context of world population , infection negligible so far , the virus has infected 169 people in seven countries , killing 91 , according to the world health organization .
despite the mortality rate being just under 50 percent , in relation to the combined population figures of those seven countries , the number of people infected is minute and those who have died even more so . the fact is the threat is real and people have died .
but as the situation stands at the moment , the threat to humans is negligible .

" some 800 participants attended a small party conference in berlin monday , where the topic on hand was a reassessment of the ruling christian democratic union 's values .
cdu leader angela merkel took the opportunity to call for fundamental change , but stressed the need to keep christian values at the core of the party 's ideology . in a debate that is expected to go on for two years , the cdu wants to refine its image within the " grand coalition " government -lrb- it currently shares power with the the social democrats . -rrb-
to do this , it plans to modernize its manifesto .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a weak election result forced the cdu to govern with the spd by claiming a phrase historically associated with workers ' parties and the opposing social democrats - solidarity - the cdu is seen to be angling for more support after a razor-thin win at the polls last year .
' solidarity is patriotism ' solidarity needs to be seen on a par with basic values like freedom and justice , in order to keep germany on the right path , merkel said .
sounding more like the leader of a workers ' union than a conservative government , merkel said : " we have to remain in a country where solidarity is practiced without asking about the material gains . "
" freedom and solidarity - for us , this combination is not unattainable , " merkel told the party faithful .
" the ability to exercise solidarity is perhaps one of the most important patriotic abilities . "
questioning the social-market economy the most important thing is for the cdu to take a new look at germany 's social-market economy , merkel said .
in her first big party speech since being elected to office nearly 100 days ago , merkel noted that the party 's current manifesto , created in 1994 , " fails to answer a whole array " of modern-day questions .
that is especially true when it comes to social and economic policies , she said .
" we want to secure the future of the social-market economy .
but we realize that with globalization , certain basic conditions have changed , " she said .
as a result , people are rejecting germany 's current economic model .
" only a minority considers the social-market economy to be fair , " merkel said .
christianity at the base party members and committees will meet repeatedly to discuss the new manifesto between now and late 2007 , when it will be put up for a vote .
merkel said the basis of the cdu manifesto needs to be christian values , and warned that the party has to " figure out what it can absolutely not afford to lose . "
she urged the cdu to discuss basic values with people from other countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heiner geißler of the cdu the party also unveiled a new motto , " new justice through more freedom . " ex-cdu general secretary heiner geißler told the express newspaper he thought the motto was " backwards , " adding that freedom alone can not bring about justice . and michael sommer , head of the association of german unions , told the kölner stadt anzeiger that the cdu seemed to be on a course of " basic social renovation . "
the discussion " reflects the fact that in germany , you ca n't get a majority of votes with neo-liberal rhetoric , " he said . a number of active members concentrated on the idea that the cdu should stress its roots in christian belief and values .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 21.02.2006 german carnival steers clear of religious topics großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's carnival float-makers are comfortable with controversy carnival kicks off across germany this week .
traditionally , no topic is sacred during this time .
but the ongoing controversy over caricatures of the prophet mohammed will stay out of the festivities . a carnival skit poking fun at pope benedict xvi has raised a debate on just how far political cabaret can satirize certain topics . the carnival gala stunksitzung plans to show the sketch in which pope benedict xvi as a pop star and the archbishop of cologne , cardinal joachim meisner , as a wannabe pop star lie in a bed together .
the two end up smooching . a private citizen has now pressed charges against the stunksitzung for " disrupting religious peace . "
public television channel wdr , which will broadcast the gala on saturday , has decided to cut out the controversial part .
the station said its policies prescribed respect of religious feelings , which they said would have been hurt if the skit was broadcast . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should satire be allowed to present the pope as a pop star ? winni rau , spokesman for the stunksitzung , said the skit was an interpretation of the pope 's pop star qualities during world youth day , which took place in cologne last summer .
he said he did n't agree with wdr 's decision . " what is satire allowed to do in the western world ? "
rau said .
" we can debate this issue , but not forbid it . " rau said he wished wdr would have had " more courage . "
" i really think it 's a shame , " he said .
" it could have showed that we here in the west can also mock our own culture and religion . " people have to be able to handle satire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rote funken are a popular carnival society the stunksitzung is an alternative to the traditional galas , which mainly take place in the german karneval strongholds cologne , düsseldorf and mainz .
the galas are a regular part of the so-called " fifth season " between its kick-off on nov .
11 and the actual carnival week , which starts on the thursday before ash wednesday .
they include singing and dancing , but also orators , who address various political and societal topics . rau said the stunksitzung considers itself political cabaret . " this satire can and should also be directed against the church or political topics , " rau said .
" in the case of cabaret or satire , people have to be able to take it .
it is part of our culture . " cologne just wants to have fun bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you 'll find more happy than sad clowns in cologne in cologne , though , political and socio-critical issues have never been at the top of the carnival agenda , and they wo n't be this year either . " our philosophy is that carnival should be fun and friendly , " said sigrid krebs , spokeswoman for the city 's carnival committee . krebs said there would be satirical floats in the rosenmontag parade on carnival monday , one of the highlights of the " fifth season . " " but they have never been aimed at harming or offending people nor will they in the future , " krebs said . düsseldorf wants to avoid religious provocation just 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- further north , in düsseldorf , political and religious critique have been much more common in the past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this float had the motto " fostering tradition " last year , a float showed cardinal meisner striking a match to a woman tied to the stake , the words " i had an abortion " written on her .
in 2003 , the düsseldorf procession showed angela merkel , today 's chancellor , coming out of uncle sam 's behind - a statement on her support for the us invasion of iraq . bernd jost , spokesman for the düsseldorf carnival committee , said there would not be any floats dealing with religion this year . " in view of the current debate , we will be keeping very clear of things related to muslims , " jost said .
" we do n't want to fuel hatred . " according to jost , the well-being of the parade spectators was the top priority for the committee . the cartoon controversy is also not an issue on the agenda in the third carnival stronghold , mainz .
local and national issues are more a priority in the city 's rosenmontag parade . turning the world on its head karneval has its origins in the middle ages and is traditionally a roman catholic celebration .
it is closely associated with easter , as it always ends on ash wednesday , marking the beginning of lent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a so-called mullahburger , shown in düsseldorf last year , does not reflect carnival tradition parody and mockery are part of its tradition , said matthias von der bank , a historian from cologne 's carnival museum . " but it was n't satire like we have today , " von der bank said . " in the middle ages , carnival was a festival of reverse worlds and a playful expression of this , " von der bank said .
" so christian symbols , for example , were turned upside down . " but , he added , slandering the church was and is not part of carnival 's festivities . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : young carnival prince is also integration success story this year , the town of wesseling has dubbed a tunisian boy its traditional carnival prince .

but few people know that two-thirds of them went to army-sponsored athletes . the german army spends 25 million euros -lrb- $ 30 million -rrb- per year on sports training and it certainly seems to be getting its money 's worth . when sylke otto , silke kraushaar and tatjana hüfner won gold , silver and bronze in the luge competition last week , the victory was theirs - and the german army 's . ditto for kati wilhelm , who took a gold in biathlon -lrb- cross-country skiing and target shooting -rrb- , andre lang , who won a gold medal in the two-man bobsled , and the women 's cross-country ski team , which got a silver medal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kati wilhelm got gold for biathlon all of these athletes were competing for germany - but also for the german army , or bundeswehr .
they are all soldiers in the athletics-training department of the army where they prepared for the turin games . ' just one responsibility : training ' a total of 72 bundeswehr athletes are competing in turin .
that 's nearly half of germany 's 161-person team .
petty officer uwe witte , a trainer in the german army 's athletics-training division in the town of warendorf said there 's a reason why the bundeswehr program is so successful . " all their -lrb- the athletes ' -rrb- other responsibilities - school , family , household - disappear . here they can concentrate entirely on their sport .
of course , if you look at their schedule , there is not a lot of extra time to take care of other things . " the army has 22 sports-training departments across germany .
altogether , they support 744 athletes in 70 different sports .
such specialized athletics departments arose out of a decision the german parliament made in 1968 to promote sports in the country and to primarily rope in the army for that purpose . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luge slider sylke otto won a gold medal in turin georg remmert , who is temporarily in charge of the warendorf athletics-training department , said the training programs work both ways . " we are mostly here for the people who ca n't finance their training themselves .
in other words , the army is a kind of social net , " he said .
" it gives the athletes the security to be able to pursue their sport to such a degree of excellence .
in turn it shows the bundeswehr and germany in a good light internationally . " but only those who are already very accomplished athletes can be sponsored .
all those who have already made it to the national squad in their sport can apply .
in other words , the athletes are already very successful when they they are accepted into the army 's program . they are then assigned a trainer and are also meant to start following a normal soldier 's basic training .
later , they only need to fulfill 30 percent of a soldier 's normal duties ; the other 70 percent of their time is free for athletic training . best for winter sports the system seems to work especially well for winter sport athletes .
of 744 army athletes , only 200 are in winter sports , but they rack up the most successes .
much of that has to do with the popularity of winter sports in germany and particulary in the army .
further , athletes also have good infrastructure and training possibilies for winter olympic sports within germany . on top of that , " there are just fewer nations who do these winter sports , " said uwe witte .
" in turin , 84 countries are competing .
in contrast , there are 200 countries competing in the summer olympics .
-lrb- in summer -rrb- the spectrum of competing athletes is much bigger . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weight training rooms are used by regular soldiers too witte added that the bundeswehr placed great emphasis on supporting young , up-and-coming athletes .
" here , young people are pushed to be top in their field , in contrast to sponsorship by large companies , which is mostly aimed at a few very top athletes , " he said . josef nehren , head of the sports department of the bundeswehr , has high expectations for germany 's success in turin .
in salt lake city , in 2002 , soldiers took 25 of the total 35 medals that went to germany . " that is definitely good publicity .
but for me it is more important that it shows that our system is good , and that it works well when it is used right .
it also shows that money is being used well , " he said . julia spurzem -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : winter olympics in turin the 20th winter olympics kicked off on feb .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 21.02.2006 german carnival steers clear of religious topics großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's carnival float-makers are comfortable with controversy carnival kicks off across germany this week .
traditionally , no topic is sacred during this time .
but the ongoing controversy over caricatures of the prophet mohammed will stay out of the festivities . a carnival skit poking fun at pope benedict xvi has raised a debate on just how far political cabaret can satirize certain topics . the carnival gala stunksitzung plans to show the sketch in which pope benedict xvi as a pop star and the archbishop of cologne , cardinal joachim meisner , as a wannabe pop star lie in a bed together .
the two end up smooching . a private citizen has now pressed charges against the stunksitzung for " disrupting religious peace . "
public television channel wdr , which will broadcast the gala on saturday , has decided to cut out the controversial part .
the station said its policies prescribed respect of religious feelings , which they said would have been hurt if the skit was broadcast . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should satire be allowed to present the pope as a pop star ? winni rau , spokesman for the stunksitzung , said the skit was an interpretation of the pope 's pop star qualities during world youth day , which took place in cologne last summer .
he said he did n't agree with wdr 's decision . " what is satire allowed to do in the western world ? "
rau said .
" we can debate this issue , but not forbid it . " rau said he wished wdr would have had " more courage . "
" i really think it 's a shame , " he said .
" it could have showed that we here in the west can also mock our own culture and religion . " people have to be able to handle satire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rote funken are a popular carnival society the stunksitzung is an alternative to the traditional galas , which mainly take place in the german karneval strongholds cologne , düsseldorf and mainz .
the galas are a regular part of the so-called " fifth season " between its kick-off on nov .
11 and the actual carnival week , which starts on the thursday before ash wednesday .
they include singing and dancing , but also orators , who address various political and societal topics . rau said the stunksitzung considers itself political cabaret . " this satire can and should also be directed against the church or political topics , " rau said .
" in the case of cabaret or satire , people have to be able to take it .
it is part of our culture . " cologne just wants to have fun bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you 'll find more happy than sad clowns in cologne in cologne , though , political and socio-critical issues have never been at the top of the carnival agenda , and they wo n't be this year either . " our philosophy is that carnival should be fun and friendly , " said sigrid krebs , spokeswoman for the city 's carnival committee . krebs said there would be satirical floats in the rosenmontag parade on carnival monday , one of the highlights of the " fifth season . " " but they have never been aimed at harming or offending people nor will they in the future , " krebs said . düsseldorf wants to avoid religious provocation just 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- further north , in düsseldorf , political and religious critique have been much more common in the past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this float had the motto " fostering tradition " last year , a float showed cardinal meisner striking a match to a woman tied to the stake , the words " i had an abortion " written on her .
in 2003 , the düsseldorf procession showed angela merkel , today 's chancellor , coming out of uncle sam 's behind - a statement on her support for the us invasion of iraq . bernd jost , spokesman for the düsseldorf carnival committee , said there would not be any floats dealing with religion this year . " in view of the current debate , we will be keeping very clear of things related to muslims , " jost said .
" we do n't want to fuel hatred . " according to jost , the well-being of the parade spectators was the top priority for the committee . the cartoon controversy is also not an issue on the agenda in the third carnival stronghold , mainz .
local and national issues are more a priority in the city 's rosenmontag parade . turning the world on its head karneval has its origins in the middle ages and is traditionally a roman catholic celebration .
it is closely associated with easter , as it always ends on ash wednesday , marking the beginning of lent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a so-called mullahburger , shown in düsseldorf last year , does not reflect carnival tradition parody and mockery are part of its tradition , said matthias von der bank , a historian from cologne 's carnival museum . " but it was n't satire like we have today , " von der bank said . " in the middle ages , carnival was a festival of reverse worlds and a playful expression of this , " von der bank said .
" so christian symbols , for example , were turned upside down . " but , he added , slandering the church was and is not part of carnival 's festivities . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : young carnival prince is also integration success story this year , the town of wesseling has dubbed a tunisian boy its traditional carnival prince .

the welsh assembly government said it planned training for decision-makers and an improved appeals system with a role for community health councils .

the bbc 's mark duff in milan looks at mr prodi 's uphill struggle to woo voters .
mr prodi has to keep a broad spectrum of interests together a veteran of court battles , silvio berlusconi has chutzpah , charm - a certain charisma .
by contrast mr prodi is rather uninspiring , known as " the professor " - hardly the nickname of an a-list party animal - and not renowned for communication skills .
the professor tag - which dates back to his years teaching economics at bologna university - should , though , be one of mr prodi 's plus points .
the former president of the european commission came to power before as a non-party bureaucrat , respected for his expertise on the economy and industrial policy .
before his government fell to insider bickering , he had been credited with doing a pretty good job - if not perhaps forcefully enough .
with the italian economy currently grumbling along at zero growth , and with italians feeling decidedly poorer than they did in 2001 , all things being equal , that record should stand mr prodi in good stead .
the economic programme he has outlined for a centre-left government has won qualified approval from several respected commentators .
he has committed himself to cut unit labour costs , slim down the country 's overweight bureaucracy , increase competition and gradually reduce the budget deficit .
there is , though , no word on reforming the unions , the professions or the public sector .
' walking tightrope ' and there is the rub .
mr prodi simply could not afford to alienate the vested interests within his own alliance by including those elements .
mr berlusconi has survived numerous political storms recent opinion polls show the left 's lead starting to look decidedly wobbly and mr berlusconi 's own party - forza italia - making a comeback .
mr prodi 's political weakness is pitiful - especially when compared with his rival for top office .
mr berlusconi was able to steamroller through his action plan for government without bothering about the niceties of consulting his allies on the political right .
mr prodi - by contrast - finds himself walking a tightrope to avoid upsetting his fractious allies , who at times disagree on everything from the environment to the rights of same-sex and unmarried couples .
not for nothing is the new symbol of the leftist coalition , the union , a rainbow .
its members range from a former trotskyite who has argued that it is fair enough for iraqi insurgents to shoot italian troops to catholic centrists who kow-tow to every nod and wink on social policy from the vatican .
mr prodi does not lead his own party - he is the creature of other forces .
prodi 's ' tome ' just look at - or weigh - the programmes offered by the rival camps .
mr berlusconi 's manifesto is short , sharp , to the point : an eight-point plan led by tax cuts - very similar to what he offered last time round .
mr prodi has had to endure months of wrangling to ensure that none of his supporters can take exception to a single comment or comma of his programme for government .
the result : a tome that fills hundreds of pages and is riddled with plenty of ambiguities for mischief-mongers on the right to exploit .
rail row a controversial new high-speed rail link beneath the alps between the northern city of turin and the french city of lyon exemplifies the problems mr prodi faces .
local communities and anti-globalisation protesters want to halt the rail project - as do the greens and the third biggest party in his alliance , the hardline communist refoundation .
others on the left support it .
to avoid unseemly rows , the union 's manifesto drafters made no mention of it - allowing both sides to argue that they had carried the day .
cue a field day for mr berlusconi 's allies - who argued that the left was showing once again that it could not be trusted with government .
mr prodi tried to prevent any further damage by announcing that the project would continue at all costs .
but he will not have needed reminding that it was communist refoundation which orchestrated his fall from power in 1998 .

its members range from a former trotskyite who has argued that it is fair enough for iraqi insurgents to shoot italian troops to catholic centrists who kow-tow to every nod and wink on social policy from the vatican .
mr prodi does not lead his own party - he is the creature of other forces .
prodi 's ' tome ' just look at - or weigh - the programmes offered by the rival camps .
mr berlusconi 's manifesto is short , sharp , to the point : an eight-point plan led by tax cuts - very similar to what he offered last time round .
mr prodi has had to endure months of wrangling to ensure that none of his supporters can take exception to a single comment or comma of his programme for government .
the result : a tome that fills hundreds of pages and is riddled with plenty of ambiguities for mischief-mongers on the right to exploit .
rail row a controversial new high-speed rail link beneath the alps between the northern city of turin and the french city of lyon exemplifies the problems mr prodi faces .
local communities and anti-globalisation protesters want to halt the rail project - as do the greens and the third biggest party in his alliance , the hardline communist refoundation .
others on the left support it .
to avoid unseemly rows , the union 's manifesto drafters made no mention of it - allowing both sides to argue that they had carried the day .
cue a field day for mr berlusconi 's allies - who argued that the left was showing once again that it could not be trusted with government .
mr prodi tried to prevent any further damage by announcing that the project would continue at all costs .
but he will not have needed reminding that it was communist refoundation which orchestrated his fall from power in 1998 .

the country is on maximum alert for a coup plot against mrs arroyo ahead of a key anniversary .
the president told a briefing for foreign correspondents that nothing would force her to resign .
she has been under fire for months , accused of attempting to influence a 2004 poll and poor economic management .
mrs arroyo appealed to military officers to refrain from engineering a coup .
" these adventurists do n't have any justification for what they have been trying to do , " she said .
her comments came as the military recaptured one of the alleged leaders of a failed 2003 coup who escaped last month .
coup plotter lt lawrence san juan was rearrested on tuesday another soldier on the run and facing the same charges was rearrested last month .
two former philippines presidents have been ousted through army-backed " people power " movements - ferdinand marcos in 1986 and joseph estrada in 2001 .
saturday is the 20th anniversary of the marcos ouster , and protests are expected to gather steam approaching the anniversary .
the original protests were named after manila 's epifanio de los santos avenue , or edsa , where the demonstrators gathered .
" the world embraced edsa 1 in 1986 .
the world tolerated edsa 2 in 2001 , " mrs arroyo said on tuesday .
" the world will not forgive an edsa 3 , but instead would condemn the philippines as a country whose political system is hopelessly unstable , and the filipinos as among the finest people in the world but who manage to shoot themselves in the foot , " she said .
last year mrs arroyo survived an attempt to impeach her over allegations that she tried to influence the 2004 presidential poll .
she is also unpopular for introducing a tax hike in a bid to cut debt .
although such protests have been frequent , even the largest anti-arroyo rally has fallen far short of the hundreds of thousands that joined the uprisings that overthrew ferdinand marcos in 1986 and joseph estrada in 2001 .

bbc news -pipe- uk -pipe- england -pipe- north-south split in water levels home news sport radio tv weather languages low graphics -pipe- accessibility help one-minute world news news services your news when you want it news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk england northern ireland scotland wales uk politics education magazine business health science & environment technology entertainment also in the news - video and audio - programmes have your say in pictures country profiles special reports related bbc sites sport weather on this day editors ' blog last updated : tuesday , 21 february 2006 , 08:37 gmt e-mail this to a friend printable version north-south split in water levels by james clarke bbc news , england south east water issued a ' wanted ' poster to ask for help saving water the south east has had such low rainfall over the past year it is dangerously low on water when most of england has no real shortage at all .
the region has had below-average rainfall 14 months in a row , with water companies in kent , sussex and london appointing drought planning teams .
but areas in the north and west have had no such problems .
the environment agency said the contrast was solely down to the regional difference in rainfall levels .
the consumer council for water backed those claims , agreeing that outside of the south east , east anglia and parts of central england there were no real problems .
' driest since 1920s ' last month was the driest january since 1997 across england and wales .
but the general trend since the end of 2004 has been for the south east , east anglia and central southern england to receive far less rain than other parts of the uk .
while the south east has had only about 40 % of its average rainfall over the winter , some regions have had more rain than they would normally expect to get .
drought-hit region needing water lisa beechey , of the environment agency , said : " we are really focusing on the south east .
" the last 15 months have been the driest period since the 1976 drought , but there are some areas where it has been the driest since the 1920s .
" the rest of england and wales has had at least close-to-average rainfall .
if below-average rain continues across the next few months you might see localised problems , but the south east is where the environmental impact is . "
environment agency figures showed in the first week of february most of england and wales received less than 10 % of the average february rainfall .
southern england received about 4 % of the average .
its data also showed the river thames at kingston had flows that were only 28 % of the average for this time of year , with other rivers in the south east also close to their lowest ever recorded levels .
england is quite dry , people think it rains all the time here but it 's a dry country susan adams , consumer council for water ms beechey said as well as the problems caused to the public by the shortage of water , the drought was " definitely impacting on the environment " .
she said : " when the drought finally ends , we could be looking at quite a few years , with at least average rainfall , before things could return to normal .
" if fish populations have been affected , it could take years before numbers get back up .
" for example with the low river levels over winter , the salmon population in the hampshire avon failed to reach their normal spawning area - they were n't able to get to some parts of the river .
images of weir wood reservoir a year apart show how water levels fell " some plants that are used to living in mostly wet environments could die and be replaced by weeds and low river levels usually result in an increase in silt , which can block rivers . "
figures from water supplier mid kent water show people in the south east use about 15 litres of water each per day more than people in the north east , which the water firm thinks is partly due to there being more people living on their own in the south east .
the fact the region is densely populated in comparison with some parts of the country means even more water is used .
leaking pipes susan adams , of the consumer council for water , said : " people do use more water in the south east but it 's down to the weather as well , it 's been very dry in that area .
" england is quite dry , people think it rains all the time here but it 's a dry country . "
but while england may be a dry country , some parts are drier than others .
james perowne , midlands region chairman of the consumer council for water , said : " the west , north west and scotland have had a very wet winter .
the average garden sprinkler uses over 1,000 litres of water an hour " and wales , where birmingham gets its water from , has had more than its fair share of water this winter .
" if people are sensible we wo n't have a problem in the midlands .
" despite having a drier than average winter in the east of the region there really should be no water shortage this summer . "
knowing that water is becoming a scarce resource , water firms , particularly those in the drought-hit south east , are trying to limit the amount wasted .
several firms in the south east imposed hosepipe bans in 2005 , the first in the uk for nine years .
southern water , south east water and mid kent water still have bans in place .
attempts are being made to encourage developers building new homes to take economical water use into account .
and firms have reduced the amount of water lost through leaking pipes .
thames water replaced victorian mains in west brompton in west london with seven miles of new plastic pipes at a cost of £ 5.3m.
it claims the work has saved 1.7m litres of water a day - enough to supply more than 10,500 people - and has reduced the number of burst pipes in nearby houses .

the region has had below-average rainfall 14 months in a row , with water companies in kent , sussex and london appointing drought planning teams .
but areas in the north and west have had no such problems .
the environment agency said the contrast was solely down to the regional difference in rainfall levels .
the consumer council for water backed those claims , agreeing that outside of the south east , east anglia and parts of central england there were no real problems .
' driest since 1920s ' last month was the driest january since 1997 across england and wales .
but the general trend since the end of 2004 has been for the south east , east anglia and central southern england to receive far less rain than other parts of the uk .
while the south east has had only about 40 % of its average rainfall over the winter , some regions have had more rain than they would normally expect to get .
drought-hit region needing water lisa beechey , of the environment agency , said : " we are really focusing on the south east .
" the last 15 months have been the driest period since the 1976 drought , but there are some areas where it has been the driest since the 1920s .
" the rest of england and wales has had at least close-to-average rainfall .
if below-average rain continues across the next few months you might see localised problems , but the south east is where the environmental impact is . "
environment agency figures showed in the first week of february most of england and wales received less than 10 % of the average february rainfall .
southern england received about 4 % of the average .
its data also showed the river thames at kingston had flows that were only 28 % of the average for this time of year , with other rivers in the south east also close to their lowest ever recorded levels .
england is quite dry , people think it rains all the time here but it 's a dry country susan adams , consumer council for water ms beechey said as well as the problems caused to the public by the shortage of water , the drought was " definitely impacting on the environment " .
she said : " when the drought finally ends , we could be looking at quite a few years , with at least average rainfall , before things could return to normal .
" if fish populations have been affected , it could take years before numbers get back up .
" for example with the low river levels over winter , the salmon population in the hampshire avon failed to reach their normal spawning area - they were n't able to get to some parts of the river .
images of weir wood reservoir a year apart show how water levels fell " some plants that are used to living in mostly wet environments could die and be replaced by weeds and low river levels usually result in an increase in silt , which can block rivers . "
figures from water supplier mid kent water show people in the south east use about 15 litres of water each per day more than people in the north east , which the water firm thinks is partly due to there being more people living on their own in the south east .
the fact the region is densely populated in comparison with some parts of the country means even more water is used .
leaking pipes susan adams , of the consumer council for water , said : " people do use more water in the south east but it 's down to the weather as well , it 's been very dry in that area .
" england is quite dry , people think it rains all the time here but it 's a dry country . "
but while england may be a dry country , some parts are drier than others .
james perowne , midlands region chairman of the consumer council for water , said : " the west , north west and scotland have had a very wet winter .
the average garden sprinkler uses over 1,000 litres of water an hour " and wales , where birmingham gets its water from , has had more than its fair share of water this winter .
" if people are sensible we wo n't have a problem in the midlands .
" despite having a drier than average winter in the east of the region there really should be no water shortage this summer . "
knowing that water is becoming a scarce resource , water firms , particularly those in the drought-hit south east , are trying to limit the amount wasted .
several firms in the south east imposed hosepipe bans in 2005 , the first in the uk for nine years .
southern water , south east water and mid kent water still have bans in place .
attempts are being made to encourage developers building new homes to take economical water use into account .

the region has had below-average rainfall 14 months in a row , with water companies in kent , sussex and london appointing drought planning teams .
but areas in the north and west have had no such problems .
the environment agency said the contrast was solely down to the regional difference in rainfall levels .
the consumer council for water backed those claims , agreeing that outside of the south east , east anglia and parts of central england there were no real problems .
' driest since 1920s ' last month was the driest january since 1997 across england and wales .
but the general trend since the end of 2004 has been for the south east , east anglia and central southern england to receive far less rain than other parts of the uk .
while the south east has had only about 40 % of its average rainfall over the winter , some regions have had more rain than they would normally expect to get .
drought-hit region needing water lisa beechey , of the environment agency , said : " we are really focusing on the south east .
" the last 15 months have been the driest period since the 1976 drought , but there are some areas where it has been the driest since the 1920s .
" the rest of england and wales has had at least close-to-average rainfall .
if below-average rain continues across the next few months you might see localised problems , but the south east is where the environmental impact is . "
environment agency figures showed in the first week of february most of england and wales received less than 10 % of the average february rainfall .
southern england received about 4 % of the average .
its data also showed the river thames at kingston had flows that were only 28 % of the average for this time of year , with other rivers in the south east also close to their lowest ever recorded levels .
england is quite dry , people think it rains all the time here but it 's a dry country susan adams , consumer council for water ms beechey said as well as the problems caused to the public by the shortage of water , the drought was " definitely impacting on the environment " .
she said : " when the drought finally ends , we could be looking at quite a few years , with at least average rainfall , before things could return to normal .
" if fish populations have been affected , it could take years before numbers get back up .
" for example with the low river levels over winter , the salmon population in the hampshire avon failed to reach their normal spawning area - they were n't able to get to some parts of the river .
images of weir wood reservoir a year apart show how water levels fell " some plants that are used to living in mostly wet environments could die and be replaced by weeds and low river levels usually result in an increase in silt , which can block rivers . "
figures from water supplier mid kent water show people in the south east use about 15 litres of water each per day more than people in the north east , which the water firm thinks is partly due to there being more people living on their own in the south east .
the fact the region is densely populated in comparison with some parts of the country means even more water is used .
leaking pipes susan adams , of the consumer council for water , said : " people do use more water in the south east but it 's down to the weather as well , it 's been very dry in that area .
" england is quite dry , people think it rains all the time here but it 's a dry country . "
but while england may be a dry country , some parts are drier than others .
james perowne , midlands region chairman of the consumer council for water , said : " the west , north west and scotland have had a very wet winter .
the average garden sprinkler uses over 1,000 litres of water an hour " and wales , where birmingham gets its water from , has had more than its fair share of water this winter .
" if people are sensible we wo n't have a problem in the midlands .
" despite having a drier than average winter in the east of the region there really should be no water shortage this summer . "
knowing that water is becoming a scarce resource , water firms , particularly those in the drought-hit south east , are trying to limit the amount wasted .
several firms in the south east imposed hosepipe bans in 2005 , the first in the uk for nine years .
southern water , south east water and mid kent water still have bans in place .
attempts are being made to encourage developers building new homes to take economical water use into account .
and firms have reduced the amount of water lost through leaking pipes .
thames water replaced victorian mains in west brompton in west london with seven miles of new plastic pipes at a cost of £ 5.3m.
it claims the work has saved 1.7m litres of water a day - enough to supply more than 10,500 people - and has reduced the number of burst pipes in nearby houses .

the consumer council for water backed those claims , agreeing that outside of the south east , east anglia and parts of central england there were no real problems .
' driest since 1920s ' last month was the driest january since 1997 across england and wales .
but the general trend since the end of 2004 has been for the south east , east anglia and central southern england to receive far less rain than other parts of the uk .
while the south east has had only about 40 % of its average rainfall over the winter , some regions have had more rain than they would normally expect to get .
drought-hit region needing water lisa beechey , of the environment agency , said : " we are really focusing on the south east .
" the last 15 months have been the driest period since the 1976 drought , but there are some areas where it has been the driest since the 1920s .
" the rest of england and wales has had at least close-to-average rainfall .
if below-average rain continues across the next few months you might see localised problems , but the south east is where the environmental impact is . "
environment agency figures showed in the first week of february most of england and wales received less than 10 % of the average february rainfall .
southern england received about 4 % of the average .
its data also showed the river thames at kingston had flows that were only 28 % of the average for this time of year , with other rivers in the south east also close to their lowest ever recorded levels . "
england is quite dry , people think it rains all the time here but it 's a dry country " susan adams , consumer council for water ms beechey said as well as the problems caused to the public by the shortage of water , the drought was " definitely impacting on the environment " .
she said : " when the drought finally ends , we could be looking at quite a few years , with at least average rainfall , before things could return to normal .
" if fish populations have been affected , it could take years before numbers get back up .
" for example with the low river levels over winter , the salmon population in the hampshire avon failed to reach their normal spawning area - they were n't able to get to some parts of the river .
" some plants that are used to living in mostly wet environments could die and be replaced by weeds and low river levels usually result in an increase in silt , which can block rivers . "
figures from water supplier mid kent water show people in the south east use about 15 litres of water each per day more than people in the north east , which the water firm thinks is partly due to there being more people living on their own in the south east .
the fact the region is densely populated in comparison with some parts of the country means even more water is used .
leaking pipes susan adams , of the consumer council for water , said : " people do use more water in the south east but it 's down to the weather as well , it 's been very dry in that area .
" england is quite dry , people think it rains all the time here but it 's a dry country . "
but while england may be a dry country , some parts are drier than others .
james perowne , midlands region chairman of the consumer council for water , said : " the west , north west and scotland have had a very wet winter .
" and wales , where birmingham gets its water from , has had more than its fair share of water this winter .
" if people are sensible we wo n't have a problem in the midlands .
" despite having a drier than average winter in the east of the region there really should be no water shortage this summer . "
knowing that water is becoming a scarce resource , water firms , particularly those in the drought-hit south east , are trying to limit the amount wasted .
several firms in the south east imposed hosepipe bans in 2005 , the first in the uk for nine years .
southern water , south east water and mid kent water still have bans in place .
attempts are being made to encourage developers building new homes to take economical water use into account .
and firms have reduced the amount of water lost through leaking pipes .
thames water replaced victorian mains in west brompton in west london with seven miles of new plastic pipes at a cost of £ 5.3m.
it claims the work has saved 1.7m litres of water a day - enough to supply more than 10,500 people - and has reduced the number of burst pipes in nearby houses .

reservoirs which would normally be more than 90 % full in february are standing less than 40 % full after more than a year of drought conditions .
rainfall for january in the south east was about 25 % of the average level .
customers in some parts of sussex and kent have already been told they will face a hosepipe ban all this year .
peter midgley , the environment agency 's regional planning manager for the south east , said : " we are in a major drought . "
this year is going to be hard , this is the second consecutive dry winter and that means resources will be stretched " meyrick gough , southern water north-south split in water levels " too many of us are still behaving as though water is unlimited and cheap . "
figures from mid kent water show people in the south east use an average of between 160 and 170 litres of water each per day , about 15 litres per head per day more than the north east .
mid kent water 's asset director paul seeley said : " one of the major factors that affects that is the number of people per house in the south east .
there are far more properties with fewer people living in them . "
water companies across the south east are trying to convince their customers to cut down on their use of water .
hosepipe bans are already in force or almost certain to be brought in later this year , while restrictions on non-essential water use , such as for jet washes or to water sports pitches , could be introduced .
how full are the south east 's reservoirs ?
ardingly - 73 % , normal february level - 100 % arlington - 96 % , normal february level - 100 % bewl water - 37 % , normal february level - 92 % darwell - 68 % , normal february level - 87 % powdermill - 80 % , normal february level - 90 % weir wood - 36 % , normal february level - 93 % sources : southern water and south east water , february 2006 several firms are urging customers to have meters installed , hoping that charging according to how much water is used will prompt people to waste less water .
but the campaign to protect rural england has criticised some water suppliers for failing to address rising demand and the impact of climate change .
meyrick gough , water planning and strategy manager for southern water , which serves 2.2m people in kent and sussex , said the drought in the area started in november 2004 .
he said : " before then the rainfall deficits were really about the average , but since then we 've gone through 15 months when only three have been about average . "
bewl water , southern water 's largest reservoir , is 37 % full , when the firm would expect it to be 92 % full in a normal february .
thames levels low despite heavier rainfall in recent days , other reservoirs are also well below average capacity and low levels in the river medway have made it harder than usual to top them up .
mr gough said : " this year is going to be hard , this is the second consecutive dry winter and that means resources will be stretched . "
folkestone and dover water , a smaller firm which supplies about 160,000 people in kent , has become the first company in the country to apply for water scarcity status .
it has had to prove it has exhausted all additional avenues for water sourcing , has done what it can to meet customer demand and will have problems with water resources for the next 10 years .
if the status is granted by the government - a decision is expected by march - the company would be allowed to impose compulsory charging by meter .
managing director david walton said : " a reservoir would be great but it would have to be so far from our operating area that metering becomes a more cost-effective option . "
south east water is also having problems with resources .
the area it covers is split into two sections , with the largest reservoir in its southern region , at ardingly in west sussex , only 73 % full at a time of year it would normally expect it to be full to capacity .
the firm 's northern region - covering parts of hampshire and surrey - gets its water from the river thames but spokesman james grindell said the flow from the thames is only at about 25 % of the normal level .
mr grindell said south east water had produced an extra 35m litres a day since 1997 , mainly through stopping leaks .
the company is also looking into the feasibility of opening a new reservoir by 2010 .
water companies in the south east fear problems with shortages may get worse when plans to build thousands of new homes in the region are carried out , fears echoed by various environmental groups and councils .
the south east county leaders group , made up of leaders of seven county councils in the region , has said the house building plans will leave millions of families facing regular water shortages .
the plans , announced by deputy prime minister john prescott in 2003 , could see more than half a million new homes built in the south east by 2026 .
mid kent water and kent county council have combined to develop the kent design code , which will see developers hoping to get contracts to build some of the county 's new homes asked to prove their projects are designed to efficiently use water in areas such as showers and drainage systems .
but it is not clear yet how many local councils , the authorities which grant planning permission , will use the code .

reservoirs which would normally be more than 90 % full in february are standing less than 40 % full after more than a year of drought conditions .
rainfall for january in the south east was about 25 % of the average level .
customers in some parts of sussex and kent have already been told they will face a hosepipe ban all this year .
peter midgley , the environment agency 's regional planning manager for the south east , said : " we are in a major drought .
this year is going to be hard , this is the second consecutive dry winter and that means resources will be stretched meyrick gough , southern water north-south split in water levels " too many of us are still behaving as though water is unlimited and cheap . "
figures from mid kent water show people in the south east use an average of between 160 and 170 litres of water each per day , about 15 litres per head per day more than the north east .
mid kent water 's asset director paul seeley said : " one of the major factors that affects that is the number of people per house in the south east .
there are far more properties with fewer people living in them . "
water companies across the south east are trying to convince their customers to cut down on their use of water .
hosepipe bans are already in force or almost certain to be brought in later this year , while restrictions on non-essential water use , such as for jet washes or to water sports pitches , could be introduced .
how full are the south east 's reservoirs ?
ardingly - 73 % , normal february level - 100 % arlington - 96 % , normal february level - 100 % bewl water - 37 % , normal february level - 92 % darwell - 68 % , normal february level - 87 % powdermill - 80 % , normal february level - 90 % weir wood - 36 % , normal february level - 93 % sources : southern water and south east water , february 2006 several firms are urging customers to have meters installed , hoping that charging according to how much water is used will prompt people to waste less water .
but the campaign to protect rural england has criticised some water suppliers for failing to address rising demand and the impact of climate change .
meyrick gough , water planning and strategy manager for southern water , which serves 2.2m people in kent and sussex , said the drought in the area started in november 2004 .
he said : " before then the rainfall deficits were really about the average , but since then we 've gone through 15 months when only three have been about average . "
bewl water , southern water 's largest reservoir , is 37 % full , when the firm would expect it to be 92 % full in a normal february .
thames levels low despite heavier rainfall in recent days , other reservoirs are also well below average capacity and low levels in the river medway have made it harder than usual to top them up .
mr gough said : " this year is going to be hard , this is the second consecutive dry winter and that means resources will be stretched . "
weir wood reservoir near east grinstead was 36 % full in february folkestone and dover water , a smaller firm which supplies about 160,000 people in kent , has become the first company in the country to apply for water scarcity status .
it has had to prove it has exhausted all additional avenues for water sourcing , has done what it can to meet customer demand and will have problems with water resources for the next 10 years .
if the status is granted by the government - a decision is expected by march - the company would be allowed to impose compulsory charging by meter .
managing director david walton said : " a reservoir would be great but it would have to be so far from our operating area that metering becomes a more cost-effective option . "
south east water is also having problems with resources .
the area it covers is split into two sections , with the largest reservoir in its southern region , at ardingly in west sussex , only 73 % full at a time of year it would normally expect it to be full to capacity .
the firm 's northern region - covering parts of hampshire and surrey - gets its water from the river thames but spokesman james grindell said the flow from the thames is only at about 25 % of the normal level .
water levels are also well below average in the river medway in kent mr grindell said south east water had produced an extra 35m litres a day since 1997 , mainly through stopping leaks .
the company is also looking into the feasibility of opening a new reservoir by 2010 .
water companies in the south east fear problems with shortages may get worse when plans to build thousands of new homes in the region are carried out , fears echoed by various environmental groups and councils .
the south east county leaders group , made up of leaders of seven county councils in the region , has said the house building plans will leave millions of families facing regular water shortages .
the plans , announced by deputy prime minister john prescott in 2003 , could see more than half a million new homes built in the south east by 2026 .

weir wood reservoir near east grinstead was 36 % full in february folkestone and dover water , a smaller firm which supplies about 160,000 people in kent , has become the first company in the country to apply for water scarcity status .
it has had to prove it has exhausted all additional avenues for water sourcing , has done what it can to meet customer demand and will have problems with water resources for the next 10 years .
if the status is granted by the government - a decision is expected by march - the company would be allowed to impose compulsory charging by meter .
managing director david walton said : " a reservoir would be great but it would have to be so far from our operating area that metering becomes a more cost-effective option . "
south east water is also having problems with resources .
the area it covers is split into two sections , with the largest reservoir in its southern region , at ardingly in west sussex , only 73 % full at a time of year it would normally expect it to be full to capacity .
the firm 's northern region - covering parts of hampshire and surrey - gets its water from the river thames but spokesman james grindell said the flow from the thames is only at about 25 % of the normal level .
water levels are also well below average in the river medway in kent mr grindell said south east water had produced an extra 35m litres a day since 1997 , mainly through stopping leaks .
the company is also looking into the feasibility of opening a new reservoir by 2010 .
water companies in the south east fear problems with shortages may get worse when plans to build thousands of new homes in the region are carried out , fears echoed by various environmental groups and councils .
the south east county leaders group , made up of leaders of seven county councils in the region , has said the house building plans will leave millions of families facing regular water shortages .
the plans , announced by deputy prime minister john prescott in 2003 , could see more than half a million new homes built in the south east by 2026 .
mid kent water and kent county council have combined to develop the kent design code , which will see developers hoping to get contracts to build some of the county 's new homes asked to prove their projects are designed to efficiently use water in areas such as showers and drainage systems .
but it is not clear yet how many local councils , the authorities which grant planning permission , will use the code .

reservoirs which would normally be more than 90 % full in february are standing less than 40 % full after more than a year of drought conditions .
rainfall for january in the south east was about 25 % of the average level .
customers in some parts of sussex and kent have already been told they will face a hosepipe ban all this year .
peter midgley , the environment agency 's regional planning manager for the south east , said : " we are in a major drought .
this year is going to be hard , this is the second consecutive dry winter and that means resources will be stretched meyrick gough , southern water north-south split in water levels " too many of us are still behaving as though water is unlimited and cheap . "
figures from mid kent water show people in the south east use an average of between 160 and 170 litres of water each per day , about 15 litres per head per day more than the north east .
mid kent water 's asset director paul seeley said : " one of the major factors that affects that is the number of people per house in the south east .
there are far more properties with fewer people living in them . "
water companies across the south east are trying to convince their customers to cut down on their use of water .
hosepipe bans are already in force or almost certain to be brought in later this year , while restrictions on non-essential water use , such as for jet washes or to water sports pitches , could be introduced .

meyrick gough , water planning and strategy manager for southern water , which serves 2.2m people in kent and sussex , said the drought in the area started in november 2004 .
he said : " before then the rainfall deficits were really about the average , but since then we 've gone through 15 months when only three have been about average . "

the royal ballet school described tilly as ' an inspiration ' the frame , in its final stages of testing before being handed over to a delighted tilly , is just the latest in a long line of innovative and inclusive products to come from demand - short for design and manufacture for disability .
based in an old chapel just outside watford in hertfordshire , demand was set up by lady renton in 1980 after she was unable to find a chair in which her disabled daughter could sit comfortably .
" we have an interesting dilemma , " explains demand director andy mcbeath .
" we dare n't advertise because otherwise we would be inundated and would n't have the capacity to manage it . "
as a result , few people beyond the professionals working in adaptive technology have little idea that such a bespoke and commercially uneconomical service exists .
" 80 % of the things we design and manufacture are for every day needs - things that make life more bearable or more comfortable , " said mr mcbeath .
" the other 20 % falls into a category called ' opportunity ' - providing the chance to take part in leisure activities or sporting competitions where the person would n't normally be able to participate at all , but for specially adapted sports or leisure equipment . "
form and function as well as designing and making the ballet frame for tilly griffiths , demand has produced state of the art skiing frames to enable people with little or no lower-body mobility to experience the thrill of the slopes .
another of the charity 's innovations is equipment for playing the game of boccia , a sort of bowls for wheelchair users .
the vast majority of our work is with individuals .
the vast majority of those individuals are in no position to pay andy mcbeath , demand in pictures : innovation on demand and thanks to the ingenuity of the design and manufacturing teams , disabled children have been able to take part in the green power challenge , an endurance race for battery-powered cars .
demand has developed a vehicle that can be operated using hand controls , and into which the driver can be lifted using a hoist .
according to mr mcbeath , demand 's approach places as much emphasis on design as it does on functionality .
" it does n't just have to do what it 's go to do , but it 's got to look good as well . "
he attributes the organisation 's success in this field to selecting students from a design background where there is a strong emphasis on aesthetics .
in the case of the skiing frames , some plastic parts were made in kawasaki green and day-glo orange .
the result was that it was n't just disabled children who wanted to use it .
everyone on the skiing trip wanted to have a go .
" what we try to do is to produce something that is at least production standard , " said mr mcbeath .
" at best , something that 's outrageous , funky and which people are drawn towards . "
cost considerations demand operates in a niche that is completely uneconomical .
the cost of producing tailor-made items for individuals would not be commercially viable .
the boccia ramp can be adjusted according to the shot required yet individuals who approach the charity for help pay nothing for the end product .
the cost of commissions undertaken with another charity partner are split 50-50 , while work undertaken for commercial or government bodies is charged at the full cost .
" the vast majority of our work is with individuals , " explained mr mcbeath .
" the vast majority of those individuals are in no position to pay . "
designer jennifer cox started work on tilly 's ballet frame as soon as she joined demand from brunel university .
she says the main consideration was to come up with something that would blend in with tilly 's surroundings .
" it had to be nice and pale pink , " she said .
" the one she has at the moment is quite clunky and angular .
the new one is all smooth , has rounded corners , the metal tubing is thinner and the wheels are smaller . "
demand made an exception in tilly 's case .
they normally operate within a 100 mile radius of their hertfordshire base , although a similar operation is now planned for yorkshire .
" it was such an interesting challenge that they felt they were in a position to lend a hand , " said tilly 's mother , jackie griffiths .
with limited resources and a potentially huge need for its services , andy mcbeath says demand has had to learn to be ruthless .
" you can help more people if you 're more effective with your time . "

designer jennifer cox started work on tilly 's ballet frame as soon as she joined demand from brunel university .
she says the main consideration was to come up with something that would blend in with tilly 's surroundings .
" it had to be nice and pale pink , " she said .
" the one she has at the moment is quite clunky and angular .
the new one is all smooth , has rounded corners , the metal tubing is thinner and the wheels are smaller . "
demand made an exception in tilly 's case .
they normally operate within a 100 mile radius of their hertfordshire base , although a similar operation is now planned for yorkshire .

the royal ballet school described tilly as ' an inspiration ' the frame , in its final stages of testing before being handed over to a delighted tilly , is just the latest in a long line of innovative and inclusive products to come from demand - short for design and manufacture for disability .
based in an old chapel just outside watford in hertfordshire , demand was set up by lady renton in 1980 after she was unable to find a chair in which her disabled daughter could sit comfortably .
" we have an interesting dilemma , " explains demand director andy mcbeath .
" we dare n't advertise because otherwise we would be inundated and would n't have the capacity to manage it . "
as a result , few people beyond the professionals working in adaptive technology have little idea that such a bespoke and commercially uneconomical service exists .
" 80 % of the things we design and manufacture are for every day needs - things that make life more bearable or more comfortable , " said mr mcbeath .
" the other 20 % falls into a category called ' opportunity ' - providing the chance to take part in leisure activities or sporting competitions where the person would n't normally be able to participate at all , but for specially adapted sports or leisure equipment . "
form and function as well as designing and making the ballet frame for tilly griffiths , demand has produced state of the art skiing frames to enable people with little or no lower-body mobility to experience the thrill of the slopes .
another of the charity 's innovations is equipment for playing the game of boccia , a sort of bowls for wheelchair users .
the vast majority of our work is with individuals .
the vast majority of those individuals are in no position to pay andy mcbeath , demand in pictures : innovation on demand and thanks to the ingenuity of the design and manufacturing teams , disabled children have been able to take part in the green power challenge , an endurance race for battery-powered cars .
demand has developed a vehicle that can be operated using hand controls , and into which the driver can be lifted using a hoist .
according to mr mcbeath , demand 's approach places as much emphasis on design as it does on functionality .
" it does n't just have to do what it 's go to do , but it 's got to look good as well . "
he attributes the organisation 's success in this field to selecting students from a design background where there is a strong emphasis on aesthetics .
in the case of the skiing frames , some plastic parts were made in kawasaki green and day-glo orange .
the result was that it was n't just disabled children who wanted to use it .
everyone on the skiing trip wanted to have a go .
" what we try to do is to produce something that is at least production standard , " said mr mcbeath .
" at best , something that 's outrageous , funky and which people are drawn towards . "
cost considerations demand operates in a niche that is completely uneconomical .
the cost of producing tailor-made items for individuals would not be commercially viable .

the frame , in its final stages of testing before being handed over to a delighted tilly , is just the latest in a long line of innovative and inclusive products to come from demand - short for design and manufacture for disability .
based in an old chapel just outside watford in hertfordshire , demand was set up by lady renton in 1980 after she was unable to find a chair in which her disabled daughter could sit comfortably .
" we have an interesting dilemma , " explains demand director andy mcbeath .
" we dare n't advertise because otherwise we would be inundated and would n't have the capacity to manage it . "
as a result , few people beyond the professionals working in adaptive technology have little idea that such a bespoke and commercially uneconomical service exists .
" 80 % of the things we design and manufacture are for every day needs - things that make life more bearable or more comfortable , " said mr mcbeath .
" the other 20 % falls into a category called ' opportunity ' - providing the chance to take part in leisure activities or sporting competitions where the person would n't normally be able to participate at all , but for specially adapted sports or leisure equipment . "
form and function as well as designing and making the ballet frame for tilly griffiths , demand has produced state of the art skiing frames to enable people with little or no lower-body mobility to experience the thrill of the slopes .
another of the charity 's innovations is equipment for playing the game of boccia , a sort of bowls for wheelchair users . "
the vast majority of our work is with individuals .
the vast majority of those individuals are in no position to pay " andy mcbeath , demand in pictures : innovation on demand and thanks to the ingenuity of the design and manufacturing teams , disabled children have been able to take part in the green power challenge , an endurance race for battery-powered cars .
demand has developed a vehicle that can be operated using hand controls , and into which the driver can be lifted using a hoist .
according to mr mcbeath , demand 's approach places as much emphasis on design as it does on functionality .
" it does n't just have to do what it 's go to do , but it 's got to look good as well . "
he attributes the organisation 's success in this field to selecting students from a design background where there is a strong emphasis on aesthetics .
in the case of the skiing frames , some plastic parts were made in kawasaki green and day-glo orange .
the result was that it was n't just disabled children who wanted to use it .
