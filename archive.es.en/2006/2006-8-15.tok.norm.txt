with less than a day remaining , residents of delmenhorst near bremen are waiting with bated breath to see if efforts to raise the 3.4 million euros -lrb- $ 4.2 million -rrb- to buy a local hotel have been successful .
otherwise , the now empty hotel am stadtpark will become the property of a neo-nazi group .
in the past week , the ticker on the web site www.fuer-delmenhorst.de detailing donations has steadily risen .
as of tuesday afternoon , it reached 679,486 euros .
still , even with a matching town donation of 2 million euros , delmenhorst is coming up short .
but townsfolk said they remain hopeful .
" every euro makes a difference , " mayor carsten schwettmann said in a statement .
" it is a sign of the solidarity and commitment of the town . "
" nein " to neo-nazis the initiative began after hamburg lawyer jürgen rieger made an offer to buy the hotel , which is prominently situated across from the town hall in the center of the town .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 100-room hotel am stadtpark is at the center of the controversy rieger made an offer for the building on behalf of the wilhelm tietjen foundation for fertilization ltd , a mysterious group registered in london that promotes racial purity .
the organization is named for a rich nazi from bremen who died childless in 2002 .
the lawyer , who has defended a number of neo-nazis including holocaust denier ernst zündel and is known for speaking at neo-nazi rallies honoring hitler 's deputy rudolf hess , reportedly aims to transform the hotel into a neo-nazi center for research and conferences .
rieger , who owns property in hamburg , thuringia , a former german military building in dörverden near bremen as well as in sweden , has not said publicly why he wants to buy the hotel in the lower saxony town of fewer than 80,000 people .
he was unavailable for comment .
fighting fire with fire town officials said there is little they can do to prevent the sale other than offer the 2 million euros from their already-stretched budget , adding that their efforts to convince property owner günter mergel not to sell to rieger have been unsuccessful .
" we can not stop the current owner from selling to whomever he wants , " schwettmann told reporters .
" but i am proud of the solidarity the townspeople have shown in the past days . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lawyer jürgen rieger is well-known for his neo-nazi activities mergel , who told focus magazine that the empty 100-room hotel is bleeding him dry financially , said he has no choice : " i am up to my neck in hot water . "
" a crazy idea " as a result , locals took the burden into their own hands .
they have staged protests , held fundraisers such as " barbeques against the right " and rallies featuring rock music .
they have created petitions and weblogs and planned exhibitions .
more than 3,000 people from the town and around germany have donated to delmenhorst 's cause via a web page that launched on aug .
4 .
" it might be a crazy idea , " said town resident günter feith , a 58-year-old architect and founder of the initiative .
" but we are doing it anyway .
we have to . "
feith said at first , there were doubts about the chance of successfully derailing the sale .
but now , as thousands of euros pour in , those doubts are dissipating .
" we have a good chance of succeeding , " he said .
" besides , i do n't want to think about what happens if we do n't .

but this is exactly what happened in the case of the greatest dramatist of the 20th century , bertolt brecht . ahead of 50th anniversary of brecht 's death , the academy of the arts in berlin and its brecht archive announced that brecht 's manuscripts , which were discovered in switzerland several years ago , have been added to the archive 's collection .
this is the largest expansion of the internationally renowned archive since its founding in 1956 .
the archive is used by approximately 240 researchers every year . previously , it was believed that no new materials could be added to the archive of the most performed german dramatist in the world .
but new brecht materials include brecht 's and other author 's manuscripts , his notebooks , contracts , documents , passports , check books , bills and letters that he wrote or received . all of these , brecht left with his friend , union leader and graphic artist , victor .
n. cohen in 1949 in goldbach on the lake of zurich .
brecht , 51 at the time , was living in switzerland - after years of exile in scandinavia and the united states - and preparing for his return to east berlin .
cohen was a left-inclined social democrat who wrote articles for union newspapers and rand social democratic campaigns and referendums .
he died in 1975 . but it was not until the late 1990s that cohen 's sons actually became aware of the valuable collection . it 's all brecht ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht 's finnish passport " they had to empty a warehouse , because their contract had expired , " said erdmut wizisla of the brecht archive .
" and victor 's stuff was there .
when they opened it , they thought : good god !
this is all brecht !
and then they went on to the next box and found again - all brecht . " the negotiations with the owners lasted eight years .
they were completed successfully because the deutsche klassenlotterie foundation , the german research foundation and the academy of the arts agreed to jointly finance the purchase : 2,500 sheets of paper , which correspond to one fifth of brecht 's overall archival materials , and a typewriter now make up the victor n. cohen collection at the brecht archive . brecht 's wife helena weigel , who meticulously collected brecht 's unpublished writings after his death , seems to have completely forgotten about the materials which were left in switzerland .
brecht himself obviously did n't miss these materials after he returned to germany .
they document above all the time he spent in switzerland , but also shed some light on his exile years in the united states and , to a lesser extent , his earlier periods . new and spectacular bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht left the us in 1947 after testifying before the committee on un-american activities in washington , dc the swiss materials include two previously unknown drafts of the play " the caucasian chalk circle , " several short stories , an idea for a novel as well as political and theatrical essays .
among them is a prose text " my unforgettable character , " in which brecht , similar to what he did in the play the " the resistible rise of arturo ui , " makes a caricature out of hitler . the manuscripts also show that , while in the states , brecht was involved with the council for a democratic germany .
this association of german emigrants was founded in 1944 in response to the national committee free germany , which was based in the soviet union .
brecht composed opinions and letters , in which he urged prominent germans - such as writer alfred döblin - to become engaged .
the council was a temporary coalition which already during the war supported the idea of a unified germany with the possibility of a sovereign inner and foreign policy . theater plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht and his wife helene weigel are buried in berlin the materials also show the enthusiasm with which brecht was preparing for his work in the theater in post-war germany .
he corresponded with his friends and colleagues in germany , directors , actors and german as well as russian cultural officials .
he wanted to adapt all his plays in view of the end of the war .
" arturo ui " was the only play that brecht believed - because of its genre as a farce - as fitting for the stage confrontation with the nazi rule . despite the fact that brecht 's exile years were difficult and marked by lack of success , the 350 letters in the collection paint a picture of a self-confident and self-assertive poet . publications based on the new materials have already been announced .
in addition to brecht 's letters to helena weigel from 1923 to 1956 , german publishing house suhrkamp is also planning to publish a 150-page-long appendix to werner hecht 's 1997 chronicle , which documented brecht 's life from day to day . hecht sees a number of exciting challenges for brecht researchers . " it is , of course , peculiar that brecht was caught in the interpretation struggle between the east and the west , " hecht said .

but this is exactly what happened in the case of the greatest dramatist of the 20th century , bertolt brecht . ahead of 50th anniversary of brecht 's death , the academy of the arts in berlin and its brecht archive announced that brecht 's manuscripts , which were discovered in switzerland several years ago , have been added to the archive 's collection .
this is the largest expansion of the internationally renowned archive since its founding in 1956 .
the archive is used by approximately 240 researchers every year . previously , it was believed that no new materials could be added to the archive of the most performed german dramatist in the world .
but new brecht materials include brecht 's and other author 's manuscripts , his notebooks , contracts , documents , passports , check books , bills and letters that he wrote or received . all of these , brecht left with his friend , union leader and graphic artist , victor .
n. cohen in 1949 in goldbach on the lake of zurich .
brecht , 51 at the time , was living in switzerland - after years of exile in scandinavia and the united states - and preparing for his return to east berlin .
cohen was a left-inclined social democrat who wrote articles for union newspapers and rand social democratic campaigns and referendums .
he died in 1975 . but it was not until the late 1990s that cohen 's sons actually became aware of the valuable collection . it 's all brecht ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht 's finnish passport " they had to empty a warehouse , because their contract had expired , " said erdmut wizisla of the brecht archive .
" and victor 's stuff was there .
when they opened it , they thought : good god !
this is all brecht !
and then they went on to the next box and found again - all brecht . " the negotiations with the owners lasted eight years .
they were completed successfully because the deutsche klassenlotterie foundation , the german research foundation and the academy of the arts agreed to jointly finance the purchase : 2,500 sheets of paper , which correspond to one fifth of brecht 's overall archival materials , and a typewriter now make up the victor n. cohen collection at the brecht archive . brecht 's wife helena weigel , who meticulously collected brecht 's unpublished writings after his death , seems to have completely forgotten about the materials which were left in switzerland .
brecht himself obviously did n't miss these materials after he returned to germany .
they document above all the time he spent in switzerland , but also shed some light on his exile years in the united states and , to a lesser extent , his earlier periods . new and spectacular bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht left the us in 1947 after testifying before the committee on un-american activities in washington , dc the swiss materials include two previously unknown drafts of the play " the caucasian chalk circle , " several short stories , an idea for a novel as well as political and theatrical essays .
among them is a prose text " my unforgettable character , " in which brecht , similar to what he did in the play the " the resistible rise of arturo ui , " makes a caricature out of hitler . the manuscripts also show that , while in the states , brecht was involved with the council for a democratic germany .
this association of german emigrants was founded in 1944 in response to the national committee free germany , which was based in the soviet union .
brecht composed opinions and letters , in which he urged prominent germans - such as writer alfred döblin - to become engaged .
the council was a temporary coalition which already during the war supported the idea of a unified germany with the possibility of a sovereign inner and foreign policy . theater plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht and his wife helene weigel are buried in berlin the materials also show the enthusiasm with which brecht was preparing for his work in the theater in post-war germany .
he corresponded with his friends and colleagues in germany , directors , actors and german as well as russian cultural officials .
he wanted to adapt all his plays in view of the end of the war .
" arturo ui " was the only play that brecht believed - because of its genre as a farce - as fitting for the stage confrontation with the nazi rule . despite the fact that brecht 's exile years were difficult and marked by lack of success , the 350 letters in the collection paint a picture of a self-confident and self-assertive poet . publications based on the new materials have already been announced .
in addition to brecht 's letters to helena weigel from 1923 to 1956 , german publishing house suhrkamp is also planning to publish a 150-page-long appendix to werner hecht 's 1997 chronicle , which documented brecht 's life from day to day . hecht sees a number of exciting challenges for brecht researchers . " it is , of course , peculiar that brecht was caught in the interpretation struggle between the east and the west , " hecht said .
" now is the time to paint an objective picture of brecht .
that is why discoveries of this kind are of such great value . " dunja welke -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de celebrating bertolt brecht click here for dw-world.de 's dossier on brecht 's life and international influence .

he also co-wrote " aggression and war : their biological and social bases , " which dissects human aggression and war .
until recently , he was the director general of the european institute for the media .
dw-world.de : in a general sense , what have you observed from the current conflict in the middle east and the role that the media has played ?
jo groebel : in the middle east there is the situation of political violence and the role of individual versus national aggression .
are these the actions of individuals who are caught up in the continual fighting or individual acts of violence ?
the role of communication and media in these situations shows that there is a certain unbalance .
they were not presented as victims on the israeli side , and people reacted to individual pictures - especially from hezbollah - which were presented differently to israel .
my assumption is that israel cared less about public opinion and people started to feel more sympathetic to hezbollah , which was a reaction to the images of violence and death that were shown on the hezbollah side .
although these events were still present on the israel side , they were not shown as constantly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : use of media for propaganda : hezbollah television al -manar what is your perception of the recent coverage of the conflict in lebanon ?
there is the whole question of what gets more attention - war or peace ?
the problem is that by being violent you get more attention , and this is has more news value .
people are more interested in the negatives than the positives .
from a rewards point of view , getting more attention means more publicity of the cause .
in this conflict , at the moment , there has been confirmation , especially from the hezbollah side , that there has been manipulation of media by showing certain images .
a few years ago , there was footage of a young child looking into the camera and this same type of image appeared recently in lebanon , whether this is a coincidence is questionable .
one tends to compare the recent conflicts to what happened in iraq about three years ago , where there were major discussions about the reporting and embedded journalists who were working in iraq .
in the case of recent events the discussion only started a couple of days ago , before that there was no discussion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an embedded time magazine journalist has up close experience with war in iraq there are three main issues that have influenced the coverage of the current conflict .
firstly , this is considered another kind of war .
people are used to seeing conflict , but unlike iraq , which held bad public opinion , the conflict in lebanon was not a surprise and inevitably lacked extreme impact .
secondly , people expect propaganda and therefore could be immune to , or even cynical about , the images that they see in this conflict because of the images that came from iraq .
thirdly , people get used to this sort of conflict .
if more people had died , it would have made big news .
in the case of germany 's coverage , it was in the news every 24 hours and there was permanent coverage .
however , for other european news it was amongst the top stories of the regular news bulletin , but there was not much more than coverage .
considering the recent development of a peace deal between the fighting parties , how do you think media audiences take this sort of outcome , in light of what you said previously about the expectation of conflict in the region ?
my assumption is that no one will assume that peace will happen .
however , all the sides that are involved in the conflict have both confirmed their will to act and to open dialogue .

he also co-wrote " aggression and war : their biological and social bases , " which dissects human aggression and war .
until recently , he was the director general of the european institute for the media .
dw-world.de : in a general sense , what have you observed from the current conflict in the middle east and the role that the media has played ?
jo groebel : in the middle east there is the situation of political violence and the role of individual versus national aggression .
are these the actions of individuals who are caught up in the continual fighting or individual acts of violence ?
the role of communication and media in these situations shows that there is a certain unbalance .
they were not presented as victims on the israeli side , and people reacted to individual pictures - especially from hezbollah - which were presented differently to israel .
my assumption is that israel cared less about public opinion and people started to feel more sympathetic to hezbollah , which was a reaction to the images of violence and death that were shown on the hezbollah side .
although these events were still present on the israel side , they were not shown as constantly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : use of media for propaganda : hezbollah television al -manar what is your perception of the recent coverage of the conflict in lebanon ?
there is the whole question of what gets more attention - war or peace ?
the problem is that by being violent you get more attention , and this is has more news value .
people are more interested in the negatives than the positives .
from a rewards point of view , getting more attention means more publicity of the cause .
in this conflict , at the moment , there has been confirmation , especially from the hezbollah side , that there has been manipulation of media by showing certain images .
a few years ago , there was footage of a young child looking into the camera and this same type of image appeared recently in lebanon , whether this is a coincidence is questionable .
one tends to compare the recent conflicts to what happened in iraq about three years ago , where there were major discussions about the reporting and embedded journalists who were working in iraq .
in the case of recent events the discussion only started a couple of days ago , before that there was no discussion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an embedded time magazine journalist has up close experience with war in iraq there are three main issues that have influenced the coverage of the current conflict .
firstly , this is considered another kind of war .
people are used to seeing conflict , but unlike iraq , which held bad public opinion , the conflict in lebanon was not a surprise and inevitably lacked extreme impact .
secondly , people expect propaganda and therefore could be immune to , or even cynical about , the images that they see in this conflict because of the images that came from iraq .
thirdly , people get used to this sort of conflict .
if more people had died , it would have made big news .
in the case of germany 's coverage , it was in the news every 24 hours and there was permanent coverage .
however , for other european news it was amongst the top stories of the regular news bulletin , but there was not much more than coverage .
considering the recent development of a peace deal between the fighting parties , how do you think media audiences take this sort of outcome , in light of what you said previously about the expectation of conflict in the region ?
my assumption is that no one will assume that peace will happen .
however , all the sides that are involved in the conflict have both confirmed their will to act and to open dialogue .
there is some credibility to this process and hope for periodical peace .
but there is no assuming that this is will be certain .

he also co-wrote " aggression and war : their biological and social bases , " which dissects human aggression and war .
until recently , he was the director general of the european institute for the media .
dw-world.de : in a general sense , what have you observed from the current conflict in the middle east and the role that the media has played ?
jo groebel : in the middle east there is the situation of political violence and the role of individual versus national aggression .
are these the actions of individuals who are caught up in the continual fighting or individual acts of violence ?
the role of communication and media in these situations shows that there is a certain unbalance .
they were not presented as victims on the israeli side , and people reacted to individual pictures - especially from hezbollah - which were presented differently to israel .
my assumption is that israel cared less about public opinion and people started to feel more sympathetic to hezbollah , which was a reaction to the images of violence and death that were shown on the hezbollah side .
although these events were still present on the israel side , they were not shown as constantly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : use of media for propaganda : hezbollah television al -manar what is your perception of the recent coverage of the conflict in lebanon ?
there is the whole question of what gets more attention - war or peace ?
the problem is that by being violent you get more attention , and this is has more news value .
people are more interested in the negatives than the positives .
from a rewards point of view , getting more attention means more publicity of the cause .
in this conflict , at the moment , there has been confirmation , especially from the hezbollah side , that there has been manipulation of media by showing certain images .
a few years ago , there was footage of a young child looking into the camera and this same type of image appeared recently in lebanon , whether this is a coincidence is questionable .
one tends to compare the recent conflicts to what happened in iraq about three years ago , where there were major discussions about the reporting and embedded journalists who were working in iraq .
in the case of recent events the discussion only started a couple of days ago , before that there was no discussion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an embedded time magazine journalist has up close experience with war in iraq there are three main issues that have influenced the coverage of the current conflict .
firstly , this is considered another kind of war .
people are used to seeing conflict , but unlike iraq , which held bad public opinion , the conflict in lebanon was not a surprise and inevitably lacked extreme impact .
secondly , people expect propaganda and therefore could be immune to , or even cynical about , the images that they see in this conflict because of the images that came from iraq .
thirdly , people get used to this sort of conflict .
if more people had died , it would have made big news .
in the case of germany 's coverage , it was in the news every 24 hours and there was permanent coverage .
however , for other european news it was amongst the top stories of the regular news bulletin , but there was not much more than coverage .
considering the recent development of a peace deal between the fighting parties , how do you think media audiences take this sort of outcome , in light of what you said previously about the expectation of conflict in the region ?
my assumption is that no one will assume that peace will happen .
however , all the sides that are involved in the conflict have both confirmed their will to act and to open dialogue .
there is some credibility to this process and hope for periodical peace .
but there is no assuming that this is will be certain .
are there any notable differences of the media coverage for the israel and hezbollah conflict compared to other conflicts around the world ?
what i find particularly interesting is the use of what is called amateur or informal media , like weblogs , web images and such , that has been applied in professional conflict reporting .

but he at least admitted his own hypocrisy , said dw-world.de 's toma tasovac . oskar matzerath , the obscene and earth-bound narrator of grass 's most famous novel " the tin drum " willfully stopped growing at the age of three and , hence , observed the world from the vantage point of a child , looking up from below .
günter grass himself , on the other hand , always acted as if he had somehow grown taller than the rest of the world ; as if his head was , in fact , dwelling in a stratosphere of pure , guiltless thought ; a moral emporium beyond anybody else 's reach . in post-war germany , günter grass became a moral institution and a powerful force of reflection on what it meant to have had a nazi past .
as " the conscience of the post-war generation , " grass made a significant contribution to germany 's development into an open , democratic society that it is today . yet it is in the nature of any authority - whether it 's moral , political or military - to be talking down to its subjects .
günter grass has been talking down to germans for decades : when he , for a long time , looked favorably towards the soviet union while turning a blind eye toward the prison house that was the german democratic republic ; when he allowed himself to be shocked by the way east germans abandoned their socialist dreams and rushed across the border in pursuit of capitalist commodities ; when he said that the two germanys should not be united because germans had every reason to fear themselves as a unit . günter grass always knew better . a shocking revelation which is why his belated confession that he had been a member of the notorious waffen ss combat troops - admittedly , as a 17-year-old boy in 1944 - has come as such a shock to everybody , both in germany and abroad .
people do n't like to see the untouchables strip themselves naked .
if anything , people like to do the mud-dragging themselves . it is absolutely inexcusable that günter grass waited more than half of a century to come clean , after having spent that same half of a century teaching germans the moral imperative of coming to terms with their past .
it is disappointing and discomforting that grass , who once spoke passionately about the need of " preventing the past from coming to an end , " kept his own past hidden away for so long .
it is sad and embarrassing to see a man of his stature resort to sentimentality -lrb- " i have carried this blemish for 60 years " -rrb- or narcissism - he described the current avalanche of criticism on him as " an attempt at turning him into an non-person . " yet if anybody ever believed in the infallibility of günter grass as a kind of leftist answer to the holy father , then they were simply too naive for their own good .
infallibility is not a human trait . the end of a moral authority some commentators have pointed out that grass 's literary oeuvre will need to be completely reevaluated .
this is hardly true .
his monumental literary achievement will not be shaken one bit by the revelation of his weakness as a human being . those who - like wolfgang börnsen , the parliamentary spokesman on cultural affairs for the conservative christian democratic union - believe that grass should " honorably return the -lrb- nobel -rrb- prize " - are still unable to come to terms with a simple fact that günter grass , the writer , günter grass , the moralist , and günter grass , the father who did n't tell his children that he was a member of the waffen ss , are not the same persona and deserve to be seen and judged independently .
the fall of the moralist is not the fall of the writer . when all is said and done , however , it should be remembered that it was grass alone who revealed his own hypocrisy .
when he came out with the story - which will , no doubt , help him increase the sales of his forthcoming autobiography - he also decided that truth was more important than the comfort of secrecy .

but he at least admitted his own hypocrisy , said dw-world.de 's toma tasovac . oskar matzerath , the obscene and earth-bound narrator of grass 's most famous novel " the tin drum " willfully stopped growing at the age of three and , hence , observed the world from the vantage point of a child , looking up from below .
günter grass himself , on the other hand , always acted as if he had somehow grown taller than the rest of the world ; as if his head was , in fact , dwelling in a stratosphere of pure , guiltless thought ; a moral emporium beyond anybody else 's reach . in post-war germany , günter grass became a moral institution and a powerful force of reflection on what it meant to have had a nazi past .
as " the conscience of the post-war generation , " grass made a significant contribution to germany 's development into an open , democratic society that it is today . yet it is in the nature of any authority - whether it 's moral , political or military - to be talking down to its subjects .
günter grass has been talking down to germans for decades : when he , for a long time , looked favorably towards the soviet union while turning a blind eye toward the prison house that was the german democratic republic ; when he allowed himself to be shocked by the way east germans abandoned their socialist dreams and rushed across the border in pursuit of capitalist commodities ; when he said that the two germanys should not be united because germans had every reason to fear themselves as a unit . günter grass always knew better . a shocking revelation which is why his belated confession that he had been a member of the notorious waffen ss combat troops - admittedly , as a 17-year-old boy in 1944 - has come as such a shock to everybody , both in germany and abroad .
people do n't like to see the untouchables strip themselves naked .
if anything , people like to do the mud-dragging themselves . it is absolutely inexcusable that günter grass waited more than half of a century to come clean , after having spent that same half of a century teaching germans the moral imperative of coming to terms with their past .
it is disappointing and discomforting that grass , who once spoke passionately about the need of " preventing the past from coming to an end , " kept his own past hidden away for so long .
it is sad and embarrassing to see a man of his stature resort to sentimentality -lrb- " i have carried this blemish for 60 years " -rrb- or narcissism - he described the current avalanche of criticism on him as " an attempt at turning him into an non-person . " yet if anybody ever believed in the infallibility of günter grass as a kind of leftist answer to the holy father , then they were simply too naive for their own good .
infallibility is not a human trait . the end of a moral authority some commentators have pointed out that grass 's literary oeuvre will need to be completely reevaluated .
this is hardly true .
his monumental literary achievement will not be shaken one bit by the revelation of his weakness as a human being . those who - like wolfgang börnsen , the parliamentary spokesman on cultural affairs for the conservative christian democratic union - believe that grass should " honorably return the -lrb- nobel -rrb- prize " - are still unable to come to terms with a simple fact that günter grass , the writer , günter grass , the moralist , and günter grass , the father who did n't tell his children that he was a member of the waffen ss , are not the same persona and deserve to be seen and judged independently .
the fall of the moralist is not the fall of the writer . when all is said and done , however , it should be remembered that it was grass alone who revealed his own hypocrisy .
when he came out with the story - which will , no doubt , help him increase the sales of his forthcoming autobiography - he also decided that truth was more important than the comfort of secrecy .
for the first time , perhaps , he stopped looking down on people . he should have spoken out earlier , but belated truth is still better than no truth at all . toma tasovac is an editor for the english site of dw-world.de and an expert on german literature . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nobel prize winner grass under fire for belated ss confession nobel prize winning author günter grass is facing a backlash from contemporaries and commentators after he admitted that he was drafted into nazi germany 's notorious waffen ss elite force during world war ii .

the lawyer , who has defended a number of neo-nazis including holocaust denier ernst zündel and is known for speaking at neo-nazi rallies honoring hitler 's deputy rudolf hess , reportedly aims to transform the hotel into a neo-nazi center for research and conferences .
rieger , who owns property in hamburg , thuringia , a former german military building in dörverden near bremen as well as in sweden , has not said publicly why he wants to buy the hotel in the lower saxony town of fewer than 80,000 people .
he was unavailable for comment .
fighting fire with fire town officials said there is little they can do to prevent the sale other than offer the 2 million euros from their already-stretched budget , adding that their efforts to convince property owner günter mergel not to sell to rieger have been unsuccessful .
" we can not stop the current owner from selling to whomever he wants , " schwettmann told reporters .

but he at least admitted his own hypocrisy , said dw-world.de 's toma tasovac . oskar matzerath , the obscene and earth-bound narrator of grass 's most famous novel " the tin drum " willfully stopped growing at the age of three and , hence , observed the world from the vantage point of a child , looking up from below .
günter grass himself , on the other hand , always acted as if he had somehow grown taller than the rest of the world ; as if his head was , in fact , dwelling in a stratosphere of pure , guiltless thought ; a moral emporium beyond anybody else 's reach . in post-war germany , günter grass became a moral institution and a powerful force of reflection on what it meant to have had a nazi past .
as " the conscience of the post-war generation , " grass made a significant contribution to germany 's development into an open , democratic society that it is today . yet it is in the nature of any authority - whether it 's moral , political or military - to be talking down to its subjects .
günter grass has been talking down to germans for decades : when he , for a long time , looked favorably towards the soviet union while turning a blind eye toward the prison house that was the german democratic republic ; when he allowed himself to be shocked by the way east germans abandoned their socialist dreams and rushed across the border in pursuit of capitalist commodities ; when he said that the two germanys should not be united because germans had every reason to fear themselves as a unit . günter grass always knew better . a shocking revelation which is why his belated confession that he had been a member of the notorious waffen ss combat troops - admittedly , as a 17-year-old boy in 1944 - has come as such a shock to everybody , both in germany and abroad .
people do n't like to see the untouchables strip themselves naked .
if anything , people like to do the mud-dragging themselves . it is absolutely inexcusable that günter grass waited more than half of a century to come clean , after having spent that same half of a century teaching germans the moral imperative of coming to terms with their past .
it is disappointing and discomforting that grass , who once spoke passionately about the need of " preventing the past from coming to an end , " kept his own past hidden away for so long .
it is sad and embarrassing to see a man of his stature resort to sentimentality -lrb- " i have carried this blemish for 60 years " -rrb- or narcissism - he described the current avalanche of criticism on him as " an attempt at turning him into an non-person . " yet if anybody ever believed in the infallibility of günter grass as a kind of leftist answer to the holy father , then they were simply too naive for their own good .
infallibility is not a human trait . the end of a moral authority some commentators have pointed out that grass 's literary oeuvre will need to be completely reevaluated .
this is hardly true .
his monumental literary achievement will not be shaken one bit by the revelation of his weakness as a human being . those who - like wolfgang börnsen , the parliamentary spokesman on cultural affairs for the conservative christian democratic union - believe that grass should " honorably return the -lrb- nobel -rrb- prize " - are still unable to come to terms with a simple fact that günter grass , the writer , günter grass , the moralist , and günter grass , the father who did n't tell his children that he was a member of the waffen ss , are not the same persona and deserve to be seen and judged independently .
the fall of the moralist is not the fall of the writer . when all is said and done , however , it should be remembered that it was grass alone who revealed his own hypocrisy .
when he came out with the story - which will , no doubt , help him increase the sales of his forthcoming autobiography - he also decided that truth was more important than the comfort of secrecy .
for the first time , perhaps , he stopped looking down on people . he should have spoken out earlier , but belated truth is still better than no truth at all . toma tasovac is an editor for the english site of dw-world.de and an expert on german literature . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nobel prize winner grass under fire for belated ss confession nobel prize winning author günter grass is facing a backlash from contemporaries and commentators after he admitted that he was drafted into nazi germany 's notorious waffen ss elite force during world war ii .

günter grass has been talking down to germans for decades : when he , for a long time , looked favorably towards the soviet union while turning a blind eye toward the prison house that was the german democratic republic ; when he allowed himself to be shocked by the way east germans abandoned their socialist dreams and rushed across the border in pursuit of capitalist commodities ; when he said that the two germanys should not be united because germans had every reason to fear themselves as a unit . günter grass always knew better . a shocking revelation which is why his belated confession that he had been a member of the notorious waffen ss combat troops - admittedly , as a 17-year-old boy in 1944 - has come as such a shock to everybody , both in germany and abroad .
people do n't like to see the untouchables strip themselves naked .
if anything , people like to do the mud-dragging themselves . it is absolutely inexcusable that günter grass waited more than half of a century to come clean , after having spent that same half of a century teaching germans the moral imperative of coming to terms with their past .
it is disappointing and discomforting that grass , who once spoke passionately about the need of " preventing the past from coming to an end , " kept his own past hidden away for so long .
it is sad and embarrassing to see a man of his stature resort to sentimentality -lrb- " i have carried this blemish for 60 years " -rrb- or narcissism - he described the current avalanche of criticism on him as " an attempt at turning him into an non-person . " yet if anybody ever believed in the infallibility of günter grass as a kind of leftist answer to the holy father , then they were simply too naive for their own good .
infallibility is not a human trait . the end of a moral authority some commentators have pointed out that grass 's literary oeuvre will need to be completely reevaluated .
this is hardly true .
his monumental literary achievement will not be shaken one bit by the revelation of his weakness as a human being . those who - like wolfgang börnsen , the parliamentary spokesman on cultural affairs for the conservative christian democratic union - believe that grass should " honorably return the -lrb- nobel -rrb- prize " - are still unable to come to terms with a simple fact that günter grass , the writer , günter grass , the moralist , and günter grass , the father who did n't tell his children that he was a member of the waffen ss , are not the same persona and deserve to be seen and judged independently .
the fall of the moralist is not the fall of the writer . when all is said and done , however , it should be remembered that it was grass alone who revealed his own hypocrisy .
when he came out with the story - which will , no doubt , help him increase the sales of his forthcoming autobiography - he also decided that truth was more important than the comfort of secrecy .
for the first time , perhaps , he stopped looking down on people . he should have spoken out earlier , but belated truth is still better than no truth at all . toma tasovac is an editor for the english site of dw-world.de and an expert on german literature . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nobel prize winner grass under fire for belated ss confession nobel prize winning author günter grass is facing a backlash from contemporaries and commentators after he admitted that he was drafted into nazi germany 's notorious waffen ss elite force during world war ii .

14 , 2006 -rrb- opinion : a truly idiotic decision by declaring themselves ready to revoke the decision of an independent literary jury , german politicians are embarrassing themselves and damaging the fundaments of democratic culture , says dw-world.de 's toma tasovac .
" i do n't hold onto ideological distortions " dw-world.de spoke to german novelist and nobel prize winner günter grass about international pen , germany , the role of the writer in contemporary society and a world without peace .

he also co-wrote " aggression and war : their biological and social bases , " which dissects human aggression and war .
until recently , he was the director general of the european institute for the media .
dw-world.de : in a general sense , what have you observed from the current conflict in the middle east and the role that the media has played ?
jo groebel : in the middle east there is the situation of political violence and the role of individual versus national aggression .
are these the actions of individuals who are caught up in the continual fighting or individual acts of violence ?
the role of communication and media in these situations shows that there is a certain unbalance .
they were not presented as victims on the israeli side , and people reacted to individual pictures - especially from hezbollah - which were presented differently to israel .
my assumption is that israel cared less about public opinion and people started to feel more sympathetic to hezbollah , which was a reaction to the images of violence and death that were shown on the hezbollah side .
although these events were still present on the israel side , they were not shown as constantly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : use of media for propaganda : hezbollah television al -manar what is your perception of the recent coverage of the conflict in lebanon ?
there is the whole question of what gets more attention - war or peace ?
the problem is that by being violent you get more attention , and this is has more news value .
people are more interested in the negatives than the positives .
from a rewards point of view , getting more attention means more publicity of the cause .
in this conflict , at the moment , there has been confirmation , especially from the hezbollah side , that there has been manipulation of media by showing certain images .
a few years ago , there was footage of a young child looking into the camera and this same type of image appeared recently in lebanon , whether this is a coincidence is questionable .
one tends to compare the recent conflicts to what happened in iraq about three years ago , where there were major discussions about the reporting and embedded journalists who were working in iraq .
in the case of recent events the discussion only started a couple of days ago , before that there was no discussion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an embedded time magazine journalist has up close experience with war in iraq there are three main issues that have influenced the coverage of the current conflict .
firstly , this is considered another kind of war .
people are used to seeing conflict , but unlike iraq , which held bad public opinion , the conflict in lebanon was not a surprise and inevitably lacked extreme impact .
secondly , people expect propaganda and therefore could be immune to , or even cynical about , the images that they see in this conflict because of the images that came from iraq .
thirdly , people get used to this sort of conflict .
if more people had died , it would have made big news .
in the case of germany 's coverage , it was in the news every 24 hours and there was permanent coverage .
however , for other european news it was amongst the top stories of the regular news bulletin , but there was not much more than coverage .
considering the recent development of a peace deal between the fighting parties , how do you think media audiences take this sort of outcome , in light of what you said previously about the expectation of conflict in the region ?
my assumption is that no one will assume that peace will happen .
however , all the sides that are involved in the conflict have both confirmed their will to act and to open dialogue .
there is some credibility to this process and hope for periodical peace .
but there is no assuming that this is will be certain .
are there any notable differences of the media coverage for the israel and hezbollah conflict compared to other conflicts around the world ?
what i find particularly interesting is the use of what is called amateur or informal media , like weblogs , web images and such , that has been applied in professional conflict reporting .
this has meant anyone who has access to camera and the internet , can post pictures on the web .
if you receive an image from someone who is actually there and has actual images , that can seem to be more credible information .
however , there are ethical dilemmas with this situation and ideally , a journalist is the one doing the stories and taking the pictures , because they are working by a code of ethics and have a certain standard of objectivity and do not have the same local ties as someone living there .
this is important , to be cautious about amateur photographs , because they can be digitally changed and manipulated and the impact that the pictures publicized by hezbollah have are an example of this . rachel ryan interviewed jo groebel send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : " it 's a long way to peace " in accordance with un resolution 1701 , a ceasefire in the conflict between israel and hezbollah in lebanon came into effect on monday morning .

from a rewards point of view , getting more attention means more publicity of the cause .
in this conflict , at the moment , there has been confirmation , especially from the hezbollah side , that there has been manipulation of media by showing certain images .
a few years ago , there was footage of a young child looking into the camera and this same type of image appeared recently in lebanon , whether this is a coincidence is questionable .
one tends to compare the recent conflicts to what happened in iraq about three years ago , where there were major discussions about the reporting and embedded journalists who were working in iraq .
in the case of recent events the discussion only started a couple of days ago , before that there was no discussion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an embedded time magazine journalist has up close experience with war in iraq there are three main issues that have influenced the coverage of the current conflict .
firstly , this is considered another kind of war .
people are used to seeing conflict , but unlike iraq , which held bad public opinion , the conflict in lebanon was not a surprise and inevitably lacked extreme impact .
secondly , people expect propaganda and therefore could be immune to , or even cynical about , the images that they see in this conflict because of the images that came from iraq .
thirdly , people get used to this sort of conflict .
if more people had died , it would have made big news .
in the case of germany 's coverage , it was in the news every 24 hours and there was permanent coverage .
however , for other european news it was amongst the top stories of the regular news bulletin , but there was not much more than coverage .
considering the recent development of a peace deal between the fighting parties , how do you think media audiences take this sort of outcome , in light of what you said previously about the expectation of conflict in the region ?
my assumption is that no one will assume that peace will happen .
however , all the sides that are involved in the conflict have both confirmed their will to act and to open dialogue .
there is some credibility to this process and hope for periodical peace .
but there is no assuming that this is will be certain .
are there any notable differences of the media coverage for the israel and hezbollah conflict compared to other conflicts around the world ?
what i find particularly interesting is the use of what is called amateur or informal media , like weblogs , web images and such , that has been applied in professional conflict reporting .
this has meant anyone who has access to camera and the internet , can post pictures on the web .
if you receive an image from someone who is actually there and has actual images , that can seem to be more credible information .
however , there are ethical dilemmas with this situation and ideally , a journalist is the one doing the stories and taking the pictures , because they are working by a code of ethics and have a certain standard of objectivity and do not have the same local ties as someone living there .

he also co-wrote " aggression and war : their biological and social bases , " which dissects human aggression and war .
until recently , he was the director general of the european institute for the media .
dw-world.de : in a general sense , what have you observed from the current conflict in the middle east and the role that the media has played ?
jo groebel : in the middle east there is the situation of political violence and the role of individual versus national aggression .
are these the actions of individuals who are caught up in the continual fighting or individual acts of violence ?
the role of communication and media in these situations shows that there is a certain unbalance .
they were not presented as victims on the israeli side , and people reacted to individual pictures - especially from hezbollah - which were presented differently to israel .
my assumption is that israel cared less about public opinion and people started to feel more sympathetic to hezbollah , which was a reaction to the images of violence and death that were shown on the hezbollah side .
although these events were still present on the israel side , they were not shown as constantly .

there is no salvation for the upper echelons of the hitler / nazi government - but there should be heartfelt and very open forgiveness expressed to these one-time youngsters . - wiley horne , us i believe günter grass should have much earlier revealed his past and should not have kept it hidden for the last 61 years .
i think he did not confess it earlier fearing that such a confession would prevent him from getting the nobel prize , which he eventually got in 1999 .
this whole episode only shows his hypocrisy and double-speak . - pialy mazumder , india it 's a sad thing that one of germany 's most famous authors , if not people , of the 20th century has come under such wide criticism .

this man became the icon of german left politics , claiming to have the role as moral conscious of the modern world .
that günter grass lied to germany in this matter and that germany and germans believed him , only speaks that germany and german have no moral superiority with which to admonish the world on what is righteous or to show the world which is the ethical path .
recently germany , under chancellor gerhard schröder , again reclaimed the post of moral voice of the world by opposing and decrying the invasion of iraq by the us , britain and other nations .
the parochialism of german society continues as do the hypocrisy that permeates it .
unfortunately germans have not changed , but as we all know , the society that begot karl marx , friedrich engel and adolf hitler and company are nothing more than a bunch of liers and self-delusional people . - francisco a. olivas , nicaragua he should be stripped of the nobel prize , but not have his honorary citizenship of gdansk removed , because he was born there and he is a citizen of gdansk -lrb- danzig -rrb- .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . the man , if judged at all , should be - as any person - judged by his entire life and what he accomplished , not what happened when one was 17 years old .
it is time to put to rest this stigma of those years and let the young people of today look to the future that is " theirs . "
who are we to judge at all as we all live in " glass houses . " - robert j. patulski , us ralph giordano hit the nail on the head .
no man is perfect , and given that , we should be happy that günter grass has come to terms with himself , and with germany .
let he who has not sinned cast the first stone .
he did what anyone would do , and did .
there are legions of these boys who were inducted in 1944 and 1945 at a young age , who are now 77 , 78 , 79 and dying .
i feel that germany should make clear to grass and to these many other soldier-citizens that there was no moral fault on their part for serving their country .
there is no salvation for the upper echelons of the hitler / nazi government - but there should be heartfelt and very open forgiveness expressed to these one-time youngsters . - wiley horne , us i believe günter grass should have much earlier revealed his past and should not have kept it hidden for the last 61 years .
i think he did not confess it earlier fearing that such a confession would prevent him from getting the nobel prize , which he eventually got in 1999 .
this whole episode only shows his hypocrisy and double-speak . - pialy mazumder , india it 's a sad thing that one of germany 's most famous authors , if not people , of the 20th century has come under such wide criticism .
unfortunately , this criticism in not quite undeserved .
it is not shameful to change your convictions , especially after a catastrophe as world war ii .
it is not shameful to call for openness on the topic ; in fact , there has probably been too much left unsaid .
however , it is a blow to the atmosphere of honesty , and to the entire public , when one of the advocates of the openness and honesty has hid such a secret for so long .
whether this admission is sincere , whether it is timed to advertise the book -lrb- consciously or not -rrb- and how much more there is about grass ' military service i can not know .
yet it is unfortunate that grass ' works wo n't ever be read the same way . - boyan penev , germany this confession only confirms my suspicions that as whole the german society is plagued by hypocrisy and to continue to have a superiority complex .
this man became the icon of german left politics , claiming to have the role as moral conscious of the modern world .
that günter grass lied to germany in this matter and that germany and germans believed him , only speaks that germany and german have no moral superiority with which to admonish the world on what is righteous or to show the world which is the ethical path .
recently germany , under chancellor gerhard schröder , again reclaimed the post of moral voice of the world by opposing and decrying the invasion of iraq by the us , britain and other nations .
the parochialism of german society continues as do the hypocrisy that permeates it .
unfortunately germans have not changed , but as we all know , the society that begot karl marx , friedrich engel and adolf hitler and company are nothing more than a bunch of liers and self-delusional people . - francisco a. olivas , nicaragua he should be stripped of the nobel prize , but not have his honorary citizenship of gdansk removed , because he was born there and he is a citizen of gdansk -lrb- danzig -rrb- .

with less than a day remaining , residents of delmenhorst near bremen are waiting with bated breath to see if efforts to raise the 3.4 million euros -lrb- $ 4.2 million -rrb- to buy a local hotel have been successful .
otherwise , the now empty hotel am stadtpark will become the property of a neo-nazi group .
in the past week , the ticker on the web site www.fuer-delmenhorst.de detailing donations has steadily risen .
as of tuesday afternoon , it reached 679,486 euros .
still , even with a matching town donation of 2 million euros , delmenhorst is coming up short .
but townsfolk said they remain hopeful .
" every euro makes a difference , " mayor carsten schwettmann said in a statement .
" it is a sign of the solidarity and commitment of the town . "
" nein " to neo-nazis the initiative began after hamburg lawyer jürgen rieger made an offer to buy the hotel , which is prominently situated across from the town hall in the center of the town .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 100-room hotel am stadtpark is at the center of the controversy rieger made an offer for the building on behalf of the wilhelm tietjen foundation for fertilization ltd , a mysterious group registered in london that promotes racial purity .
the organization is named for a rich nazi from bremen who died childless in 2002 .
the lawyer , who has defended a number of neo-nazis including holocaust denier ernst zündel and is known for speaking at neo-nazi rallies honoring hitler 's deputy rudolf hess , reportedly aims to transform the hotel into a neo-nazi center for research and conferences .
rieger , who owns property in hamburg , thuringia , a former german military building in dörverden near bremen as well as in sweden , has not said publicly why he wants to buy the hotel in the lower saxony town of fewer than 80,000 people .
he was unavailable for comment .
fighting fire with fire town officials said there is little they can do to prevent the sale other than offer the 2 million euros from their already-stretched budget , adding that their efforts to convince property owner günter mergel not to sell to rieger have been unsuccessful .
" we can not stop the current owner from selling to whomever he wants , " schwettmann told reporters .
" but i am proud of the solidarity the townspeople have shown in the past days . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lawyer jürgen rieger is well-known for his neo-nazi activities mergel , who told focus magazine that the empty 100-room hotel is bleeding him dry financially , said he has no choice : " i am up to my neck in hot water . "
" a crazy idea " as a result , locals took the burden into their own hands .
they have staged protests , held fundraisers such as " barbeques against the right " and rallies featuring rock music .
they have created petitions and weblogs and planned exhibitions .
more than 3,000 people from the town and around germany have donated to delmenhorst 's cause via a web page that launched on aug .
4 .
" it might be a crazy idea , " said town resident günter feith , a 58-year-old architect and founder of the initiative .
" but we are doing it anyway .
we have to . "
feith said at first , there were doubts about the chance of successfully derailing the sale .
but now , as thousands of euros pour in , those doubts are dissipating .
" we have a good chance of succeeding , " he said .
" besides , i do n't want to think about what happens if we do n't .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 15.08.2006 discovering brecht 's forgotten manuscripts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht 's letter to helene weigel , part of the victor n. cohen collection it happens rarely that 50 years after the death of a writer , new and important manuscripts are discovered .
but this is exactly what happened in the case of the greatest dramatist of the 20th century , bertolt brecht . ahead of 50th anniversary of brecht 's death , the academy of the arts in berlin and its brecht archive announced that brecht 's manuscripts , which were discovered in switzerland several years ago , have been added to the archive 's collection .
this is the largest expansion of the internationally renowned archive since its founding in 1956 .
the archive is used by approximately 240 researchers every year . previously , it was believed that no new materials could be added to the archive of the most performed german dramatist in the world .
but new brecht materials include brecht 's and other author 's manuscripts , his notebooks , contracts , documents , passports , check books , bills and letters that he wrote or received . all of these , brecht left with his friend , union leader and graphic artist , victor .
n. cohen in 1949 in goldbach on the lake of zurich .
brecht , 51 at the time , was living in switzerland - after years of exile in scandinavia and the united states - and preparing for his return to east berlin .
cohen was a left-inclined social democrat who wrote articles for union newspapers and rand social democratic campaigns and referendums .
he died in 1975 . but it was not until the late 1990s that cohen 's sons actually became aware of the valuable collection . it 's all brecht ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht 's finnish passport " they had to empty a warehouse , because their contract had expired , " said erdmut wizisla of the brecht archive .
" and victor 's stuff was there .
when they opened it , they thought : good god !
this is all brecht !
and then they went on to the next box and found again - all brecht . " the negotiations with the owners lasted eight years .
they were completed successfully because the deutsche klassenlotterie foundation , the german research foundation and the academy of the arts agreed to jointly finance the purchase : 2,500 sheets of paper , which correspond to one fifth of brecht 's overall archival materials , and a typewriter now make up the victor n. cohen collection at the brecht archive . brecht 's wife helena weigel , who meticulously collected brecht 's unpublished writings after his death , seems to have completely forgotten about the materials which were left in switzerland .
brecht himself obviously did n't miss these materials after he returned to germany .
they document above all the time he spent in switzerland , but also shed some light on his exile years in the united states and , to a lesser extent , his earlier periods . new and spectacular bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht left the us in 1947 after testifying before the committee on un-american activities in washington , dc the swiss materials include two previously unknown drafts of the play " the caucasian chalk circle , " several short stories , an idea for a novel as well as political and theatrical essays .
among them is a prose text " my unforgettable character , " in which brecht , similar to what he did in the play the " the resistible rise of arturo ui , " makes a caricature out of hitler . the manuscripts also show that , while in the states , brecht was involved with the council for a democratic germany .
this association of german emigrants was founded in 1944 in response to the national committee free germany , which was based in the soviet union .
brecht composed opinions and letters , in which he urged prominent germans - such as writer alfred döblin - to become engaged .
the council was a temporary coalition which already during the war supported the idea of a unified germany with the possibility of a sovereign inner and foreign policy . theater plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht and his wife helene weigel are buried in berlin the materials also show the enthusiasm with which brecht was preparing for his work in the theater in post-war germany .
he corresponded with his friends and colleagues in germany , directors , actors and german as well as russian cultural officials .
he wanted to adapt all his plays in view of the end of the war .
" arturo ui " was the only play that brecht believed - because of its genre as a farce - as fitting for the stage confrontation with the nazi rule . despite the fact that brecht 's exile years were difficult and marked by lack of success , the 350 letters in the collection paint a picture of a self-confident and self-assertive poet . publications based on the new materials have already been announced .
in addition to brecht 's letters to helena weigel from 1923 to 1956 , german publishing house suhrkamp is also planning to publish a 150-page-long appendix to werner hecht 's 1997 chronicle , which documented brecht 's life from day to day . hecht sees a number of exciting challenges for brecht researchers . " it is , of course , peculiar that brecht was caught in the interpretation struggle between the east and the west , " hecht said .
" now is the time to paint an objective picture of brecht .
that is why discoveries of this kind are of such great value . " dunja welke -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de celebrating bertolt brecht click here for dw-world.de 's dossier on brecht 's life and international influence .
a communist in a city of angels he blamed the sunshine in la , which " shriveled up the brains of gifted writers leaving them incapable of anything but film-writing . "
but when brecht himself tried to become a hollywood screenwriter , he failed miserably .

with less than a day remaining , residents of delmenhorst near bremen are waiting with bated breath to see if efforts to raise the 3.4 million euros -lrb- $ 4.2 million -rrb- to buy a local hotel have been successful .
otherwise , the now empty hotel am stadtpark will become the property of a neo-nazi group .
in the past week , the ticker on the web site www.fuer-delmenhorst.de detailing donations has steadily risen .
as of tuesday afternoon , it reached 679,486 euros .
still , even with a matching town donation of 2 million euros , delmenhorst is coming up short .
but townsfolk said they remain hopeful .
" every euro makes a difference , " mayor carsten schwettmann said in a statement .
" it is a sign of the solidarity and commitment of the town . "
" nein " to neo-nazis the initiative began after hamburg lawyer jürgen rieger made an offer to buy the hotel , which is prominently situated across from the town hall in the center of the town .

the organization is named for a rich nazi from bremen who died childless in 2002 .
the lawyer , who has defended a number of neo-nazis including holocaust denier ernst zündel and is known for speaking at neo-nazi rallies honoring hitler 's deputy rudolf hess , reportedly aims to transform the hotel into a neo-nazi center for research and conferences .
rieger , who owns property in hamburg , thuringia , a former german military building in dörverden near bremen as well as in sweden , has not said publicly why he wants to buy the hotel in the lower saxony town of fewer than 80,000 people .
he was unavailable for comment .
fighting fire with fire town officials said there is little they can do to prevent the sale other than offer the 2 million euros from their already-stretched budget , adding that their efforts to convince property owner günter mergel not to sell to rieger have been unsuccessful .
" we can not stop the current owner from selling to whomever he wants , " schwettmann told reporters .

" through positive , constructive action , syria could regain the lost trust of the international community , he added . " but the basic prerequisite for this is a clear and unmistakable commitment to putting regional differences in interests aside , " steinmeier said while at amman 's airport .
" president assad 's speech today is a step in the opposing direction .
that 's why i have decided not to travel to damascus . " assad praises hezbollah bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : syrian president bashar al-assad in his speech , the syrian president praised hezbollah in its fight against israel , describing resistance against the " enemy " as legitimate even as israel said it should prepare for talks . " i say to all those who accuse syria of taking the side of the resistance that this is , for the syrian people , an honor , " he said in a wide-ranging speech that also took aim at washington and anti-damascus figures in lebanon . " this resistance is a medal to pin on the chest of every arab citizen , not only syria , " he said , adding that the lebanese guerrillas had " shattered the myth of an invincible army . " a total of 160 israelis have been killed since july 12 , most of them soldiers who lost their lives in combat with hezbollah . no peace in sight ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel has begun thinning its troops in southern lebanon to prepare for a un takeover in the hard-hitting address at the opening of a journalists ' conference in damascus , punctuated by cheers and chanting from the audience , assad accused the jewish state of not wanting peace . he said there was now a " new middle east " after the month-long war between israel and hezbollah in lebanon , which he described as a " planned aggression " by the jewish state .
he accused israel of using the capture of two soldiers in a hezbollah raid on july 12 as a pretext for launching its massive assault against lebanon , which came to a halt after a un-brokered ceasefire took hold on monday . " peace would involve israel returning occupied lands to their owners and restoring their rights , " assad said .
" israel is an enemy founded on the basis of aggression and hegemony . " " the peace process has failed .
it has failed since its inception , " he added .
" we do not expect peace in the near future . " a missed opportunity assad 's speech on tuesday , which lead the german foreign minister to cancel his planned visit to syria , was his first public speech since the start of the war in lebanon . in his speech , the syrian president also lashed out at us policies in the region , accusing president george w. bush of adopting " the principle of preventative war , which is in complete contradiction to the principle of peace . " syria held political and military sway in lebanon for years until it pulled out its troops in april 2005 under massive pressure following the murder of former lebanese premier rafiq hariri . steinmeier had planned to try to further involve syria in the peace process following the implementation of a ceasefire in southern lebanon , possibly by offering economic incentives in return . now , however , the foreign minister has said he would prefer to fly on to saudi arabia where he is due to end his middle east visit on wednesday . dw staff -lrb- dc / tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de steinmeier to press syria for greater commitment to peace german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier is on his third middle east trip within a month .

he also co-wrote " aggression and war : their biological and social bases , " which dissects human aggression and war .
until recently , he was the director general of the european institute for the media .
dw-world.de : in a general sense , what have you observed from the current conflict in the middle east and the role that the media has played ?
jo groebel : in the middle east there is the situation of political violence and the role of individual versus national aggression .
are these the actions of individuals who are caught up in the continual fighting or individual acts of violence ?
the role of communication and media in these situations shows that there is a certain unbalance .
they were not presented as victims on the israeli side , and people reacted to individual pictures - especially from hezbollah - which were presented differently to israel .
my assumption is that israel cared less about public opinion and people started to feel more sympathetic to hezbollah , which was a reaction to the images of violence and death that were shown on the hezbollah side .
although these events were still present on the israel side , they were not shown as constantly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : use of media for propaganda : hezbollah television al -manar what is your perception of the recent coverage of the conflict in lebanon ?
there is the whole question of what gets more attention - war or peace ?
the problem is that by being violent you get more attention , and this is has more news value .
people are more interested in the negatives than the positives .
from a rewards point of view , getting more attention means more publicity of the cause .
in this conflict , at the moment , there has been confirmation , especially from the hezbollah side , that there has been manipulation of media by showing certain images .
a few years ago , there was footage of a young child looking into the camera and this same type of image appeared recently in lebanon , whether this is a coincidence is questionable .
one tends to compare the recent conflicts to what happened in iraq about three years ago , where there were major discussions about the reporting and embedded journalists who were working in iraq .
in the case of recent events the discussion only started a couple of days ago , before that there was no discussion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an embedded time magazine journalist has up close experience with war in iraq there are three main issues that have influenced the coverage of the current conflict .
firstly , this is considered another kind of war .
people are used to seeing conflict , but unlike iraq , which held bad public opinion , the conflict in lebanon was not a surprise and inevitably lacked extreme impact .
secondly , people expect propaganda and therefore could be immune to , or even cynical about , the images that they see in this conflict because of the images that came from iraq .
thirdly , people get used to this sort of conflict .
if more people had died , it would have made big news .
in the case of germany 's coverage , it was in the news every 24 hours and there was permanent coverage .
however , for other european news it was amongst the top stories of the regular news bulletin , but there was not much more than coverage .
considering the recent development of a peace deal between the fighting parties , how do you think media audiences take this sort of outcome , in light of what you said previously about the expectation of conflict in the region ?
my assumption is that no one will assume that peace will happen .
however , all the sides that are involved in the conflict have both confirmed their will to act and to open dialogue .
there is some credibility to this process and hope for periodical peace .
but there is no assuming that this is will be certain .
are there any notable differences of the media coverage for the israel and hezbollah conflict compared to other conflicts around the world ?
what i find particularly interesting is the use of what is called amateur or informal media , like weblogs , web images and such , that has been applied in professional conflict reporting .
this has meant anyone who has access to camera and the internet , can post pictures on the web .
if you receive an image from someone who is actually there and has actual images , that can seem to be more credible information .
however , there are ethical dilemmas with this situation and ideally , a journalist is the one doing the stories and taking the pictures , because they are working by a code of ethics and have a certain standard of objectivity and do not have the same local ties as someone living there .
this is important , to be cautious about amateur photographs , because they can be digitally changed and manipulated and the impact that the pictures publicized by hezbollah have are an example of this . rachel ryan interviewed jo groebel send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : " it 's a long way to peace " in accordance with un resolution 1701 , a ceasefire in the conflict between israel and hezbollah in lebanon came into effect on monday morning .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . the man , if judged at all , should be - as any person - judged by his entire life and what he accomplished , not what happened when one was 17 years old .
it is time to put to rest this stigma of those years and let the young people of today look to the future that is " theirs . "
who are we to judge at all as we all live in " glass houses . " - robert j. patulski , us ralph giordano hit the nail on the head .
no man is perfect , and given that , we should be happy that günter grass has come to terms with himself , and with germany .
let he who has not sinned cast the first stone .
he did what anyone would do , and did .
there are legions of these boys who were inducted in 1944 and 1945 at a young age , who are now 77 , 78 , 79 and dying .
i feel that germany should make clear to grass and to these many other soldier-citizens that there was no moral fault on their part for serving their country .
there is no salvation for the upper echelons of the hitler / nazi government - but there should be heartfelt and very open forgiveness expressed to these one-time youngsters . - wiley horne , us i believe günter grass should have much earlier revealed his past and should not have kept it hidden for the last 61 years .
i think he did not confess it earlier fearing that such a confession would prevent him from getting the nobel prize , which he eventually got in 1999 .
this whole episode only shows his hypocrisy and double-speak . - pialy mazumder , india it 's a sad thing that one of germany 's most famous authors , if not people , of the 20th century has come under such wide criticism .
unfortunately , this criticism in not quite undeserved .
it is not shameful to change your convictions , especially after a catastrophe as world war ii .
it is not shameful to call for openness on the topic ; in fact , there has probably been too much left unsaid .
however , it is a blow to the atmosphere of honesty , and to the entire public , when one of the advocates of the openness and honesty has hid such a secret for so long .
whether this admission is sincere , whether it is timed to advertise the book -lrb- consciously or not -rrb- and how much more there is about grass ' military service i can not know .
yet it is unfortunate that grass ' works wo n't ever be read the same way . - boyan penev , germany this confession only confirms my suspicions that as whole the german society is plagued by hypocrisy and to continue to have a superiority complex .
this man became the icon of german left politics , claiming to have the role as moral conscious of the modern world .
that günter grass lied to germany in this matter and that germany and germans believed him , only speaks that germany and german have no moral superiority with which to admonish the world on what is righteous or to show the world which is the ethical path .
recently germany , under chancellor gerhard schröder , again reclaimed the post of moral voice of the world by opposing and decrying the invasion of iraq by the us , britain and other nations .
the parochialism of german society continues as do the hypocrisy that permeates it .
unfortunately germans have not changed , but as we all know , the society that begot karl marx , friedrich engel and adolf hitler and company are nothing more than a bunch of liers and self-delusional people . - francisco a. olivas , nicaragua he should be stripped of the nobel prize , but not have his honorary citizenship of gdansk removed , because he was born there and he is a citizen of gdansk -lrb- danzig -rrb- .
whether we like it or not does not matter .
before we jump to conclusions , we need to investigate his role in the ss .
if grass proves not to be guilty , then all those who are " killing " grass owe him an apology in public . - danuta hejzner compiled by dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nobel prize winner grass under fire for belated ss confession nobel prize winning author günter grass is facing a backlash from contemporaries and commentators after he admitted that he was drafted into nazi germany 's notorious waffen ss elite force during world war ii .
-lrb- aug .
14 , 2006 -rrb- opinion : a late confession is better than no confession at all it is inexcusable that günter grass kept silent about his involvement with the waffen ss combat troops during world war ii .
but he at least admitted his own hypocrisy , said dw-world.de 's toma tasovac .

he also co-wrote " aggression and war : their biological and social bases , " which dissects human aggression and war .
until recently , he was the director general of the european institute for the media .
dw-world.de : in a general sense , what have you observed from the current conflict in the middle east and the role that the media has played ?
jo groebel : in the middle east there is the situation of political violence and the role of individual versus national aggression .
are these the actions of individuals who are caught up in the continual fighting or individual acts of violence ?
the role of communication and media in these situations shows that there is a certain unbalance .
they were not presented as victims on the israeli side , and people reacted to individual pictures - especially from hezbollah - which were presented differently to israel .
my assumption is that israel cared less about public opinion and people started to feel more sympathetic to hezbollah , which was a reaction to the images of violence and death that were shown on the hezbollah side .
although these events were still present on the israel side , they were not shown as constantly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : use of media for propaganda : hezbollah television al -manar what is your perception of the recent coverage of the conflict in lebanon ?
there is the whole question of what gets more attention - war or peace ?
the problem is that by being violent you get more attention , and this is has more news value .
people are more interested in the negatives than the positives .
from a rewards point of view , getting more attention means more publicity of the cause .
in this conflict , at the moment , there has been confirmation , especially from the hezbollah side , that there has been manipulation of media by showing certain images .
a few years ago , there was footage of a young child looking into the camera and this same type of image appeared recently in lebanon , whether this is a coincidence is questionable .
one tends to compare the recent conflicts to what happened in iraq about three years ago , where there were major discussions about the reporting and embedded journalists who were working in iraq .
in the case of recent events the discussion only started a couple of days ago , before that there was no discussion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an embedded time magazine journalist has up close experience with war in iraq there are three main issues that have influenced the coverage of the current conflict .
firstly , this is considered another kind of war .
people are used to seeing conflict , but unlike iraq , which held bad public opinion , the conflict in lebanon was not a surprise and inevitably lacked extreme impact .
secondly , people expect propaganda and therefore could be immune to , or even cynical about , the images that they see in this conflict because of the images that came from iraq .
thirdly , people get used to this sort of conflict .
if more people had died , it would have made big news .
in the case of germany 's coverage , it was in the news every 24 hours and there was permanent coverage .
however , for other european news it was amongst the top stories of the regular news bulletin , but there was not much more than coverage .
considering the recent development of a peace deal between the fighting parties , how do you think media audiences take this sort of outcome , in light of what you said previously about the expectation of conflict in the region ?
my assumption is that no one will assume that peace will happen .
however , all the sides that are involved in the conflict have both confirmed their will to act and to open dialogue .
there is some credibility to this process and hope for periodical peace .
but there is no assuming that this is will be certain .
are there any notable differences of the media coverage for the israel and hezbollah conflict compared to other conflicts around the world ?
what i find particularly interesting is the use of what is called amateur or informal media , like weblogs , web images and such , that has been applied in professional conflict reporting .
this has meant anyone who has access to camera and the internet , can post pictures on the web .
if you receive an image from someone who is actually there and has actual images , that can seem to be more credible information .
however , there are ethical dilemmas with this situation and ideally , a journalist is the one doing the stories and taking the pictures , because they are working by a code of ethics and have a certain standard of objectivity and do not have the same local ties as someone living there .
this is important , to be cautious about amateur photographs , because they can be digitally changed and manipulated and the impact that the pictures publicized by hezbollah have are an example of this . rachel ryan interviewed jo groebel send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : " it 's a long way to peace " in accordance with un resolution 1701 , a ceasefire in the conflict between israel and hezbollah in lebanon came into effect on monday morning .

he also co-wrote " aggression and war : their biological and social bases , " which dissects human aggression and war .
until recently , he was the director general of the european institute for the media .
dw-world.de : in a general sense , what have you observed from the current conflict in the middle east and the role that the media has played ?
jo groebel : in the middle east there is the situation of political violence and the role of individual versus national aggression .
are these the actions of individuals who are caught up in the continual fighting or individual acts of violence ?
the role of communication and media in these situations shows that there is a certain unbalance .
they were not presented as victims on the israeli side , and people reacted to individual pictures - especially from hezbollah - which were presented differently to israel .
my assumption is that israel cared less about public opinion and people started to feel more sympathetic to hezbollah , which was a reaction to the images of violence and death that were shown on the hezbollah side .
although these events were still present on the israel side , they were not shown as constantly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : use of media for propaganda : hezbollah television al -manar what is your perception of the recent coverage of the conflict in lebanon ?
there is the whole question of what gets more attention - war or peace ?
the problem is that by being violent you get more attention , and this is has more news value .
people are more interested in the negatives than the positives .
from a rewards point of view , getting more attention means more publicity of the cause .
in this conflict , at the moment , there has been confirmation , especially from the hezbollah side , that there has been manipulation of media by showing certain images .
a few years ago , there was footage of a young child looking into the camera and this same type of image appeared recently in lebanon , whether this is a coincidence is questionable .
one tends to compare the recent conflicts to what happened in iraq about three years ago , where there were major discussions about the reporting and embedded journalists who were working in iraq .
in the case of recent events the discussion only started a couple of days ago , before that there was no discussion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an embedded time magazine journalist has up close experience with war in iraq there are three main issues that have influenced the coverage of the current conflict .
firstly , this is considered another kind of war .
people are used to seeing conflict , but unlike iraq , which held bad public opinion , the conflict in lebanon was not a surprise and inevitably lacked extreme impact .
secondly , people expect propaganda and therefore could be immune to , or even cynical about , the images that they see in this conflict because of the images that came from iraq .
thirdly , people get used to this sort of conflict .
if more people had died , it would have made big news .
in the case of germany 's coverage , it was in the news every 24 hours and there was permanent coverage .
however , for other european news it was amongst the top stories of the regular news bulletin , but there was not much more than coverage .
considering the recent development of a peace deal between the fighting parties , how do you think media audiences take this sort of outcome , in light of what you said previously about the expectation of conflict in the region ?
my assumption is that no one will assume that peace will happen .
however , all the sides that are involved in the conflict have both confirmed their will to act and to open dialogue .
there is some credibility to this process and hope for periodical peace .
but there is no assuming that this is will be certain .
are there any notable differences of the media coverage for the israel and hezbollah conflict compared to other conflicts around the world ?
what i find particularly interesting is the use of what is called amateur or informal media , like weblogs , web images and such , that has been applied in professional conflict reporting .
this has meant anyone who has access to camera and the internet , can post pictures on the web .
if you receive an image from someone who is actually there and has actual images , that can seem to be more credible information .
however , there are ethical dilemmas with this situation and ideally , a journalist is the one doing the stories and taking the pictures , because they are working by a code of ethics and have a certain standard of objectivity and do not have the same local ties as someone living there .
this is important , to be cautious about amateur photographs , because they can be digitally changed and manipulated and the impact that the pictures publicized by hezbollah have are an example of this . rachel ryan interviewed jo groebel send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : " it 's a long way to peace " in accordance with un resolution 1701 , a ceasefire in the conflict between israel and hezbollah in lebanon came into effect on monday morning .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : günter grass grass defends long silence as book sales soar nobel prize winner grass under fire for belated ss confession opinion : a late confession is better than no confession at all " i do n't hold onto ideological distortions " reader response -pipe- 15.08.2006 judging grass großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grass has described the controversy as an attempt to turn him into a " non-person " dw-world.de readers comment on the controversy regarding german author günter grass ' ss past . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . the man , if judged at all , should be - as any person - judged by his entire life and what he accomplished , not what happened when one was 17 years old .
it is time to put to rest this stigma of those years and let the young people of today look to the future that is " theirs . "
who are we to judge at all as we all live in " glass houses . " - robert j. patulski , us ralph giordano hit the nail on the head .
no man is perfect , and given that , we should be happy that günter grass has come to terms with himself , and with germany .
let he who has not sinned cast the first stone .
he did what anyone would do , and did .
there are legions of these boys who were inducted in 1944 and 1945 at a young age , who are now 77 , 78 , 79 and dying .
i feel that germany should make clear to grass and to these many other soldier-citizens that there was no moral fault on their part for serving their country .
there is no salvation for the upper echelons of the hitler / nazi government - but there should be heartfelt and very open forgiveness expressed to these one-time youngsters . - wiley horne , us i believe günter grass should have much earlier revealed his past and should not have kept it hidden for the last 61 years .
i think he did not confess it earlier fearing that such a confession would prevent him from getting the nobel prize , which he eventually got in 1999 .
this whole episode only shows his hypocrisy and double-speak . - pialy mazumder , india it 's a sad thing that one of germany 's most famous authors , if not people , of the 20th century has come under such wide criticism .
unfortunately , this criticism in not quite undeserved .
it is not shameful to change your convictions , especially after a catastrophe as world war ii .
it is not shameful to call for openness on the topic ; in fact , there has probably been too much left unsaid .
however , it is a blow to the atmosphere of honesty , and to the entire public , when one of the advocates of the openness and honesty has hid such a secret for so long .
whether this admission is sincere , whether it is timed to advertise the book -lrb- consciously or not -rrb- and how much more there is about grass ' military service i can not know .
yet it is unfortunate that grass ' works wo n't ever be read the same way . - boyan penev , germany this confession only confirms my suspicions that as whole the german society is plagued by hypocrisy and to continue to have a superiority complex .
this man became the icon of german left politics , claiming to have the role as moral conscious of the modern world .
that günter grass lied to germany in this matter and that germany and germans believed him , only speaks that germany and german have no moral superiority with which to admonish the world on what is righteous or to show the world which is the ethical path .
recently germany , under chancellor gerhard schröder , again reclaimed the post of moral voice of the world by opposing and decrying the invasion of iraq by the us , britain and other nations .
the parochialism of german society continues as do the hypocrisy that permeates it .
unfortunately germans have not changed , but as we all know , the society that begot karl marx , friedrich engel and adolf hitler and company are nothing more than a bunch of liers and self-delusional people . - francisco a. olivas , nicaragua he should be stripped of the nobel prize , but not have his honorary citizenship of gdansk removed , because he was born there and he is a citizen of gdansk -lrb- danzig -rrb- .
whether we like it or not does not matter .
before we jump to conclusions , we need to investigate his role in the ss .
if grass proves not to be guilty , then all those who are " killing " grass owe him an apology in public . - danuta hejzner compiled by dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nobel prize winner grass under fire for belated ss confession nobel prize winning author günter grass is facing a backlash from contemporaries and commentators after he admitted that he was drafted into nazi germany 's notorious waffen ss elite force during world war ii .
-lrb- aug .
14 , 2006 -rrb- opinion : a late confession is better than no confession at all it is inexcusable that günter grass kept silent about his involvement with the waffen ss combat troops during world war ii .
but he at least admitted his own hypocrisy , said dw-world.de 's toma tasovac .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . the man , if judged at all , should be - as any person - judged by his entire life and what he accomplished , not what happened when one was 17 years old .
it is time to put to rest this stigma of those years and let the young people of today look to the future that is " theirs . "
who are we to judge at all as we all live in " glass houses . " - robert j. patulski , us ralph giordano hit the nail on the head .
no man is perfect , and given that , we should be happy that günter grass has come to terms with himself , and with germany .
let he who has not sinned cast the first stone .
he did what anyone would do , and did .
there are legions of these boys who were inducted in 1944 and 1945 at a young age , who are now 77 , 78 , 79 and dying .
i feel that germany should make clear to grass and to these many other soldier-citizens that there was no moral fault on their part for serving their country .
there is no salvation for the upper echelons of the hitler / nazi government - but there should be heartfelt and very open forgiveness expressed to these one-time youngsters . - wiley horne , us i believe günter grass should have much earlier revealed his past and should not have kept it hidden for the last 61 years .
i think he did not confess it earlier fearing that such a confession would prevent him from getting the nobel prize , which he eventually got in 1999 .
this whole episode only shows his hypocrisy and double-speak . - pialy mazumder , india it 's a sad thing that one of germany 's most famous authors , if not people , of the 20th century has come under such wide criticism .
unfortunately , this criticism in not quite undeserved .
it is not shameful to change your convictions , especially after a catastrophe as world war ii .
it is not shameful to call for openness on the topic ; in fact , there has probably been too much left unsaid .
however , it is a blow to the atmosphere of honesty , and to the entire public , when one of the advocates of the openness and honesty has hid such a secret for so long .
whether this admission is sincere , whether it is timed to advertise the book -lrb- consciously or not -rrb- and how much more there is about grass ' military service i can not know .
yet it is unfortunate that grass ' works wo n't ever be read the same way . - boyan penev , germany this confession only confirms my suspicions that as whole the german society is plagued by hypocrisy and to continue to have a superiority complex .
this man became the icon of german left politics , claiming to have the role as moral conscious of the modern world .
that günter grass lied to germany in this matter and that germany and germans believed him , only speaks that germany and german have no moral superiority with which to admonish the world on what is righteous or to show the world which is the ethical path .
recently germany , under chancellor gerhard schröder , again reclaimed the post of moral voice of the world by opposing and decrying the invasion of iraq by the us , britain and other nations .
the parochialism of german society continues as do the hypocrisy that permeates it .
unfortunately germans have not changed , but as we all know , the society that begot karl marx , friedrich engel and adolf hitler and company are nothing more than a bunch of liers and self-delusional people . - francisco a. olivas , nicaragua he should be stripped of the nobel prize , but not have his honorary citizenship of gdansk removed , because he was born there and he is a citizen of gdansk -lrb- danzig -rrb- .
whether we like it or not does not matter .
before we jump to conclusions , we need to investigate his role in the ss .
if grass proves not to be guilty , then all those who are " killing " grass owe him an apology in public . - danuta hejzner compiled by dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nobel prize winner grass under fire for belated ss confession nobel prize winning author günter grass is facing a backlash from contemporaries and commentators after he admitted that he was drafted into nazi germany 's notorious waffen ss elite force during world war ii .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . the man , if judged at all , should be - as any person - judged by his entire life and what he accomplished , not what happened when one was 17 years old .
it is time to put to rest this stigma of those years and let the young people of today look to the future that is " theirs . "
who are we to judge at all as we all live in " glass houses . " - robert j. patulski , us ralph giordano hit the nail on the head .
no man is perfect , and given that , we should be happy that günter grass has come to terms with himself , and with germany .
let he who has not sinned cast the first stone .
he did what anyone would do , and did .
there are legions of these boys who were inducted in 1944 and 1945 at a young age , who are now 77 , 78 , 79 and dying .
i feel that germany should make clear to grass and to these many other soldier-citizens that there was no moral fault on their part for serving their country .
there is no salvation for the upper echelons of the hitler / nazi government - but there should be heartfelt and very open forgiveness expressed to these one-time youngsters . - wiley horne , us i believe günter grass should have much earlier revealed his past and should not have kept it hidden for the last 61 years .
i think he did not confess it earlier fearing that such a confession would prevent him from getting the nobel prize , which he eventually got in 1999 .
this whole episode only shows his hypocrisy and double-speak . - pialy mazumder , india it 's a sad thing that one of germany 's most famous authors , if not people , of the 20th century has come under such wide criticism .
unfortunately , this criticism in not quite undeserved .
it is not shameful to change your convictions , especially after a catastrophe as world war ii .
it is not shameful to call for openness on the topic ; in fact , there has probably been too much left unsaid .
however , it is a blow to the atmosphere of honesty , and to the entire public , when one of the advocates of the openness and honesty has hid such a secret for so long .
whether this admission is sincere , whether it is timed to advertise the book -lrb- consciously or not -rrb- and how much more there is about grass ' military service i can not know .
yet it is unfortunate that grass ' works wo n't ever be read the same way . - boyan penev , germany this confession only confirms my suspicions that as whole the german society is plagued by hypocrisy and to continue to have a superiority complex .
this man became the icon of german left politics , claiming to have the role as moral conscious of the modern world .
that günter grass lied to germany in this matter and that germany and germans believed him , only speaks that germany and german have no moral superiority with which to admonish the world on what is righteous or to show the world which is the ethical path .
recently germany , under chancellor gerhard schröder , again reclaimed the post of moral voice of the world by opposing and decrying the invasion of iraq by the us , britain and other nations .
the parochialism of german society continues as do the hypocrisy that permeates it .
unfortunately germans have not changed , but as we all know , the society that begot karl marx , friedrich engel and adolf hitler and company are nothing more than a bunch of liers and self-delusional people . - francisco a. olivas , nicaragua he should be stripped of the nobel prize , but not have his honorary citizenship of gdansk removed , because he was born there and he is a citizen of gdansk -lrb- danzig -rrb- .
whether we like it or not does not matter .
before we jump to conclusions , we need to investigate his role in the ss .
if grass proves not to be guilty , then all those who are " killing " grass owe him an apology in public . - danuta hejzner compiled by dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nobel prize winner grass under fire for belated ss confession nobel prize winning author günter grass is facing a backlash from contemporaries and commentators after he admitted that he was drafted into nazi germany 's notorious waffen ss elite force during world war ii .

their love of shoes , of course . one thing the world has learned from " sex and the city " is that shoes are much more than mere footwear .
one does n't simply wear one 's shoes .
one loves them .
and one lives in them .
shoes are a world that fashionable men and women inhabit : a kind of portable apartment that children , pets and annoying relatives are not allowed to visit . people who love their shoes live their life as if it were an expensive caribbean vacation .
that is why sarah jessica parker alias carrie bradshaw always feels like she 's walking not on air , but , much more literally , money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roman worriors loved their sandals extensive research into the social structure of ancient rome has led some classical scholars to reinterpret the old latin proverb omnia mea mecum porto .
for centuries , this old saying was translated as " i carry all my possession with me . "
it implied that our intellect is our most precious possession . new evidence , however , suggests two different ways of reading this ancient pearl of wisdom : " all that i have , i invest in my sandals " or " i wish i could carry all my sandals with me . "
in view of the newly discovered roman obsession with shoes , stoicism is currently undergoing a radical reappraisal . what 's the big deal ? manly men - who , according to a very reliable deutsche welle source on current trends , are back in the game again , since the metrosexual crowd seems to have wasted its 15 minutes of glory on unnecessary facial peels and eyebrow plucking - always liked to make fun of women for their shopping habits and obsession with fashion . manly men could never understand how shoes could become objects of affection .
they always equaled footwear with a particularly bizarre form of fetishism that is often encountered in those disturbing works of art known as the french cinema . although , times are changing . winds of change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actually , mr. beckenbauer , it 's a shoe members of the german national soccer team - the manliest and most heroic of all teutons - have broken the new ground by standing up for the men who love their shoes . the team , which put a big , cheesy smile on their country 's face by winning third place in the world cup this summer , threatened to boycott the game against sweden , scheduled for wednesday , if not allowed to wear their own shoes . some of the soccer players are , namely , sick and tired of the deal that the german soccer association has with adidas , which stipulated that the players must wear exclusively the shoes made by the german footwear maker and soccer sponsor until 2010 .
the horror !
it 's like telling sarah jessica parker to wear only dr. scholl 's for four years . doctor who ? war of the shoes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarah jessica parker -lrb- second from left -rrb- understands the plight of german soccer players this unheard-of attack on the soccer player 's inborn right to feel comfortable and look fabulous while kicking the ball could easily escalate into a real shoe war . after several rounds of serious negotiations with their soccer association , the players agreed to play the match against sweden , after all .
but they set a new ultimatum for the management to figure out how to get out of its contract with adidas , sept .
2 .
on that day , germany play ireland in a european cup qualifier . " we owe it to our fans , not to get out on the pitch with a decimated team , " said theo zwanziger , president of the german soccer association . come sept .
2 , we may see a more colorful and diverse collection of footwear on the soccer pitch .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 15.08.2006 discovering brecht 's forgotten manuscripts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht 's letter to helene weigel , part of the victor n. cohen collection it happens rarely that 50 years after the death of a writer , new and important manuscripts are discovered .
but this is exactly what happened in the case of the greatest dramatist of the 20th century , bertolt brecht . ahead of 50th anniversary of brecht 's death , the academy of the arts in berlin and its brecht archive announced that brecht 's manuscripts , which were discovered in switzerland several years ago , have been added to the archive 's collection .
this is the largest expansion of the internationally renowned archive since its founding in 1956 .
the archive is used by approximately 240 researchers every year . previously , it was believed that no new materials could be added to the archive of the most performed german dramatist in the world .
but new brecht materials include brecht 's and other author 's manuscripts , his notebooks , contracts , documents , passports , check books , bills and letters that he wrote or received . all of these , brecht left with his friend , union leader and graphic artist , victor .
n. cohen in 1949 in goldbach on the lake of zurich .
brecht , 51 at the time , was living in switzerland - after years of exile in scandinavia and the united states - and preparing for his return to east berlin .
cohen was a left-inclined social democrat who wrote articles for union newspapers and rand social democratic campaigns and referendums .
he died in 1975 . but it was not until the late 1990s that cohen 's sons actually became aware of the valuable collection . it 's all brecht ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht 's finnish passport " they had to empty a warehouse , because their contract had expired , " said erdmut wizisla of the brecht archive .
" and victor 's stuff was there .
when they opened it , they thought : good god !
this is all brecht !
and then they went on to the next box and found again - all brecht . " the negotiations with the owners lasted eight years .
they were completed successfully because the deutsche klassenlotterie foundation , the german research foundation and the academy of the arts agreed to jointly finance the purchase : 2,500 sheets of paper , which correspond to one fifth of brecht 's overall archival materials , and a typewriter now make up the victor n. cohen collection at the brecht archive . brecht 's wife helena weigel , who meticulously collected brecht 's unpublished writings after his death , seems to have completely forgotten about the materials which were left in switzerland .
brecht himself obviously did n't miss these materials after he returned to germany .
they document above all the time he spent in switzerland , but also shed some light on his exile years in the united states and , to a lesser extent , his earlier periods . new and spectacular bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht left the us in 1947 after testifying before the committee on un-american activities in washington , dc the swiss materials include two previously unknown drafts of the play " the caucasian chalk circle , " several short stories , an idea for a novel as well as political and theatrical essays .
among them is a prose text " my unforgettable character , " in which brecht , similar to what he did in the play the " the resistible rise of arturo ui , " makes a caricature out of hitler . the manuscripts also show that , while in the states , brecht was involved with the council for a democratic germany .
this association of german emigrants was founded in 1944 in response to the national committee free germany , which was based in the soviet union .
brecht composed opinions and letters , in which he urged prominent germans - such as writer alfred döblin - to become engaged .
the council was a temporary coalition which already during the war supported the idea of a unified germany with the possibility of a sovereign inner and foreign policy . theater plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht and his wife helene weigel are buried in berlin the materials also show the enthusiasm with which brecht was preparing for his work in the theater in post-war germany .
he corresponded with his friends and colleagues in germany , directors , actors and german as well as russian cultural officials .
he wanted to adapt all his plays in view of the end of the war .
" arturo ui " was the only play that brecht believed - because of its genre as a farce - as fitting for the stage confrontation with the nazi rule . despite the fact that brecht 's exile years were difficult and marked by lack of success , the 350 letters in the collection paint a picture of a self-confident and self-assertive poet . publications based on the new materials have already been announced .
in addition to brecht 's letters to helena weigel from 1923 to 1956 , german publishing house suhrkamp is also planning to publish a 150-page-long appendix to werner hecht 's 1997 chronicle , which documented brecht 's life from day to day . hecht sees a number of exciting challenges for brecht researchers . " it is , of course , peculiar that brecht was caught in the interpretation struggle between the east and the west , " hecht said .
" now is the time to paint an objective picture of brecht .
that is why discoveries of this kind are of such great value . " dunja welke -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de celebrating bertolt brecht click here for dw-world.de 's dossier on brecht 's life and international influence .

but when brecht himself tried to become a hollywood screenwriter , he failed miserably .

but this is exactly what happened in the case of the greatest dramatist of the 20th century , bertolt brecht . ahead of 50th anniversary of brecht 's death , the academy of the arts in berlin and its brecht archive announced that brecht 's manuscripts , which were discovered in switzerland several years ago , have been added to the archive 's collection .
this is the largest expansion of the internationally renowned archive since its founding in 1956 .
the archive is used by approximately 240 researchers every year . previously , it was believed that no new materials could be added to the archive of the most performed german dramatist in the world .
but new brecht materials include brecht 's and other author 's manuscripts , his notebooks , contracts , documents , passports , check books , bills and letters that he wrote or received . all of these , brecht left with his friend , union leader and graphic artist , victor .
n. cohen in 1949 in goldbach on the lake of zurich .
brecht , 51 at the time , was living in switzerland - after years of exile in scandinavia and the united states - and preparing for his return to east berlin .
cohen was a left-inclined social democrat who wrote articles for union newspapers and rand social democratic campaigns and referendums .
he died in 1975 . but it was not until the late 1990s that cohen 's sons actually became aware of the valuable collection . it 's all brecht ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht 's finnish passport " they had to empty a warehouse , because their contract had expired , " said erdmut wizisla of the brecht archive .
" and victor 's stuff was there .
when they opened it , they thought : good god !
this is all brecht !
and then they went on to the next box and found again - all brecht . " the negotiations with the owners lasted eight years .
they were completed successfully because the deutsche klassenlotterie foundation , the german research foundation and the academy of the arts agreed to jointly finance the purchase : 2,500 sheets of paper , which correspond to one fifth of brecht 's overall archival materials , and a typewriter now make up the victor n. cohen collection at the brecht archive . brecht 's wife helena weigel , who meticulously collected brecht 's unpublished writings after his death , seems to have completely forgotten about the materials which were left in switzerland .
brecht himself obviously did n't miss these materials after he returned to germany .
they document above all the time he spent in switzerland , but also shed some light on his exile years in the united states and , to a lesser extent , his earlier periods . new and spectacular bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht left the us in 1947 after testifying before the committee on un-american activities in washington , dc the swiss materials include two previously unknown drafts of the play " the caucasian chalk circle , " several short stories , an idea for a novel as well as political and theatrical essays .
among them is a prose text " my unforgettable character , " in which brecht , similar to what he did in the play the " the resistible rise of arturo ui , " makes a caricature out of hitler . the manuscripts also show that , while in the states , brecht was involved with the council for a democratic germany .
this association of german emigrants was founded in 1944 in response to the national committee free germany , which was based in the soviet union .
brecht composed opinions and letters , in which he urged prominent germans - such as writer alfred döblin - to become engaged .
the council was a temporary coalition which already during the war supported the idea of a unified germany with the possibility of a sovereign inner and foreign policy . theater plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht and his wife helene weigel are buried in berlin the materials also show the enthusiasm with which brecht was preparing for his work in the theater in post-war germany .
he corresponded with his friends and colleagues in germany , directors , actors and german as well as russian cultural officials .
he wanted to adapt all his plays in view of the end of the war .
" arturo ui " was the only play that brecht believed - because of its genre as a farce - as fitting for the stage confrontation with the nazi rule . despite the fact that brecht 's exile years were difficult and marked by lack of success , the 350 letters in the collection paint a picture of a self-confident and self-assertive poet . publications based on the new materials have already been announced .
in addition to brecht 's letters to helena weigel from 1923 to 1956 , german publishing house suhrkamp is also planning to publish a 150-page-long appendix to werner hecht 's 1997 chronicle , which documented brecht 's life from day to day . hecht sees a number of exciting challenges for brecht researchers . " it is , of course , peculiar that brecht was caught in the interpretation struggle between the east and the west , " hecht said .
" now is the time to paint an objective picture of brecht .
that is why discoveries of this kind are of such great value . " dunja welke -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de celebrating bertolt brecht click here for dw-world.de 's dossier on brecht 's life and international influence .

but he at least admitted his own hypocrisy , said dw-world.de 's toma tasovac . oskar matzerath , the obscene and earth-bound narrator of grass 's most famous novel " the tin drum " willfully stopped growing at the age of three and , hence , observed the world from the vantage point of a child , looking up from below .
günter grass himself , on the other hand , always acted as if he had somehow grown taller than the rest of the world ; as if his head was , in fact , dwelling in a stratosphere of pure , guiltless thought ; a moral emporium beyond anybody else 's reach . in post-war germany , günter grass became a moral institution and a powerful force of reflection on what it meant to have had a nazi past .
as " the conscience of the post-war generation , " grass made a significant contribution to germany 's development into an open , democratic society that it is today . yet it is in the nature of any authority - whether it 's moral , political or military - to be talking down to its subjects .
günter grass has been talking down to germans for decades : when he , for a long time , looked favorably towards the soviet union while turning a blind eye toward the prison house that was the german democratic republic ; when he allowed himself to be shocked by the way east germans abandoned their socialist dreams and rushed across the border in pursuit of capitalist commodities ; when he said that the two germanys should not be united because germans had every reason to fear themselves as a unit . günter grass always knew better . a shocking revelation which is why his belated confession that he had been a member of the notorious waffen ss combat troops - admittedly , as a 17-year-old boy in 1944 - has come as such a shock to everybody , both in germany and abroad .
people do n't like to see the untouchables strip themselves naked .
if anything , people like to do the mud-dragging themselves . it is absolutely inexcusable that günter grass waited more than half of a century to come clean , after having spent that same half of a century teaching germans the moral imperative of coming to terms with their past .
it is disappointing and discomforting that grass , who once spoke passionately about the need of " preventing the past from coming to an end , " kept his own past hidden away for so long .
it is sad and embarrassing to see a man of his stature resort to sentimentality -lrb- " i have carried this blemish for 60 years " -rrb- or narcissism - he described the current avalanche of criticism on him as " an attempt at turning him into an non-person . " yet if anybody ever believed in the infallibility of günter grass as a kind of leftist answer to the holy father , then they were simply too naive for their own good .
infallibility is not a human trait . the end of a moral authority some commentators have pointed out that grass 's literary oeuvre will need to be completely reevaluated .
this is hardly true .
his monumental literary achievement will not be shaken one bit by the revelation of his weakness as a human being . those who - like wolfgang börnsen , the parliamentary spokesman on cultural affairs for the conservative christian democratic union - believe that grass should " honorably return the -lrb- nobel -rrb- prize " - are still unable to come to terms with a simple fact that günter grass , the writer , günter grass , the moralist , and günter grass , the father who did n't tell his children that he was a member of the waffen ss , are not the same persona and deserve to be seen and judged independently .
the fall of the moralist is not the fall of the writer . when all is said and done , however , it should be remembered that it was grass alone who revealed his own hypocrisy .
when he came out with the story - which will , no doubt , help him increase the sales of his forthcoming autobiography - he also decided that truth was more important than the comfort of secrecy .

but he at least admitted his own hypocrisy , said dw-world.de 's toma tasovac . oskar matzerath , the obscene and earth-bound narrator of grass 's most famous novel " the tin drum " willfully stopped growing at the age of three and , hence , observed the world from the vantage point of a child , looking up from below .
günter grass himself , on the other hand , always acted as if he had somehow grown taller than the rest of the world ; as if his head was , in fact , dwelling in a stratosphere of pure , guiltless thought ; a moral emporium beyond anybody else 's reach . in post-war germany , günter grass became a moral institution and a powerful force of reflection on what it meant to have had a nazi past .
as " the conscience of the post-war generation , " grass made a significant contribution to germany 's development into an open , democratic society that it is today . yet it is in the nature of any authority - whether it 's moral , political or military - to be talking down to its subjects .
günter grass has been talking down to germans for decades : when he , for a long time , looked favorably towards the soviet union while turning a blind eye toward the prison house that was the german democratic republic ; when he allowed himself to be shocked by the way east germans abandoned their socialist dreams and rushed across the border in pursuit of capitalist commodities ; when he said that the two germanys should not be united because germans had every reason to fear themselves as a unit . günter grass always knew better . a shocking revelation which is why his belated confession that he had been a member of the notorious waffen ss combat troops - admittedly , as a 17-year-old boy in 1944 - has come as such a shock to everybody , both in germany and abroad .
people do n't like to see the untouchables strip themselves naked .
if anything , people like to do the mud-dragging themselves . it is absolutely inexcusable that günter grass waited more than half of a century to come clean , after having spent that same half of a century teaching germans the moral imperative of coming to terms with their past .
it is disappointing and discomforting that grass , who once spoke passionately about the need of " preventing the past from coming to an end , " kept his own past hidden away for so long .
it is sad and embarrassing to see a man of his stature resort to sentimentality -lrb- " i have carried this blemish for 60 years " -rrb- or narcissism - he described the current avalanche of criticism on him as " an attempt at turning him into an non-person . " yet if anybody ever believed in the infallibility of günter grass as a kind of leftist answer to the holy father , then they were simply too naive for their own good .
infallibility is not a human trait . the end of a moral authority some commentators have pointed out that grass 's literary oeuvre will need to be completely reevaluated .
this is hardly true .
his monumental literary achievement will not be shaken one bit by the revelation of his weakness as a human being . those who - like wolfgang börnsen , the parliamentary spokesman on cultural affairs for the conservative christian democratic union - believe that grass should " honorably return the -lrb- nobel -rrb- prize " - are still unable to come to terms with a simple fact that günter grass , the writer , günter grass , the moralist , and günter grass , the father who did n't tell his children that he was a member of the waffen ss , are not the same persona and deserve to be seen and judged independently .
the fall of the moralist is not the fall of the writer . when all is said and done , however , it should be remembered that it was grass alone who revealed his own hypocrisy .
when he came out with the story - which will , no doubt , help him increase the sales of his forthcoming autobiography - he also decided that truth was more important than the comfort of secrecy .

with less than a day remaining , residents of delmenhorst near bremen are waiting with bated breath to see if efforts to raise the 3.4 million euros -lrb- $ 4.2 million -rrb- to buy a local hotel have been successful .
otherwise , the now empty hotel am stadtpark will become the property of a neo-nazi group .
in the past week , the ticker on the web site www.fuer-delmenhorst.de detailing donations has steadily risen .
as of tuesday afternoon , it reached 679,486 euros .
still , even with a matching town donation of 2 million euros , delmenhorst is coming up short .
but townsfolk said they remain hopeful .
" every euro makes a difference , " mayor carsten schwettmann said in a statement .
" it is a sign of the solidarity and commitment of the town . "
" nein " to neo-nazis the initiative began after hamburg lawyer jürgen rieger made an offer to buy the hotel , which is prominently situated across from the town hall in the center of the town .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 100-room hotel am stadtpark is at the center of the controversy rieger made an offer for the building on behalf of the wilhelm tietjen foundation for fertilization ltd , a mysterious group registered in london that promotes racial purity .
the organization is named for a rich nazi from bremen who died childless in 2002 .
the lawyer , who has defended a number of neo-nazis including holocaust denier ernst zündel and is known for speaking at neo-nazi rallies honoring hitler 's deputy rudolf hess , reportedly aims to transform the hotel into a neo-nazi center for research and conferences .
rieger , who owns property in hamburg , thuringia , a former german military building in dörverden near bremen as well as in sweden , has not said publicly why he wants to buy the hotel in the lower saxony town of fewer than 80,000 people .
he was unavailable for comment .
fighting fire with fire town officials said there is little they can do to prevent the sale other than offer the 2 million euros from their already-stretched budget , adding that their efforts to convince property owner günter mergel not to sell to rieger have been unsuccessful .
" we can not stop the current owner from selling to whomever he wants , " schwettmann told reporters .
" but i am proud of the solidarity the townspeople have shown in the past days . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lawyer jürgen rieger is well-known for his neo-nazi activities mergel , who told focus magazine that the empty 100-room hotel is bleeding him dry financially , said he has no choice : " i am up to my neck in hot water . "
" a crazy idea " as a result , locals took the burden into their own hands .
they have staged protests , held fundraisers such as " barbeques against the right " and rallies featuring rock music .
they have created petitions and weblogs and planned exhibitions .
more than 3,000 people from the town and around germany have donated to delmenhorst 's cause via a web page that launched on aug .
4 .
" it might be a crazy idea , " said town resident günter feith , a 58-year-old architect and founder of the initiative .
" but we are doing it anyway .
we have to . "
feith said at first , there were doubts about the chance of successfully derailing the sale .
but now , as thousands of euros pour in , those doubts are dissipating .
" we have a good chance of succeeding , " he said .
" besides , i do n't want to think about what happens if we do n't .

but this is exactly what happened in the case of the greatest dramatist of the 20th century , bertolt brecht . ahead of 50th anniversary of brecht 's death , the academy of the arts in berlin and its brecht archive announced that brecht 's manuscripts , which were discovered in switzerland several years ago , have been added to the archive 's collection .
this is the largest expansion of the internationally renowned archive since its founding in 1956 .
the archive is used by approximately 240 researchers every year . previously , it was believed that no new materials could be added to the archive of the most performed german dramatist in the world .
but new brecht materials include brecht 's and other author 's manuscripts , his notebooks , contracts , documents , passports , check books , bills and letters that he wrote or received . all of these , brecht left with his friend , union leader and graphic artist , victor .
n. cohen in 1949 in goldbach on the lake of zurich .
brecht , 51 at the time , was living in switzerland - after years of exile in scandinavia and the united states - and preparing for his return to east berlin .
cohen was a left-inclined social democrat who wrote articles for union newspapers and rand social democratic campaigns and referendums .
he died in 1975 . but it was not until the late 1990s that cohen 's sons actually became aware of the valuable collection . it 's all brecht ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht 's finnish passport " they had to empty a warehouse , because their contract had expired , " said erdmut wizisla of the brecht archive .
" and victor 's stuff was there .
when they opened it , they thought : good god !
this is all brecht !
and then they went on to the next box and found again - all brecht . " the negotiations with the owners lasted eight years .
they were completed successfully because the deutsche klassenlotterie foundation , the german research foundation and the academy of the arts agreed to jointly finance the purchase : 2,500 sheets of paper , which correspond to one fifth of brecht 's overall archival materials , and a typewriter now make up the victor n. cohen collection at the brecht archive . brecht 's wife helena weigel , who meticulously collected brecht 's unpublished writings after his death , seems to have completely forgotten about the materials which were left in switzerland .
brecht himself obviously did n't miss these materials after he returned to germany .
they document above all the time he spent in switzerland , but also shed some light on his exile years in the united states and , to a lesser extent , his earlier periods . new and spectacular bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht left the us in 1947 after testifying before the committee on un-american activities in washington , dc the swiss materials include two previously unknown drafts of the play " the caucasian chalk circle , " several short stories , an idea for a novel as well as political and theatrical essays .
among them is a prose text " my unforgettable character , " in which brecht , similar to what he did in the play the " the resistible rise of arturo ui , " makes a caricature out of hitler . the manuscripts also show that , while in the states , brecht was involved with the council for a democratic germany .
this association of german emigrants was founded in 1944 in response to the national committee free germany , which was based in the soviet union .
brecht composed opinions and letters , in which he urged prominent germans - such as writer alfred döblin - to become engaged .
the council was a temporary coalition which already during the war supported the idea of a unified germany with the possibility of a sovereign inner and foreign policy . theater plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht and his wife helene weigel are buried in berlin the materials also show the enthusiasm with which brecht was preparing for his work in the theater in post-war germany .
he corresponded with his friends and colleagues in germany , directors , actors and german as well as russian cultural officials .
he wanted to adapt all his plays in view of the end of the war .
" arturo ui " was the only play that brecht believed - because of its genre as a farce - as fitting for the stage confrontation with the nazi rule . despite the fact that brecht 's exile years were difficult and marked by lack of success , the 350 letters in the collection paint a picture of a self-confident and self-assertive poet . publications based on the new materials have already been announced .
in addition to brecht 's letters to helena weigel from 1923 to 1956 , german publishing house suhrkamp is also planning to publish a 150-page-long appendix to werner hecht 's 1997 chronicle , which documented brecht 's life from day to day . hecht sees a number of exciting challenges for brecht researchers . " it is , of course , peculiar that brecht was caught in the interpretation struggle between the east and the west , " hecht said .
" now is the time to paint an objective picture of brecht .
that is why discoveries of this kind are of such great value . " dunja welke -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de celebrating bertolt brecht click here for dw-world.de 's dossier on brecht 's life and international influence .

but when brecht himself tried to become a hollywood screenwriter , he failed miserably .

their love of shoes , of course . one thing the world has learned from " sex and the city " is that shoes are much more than mere footwear .
one does n't simply wear one 's shoes .
one loves them .
and one lives in them .
shoes are a world that fashionable men and women inhabit : a kind of portable apartment that children , pets and annoying relatives are not allowed to visit . people who love their shoes live their life as if it were an expensive caribbean vacation .
that is why sarah jessica parker alias carrie bradshaw always feels like she 's walking not on air , but , much more literally , money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roman worriors loved their sandals extensive research into the social structure of ancient rome has led some classical scholars to reinterpret the old latin proverb omnia mea mecum porto .
for centuries , this old saying was translated as " i carry all my possession with me . "
it implied that our intellect is our most precious possession . new evidence , however , suggests two different ways of reading this ancient pearl of wisdom : " all that i have , i invest in my sandals " or " i wish i could carry all my sandals with me . "
in view of the newly discovered roman obsession with shoes , stoicism is currently undergoing a radical reappraisal . what 's the big deal ? manly men - who , according to a very reliable deutsche welle source on current trends , are back in the game again , since the metrosexual crowd seems to have wasted its 15 minutes of glory on unnecessary facial peels and eyebrow plucking - always liked to make fun of women for their shopping habits and obsession with fashion . manly men could never understand how shoes could become objects of affection .
they always equaled footwear with a particularly bizarre form of fetishism that is often encountered in those disturbing works of art known as the french cinema . although , times are changing . winds of change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actually , mr. beckenbauer , it 's a shoe members of the german national soccer team - the manliest and most heroic of all teutons - have broken the new ground by standing up for the men who love their shoes . the team , which put a big , cheesy smile on their country 's face by winning third place in the world cup this summer , threatened to boycott the game against sweden , scheduled for wednesday , if not allowed to wear their own shoes . some of the soccer players are , namely , sick and tired of the deal that the german soccer association has with adidas , which stipulated that the players must wear exclusively the shoes made by the german footwear maker and soccer sponsor until 2010 .
the horror !
it 's like telling sarah jessica parker to wear only dr. scholl 's for four years . doctor who ? war of the shoes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarah jessica parker -lrb- second from left -rrb- understands the plight of german soccer players this unheard-of attack on the soccer player 's inborn right to feel comfortable and look fabulous while kicking the ball could easily escalate into a real shoe war . after several rounds of serious negotiations with their soccer association , the players agreed to play the match against sweden , after all .
but they set a new ultimatum for the management to figure out how to get out of its contract with adidas , sept .
2 .
on that day , germany play ireland in a european cup qualifier . " we owe it to our fans , not to get out on the pitch with a decimated team , " said theo zwanziger , president of the german soccer association . come sept .
2 , we may see a more colorful and diverse collection of footwear on the soccer pitch .
or - if things go terribly wrong - a bunch of manly men fighting for their rights in high heels , carrying a poster which says : " sarah jessica parker is on our side .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : günter grass grass defends long silence as book sales soar nobel prize winner grass under fire for belated ss confession opinion : a late confession is better than no confession at all " i do n't hold onto ideological distortions " reader response -pipe- 15.08.2006 judging grass großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grass has described the controversy as an attempt to turn him into a " non-person " dw-world.de readers comment on the controversy regarding german author günter grass ' ss past . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . the man , if judged at all , should be - as any person - judged by his entire life and what he accomplished , not what happened when one was 17 years old .
it is time to put to rest this stigma of those years and let the young people of today look to the future that is " theirs . "
who are we to judge at all as we all live in " glass houses . " - robert j. patulski , us ralph giordano hit the nail on the head .
no man is perfect , and given that , we should be happy that günter grass has come to terms with himself , and with germany .
let he who has not sinned cast the first stone .
he did what anyone would do , and did .
there are legions of these boys who were inducted in 1944 and 1945 at a young age , who are now 77 , 78 , 79 and dying .
i feel that germany should make clear to grass and to these many other soldier-citizens that there was no moral fault on their part for serving their country .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . the man , if judged at all , should be - as any person - judged by his entire life and what he accomplished , not what happened when one was 17 years old .
it is time to put to rest this stigma of those years and let the young people of today look to the future that is " theirs . "
who are we to judge at all as we all live in " glass houses . " - robert j. patulski , us ralph giordano hit the nail on the head .
no man is perfect , and given that , we should be happy that günter grass has come to terms with himself , and with germany .
let he who has not sinned cast the first stone .
he did what anyone would do , and did .
there are legions of these boys who were inducted in 1944 and 1945 at a young age , who are now 77 , 78 , 79 and dying .
i feel that germany should make clear to grass and to these many other soldier-citizens that there was no moral fault on their part for serving their country .
there is no salvation for the upper echelons of the hitler / nazi government - but there should be heartfelt and very open forgiveness expressed to these one-time youngsters . - wiley horne , us i believe günter grass should have much earlier revealed his past and should not have kept it hidden for the last 61 years .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . the man , if judged at all , should be - as any person - judged by his entire life and what he accomplished , not what happened when one was 17 years old .
it is time to put to rest this stigma of those years and let the young people of today look to the future that is " theirs . "
who are we to judge at all as we all live in " glass houses . " - robert j. patulski , us ralph giordano hit the nail on the head .
no man is perfect , and given that , we should be happy that günter grass has come to terms with himself , and with germany .
let he who has not sinned cast the first stone .
he did what anyone would do , and did .
there are legions of these boys who were inducted in 1944 and 1945 at a young age , who are now 77 , 78 , 79 and dying .
i feel that germany should make clear to grass and to these many other soldier-citizens that there was no moral fault on their part for serving their country .
there is no salvation for the upper echelons of the hitler / nazi government - but there should be heartfelt and very open forgiveness expressed to these one-time youngsters . - wiley horne , us i believe günter grass should have much earlier revealed his past and should not have kept it hidden for the last 61 years .
i think he did not confess it earlier fearing that such a confession would prevent him from getting the nobel prize , which he eventually got in 1999 .
this whole episode only shows his hypocrisy and double-speak . - pialy mazumder , india it 's a sad thing that one of germany 's most famous authors , if not people , of the 20th century has come under such wide criticism .
unfortunately , this criticism in not quite undeserved .
it is not shameful to change your convictions , especially after a catastrophe as world war ii .
it is not shameful to call for openness on the topic ; in fact , there has probably been too much left unsaid .
however , it is a blow to the atmosphere of honesty , and to the entire public , when one of the advocates of the openness and honesty has hid such a secret for so long .
whether this admission is sincere , whether it is timed to advertise the book -lrb- consciously or not -rrb- and how much more there is about grass ' military service i can not know .
yet it is unfortunate that grass ' works wo n't ever be read the same way . - boyan penev , germany this confession only confirms my suspicions that as whole the german society is plagued by hypocrisy and to continue to have a superiority complex .
this man became the icon of german left politics , claiming to have the role as moral conscious of the modern world .
that günter grass lied to germany in this matter and that germany and germans believed him , only speaks that germany and german have no moral superiority with which to admonish the world on what is righteous or to show the world which is the ethical path .
recently germany , under chancellor gerhard schröder , again reclaimed the post of moral voice of the world by opposing and decrying the invasion of iraq by the us , britain and other nations .
the parochialism of german society continues as do the hypocrisy that permeates it .
unfortunately germans have not changed , but as we all know , the society that begot karl marx , friedrich engel and adolf hitler and company are nothing more than a bunch of liers and self-delusional people . - francisco a. olivas , nicaragua he should be stripped of the nobel prize , but not have his honorary citizenship of gdansk removed , because he was born there and he is a citizen of gdansk -lrb- danzig -rrb- .
whether we like it or not does not matter .
before we jump to conclusions , we need to investigate his role in the ss .
if grass proves not to be guilty , then all those who are " killing " grass owe him an apology in public . - danuta hejzner compiled by dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nobel prize winner grass under fire for belated ss confession nobel prize winning author günter grass is facing a backlash from contemporaries and commentators after he admitted that he was drafted into nazi germany 's notorious waffen ss elite force during world war ii .
-lrb- aug .
14 , 2006 -rrb- opinion : a late confession is better than no confession at all it is inexcusable that günter grass kept silent about his involvement with the waffen ss combat troops during world war ii .
but he at least admitted his own hypocrisy , said dw-world.de 's toma tasovac .

but this is exactly what happened in the case of the greatest dramatist of the 20th century , bertolt brecht . ahead of 50th anniversary of brecht 's death , the academy of the arts in berlin and its brecht archive announced that brecht 's manuscripts , which were discovered in switzerland several years ago , have been added to the archive 's collection .
this is the largest expansion of the internationally renowned archive since its founding in 1956 .
the archive is used by approximately 240 researchers every year . previously , it was believed that no new materials could be added to the archive of the most performed german dramatist in the world .
but new brecht materials include brecht 's and other author 's manuscripts , his notebooks , contracts , documents , passports , check books , bills and letters that he wrote or received . all of these , brecht left with his friend , union leader and graphic artist , victor .
n. cohen in 1949 in goldbach on the lake of zurich .
brecht , 51 at the time , was living in switzerland - after years of exile in scandinavia and the united states - and preparing for his return to east berlin .
cohen was a left-inclined social democrat who wrote articles for union newspapers and rand social democratic campaigns and referendums .
he died in 1975 . but it was not until the late 1990s that cohen 's sons actually became aware of the valuable collection . it 's all brecht ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht 's finnish passport " they had to empty a warehouse , because their contract had expired , " said erdmut wizisla of the brecht archive .
" and victor 's stuff was there .
when they opened it , they thought : good god !
this is all brecht !
and then they went on to the next box and found again - all brecht . " the negotiations with the owners lasted eight years .
they were completed successfully because the deutsche klassenlotterie foundation , the german research foundation and the academy of the arts agreed to jointly finance the purchase : 2,500 sheets of paper , which correspond to one fifth of brecht 's overall archival materials , and a typewriter now make up the victor n. cohen collection at the brecht archive . brecht 's wife helena weigel , who meticulously collected brecht 's unpublished writings after his death , seems to have completely forgotten about the materials which were left in switzerland .
brecht himself obviously did n't miss these materials after he returned to germany .
they document above all the time he spent in switzerland , but also shed some light on his exile years in the united states and , to a lesser extent , his earlier periods . new and spectacular bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht left the us in 1947 after testifying before the committee on un-american activities in washington , dc the swiss materials include two previously unknown drafts of the play " the caucasian chalk circle , " several short stories , an idea for a novel as well as political and theatrical essays .
among them is a prose text " my unforgettable character , " in which brecht , similar to what he did in the play the " the resistible rise of arturo ui , " makes a caricature out of hitler . the manuscripts also show that , while in the states , brecht was involved with the council for a democratic germany .
this association of german emigrants was founded in 1944 in response to the national committee free germany , which was based in the soviet union .
brecht composed opinions and letters , in which he urged prominent germans - such as writer alfred döblin - to become engaged .
the council was a temporary coalition which already during the war supported the idea of a unified germany with the possibility of a sovereign inner and foreign policy . theater plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht and his wife helene weigel are buried in berlin the materials also show the enthusiasm with which brecht was preparing for his work in the theater in post-war germany .
he corresponded with his friends and colleagues in germany , directors , actors and german as well as russian cultural officials .
he wanted to adapt all his plays in view of the end of the war .
" arturo ui " was the only play that brecht believed - because of its genre as a farce - as fitting for the stage confrontation with the nazi rule . despite the fact that brecht 's exile years were difficult and marked by lack of success , the 350 letters in the collection paint a picture of a self-confident and self-assertive poet . publications based on the new materials have already been announced .
in addition to brecht 's letters to helena weigel from 1923 to 1956 , german publishing house suhrkamp is also planning to publish a 150-page-long appendix to werner hecht 's 1997 chronicle , which documented brecht 's life from day to day . hecht sees a number of exciting challenges for brecht researchers . " it is , of course , peculiar that brecht was caught in the interpretation struggle between the east and the west , " hecht said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 15.08.2006 discovering brecht 's forgotten manuscripts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht 's letter to helene weigel , part of the victor n. cohen collection it happens rarely that 50 years after the death of a writer , new and important manuscripts are discovered .
but this is exactly what happened in the case of the greatest dramatist of the 20th century , bertolt brecht . ahead of 50th anniversary of brecht 's death , the academy of the arts in berlin and its brecht archive announced that brecht 's manuscripts , which were discovered in switzerland several years ago , have been added to the archive 's collection .
this is the largest expansion of the internationally renowned archive since its founding in 1956 .
the archive is used by approximately 240 researchers every year . previously , it was believed that no new materials could be added to the archive of the most performed german dramatist in the world .
but new brecht materials include brecht 's and other author 's manuscripts , his notebooks , contracts , documents , passports , check books , bills and letters that he wrote or received . all of these , brecht left with his friend , union leader and graphic artist , victor .
n. cohen in 1949 in goldbach on the lake of zurich .
brecht , 51 at the time , was living in switzerland - after years of exile in scandinavia and the united states - and preparing for his return to east berlin .
cohen was a left-inclined social democrat who wrote articles for union newspapers and rand social democratic campaigns and referendums .
he died in 1975 . but it was not until the late 1990s that cohen 's sons actually became aware of the valuable collection . it 's all brecht ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht 's finnish passport " they had to empty a warehouse , because their contract had expired , " said erdmut wizisla of the brecht archive .
" and victor 's stuff was there .
when they opened it , they thought : good god !
this is all brecht !
and then they went on to the next box and found again - all brecht . " the negotiations with the owners lasted eight years .
they were completed successfully because the deutsche klassenlotterie foundation , the german research foundation and the academy of the arts agreed to jointly finance the purchase : 2,500 sheets of paper , which correspond to one fifth of brecht 's overall archival materials , and a typewriter now make up the victor n. cohen collection at the brecht archive . brecht 's wife helena weigel , who meticulously collected brecht 's unpublished writings after his death , seems to have completely forgotten about the materials which were left in switzerland .
brecht himself obviously did n't miss these materials after he returned to germany .
they document above all the time he spent in switzerland , but also shed some light on his exile years in the united states and , to a lesser extent , his earlier periods . new and spectacular bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht left the us in 1947 after testifying before the committee on un-american activities in washington , dc the swiss materials include two previously unknown drafts of the play " the caucasian chalk circle , " several short stories , an idea for a novel as well as political and theatrical essays .
among them is a prose text " my unforgettable character , " in which brecht , similar to what he did in the play the " the resistible rise of arturo ui , " makes a caricature out of hitler . the manuscripts also show that , while in the states , brecht was involved with the council for a democratic germany .
this association of german emigrants was founded in 1944 in response to the national committee free germany , which was based in the soviet union .
brecht composed opinions and letters , in which he urged prominent germans - such as writer alfred döblin - to become engaged .
the council was a temporary coalition which already during the war supported the idea of a unified germany with the possibility of a sovereign inner and foreign policy . theater plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht and his wife helene weigel are buried in berlin the materials also show the enthusiasm with which brecht was preparing for his work in the theater in post-war germany .
he corresponded with his friends and colleagues in germany , directors , actors and german as well as russian cultural officials .
he wanted to adapt all his plays in view of the end of the war .
" arturo ui " was the only play that brecht believed - because of its genre as a farce - as fitting for the stage confrontation with the nazi rule . despite the fact that brecht 's exile years were difficult and marked by lack of success , the 350 letters in the collection paint a picture of a self-confident and self-assertive poet . publications based on the new materials have already been announced .
in addition to brecht 's letters to helena weigel from 1923 to 1956 , german publishing house suhrkamp is also planning to publish a 150-page-long appendix to werner hecht 's 1997 chronicle , which documented brecht 's life from day to day . hecht sees a number of exciting challenges for brecht researchers . " it is , of course , peculiar that brecht was caught in the interpretation struggle between the east and the west , " hecht said .

there are legions of these boys who were inducted in 1944 and 1945 at a young age , who are now 77 , 78 , 79 and dying .
i feel that germany should make clear to grass and to these many other soldier-citizens that there was no moral fault on their part for serving their country .
there is no salvation for the upper echelons of the hitler / nazi government - but there should be heartfelt and very open forgiveness expressed to these one-time youngsters . - wiley horne , us i believe günter grass should have much earlier revealed his past and should not have kept it hidden for the last 61 years .
i think he did not confess it earlier fearing that such a confession would prevent him from getting the nobel prize , which he eventually got in 1999 .
this whole episode only shows his hypocrisy and double-speak . - pialy mazumder , india it 's a sad thing that one of germany 's most famous authors , if not people , of the 20th century has come under such wide criticism .
unfortunately , this criticism in not quite undeserved .
it is not shameful to change your convictions , especially after a catastrophe as world war ii .
it is not shameful to call for openness on the topic ; in fact , there has probably been too much left unsaid .
however , it is a blow to the atmosphere of honesty , and to the entire public , when one of the advocates of the openness and honesty has hid such a secret for so long .
whether this admission is sincere , whether it is timed to advertise the book -lrb- consciously or not -rrb- and how much more there is about grass ' military service i can not know .
yet it is unfortunate that grass ' works wo n't ever be read the same way . - boyan penev , germany this confession only confirms my suspicions that as whole the german society is plagued by hypocrisy and to continue to have a superiority complex .
this man became the icon of german left politics , claiming to have the role as moral conscious of the modern world .
that günter grass lied to germany in this matter and that germany and germans believed him , only speaks that germany and german have no moral superiority with which to admonish the world on what is righteous or to show the world which is the ethical path .
recently germany , under chancellor gerhard schröder , again reclaimed the post of moral voice of the world by opposing and decrying the invasion of iraq by the us , britain and other nations .
the parochialism of german society continues as do the hypocrisy that permeates it .
unfortunately germans have not changed , but as we all know , the society that begot karl marx , friedrich engel and adolf hitler and company are nothing more than a bunch of liers and self-delusional people . - francisco a. olivas , nicaragua he should be stripped of the nobel prize , but not have his honorary citizenship of gdansk removed , because he was born there and he is a citizen of gdansk -lrb- danzig -rrb- .
whether we like it or not does not matter .
before we jump to conclusions , we need to investigate his role in the ss .
if grass proves not to be guilty , then all those who are " killing " grass owe him an apology in public . - danuta hejzner compiled by dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nobel prize winner grass under fire for belated ss confession nobel prize winning author günter grass is facing a backlash from contemporaries and commentators after he admitted that he was drafted into nazi germany 's notorious waffen ss elite force during world war ii .
-lrb- aug .
14 , 2006 -rrb- opinion : a late confession is better than no confession at all it is inexcusable that günter grass kept silent about his involvement with the waffen ss combat troops during world war ii .
but he at least admitted his own hypocrisy , said dw-world.de 's toma tasovac .

but this is exactly what happened in the case of the greatest dramatist of the 20th century , bertolt brecht . ahead of 50th anniversary of brecht 's death , the academy of the arts in berlin and its brecht archive announced that brecht 's manuscripts , which were discovered in switzerland several years ago , have been added to the archive 's collection .
this is the largest expansion of the internationally renowned archive since its founding in 1956 .
the archive is used by approximately 240 researchers every year . previously , it was believed that no new materials could be added to the archive of the most performed german dramatist in the world .
but new brecht materials include brecht 's and other author 's manuscripts , his notebooks , contracts , documents , passports , check books , bills and letters that he wrote or received . all of these , brecht left with his friend , union leader and graphic artist , victor .
n. cohen in 1949 in goldbach on the lake of zurich .
brecht , 51 at the time , was living in switzerland - after years of exile in scandinavia and the united states - and preparing for his return to east berlin .
cohen was a left-inclined social democrat who wrote articles for union newspapers and rand social democratic campaigns and referendums .
he died in 1975 . but it was not until the late 1990s that cohen 's sons actually became aware of the valuable collection . it 's all brecht ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht 's finnish passport " they had to empty a warehouse , because their contract had expired , " said erdmut wizisla of the brecht archive .
" and victor 's stuff was there .
when they opened it , they thought : good god !
this is all brecht !
and then they went on to the next box and found again - all brecht . " the negotiations with the owners lasted eight years .
they were completed successfully because the deutsche klassenlotterie foundation , the german research foundation and the academy of the arts agreed to jointly finance the purchase : 2,500 sheets of paper , which correspond to one fifth of brecht 's overall archival materials , and a typewriter now make up the victor n. cohen collection at the brecht archive . brecht 's wife helena weigel , who meticulously collected brecht 's unpublished writings after his death , seems to have completely forgotten about the materials which were left in switzerland .
brecht himself obviously did n't miss these materials after he returned to germany .
they document above all the time he spent in switzerland , but also shed some light on his exile years in the united states and , to a lesser extent , his earlier periods . new and spectacular bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht left the us in 1947 after testifying before the committee on un-american activities in washington , dc the swiss materials include two previously unknown drafts of the play " the caucasian chalk circle , " several short stories , an idea for a novel as well as political and theatrical essays .
among them is a prose text " my unforgettable character , " in which brecht , similar to what he did in the play the " the resistible rise of arturo ui , " makes a caricature out of hitler . the manuscripts also show that , while in the states , brecht was involved with the council for a democratic germany .
this association of german emigrants was founded in 1944 in response to the national committee free germany , which was based in the soviet union .
brecht composed opinions and letters , in which he urged prominent germans - such as writer alfred döblin - to become engaged .
the council was a temporary coalition which already during the war supported the idea of a unified germany with the possibility of a sovereign inner and foreign policy . theater plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht and his wife helene weigel are buried in berlin the materials also show the enthusiasm with which brecht was preparing for his work in the theater in post-war germany .
he corresponded with his friends and colleagues in germany , directors , actors and german as well as russian cultural officials .
he wanted to adapt all his plays in view of the end of the war .
" arturo ui " was the only play that brecht believed - because of its genre as a farce - as fitting for the stage confrontation with the nazi rule . despite the fact that brecht 's exile years were difficult and marked by lack of success , the 350 letters in the collection paint a picture of a self-confident and self-assertive poet . publications based on the new materials have already been announced .
in addition to brecht 's letters to helena weigel from 1923 to 1956 , german publishing house suhrkamp is also planning to publish a 150-page-long appendix to werner hecht 's 1997 chronicle , which documented brecht 's life from day to day . hecht sees a number of exciting challenges for brecht researchers . " it is , of course , peculiar that brecht was caught in the interpretation struggle between the east and the west , " hecht said .
" now is the time to paint an objective picture of brecht .
that is why discoveries of this kind are of such great value . " dunja welke -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de celebrating bertolt brecht click here for dw-world.de 's dossier on brecht 's life and international influence .
a communist in a city of angels he blamed the sunshine in la , which " shriveled up the brains of gifted writers leaving them incapable of anything but film-writing . "
but when brecht himself tried to become a hollywood screenwriter , he failed miserably .
-lrb- aug .
12 , 2006 -rrb- " bertolt brecht 's influence can not be overestimated " bertolt brecht 's dramas continue to touch audiences and spark political criticism around the world 50 years after his death .
he carped on capitalism and did n't mesh with the gdr - most importantly , he entertained .

he also co-wrote " aggression and war : their biological and social bases , " which dissects human aggression and war .
until recently , he was the director general of the european institute for the media .
dw-world.de : in a general sense , what have you observed from the current conflict in the middle east and the role that the media has played ?
jo groebel : in the middle east there is the situation of political violence and the role of individual versus national aggression .
are these the actions of individuals who are caught up in the continual fighting or individual acts of violence ?
the role of communication and media in these situations shows that there is a certain unbalance .
they were not presented as victims on the israeli side , and people reacted to individual pictures - especially from hezbollah - which were presented differently to israel .
my assumption is that israel cared less about public opinion and people started to feel more sympathetic to hezbollah , which was a reaction to the images of violence and death that were shown on the hezbollah side .
although these events were still present on the israel side , they were not shown as constantly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : use of media for propaganda : hezbollah television al -manar what is your perception of the recent coverage of the conflict in lebanon ?
there is the whole question of what gets more attention - war or peace ?
the problem is that by being violent you get more attention , and this is has more news value .
people are more interested in the negatives than the positives .
from a rewards point of view , getting more attention means more publicity of the cause .
in this conflict , at the moment , there has been confirmation , especially from the hezbollah side , that there has been manipulation of media by showing certain images .
a few years ago , there was footage of a young child looking into the camera and this same type of image appeared recently in lebanon , whether this is a coincidence is questionable .
one tends to compare the recent conflicts to what happened in iraq about three years ago , where there were major discussions about the reporting and embedded journalists who were working in iraq .
in the case of recent events the discussion only started a couple of days ago , before that there was no discussion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an embedded time magazine journalist has up close experience with war in iraq there are three main issues that have influenced the coverage of the current conflict .
firstly , this is considered another kind of war .
people are used to seeing conflict , but unlike iraq , which held bad public opinion , the conflict in lebanon was not a surprise and inevitably lacked extreme impact .
secondly , people expect propaganda and therefore could be immune to , or even cynical about , the images that they see in this conflict because of the images that came from iraq .
thirdly , people get used to this sort of conflict .
if more people had died , it would have made big news .
in the case of germany 's coverage , it was in the news every 24 hours and there was permanent coverage .
however , for other european news it was amongst the top stories of the regular news bulletin , but there was not much more than coverage .
considering the recent development of a peace deal between the fighting parties , how do you think media audiences take this sort of outcome , in light of what you said previously about the expectation of conflict in the region ?
my assumption is that no one will assume that peace will happen .
however , all the sides that are involved in the conflict have both confirmed their will to act and to open dialogue .
there is some credibility to this process and hope for periodical peace .
but there is no assuming that this is will be certain .
are there any notable differences of the media coverage for the israel and hezbollah conflict compared to other conflicts around the world ?
what i find particularly interesting is the use of what is called amateur or informal media , like weblogs , web images and such , that has been applied in professional conflict reporting .
this has meant anyone who has access to camera and the internet , can post pictures on the web .
if you receive an image from someone who is actually there and has actual images , that can seem to be more credible information .
however , there are ethical dilemmas with this situation and ideally , a journalist is the one doing the stories and taking the pictures , because they are working by a code of ethics and have a certain standard of objectivity and do not have the same local ties as someone living there .
this is important , to be cautious about amateur photographs , because they can be digitally changed and manipulated and the impact that the pictures publicized by hezbollah have are an example of this . rachel ryan interviewed jo groebel send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : " it 's a long way to peace " in accordance with un resolution 1701 , a ceasefire in the conflict between israel and hezbollah in lebanon came into effect on monday morning .

until recently , he was the director general of the european institute for the media .
dw-world.de : in a general sense , what have you observed from the current conflict in the middle east and the role that the media has played ?
jo groebel : in the middle east there is the situation of political violence and the role of individual versus national aggression .
are these the actions of individuals who are caught up in the continual fighting or individual acts of violence ?
the role of communication and media in these situations shows that there is a certain unbalance .
they were not presented as victims on the israeli side , and people reacted to individual pictures - especially from hezbollah - which were presented differently to israel .
my assumption is that israel cared less about public opinion and people started to feel more sympathetic to hezbollah , which was a reaction to the images of violence and death that were shown on the hezbollah side .
although these events were still present on the israel side , they were not shown as constantly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : use of media for propaganda : hezbollah television al -manar what is your perception of the recent coverage of the conflict in lebanon ?
there is the whole question of what gets more attention - war or peace ?
the problem is that by being violent you get more attention , and this is has more news value .
people are more interested in the negatives than the positives .
from a rewards point of view , getting more attention means more publicity of the cause .
in this conflict , at the moment , there has been confirmation , especially from the hezbollah side , that there has been manipulation of media by showing certain images .
a few years ago , there was footage of a young child looking into the camera and this same type of image appeared recently in lebanon , whether this is a coincidence is questionable .
one tends to compare the recent conflicts to what happened in iraq about three years ago , where there were major discussions about the reporting and embedded journalists who were working in iraq .
in the case of recent events the discussion only started a couple of days ago , before that there was no discussion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an embedded time magazine journalist has up close experience with war in iraq there are three main issues that have influenced the coverage of the current conflict .
firstly , this is considered another kind of war .
people are used to seeing conflict , but unlike iraq , which held bad public opinion , the conflict in lebanon was not a surprise and inevitably lacked extreme impact .
secondly , people expect propaganda and therefore could be immune to , or even cynical about , the images that they see in this conflict because of the images that came from iraq .
thirdly , people get used to this sort of conflict .
if more people had died , it would have made big news .
in the case of germany 's coverage , it was in the news every 24 hours and there was permanent coverage .
however , for other european news it was amongst the top stories of the regular news bulletin , but there was not much more than coverage .
considering the recent development of a peace deal between the fighting parties , how do you think media audiences take this sort of outcome , in light of what you said previously about the expectation of conflict in the region ?
my assumption is that no one will assume that peace will happen .
however , all the sides that are involved in the conflict have both confirmed their will to act and to open dialogue .
there is some credibility to this process and hope for periodical peace .
but there is no assuming that this is will be certain .
are there any notable differences of the media coverage for the israel and hezbollah conflict compared to other conflicts around the world ?
what i find particularly interesting is the use of what is called amateur or informal media , like weblogs , web images and such , that has been applied in professional conflict reporting .
this has meant anyone who has access to camera and the internet , can post pictures on the web .
if you receive an image from someone who is actually there and has actual images , that can seem to be more credible information .
however , there are ethical dilemmas with this situation and ideally , a journalist is the one doing the stories and taking the pictures , because they are working by a code of ethics and have a certain standard of objectivity and do not have the same local ties as someone living there .
this is important , to be cautious about amateur photographs , because they can be digitally changed and manipulated and the impact that the pictures publicized by hezbollah have are an example of this . rachel ryan interviewed jo groebel send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : " it 's a long way to peace " in accordance with un resolution 1701 , a ceasefire in the conflict between israel and hezbollah in lebanon came into effect on monday morning .

with less than a day remaining , residents of delmenhorst near bremen are waiting with bated breath to see if efforts to raise the 3.4 million euros -lrb- $ 4.2 million -rrb- to buy a local hotel have been successful .
otherwise , the now empty hotel am stadtpark will become the property of a neo-nazi group .
in the past week , the ticker on the web site www.fuer-delmenhorst.de detailing donations has steadily risen .

he was unavailable for comment .
fighting fire with fire town officials said there is little they can do to prevent the sale other than offer the 2 million euros from their already-stretched budget , adding that their efforts to convince property owner günter mergel not to sell to rieger have been unsuccessful .

but he at least admitted his own hypocrisy , said dw-world.de 's toma tasovac . oskar matzerath , the obscene and earth-bound narrator of grass 's most famous novel " the tin drum " willfully stopped growing at the age of three and , hence , observed the world from the vantage point of a child , looking up from below .
günter grass himself , on the other hand , always acted as if he had somehow grown taller than the rest of the world ; as if his head was , in fact , dwelling in a stratosphere of pure , guiltless thought ; a moral emporium beyond anybody else 's reach . in post-war germany , günter grass became a moral institution and a powerful force of reflection on what it meant to have had a nazi past .
as " the conscience of the post-war generation , " grass made a significant contribution to germany 's development into an open , democratic society that it is today . yet it is in the nature of any authority - whether it 's moral , political or military - to be talking down to its subjects .
günter grass has been talking down to germans for decades : when he , for a long time , looked favorably towards the soviet union while turning a blind eye toward the prison house that was the german democratic republic ; when he allowed himself to be shocked by the way east germans abandoned their socialist dreams and rushed across the border in pursuit of capitalist commodities ; when he said that the two germanys should not be united because germans had every reason to fear themselves as a unit . günter grass always knew better . a shocking revelation which is why his belated confession that he had been a member of the notorious waffen ss combat troops - admittedly , as a 17-year-old boy in 1944 - has come as such a shock to everybody , both in germany and abroad .
people do n't like to see the untouchables strip themselves naked .
if anything , people like to do the mud-dragging themselves . it is absolutely inexcusable that günter grass waited more than half of a century to come clean , after having spent that same half of a century teaching germans the moral imperative of coming to terms with their past .
it is disappointing and discomforting that grass , who once spoke passionately about the need of " preventing the past from coming to an end , " kept his own past hidden away for so long .
it is sad and embarrassing to see a man of his stature resort to sentimentality -lrb- " i have carried this blemish for 60 years " -rrb- or narcissism - he described the current avalanche of criticism on him as " an attempt at turning him into an non-person . " yet if anybody ever believed in the infallibility of günter grass as a kind of leftist answer to the holy father , then they were simply too naive for their own good .
infallibility is not a human trait . the end of a moral authority some commentators have pointed out that grass 's literary oeuvre will need to be completely reevaluated .
this is hardly true .
his monumental literary achievement will not be shaken one bit by the revelation of his weakness as a human being . those who - like wolfgang börnsen , the parliamentary spokesman on cultural affairs for the conservative christian democratic union - believe that grass should " honorably return the -lrb- nobel -rrb- prize " - are still unable to come to terms with a simple fact that günter grass , the writer , günter grass , the moralist , and günter grass , the father who did n't tell his children that he was a member of the waffen ss , are not the same persona and deserve to be seen and judged independently .
the fall of the moralist is not the fall of the writer . when all is said and done , however , it should be remembered that it was grass alone who revealed his own hypocrisy .
when he came out with the story - which will , no doubt , help him increase the sales of his forthcoming autobiography - he also decided that truth was more important than the comfort of secrecy .

but he at least admitted his own hypocrisy , said dw-world.de 's toma tasovac . oskar matzerath , the obscene and earth-bound narrator of grass 's most famous novel " the tin drum " willfully stopped growing at the age of three and , hence , observed the world from the vantage point of a child , looking up from below .
günter grass himself , on the other hand , always acted as if he had somehow grown taller than the rest of the world ; as if his head was , in fact , dwelling in a stratosphere of pure , guiltless thought ; a moral emporium beyond anybody else 's reach . in post-war germany , günter grass became a moral institution and a powerful force of reflection on what it meant to have had a nazi past .
as " the conscience of the post-war generation , " grass made a significant contribution to germany 's development into an open , democratic society that it is today . yet it is in the nature of any authority - whether it 's moral , political or military - to be talking down to its subjects .
günter grass has been talking down to germans for decades : when he , for a long time , looked favorably towards the soviet union while turning a blind eye toward the prison house that was the german democratic republic ; when he allowed himself to be shocked by the way east germans abandoned their socialist dreams and rushed across the border in pursuit of capitalist commodities ; when he said that the two germanys should not be united because germans had every reason to fear themselves as a unit . günter grass always knew better . a shocking revelation which is why his belated confession that he had been a member of the notorious waffen ss combat troops - admittedly , as a 17-year-old boy in 1944 - has come as such a shock to everybody , both in germany and abroad .
people do n't like to see the untouchables strip themselves naked .
if anything , people like to do the mud-dragging themselves . it is absolutely inexcusable that günter grass waited more than half of a century to come clean , after having spent that same half of a century teaching germans the moral imperative of coming to terms with their past .
it is disappointing and discomforting that grass , who once spoke passionately about the need of " preventing the past from coming to an end , " kept his own past hidden away for so long .
it is sad and embarrassing to see a man of his stature resort to sentimentality -lrb- " i have carried this blemish for 60 years " -rrb- or narcissism - he described the current avalanche of criticism on him as " an attempt at turning him into an non-person . " yet if anybody ever believed in the infallibility of günter grass as a kind of leftist answer to the holy father , then they were simply too naive for their own good .
infallibility is not a human trait . the end of a moral authority some commentators have pointed out that grass 's literary oeuvre will need to be completely reevaluated .
this is hardly true .
his monumental literary achievement will not be shaken one bit by the revelation of his weakness as a human being . those who - like wolfgang börnsen , the parliamentary spokesman on cultural affairs for the conservative christian democratic union - believe that grass should " honorably return the -lrb- nobel -rrb- prize " - are still unable to come to terms with a simple fact that günter grass , the writer , günter grass , the moralist , and günter grass , the father who did n't tell his children that he was a member of the waffen ss , are not the same persona and deserve to be seen and judged independently .
the fall of the moralist is not the fall of the writer . when all is said and done , however , it should be remembered that it was grass alone who revealed his own hypocrisy .
when he came out with the story - which will , no doubt , help him increase the sales of his forthcoming autobiography - he also decided that truth was more important than the comfort of secrecy .
for the first time , perhaps , he stopped looking down on people . he should have spoken out earlier , but belated truth is still better than no truth at all . toma tasovac is an editor for the english site of dw-world.de and an expert on german literature . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nobel prize winner grass under fire for belated ss confession nobel prize winning author günter grass is facing a backlash from contemporaries and commentators after he admitted that he was drafted into nazi germany 's notorious waffen ss elite force during world war ii .

14 , 2006 -rrb- opinion : a truly idiotic decision by declaring themselves ready to revoke the decision of an independent literary jury , german politicians are embarrassing themselves and damaging the fundaments of democratic culture , says dw-world.de 's toma tasovac .
" i do n't hold onto ideological distortions " dw-world.de spoke to german novelist and nobel prize winner günter grass about international pen , germany , the role of the writer in contemporary society and a world without peace .

but this is exactly what happened in the case of the greatest dramatist of the 20th century , bertolt brecht . ahead of 50th anniversary of brecht 's death , the academy of the arts in berlin and its brecht archive announced that brecht 's manuscripts , which were discovered in switzerland several years ago , have been added to the archive 's collection .
this is the largest expansion of the internationally renowned archive since its founding in 1956 .
the archive is used by approximately 240 researchers every year . previously , it was believed that no new materials could be added to the archive of the most performed german dramatist in the world .
but new brecht materials include brecht 's and other author 's manuscripts , his notebooks , contracts , documents , passports , check books , bills and letters that he wrote or received . all of these , brecht left with his friend , union leader and graphic artist , victor .
n. cohen in 1949 in goldbach on the lake of zurich .
brecht , 51 at the time , was living in switzerland - after years of exile in scandinavia and the united states - and preparing for his return to east berlin .
cohen was a left-inclined social democrat who wrote articles for union newspapers and rand social democratic campaigns and referendums .
he died in 1975 . but it was not until the late 1990s that cohen 's sons actually became aware of the valuable collection . it 's all brecht ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht 's finnish passport " they had to empty a warehouse , because their contract had expired , " said erdmut wizisla of the brecht archive .
" and victor 's stuff was there .
when they opened it , they thought : good god !
this is all brecht !
and then they went on to the next box and found again - all brecht . " the negotiations with the owners lasted eight years .
they were completed successfully because the deutsche klassenlotterie foundation , the german research foundation and the academy of the arts agreed to jointly finance the purchase : 2,500 sheets of paper , which correspond to one fifth of brecht 's overall archival materials , and a typewriter now make up the victor n. cohen collection at the brecht archive . brecht 's wife helena weigel , who meticulously collected brecht 's unpublished writings after his death , seems to have completely forgotten about the materials which were left in switzerland .
brecht himself obviously did n't miss these materials after he returned to germany .
they document above all the time he spent in switzerland , but also shed some light on his exile years in the united states and , to a lesser extent , his earlier periods . new and spectacular bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht left the us in 1947 after testifying before the committee on un-american activities in washington , dc the swiss materials include two previously unknown drafts of the play " the caucasian chalk circle , " several short stories , an idea for a novel as well as political and theatrical essays .
among them is a prose text " my unforgettable character , " in which brecht , similar to what he did in the play the " the resistible rise of arturo ui , " makes a caricature out of hitler . the manuscripts also show that , while in the states , brecht was involved with the council for a democratic germany .
this association of german emigrants was founded in 1944 in response to the national committee free germany , which was based in the soviet union .
brecht composed opinions and letters , in which he urged prominent germans - such as writer alfred döblin - to become engaged .
the council was a temporary coalition which already during the war supported the idea of a unified germany with the possibility of a sovereign inner and foreign policy . theater plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht and his wife helene weigel are buried in berlin the materials also show the enthusiasm with which brecht was preparing for his work in the theater in post-war germany .
he corresponded with his friends and colleagues in germany , directors , actors and german as well as russian cultural officials .
he wanted to adapt all his plays in view of the end of the war .
" arturo ui " was the only play that brecht believed - because of its genre as a farce - as fitting for the stage confrontation with the nazi rule . despite the fact that brecht 's exile years were difficult and marked by lack of success , the 350 letters in the collection paint a picture of a self-confident and self-assertive poet . publications based on the new materials have already been announced .
in addition to brecht 's letters to helena weigel from 1923 to 1956 , german publishing house suhrkamp is also planning to publish a 150-page-long appendix to werner hecht 's 1997 chronicle , which documented brecht 's life from day to day . hecht sees a number of exciting challenges for brecht researchers . " it is , of course , peculiar that brecht was caught in the interpretation struggle between the east and the west , " hecht said .
" now is the time to paint an objective picture of brecht .
that is why discoveries of this kind are of such great value . " dunja welke -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de celebrating bertolt brecht click here for dw-world.de 's dossier on brecht 's life and international influence .
a communist in a city of angels he blamed the sunshine in la , which " shriveled up the brains of gifted writers leaving them incapable of anything but film-writing . "
but when brecht himself tried to become a hollywood screenwriter , he failed miserably .

he carped on capitalism and did n't mesh with the gdr - most importantly , he entertained .

shoes are a world that fashionable men and women inhabit : a kind of portable apartment that children , pets and annoying relatives are not allowed to visit . people who love their shoes live their life as if it were an expensive caribbean vacation .
that is why sarah jessica parker alias carrie bradshaw always feels like she 's walking not on air , but , much more literally , money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roman worriors loved their sandals extensive research into the social structure of ancient rome has led some classical scholars to reinterpret the old latin proverb omnia mea mecum porto .
for centuries , this old saying was translated as " i carry all my possession with me . "
it implied that our intellect is our most precious possession . new evidence , however , suggests two different ways of reading this ancient pearl of wisdom : " all that i have , i invest in my sandals " or " i wish i could carry all my sandals with me . "
in view of the newly discovered roman obsession with shoes , stoicism is currently undergoing a radical reappraisal . what 's the big deal ? manly men - who , according to a very reliable deutsche welle source on current trends , are back in the game again , since the metrosexual crowd seems to have wasted its 15 minutes of glory on unnecessary facial peels and eyebrow plucking - always liked to make fun of women for their shopping habits and obsession with fashion . manly men could never understand how shoes could become objects of affection .
they always equaled footwear with a particularly bizarre form of fetishism that is often encountered in those disturbing works of art known as the french cinema . although , times are changing . winds of change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actually , mr. beckenbauer , it 's a shoe members of the german national soccer team - the manliest and most heroic of all teutons - have broken the new ground by standing up for the men who love their shoes . the team , which put a big , cheesy smile on their country 's face by winning third place in the world cup this summer , threatened to boycott the game against sweden , scheduled for wednesday , if not allowed to wear their own shoes . some of the soccer players are , namely , sick and tired of the deal that the german soccer association has with adidas , which stipulated that the players must wear exclusively the shoes made by the german footwear maker and soccer sponsor until 2010 .
the horror !
it 's like telling sarah jessica parker to wear only dr. scholl 's for four years . doctor who ? war of the shoes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarah jessica parker -lrb- second from left -rrb- understands the plight of german soccer players this unheard-of attack on the soccer player 's inborn right to feel comfortable and look fabulous while kicking the ball could easily escalate into a real shoe war . after several rounds of serious negotiations with their soccer association , the players agreed to play the match against sweden , after all .
but they set a new ultimatum for the management to figure out how to get out of its contract with adidas , sept .

on that day , germany play ireland in a european cup qualifier . " we owe it to our fans , not to get out on the pitch with a decimated team , " said theo zwanziger , president of the german soccer association . come sept .
2 , we may see a more colorful and diverse collection of footwear on the soccer pitch .
or - if things go terribly wrong - a bunch of manly men fighting for their rights in high heels , carrying a poster which says : " sarah jessica parker is on our side .

but this is exactly what happened in the case of the greatest dramatist of the 20th century , bertolt brecht . ahead of 50th anniversary of brecht 's death , the academy of the arts in berlin and its brecht archive announced that brecht 's manuscripts , which were discovered in switzerland several years ago , have been added to the archive 's collection .
this is the largest expansion of the internationally renowned archive since its founding in 1956 .
the archive is used by approximately 240 researchers every year . previously , it was believed that no new materials could be added to the archive of the most performed german dramatist in the world .
but new brecht materials include brecht 's and other author 's manuscripts , his notebooks , contracts , documents , passports , check books , bills and letters that he wrote or received . all of these , brecht left with his friend , union leader and graphic artist , victor .
n. cohen in 1949 in goldbach on the lake of zurich .
brecht , 51 at the time , was living in switzerland - after years of exile in scandinavia and the united states - and preparing for his return to east berlin .
cohen was a left-inclined social democrat who wrote articles for union newspapers and rand social democratic campaigns and referendums .
he died in 1975 . but it was not until the late 1990s that cohen 's sons actually became aware of the valuable collection . it 's all brecht ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht 's finnish passport " they had to empty a warehouse , because their contract had expired , " said erdmut wizisla of the brecht archive .
" and victor 's stuff was there .
when they opened it , they thought : good god !
this is all brecht !
and then they went on to the next box and found again - all brecht . " the negotiations with the owners lasted eight years .
they were completed successfully because the deutsche klassenlotterie foundation , the german research foundation and the academy of the arts agreed to jointly finance the purchase : 2,500 sheets of paper , which correspond to one fifth of brecht 's overall archival materials , and a typewriter now make up the victor n. cohen collection at the brecht archive . brecht 's wife helena weigel , who meticulously collected brecht 's unpublished writings after his death , seems to have completely forgotten about the materials which were left in switzerland .
brecht himself obviously did n't miss these materials after he returned to germany .
they document above all the time he spent in switzerland , but also shed some light on his exile years in the united states and , to a lesser extent , his earlier periods . new and spectacular bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht left the us in 1947 after testifying before the committee on un-american activities in washington , dc the swiss materials include two previously unknown drafts of the play " the caucasian chalk circle , " several short stories , an idea for a novel as well as political and theatrical essays .
among them is a prose text " my unforgettable character , " in which brecht , similar to what he did in the play the " the resistible rise of arturo ui , " makes a caricature out of hitler . the manuscripts also show that , while in the states , brecht was involved with the council for a democratic germany .
this association of german emigrants was founded in 1944 in response to the national committee free germany , which was based in the soviet union .
brecht composed opinions and letters , in which he urged prominent germans - such as writer alfred döblin - to become engaged .
the council was a temporary coalition which already during the war supported the idea of a unified germany with the possibility of a sovereign inner and foreign policy . theater plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht and his wife helene weigel are buried in berlin the materials also show the enthusiasm with which brecht was preparing for his work in the theater in post-war germany .
he corresponded with his friends and colleagues in germany , directors , actors and german as well as russian cultural officials .
he wanted to adapt all his plays in view of the end of the war .
" arturo ui " was the only play that brecht believed - because of its genre as a farce - as fitting for the stage confrontation with the nazi rule . despite the fact that brecht 's exile years were difficult and marked by lack of success , the 350 letters in the collection paint a picture of a self-confident and self-assertive poet . publications based on the new materials have already been announced .
in addition to brecht 's letters to helena weigel from 1923 to 1956 , german publishing house suhrkamp is also planning to publish a 150-page-long appendix to werner hecht 's 1997 chronicle , which documented brecht 's life from day to day . hecht sees a number of exciting challenges for brecht researchers . " it is , of course , peculiar that brecht was caught in the interpretation struggle between the east and the west , " hecht said .
" now is the time to paint an objective picture of brecht .
that is why discoveries of this kind are of such great value . " dunja welke -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de celebrating bertolt brecht click here for dw-world.de 's dossier on brecht 's life and international influence .
a communist in a city of angels he blamed the sunshine in la , which " shriveled up the brains of gifted writers leaving them incapable of anything but film-writing . "
but when brecht himself tried to become a hollywood screenwriter , he failed miserably .

but this is exactly what happened in the case of the greatest dramatist of the 20th century , bertolt brecht . ahead of 50th anniversary of brecht 's death , the academy of the arts in berlin and its brecht archive announced that brecht 's manuscripts , which were discovered in switzerland several years ago , have been added to the archive 's collection .
this is the largest expansion of the internationally renowned archive since its founding in 1956 .
the archive is used by approximately 240 researchers every year . previously , it was believed that no new materials could be added to the archive of the most performed german dramatist in the world .
but new brecht materials include brecht 's and other author 's manuscripts , his notebooks , contracts , documents , passports , check books , bills and letters that he wrote or received . all of these , brecht left with his friend , union leader and graphic artist , victor .
n. cohen in 1949 in goldbach on the lake of zurich .
brecht , 51 at the time , was living in switzerland - after years of exile in scandinavia and the united states - and preparing for his return to east berlin .

but he at least admitted his own hypocrisy , said dw-world.de 's toma tasovac . oskar matzerath , the obscene and earth-bound narrator of grass 's most famous novel " the tin drum " willfully stopped growing at the age of three and , hence , observed the world from the vantage point of a child , looking up from below .
günter grass himself , on the other hand , always acted as if he had somehow grown taller than the rest of the world ; as if his head was , in fact , dwelling in a stratosphere of pure , guiltless thought ; a moral emporium beyond anybody else 's reach . in post-war germany , günter grass became a moral institution and a powerful force of reflection on what it meant to have had a nazi past .
as " the conscience of the post-war generation , " grass made a significant contribution to germany 's development into an open , democratic society that it is today . yet it is in the nature of any authority - whether it 's moral , political or military - to be talking down to its subjects .
günter grass has been talking down to germans for decades : when he , for a long time , looked favorably towards the soviet union while turning a blind eye toward the prison house that was the german democratic republic ; when he allowed himself to be shocked by the way east germans abandoned their socialist dreams and rushed across the border in pursuit of capitalist commodities ; when he said that the two germanys should not be united because germans had every reason to fear themselves as a unit . günter grass always knew better . a shocking revelation which is why his belated confession that he had been a member of the notorious waffen ss combat troops - admittedly , as a 17-year-old boy in 1944 - has come as such a shock to everybody , both in germany and abroad .
people do n't like to see the untouchables strip themselves naked .
if anything , people like to do the mud-dragging themselves . it is absolutely inexcusable that günter grass waited more than half of a century to come clean , after having spent that same half of a century teaching germans the moral imperative of coming to terms with their past .
it is disappointing and discomforting that grass , who once spoke passionately about the need of " preventing the past from coming to an end , " kept his own past hidden away for so long .
it is sad and embarrassing to see a man of his stature resort to sentimentality -lrb- " i have carried this blemish for 60 years " -rrb- or narcissism - he described the current avalanche of criticism on him as " an attempt at turning him into an non-person . " yet if anybody ever believed in the infallibility of günter grass as a kind of leftist answer to the holy father , then they were simply too naive for their own good .
infallibility is not a human trait . the end of a moral authority some commentators have pointed out that grass 's literary oeuvre will need to be completely reevaluated .
this is hardly true .
his monumental literary achievement will not be shaken one bit by the revelation of his weakness as a human being . those who - like wolfgang börnsen , the parliamentary spokesman on cultural affairs for the conservative christian democratic union - believe that grass should " honorably return the -lrb- nobel -rrb- prize " - are still unable to come to terms with a simple fact that günter grass , the writer , günter grass , the moralist , and günter grass , the father who did n't tell his children that he was a member of the waffen ss , are not the same persona and deserve to be seen and judged independently .
the fall of the moralist is not the fall of the writer . when all is said and done , however , it should be remembered that it was grass alone who revealed his own hypocrisy .
when he came out with the story - which will , no doubt , help him increase the sales of his forthcoming autobiography - he also decided that truth was more important than the comfort of secrecy .

he also co-wrote " aggression and war : their biological and social bases , " which dissects human aggression and war .
until recently , he was the director general of the european institute for the media .
dw-world.de : in a general sense , what have you observed from the current conflict in the middle east and the role that the media has played ?
jo groebel : in the middle east there is the situation of political violence and the role of individual versus national aggression .
are these the actions of individuals who are caught up in the continual fighting or individual acts of violence ?
the role of communication and media in these situations shows that there is a certain unbalance .
they were not presented as victims on the israeli side , and people reacted to individual pictures - especially from hezbollah - which were presented differently to israel .
my assumption is that israel cared less about public opinion and people started to feel more sympathetic to hezbollah , which was a reaction to the images of violence and death that were shown on the hezbollah side .
although these events were still present on the israel side , they were not shown as constantly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : use of media for propaganda : hezbollah television al -manar what is your perception of the recent coverage of the conflict in lebanon ?
there is the whole question of what gets more attention - war or peace ?
the problem is that by being violent you get more attention , and this is has more news value .
people are more interested in the negatives than the positives .
from a rewards point of view , getting more attention means more publicity of the cause .
in this conflict , at the moment , there has been confirmation , especially from the hezbollah side , that there has been manipulation of media by showing certain images .
a few years ago , there was footage of a young child looking into the camera and this same type of image appeared recently in lebanon , whether this is a coincidence is questionable .
one tends to compare the recent conflicts to what happened in iraq about three years ago , where there were major discussions about the reporting and embedded journalists who were working in iraq .
in the case of recent events the discussion only started a couple of days ago , before that there was no discussion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an embedded time magazine journalist has up close experience with war in iraq there are three main issues that have influenced the coverage of the current conflict .
firstly , this is considered another kind of war .
people are used to seeing conflict , but unlike iraq , which held bad public opinion , the conflict in lebanon was not a surprise and inevitably lacked extreme impact .
secondly , people expect propaganda and therefore could be immune to , or even cynical about , the images that they see in this conflict because of the images that came from iraq .
thirdly , people get used to this sort of conflict .
if more people had died , it would have made big news .
in the case of germany 's coverage , it was in the news every 24 hours and there was permanent coverage .
however , for other european news it was amongst the top stories of the regular news bulletin , but there was not much more than coverage .
considering the recent development of a peace deal between the fighting parties , how do you think media audiences take this sort of outcome , in light of what you said previously about the expectation of conflict in the region ?
my assumption is that no one will assume that peace will happen .
however , all the sides that are involved in the conflict have both confirmed their will to act and to open dialogue .
there is some credibility to this process and hope for periodical peace .
but there is no assuming that this is will be certain .
are there any notable differences of the media coverage for the israel and hezbollah conflict compared to other conflicts around the world ?
what i find particularly interesting is the use of what is called amateur or informal media , like weblogs , web images and such , that has been applied in professional conflict reporting .
this has meant anyone who has access to camera and the internet , can post pictures on the web .
if you receive an image from someone who is actually there and has actual images , that can seem to be more credible information .
however , there are ethical dilemmas with this situation and ideally , a journalist is the one doing the stories and taking the pictures , because they are working by a code of ethics and have a certain standard of objectivity and do not have the same local ties as someone living there .
this is important , to be cautious about amateur photographs , because they can be digitally changed and manipulated and the impact that the pictures publicized by hezbollah have are an example of this . rachel ryan interviewed jo groebel send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : " it 's a long way to peace " in accordance with un resolution 1701 , a ceasefire in the conflict between israel and hezbollah in lebanon came into effect on monday morning .

but he at least admitted his own hypocrisy , said dw-world.de 's toma tasovac . oskar matzerath , the obscene and earth-bound narrator of grass 's most famous novel " the tin drum " willfully stopped growing at the age of three and , hence , observed the world from the vantage point of a child , looking up from below .
günter grass himself , on the other hand , always acted as if he had somehow grown taller than the rest of the world ; as if his head was , in fact , dwelling in a stratosphere of pure , guiltless thought ; a moral emporium beyond anybody else 's reach . in post-war germany , günter grass became a moral institution and a powerful force of reflection on what it meant to have had a nazi past .
as " the conscience of the post-war generation , " grass made a significant contribution to germany 's development into an open , democratic society that it is today . yet it is in the nature of any authority - whether it 's moral , political or military - to be talking down to its subjects .
günter grass has been talking down to germans for decades : when he , for a long time , looked favorably towards the soviet union while turning a blind eye toward the prison house that was the german democratic republic ; when he allowed himself to be shocked by the way east germans abandoned their socialist dreams and rushed across the border in pursuit of capitalist commodities ; when he said that the two germanys should not be united because germans had every reason to fear themselves as a unit . günter grass always knew better . a shocking revelation which is why his belated confession that he had been a member of the notorious waffen ss combat troops - admittedly , as a 17-year-old boy in 1944 - has come as such a shock to everybody , both in germany and abroad .
people do n't like to see the untouchables strip themselves naked .
if anything , people like to do the mud-dragging themselves . it is absolutely inexcusable that günter grass waited more than half of a century to come clean , after having spent that same half of a century teaching germans the moral imperative of coming to terms with their past .
it is disappointing and discomforting that grass , who once spoke passionately about the need of " preventing the past from coming to an end , " kept his own past hidden away for so long .
it is sad and embarrassing to see a man of his stature resort to sentimentality -lrb- " i have carried this blemish for 60 years " -rrb- or narcissism - he described the current avalanche of criticism on him as " an attempt at turning him into an non-person . " yet if anybody ever believed in the infallibility of günter grass as a kind of leftist answer to the holy father , then they were simply too naive for their own good .
infallibility is not a human trait . the end of a moral authority some commentators have pointed out that grass 's literary oeuvre will need to be completely reevaluated .
this is hardly true .
his monumental literary achievement will not be shaken one bit by the revelation of his weakness as a human being . those who - like wolfgang börnsen , the parliamentary spokesman on cultural affairs for the conservative christian democratic union - believe that grass should " honorably return the -lrb- nobel -rrb- prize " - are still unable to come to terms with a simple fact that günter grass , the writer , günter grass , the moralist , and günter grass , the father who did n't tell his children that he was a member of the waffen ss , are not the same persona and deserve to be seen and judged independently .
the fall of the moralist is not the fall of the writer . when all is said and done , however , it should be remembered that it was grass alone who revealed his own hypocrisy .
when he came out with the story - which will , no doubt , help him increase the sales of his forthcoming autobiography - he also decided that truth was more important than the comfort of secrecy .

with less than a day remaining , residents of delmenhorst near bremen are waiting with bated breath to see if efforts to raise the 3.4 million euros -lrb- $ 4.2 million -rrb- to buy a local hotel have been successful .
otherwise , the now empty hotel am stadtpark will become the property of a neo-nazi group .
in the past week , the ticker on the web site www.fuer-delmenhorst.de detailing donations has steadily risen .
as of tuesday afternoon , it reached 679,486 euros .
still , even with a matching town donation of 2 million euros , delmenhorst is coming up short .
but townsfolk said they remain hopeful .
" every euro makes a difference , " mayor carsten schwettmann said in a statement .
" it is a sign of the solidarity and commitment of the town . "
" nein " to neo-nazis the initiative began after hamburg lawyer jürgen rieger made an offer to buy the hotel , which is prominently situated across from the town hall in the center of the town .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 100-room hotel am stadtpark is at the center of the controversy rieger made an offer for the building on behalf of the wilhelm tietjen foundation for fertilization ltd , a mysterious group registered in london that promotes racial purity .
the organization is named for a rich nazi from bremen who died childless in 2002 .
the lawyer , who has defended a number of neo-nazis including holocaust denier ernst zündel and is known for speaking at neo-nazi rallies honoring hitler 's deputy rudolf hess , reportedly aims to transform the hotel into a neo-nazi center for research and conferences .
rieger , who owns property in hamburg , thuringia , a former german military building in dörverden near bremen as well as in sweden , has not said publicly why he wants to buy the hotel in the lower saxony town of fewer than 80,000 people .
he was unavailable for comment .
fighting fire with fire town officials said there is little they can do to prevent the sale other than offer the 2 million euros from their already-stretched budget , adding that their efforts to convince property owner günter mergel not to sell to rieger have been unsuccessful .
" we can not stop the current owner from selling to whomever he wants , " schwettmann told reporters .
" but i am proud of the solidarity the townspeople have shown in the past days . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lawyer jürgen rieger is well-known for his neo-nazi activities mergel , who told focus magazine that the empty 100-room hotel is bleeding him dry financially , said he has no choice : " i am up to my neck in hot water . "
" a crazy idea " as a result , locals took the burden into their own hands .
they have staged protests , held fundraisers such as " barbeques against the right " and rallies featuring rock music .
they have created petitions and weblogs and planned exhibitions .
more than 3,000 people from the town and around germany have donated to delmenhorst 's cause via a web page that launched on aug .
4 .
" it might be a crazy idea , " said town resident günter feith , a 58-year-old architect and founder of the initiative .
" but we are doing it anyway .
we have to . "
feith said at first , there were doubts about the chance of successfully derailing the sale .
but now , as thousands of euros pour in , those doubts are dissipating .
" we have a good chance of succeeding , " he said .

he also co-wrote " aggression and war : their biological and social bases , " which dissects human aggression and war .
until recently , he was the director general of the european institute for the media .
dw-world.de : in a general sense , what have you observed from the current conflict in the middle east and the role that the media has played ?
jo groebel : in the middle east there is the situation of political violence and the role of individual versus national aggression .
are these the actions of individuals who are caught up in the continual fighting or individual acts of violence ?
the role of communication and media in these situations shows that there is a certain unbalance .
they were not presented as victims on the israeli side , and people reacted to individual pictures - especially from hezbollah - which were presented differently to israel .
my assumption is that israel cared less about public opinion and people started to feel more sympathetic to hezbollah , which was a reaction to the images of violence and death that were shown on the hezbollah side .
although these events were still present on the israel side , they were not shown as constantly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : use of media for propaganda : hezbollah television al -manar what is your perception of the recent coverage of the conflict in lebanon ?
there is the whole question of what gets more attention - war or peace ?
the problem is that by being violent you get more attention , and this is has more news value .
people are more interested in the negatives than the positives .
from a rewards point of view , getting more attention means more publicity of the cause .
in this conflict , at the moment , there has been confirmation , especially from the hezbollah side , that there has been manipulation of media by showing certain images .
a few years ago , there was footage of a young child looking into the camera and this same type of image appeared recently in lebanon , whether this is a coincidence is questionable .
one tends to compare the recent conflicts to what happened in iraq about three years ago , where there were major discussions about the reporting and embedded journalists who were working in iraq .
in the case of recent events the discussion only started a couple of days ago , before that there was no discussion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an embedded time magazine journalist has up close experience with war in iraq there are three main issues that have influenced the coverage of the current conflict .
firstly , this is considered another kind of war .
people are used to seeing conflict , but unlike iraq , which held bad public opinion , the conflict in lebanon was not a surprise and inevitably lacked extreme impact .
secondly , people expect propaganda and therefore could be immune to , or even cynical about , the images that they see in this conflict because of the images that came from iraq .
thirdly , people get used to this sort of conflict .
if more people had died , it would have made big news .
in the case of germany 's coverage , it was in the news every 24 hours and there was permanent coverage .
however , for other european news it was amongst the top stories of the regular news bulletin , but there was not much more than coverage .
considering the recent development of a peace deal between the fighting parties , how do you think media audiences take this sort of outcome , in light of what you said previously about the expectation of conflict in the region ?
my assumption is that no one will assume that peace will happen .
however , all the sides that are involved in the conflict have both confirmed their will to act and to open dialogue .
there is some credibility to this process and hope for periodical peace .
but there is no assuming that this is will be certain .
are there any notable differences of the media coverage for the israel and hezbollah conflict compared to other conflicts around the world ?
what i find particularly interesting is the use of what is called amateur or informal media , like weblogs , web images and such , that has been applied in professional conflict reporting .
this has meant anyone who has access to camera and the internet , can post pictures on the web .
if you receive an image from someone who is actually there and has actual images , that can seem to be more credible information .
however , there are ethical dilemmas with this situation and ideally , a journalist is the one doing the stories and taking the pictures , because they are working by a code of ethics and have a certain standard of objectivity and do not have the same local ties as someone living there .
this is important , to be cautious about amateur photographs , because they can be digitally changed and manipulated and the impact that the pictures publicized by hezbollah have are an example of this . rachel ryan interviewed jo groebel send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : " it 's a long way to peace " in accordance with un resolution 1701 , a ceasefire in the conflict between israel and hezbollah in lebanon came into effect on monday morning .

he also co-wrote " aggression and war : their biological and social bases , " which dissects human aggression and war .
until recently , he was the director general of the european institute for the media .
dw-world.de : in a general sense , what have you observed from the current conflict in the middle east and the role that the media has played ?
jo groebel : in the middle east there is the situation of political violence and the role of individual versus national aggression .
are these the actions of individuals who are caught up in the continual fighting or individual acts of violence ?
the role of communication and media in these situations shows that there is a certain unbalance .
they were not presented as victims on the israeli side , and people reacted to individual pictures - especially from hezbollah - which were presented differently to israel .
my assumption is that israel cared less about public opinion and people started to feel more sympathetic to hezbollah , which was a reaction to the images of violence and death that were shown on the hezbollah side .
although these events were still present on the israel side , they were not shown as constantly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : use of media for propaganda : hezbollah television al -manar what is your perception of the recent coverage of the conflict in lebanon ?
there is the whole question of what gets more attention - war or peace ?
the problem is that by being violent you get more attention , and this is has more news value .
people are more interested in the negatives than the positives .
from a rewards point of view , getting more attention means more publicity of the cause .
in this conflict , at the moment , there has been confirmation , especially from the hezbollah side , that there has been manipulation of media by showing certain images .
a few years ago , there was footage of a young child looking into the camera and this same type of image appeared recently in lebanon , whether this is a coincidence is questionable .
one tends to compare the recent conflicts to what happened in iraq about three years ago , where there were major discussions about the reporting and embedded journalists who were working in iraq .
in the case of recent events the discussion only started a couple of days ago , before that there was no discussion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an embedded time magazine journalist has up close experience with war in iraq there are three main issues that have influenced the coverage of the current conflict .
firstly , this is considered another kind of war .
people are used to seeing conflict , but unlike iraq , which held bad public opinion , the conflict in lebanon was not a surprise and inevitably lacked extreme impact .
secondly , people expect propaganda and therefore could be immune to , or even cynical about , the images that they see in this conflict because of the images that came from iraq .
thirdly , people get used to this sort of conflict .
if more people had died , it would have made big news .
in the case of germany 's coverage , it was in the news every 24 hours and there was permanent coverage .
however , for other european news it was amongst the top stories of the regular news bulletin , but there was not much more than coverage .
considering the recent development of a peace deal between the fighting parties , how do you think media audiences take this sort of outcome , in light of what you said previously about the expectation of conflict in the region ?
my assumption is that no one will assume that peace will happen .
however , all the sides that are involved in the conflict have both confirmed their will to act and to open dialogue .
there is some credibility to this process and hope for periodical peace .
but there is no assuming that this is will be certain .
are there any notable differences of the media coverage for the israel and hezbollah conflict compared to other conflicts around the world ?
what i find particularly interesting is the use of what is called amateur or informal media , like weblogs , web images and such , that has been applied in professional conflict reporting .
this has meant anyone who has access to camera and the internet , can post pictures on the web .
if you receive an image from someone who is actually there and has actual images , that can seem to be more credible information .
however , there are ethical dilemmas with this situation and ideally , a journalist is the one doing the stories and taking the pictures , because they are working by a code of ethics and have a certain standard of objectivity and do not have the same local ties as someone living there .
this is important , to be cautious about amateur photographs , because they can be digitally changed and manipulated and the impact that the pictures publicized by hezbollah have are an example of this . rachel ryan interviewed jo groebel send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : " it 's a long way to peace " in accordance with un resolution 1701 , a ceasefire in the conflict between israel and hezbollah in lebanon came into effect on monday morning .

he also co-wrote " aggression and war : their biological and social bases , " which dissects human aggression and war .
until recently , he was the director general of the european institute for the media .
dw-world.de : in a general sense , what have you observed from the current conflict in the middle east and the role that the media has played ?
jo groebel : in the middle east there is the situation of political violence and the role of individual versus national aggression .
are these the actions of individuals who are caught up in the continual fighting or individual acts of violence ?
the role of communication and media in these situations shows that there is a certain unbalance .
they were not presented as victims on the israeli side , and people reacted to individual pictures - especially from hezbollah - which were presented differently to israel .
my assumption is that israel cared less about public opinion and people started to feel more sympathetic to hezbollah , which was a reaction to the images of violence and death that were shown on the hezbollah side .
although these events were still present on the israel side , they were not shown as constantly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : use of media for propaganda : hezbollah television al -manar what is your perception of the recent coverage of the conflict in lebanon ?
there is the whole question of what gets more attention - war or peace ?
the problem is that by being violent you get more attention , and this is has more news value .
people are more interested in the negatives than the positives .
from a rewards point of view , getting more attention means more publicity of the cause .
in this conflict , at the moment , there has been confirmation , especially from the hezbollah side , that there has been manipulation of media by showing certain images .
a few years ago , there was footage of a young child looking into the camera and this same type of image appeared recently in lebanon , whether this is a coincidence is questionable .
one tends to compare the recent conflicts to what happened in iraq about three years ago , where there were major discussions about the reporting and embedded journalists who were working in iraq .
in the case of recent events the discussion only started a couple of days ago , before that there was no discussion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an embedded time magazine journalist has up close experience with war in iraq there are three main issues that have influenced the coverage of the current conflict .
firstly , this is considered another kind of war .
people are used to seeing conflict , but unlike iraq , which held bad public opinion , the conflict in lebanon was not a surprise and inevitably lacked extreme impact .
secondly , people expect propaganda and therefore could be immune to , or even cynical about , the images that they see in this conflict because of the images that came from iraq .
thirdly , people get used to this sort of conflict .
if more people had died , it would have made big news .
in the case of germany 's coverage , it was in the news every 24 hours and there was permanent coverage .
however , for other european news it was amongst the top stories of the regular news bulletin , but there was not much more than coverage .
considering the recent development of a peace deal between the fighting parties , how do you think media audiences take this sort of outcome , in light of what you said previously about the expectation of conflict in the region ?
my assumption is that no one will assume that peace will happen .
however , all the sides that are involved in the conflict have both confirmed their will to act and to open dialogue .
there is some credibility to this process and hope for periodical peace .
but there is no assuming that this is will be certain .
are there any notable differences of the media coverage for the israel and hezbollah conflict compared to other conflicts around the world ?
what i find particularly interesting is the use of what is called amateur or informal media , like weblogs , web images and such , that has been applied in professional conflict reporting .
this has meant anyone who has access to camera and the internet , can post pictures on the web .
if you receive an image from someone who is actually there and has actual images , that can seem to be more credible information .
however , there are ethical dilemmas with this situation and ideally , a journalist is the one doing the stories and taking the pictures , because they are working by a code of ethics and have a certain standard of objectivity and do not have the same local ties as someone living there .
this is important , to be cautious about amateur photographs , because they can be digitally changed and manipulated and the impact that the pictures publicized by hezbollah have are an example of this . rachel ryan interviewed jo groebel send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : " it 's a long way to peace " in accordance with un resolution 1701 , a ceasefire in the conflict between israel and hezbollah in lebanon came into effect on monday morning .

with less than a day remaining , residents of delmenhorst near bremen are waiting with bated breath to see if efforts to raise the 3.4 million euros -lrb- $ 4.2 million -rrb- to buy a local hotel have been successful .
otherwise , the now empty hotel am stadtpark will become the property of a neo-nazi group .
in the past week , the ticker on the web site www.fuer-delmenhorst.de detailing donations has steadily risen .
as of tuesday afternoon , it reached 679,486 euros .
still , even with a matching town donation of 2 million euros , delmenhorst is coming up short .
but townsfolk said they remain hopeful .
" every euro makes a difference , " mayor carsten schwettmann said in a statement .
" it is a sign of the solidarity and commitment of the town . "
" nein " to neo-nazis the initiative began after hamburg lawyer jürgen rieger made an offer to buy the hotel , which is prominently situated across from the town hall in the center of the town .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 100-room hotel am stadtpark is at the center of the controversy rieger made an offer for the building on behalf of the wilhelm tietjen foundation for fertilization ltd , a mysterious group registered in london that promotes racial purity .
the organization is named for a rich nazi from bremen who died childless in 2002 .
the lawyer , who has defended a number of neo-nazis including holocaust denier ernst zündel and is known for speaking at neo-nazi rallies honoring hitler 's deputy rudolf hess , reportedly aims to transform the hotel into a neo-nazi center for research and conferences .
rieger , who owns property in hamburg , thuringia , a former german military building in dörverden near bremen as well as in sweden , has not said publicly why he wants to buy the hotel in the lower saxony town of fewer than 80,000 people .
he was unavailable for comment .
fighting fire with fire town officials said there is little they can do to prevent the sale other than offer the 2 million euros from their already-stretched budget , adding that their efforts to convince property owner günter mergel not to sell to rieger have been unsuccessful .
" we can not stop the current owner from selling to whomever he wants , " schwettmann told reporters .

they have staged protests , held fundraisers such as " barbeques against the right " and rallies featuring rock music .
they have created petitions and weblogs and planned exhibitions .

but he at least admitted his own hypocrisy , said dw-world.de 's toma tasovac . oskar matzerath , the obscene and earth-bound narrator of grass 's most famous novel " the tin drum " willfully stopped growing at the age of three and , hence , observed the world from the vantage point of a child , looking up from below .
günter grass himself , on the other hand , always acted as if he had somehow grown taller than the rest of the world ; as if his head was , in fact , dwelling in a stratosphere of pure , guiltless thought ; a moral emporium beyond anybody else 's reach . in post-war germany , günter grass became a moral institution and a powerful force of reflection on what it meant to have had a nazi past .
as " the conscience of the post-war generation , " grass made a significant contribution to germany 's development into an open , democratic society that it is today . yet it is in the nature of any authority - whether it 's moral , political or military - to be talking down to its subjects .
günter grass has been talking down to germans for decades : when he , for a long time , looked favorably towards the soviet union while turning a blind eye toward the prison house that was the german democratic republic ; when he allowed himself to be shocked by the way east germans abandoned their socialist dreams and rushed across the border in pursuit of capitalist commodities ; when he said that the two germanys should not be united because germans had every reason to fear themselves as a unit . günter grass always knew better . a shocking revelation which is why his belated confession that he had been a member of the notorious waffen ss combat troops - admittedly , as a 17-year-old boy in 1944 - has come as such a shock to everybody , both in germany and abroad .
people do n't like to see the untouchables strip themselves naked .
if anything , people like to do the mud-dragging themselves . it is absolutely inexcusable that günter grass waited more than half of a century to come clean , after having spent that same half of a century teaching germans the moral imperative of coming to terms with their past .
it is disappointing and discomforting that grass , who once spoke passionately about the need of " preventing the past from coming to an end , " kept his own past hidden away for so long .
it is sad and embarrassing to see a man of his stature resort to sentimentality -lrb- " i have carried this blemish for 60 years " -rrb- or narcissism - he described the current avalanche of criticism on him as " an attempt at turning him into an non-person . " yet if anybody ever believed in the infallibility of günter grass as a kind of leftist answer to the holy father , then they were simply too naive for their own good .
infallibility is not a human trait . the end of a moral authority some commentators have pointed out that grass 's literary oeuvre will need to be completely reevaluated .
this is hardly true .
his monumental literary achievement will not be shaken one bit by the revelation of his weakness as a human being . those who - like wolfgang börnsen , the parliamentary spokesman on cultural affairs for the conservative christian democratic union - believe that grass should " honorably return the -lrb- nobel -rrb- prize " - are still unable to come to terms with a simple fact that günter grass , the writer , günter grass , the moralist , and günter grass , the father who did n't tell his children that he was a member of the waffen ss , are not the same persona and deserve to be seen and judged independently .
the fall of the moralist is not the fall of the writer . when all is said and done , however , it should be remembered that it was grass alone who revealed his own hypocrisy .
when he came out with the story - which will , no doubt , help him increase the sales of his forthcoming autobiography - he also decided that truth was more important than the comfort of secrecy .
for the first time , perhaps , he stopped looking down on people . he should have spoken out earlier , but belated truth is still better than no truth at all . toma tasovac is an editor for the english site of dw-world.de and an expert on german literature . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nobel prize winner grass under fire for belated ss confession nobel prize winning author günter grass is facing a backlash from contemporaries and commentators after he admitted that he was drafted into nazi germany 's notorious waffen ss elite force during world war ii .

as " the conscience of the post-war generation , " grass made a significant contribution to germany 's development into an open , democratic society that it is today . yet it is in the nature of any authority - whether it 's moral , political or military - to be talking down to its subjects .
günter grass has been talking down to germans for decades : when he , for a long time , looked favorably towards the soviet union while turning a blind eye toward the prison house that was the german democratic republic ; when he allowed himself to be shocked by the way east germans abandoned their socialist dreams and rushed across the border in pursuit of capitalist commodities ; when he said that the two germanys should not be united because germans had every reason to fear themselves as a unit . günter grass always knew better . a shocking revelation which is why his belated confession that he had been a member of the notorious waffen ss combat troops - admittedly , as a 17-year-old boy in 1944 - has come as such a shock to everybody , both in germany and abroad .
people do n't like to see the untouchables strip themselves naked .
if anything , people like to do the mud-dragging themselves . it is absolutely inexcusable that günter grass waited more than half of a century to come clean , after having spent that same half of a century teaching germans the moral imperative of coming to terms with their past .
it is disappointing and discomforting that grass , who once spoke passionately about the need of " preventing the past from coming to an end , " kept his own past hidden away for so long .
it is sad and embarrassing to see a man of his stature resort to sentimentality -lrb- " i have carried this blemish for 60 years " -rrb- or narcissism - he described the current avalanche of criticism on him as " an attempt at turning him into an non-person . " yet if anybody ever believed in the infallibility of günter grass as a kind of leftist answer to the holy father , then they were simply too naive for their own good .
infallibility is not a human trait . the end of a moral authority some commentators have pointed out that grass 's literary oeuvre will need to be completely reevaluated .
this is hardly true .
his monumental literary achievement will not be shaken one bit by the revelation of his weakness as a human being . those who - like wolfgang börnsen , the parliamentary spokesman on cultural affairs for the conservative christian democratic union - believe that grass should " honorably return the -lrb- nobel -rrb- prize " - are still unable to come to terms with a simple fact that günter grass , the writer , günter grass , the moralist , and günter grass , the father who did n't tell his children that he was a member of the waffen ss , are not the same persona and deserve to be seen and judged independently .
the fall of the moralist is not the fall of the writer . when all is said and done , however , it should be remembered that it was grass alone who revealed his own hypocrisy .
when he came out with the story - which will , no doubt , help him increase the sales of his forthcoming autobiography - he also decided that truth was more important than the comfort of secrecy .
for the first time , perhaps , he stopped looking down on people . he should have spoken out earlier , but belated truth is still better than no truth at all . toma tasovac is an editor for the english site of dw-world.de and an expert on german literature . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nobel prize winner grass under fire for belated ss confession nobel prize winning author günter grass is facing a backlash from contemporaries and commentators after he admitted that he was drafted into nazi germany 's notorious waffen ss elite force during world war ii .
-lrb- aug .
14 , 2006 -rrb- opinion : a truly idiotic decision by declaring themselves ready to revoke the decision of an independent literary jury , german politicians are embarrassing themselves and damaging the fundaments of democratic culture , says dw-world.de 's toma tasovac .
" i do n't hold onto ideological distortions " dw-world.de spoke to german novelist and nobel prize winner günter grass about international pen , germany , the role of the writer in contemporary society and a world without peace .

he also co-wrote " aggression and war : their biological and social bases , " which dissects human aggression and war .
until recently , he was the director general of the european institute for the media .
dw-world.de : in a general sense , what have you observed from the current conflict in the middle east and the role that the media has played ?
jo groebel : in the middle east there is the situation of political violence and the role of individual versus national aggression .
are these the actions of individuals who are caught up in the continual fighting or individual acts of violence ?
the role of communication and media in these situations shows that there is a certain unbalance .
they were not presented as victims on the israeli side , and people reacted to individual pictures - especially from hezbollah - which were presented differently to israel .
my assumption is that israel cared less about public opinion and people started to feel more sympathetic to hezbollah , which was a reaction to the images of violence and death that were shown on the hezbollah side .
although these events were still present on the israel side , they were not shown as constantly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : use of media for propaganda : hezbollah television al -manar what is your perception of the recent coverage of the conflict in lebanon ?
there is the whole question of what gets more attention - war or peace ?
the problem is that by being violent you get more attention , and this is has more news value .
people are more interested in the negatives than the positives .
from a rewards point of view , getting more attention means more publicity of the cause .
in this conflict , at the moment , there has been confirmation , especially from the hezbollah side , that there has been manipulation of media by showing certain images .
a few years ago , there was footage of a young child looking into the camera and this same type of image appeared recently in lebanon , whether this is a coincidence is questionable .
one tends to compare the recent conflicts to what happened in iraq about three years ago , where there were major discussions about the reporting and embedded journalists who were working in iraq .
in the case of recent events the discussion only started a couple of days ago , before that there was no discussion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an embedded time magazine journalist has up close experience with war in iraq there are three main issues that have influenced the coverage of the current conflict .
firstly , this is considered another kind of war .
people are used to seeing conflict , but unlike iraq , which held bad public opinion , the conflict in lebanon was not a surprise and inevitably lacked extreme impact .
secondly , people expect propaganda and therefore could be immune to , or even cynical about , the images that they see in this conflict because of the images that came from iraq .
thirdly , people get used to this sort of conflict .
if more people had died , it would have made big news .
in the case of germany 's coverage , it was in the news every 24 hours and there was permanent coverage .
however , for other european news it was amongst the top stories of the regular news bulletin , but there was not much more than coverage .
considering the recent development of a peace deal between the fighting parties , how do you think media audiences take this sort of outcome , in light of what you said previously about the expectation of conflict in the region ?
my assumption is that no one will assume that peace will happen .
however , all the sides that are involved in the conflict have both confirmed their will to act and to open dialogue .
there is some credibility to this process and hope for periodical peace .
but there is no assuming that this is will be certain .
are there any notable differences of the media coverage for the israel and hezbollah conflict compared to other conflicts around the world ?
what i find particularly interesting is the use of what is called amateur or informal media , like weblogs , web images and such , that has been applied in professional conflict reporting .
this has meant anyone who has access to camera and the internet , can post pictures on the web .
if you receive an image from someone who is actually there and has actual images , that can seem to be more credible information .
however , there are ethical dilemmas with this situation and ideally , a journalist is the one doing the stories and taking the pictures , because they are working by a code of ethics and have a certain standard of objectivity and do not have the same local ties as someone living there .
this is important , to be cautious about amateur photographs , because they can be digitally changed and manipulated and the impact that the pictures publicized by hezbollah have are an example of this . rachel ryan interviewed jo groebel send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : " it 's a long way to peace " in accordance with un resolution 1701 , a ceasefire in the conflict between israel and hezbollah in lebanon came into effect on monday morning .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . the man , if judged at all , should be - as any person - judged by his entire life and what he accomplished , not what happened when one was 17 years old .
it is time to put to rest this stigma of those years and let the young people of today look to the future that is " theirs . "
who are we to judge at all as we all live in " glass houses . " - robert j. patulski , us ralph giordano hit the nail on the head .
no man is perfect , and given that , we should be happy that günter grass has come to terms with himself , and with germany .
let he who has not sinned cast the first stone .
he did what anyone would do , and did .
there are legions of these boys who were inducted in 1944 and 1945 at a young age , who are now 77 , 78 , 79 and dying .
i feel that germany should make clear to grass and to these many other soldier-citizens that there was no moral fault on their part for serving their country .
there is no salvation for the upper echelons of the hitler / nazi government - but there should be heartfelt and very open forgiveness expressed to these one-time youngsters . - wiley horne , us i believe günter grass should have much earlier revealed his past and should not have kept it hidden for the last 61 years .
i think he did not confess it earlier fearing that such a confession would prevent him from getting the nobel prize , which he eventually got in 1999 .
this whole episode only shows his hypocrisy and double-speak . - pialy mazumder , india it 's a sad thing that one of germany 's most famous authors , if not people , of the 20th century has come under such wide criticism .
unfortunately , this criticism in not quite undeserved .
it is not shameful to change your convictions , especially after a catastrophe as world war ii .
it is not shameful to call for openness on the topic ; in fact , there has probably been too much left unsaid .
however , it is a blow to the atmosphere of honesty , and to the entire public , when one of the advocates of the openness and honesty has hid such a secret for so long .
whether this admission is sincere , whether it is timed to advertise the book -lrb- consciously or not -rrb- and how much more there is about grass ' military service i can not know .
yet it is unfortunate that grass ' works wo n't ever be read the same way . - boyan penev , germany this confession only confirms my suspicions that as whole the german society is plagued by hypocrisy and to continue to have a superiority complex .
this man became the icon of german left politics , claiming to have the role as moral conscious of the modern world .
that günter grass lied to germany in this matter and that germany and germans believed him , only speaks that germany and german have no moral superiority with which to admonish the world on what is righteous or to show the world which is the ethical path .
recently germany , under chancellor gerhard schröder , again reclaimed the post of moral voice of the world by opposing and decrying the invasion of iraq by the us , britain and other nations .
the parochialism of german society continues as do the hypocrisy that permeates it .
unfortunately germans have not changed , but as we all know , the society that begot karl marx , friedrich engel and adolf hitler and company are nothing more than a bunch of liers and self-delusional people . - francisco a. olivas , nicaragua he should be stripped of the nobel prize , but not have his honorary citizenship of gdansk removed , because he was born there and he is a citizen of gdansk -lrb- danzig -rrb- .
whether we like it or not does not matter .
before we jump to conclusions , we need to investigate his role in the ss .
if grass proves not to be guilty , then all those who are " killing " grass owe him an apology in public . - danuta hejzner compiled by dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nobel prize winner grass under fire for belated ss confession nobel prize winning author günter grass is facing a backlash from contemporaries and commentators after he admitted that he was drafted into nazi germany 's notorious waffen ss elite force during world war ii .
-lrb- aug .
14 , 2006 -rrb- opinion : a late confession is better than no confession at all it is inexcusable that günter grass kept silent about his involvement with the waffen ss combat troops during world war ii .
but he at least admitted his own hypocrisy , said dw-world.de 's toma tasovac .

" through positive , constructive action , syria could regain the lost trust of the international community , he added . " but the basic prerequisite for this is a clear and unmistakable commitment to putting regional differences in interests aside , " steinmeier said while at amman 's airport .
" president assad 's speech today is a step in the opposing direction .
that 's why i have decided not to travel to damascus . " assad praises hezbollah bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : syrian president bashar al-assad in his speech , the syrian president praised hezbollah in its fight against israel , describing resistance against the " enemy " as legitimate even as israel said it should prepare for talks . " i say to all those who accuse syria of taking the side of the resistance that this is , for the syrian people , an honor , " he said in a wide-ranging speech that also took aim at washington and anti-damascus figures in lebanon . " this resistance is a medal to pin on the chest of every arab citizen , not only syria , " he said , adding that the lebanese guerrillas had " shattered the myth of an invincible army . " a total of 160 israelis have been killed since july 12 , most of them soldiers who lost their lives in combat with hezbollah . no peace in sight ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel has begun thinning its troops in southern lebanon to prepare for a un takeover in the hard-hitting address at the opening of a journalists ' conference in damascus , punctuated by cheers and chanting from the audience , assad accused the jewish state of not wanting peace . he said there was now a " new middle east " after the month-long war between israel and hezbollah in lebanon , which he described as a " planned aggression " by the jewish state .
he accused israel of using the capture of two soldiers in a hezbollah raid on july 12 as a pretext for launching its massive assault against lebanon , which came to a halt after a un-brokered ceasefire took hold on monday . " peace would involve israel returning occupied lands to their owners and restoring their rights , " assad said .
" israel is an enemy founded on the basis of aggression and hegemony . " " the peace process has failed .
it has failed since its inception , " he added .
" we do not expect peace in the near future . " a missed opportunity assad 's speech on tuesday , which lead the german foreign minister to cancel his planned visit to syria , was his first public speech since the start of the war in lebanon . in his speech , the syrian president also lashed out at us policies in the region , accusing president george w. bush of adopting " the principle of preventative war , which is in complete contradiction to the principle of peace . " syria held political and military sway in lebanon for years until it pulled out its troops in april 2005 under massive pressure following the murder of former lebanese premier rafiq hariri . steinmeier had planned to try to further involve syria in the peace process following the implementation of a ceasefire in southern lebanon , possibly by offering economic incentives in return . now , however , the foreign minister has said he would prefer to fly on to saudi arabia where he is due to end his middle east visit on wednesday . dw staff -lrb- dc / tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de steinmeier to press syria for greater commitment to peace german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier is on his third middle east trip within a month .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 15.08.2006 discovering brecht 's forgotten manuscripts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht 's letter to helene weigel , part of the victor n. cohen collection it happens rarely that 50 years after the death of a writer , new and important manuscripts are discovered .
but this is exactly what happened in the case of the greatest dramatist of the 20th century , bertolt brecht . ahead of 50th anniversary of brecht 's death , the academy of the arts in berlin and its brecht archive announced that brecht 's manuscripts , which were discovered in switzerland several years ago , have been added to the archive 's collection .
this is the largest expansion of the internationally renowned archive since its founding in 1956 .
the archive is used by approximately 240 researchers every year . previously , it was believed that no new materials could be added to the archive of the most performed german dramatist in the world .
but new brecht materials include brecht 's and other author 's manuscripts , his notebooks , contracts , documents , passports , check books , bills and letters that he wrote or received . all of these , brecht left with his friend , union leader and graphic artist , victor .
n. cohen in 1949 in goldbach on the lake of zurich .
brecht , 51 at the time , was living in switzerland - after years of exile in scandinavia and the united states - and preparing for his return to east berlin .
cohen was a left-inclined social democrat who wrote articles for union newspapers and rand social democratic campaigns and referendums .
he died in 1975 . but it was not until the late 1990s that cohen 's sons actually became aware of the valuable collection . it 's all brecht ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht 's finnish passport " they had to empty a warehouse , because their contract had expired , " said erdmut wizisla of the brecht archive .
" and victor 's stuff was there .
when they opened it , they thought : good god !
this is all brecht !
and then they went on to the next box and found again - all brecht . " the negotiations with the owners lasted eight years .
they were completed successfully because the deutsche klassenlotterie foundation , the german research foundation and the academy of the arts agreed to jointly finance the purchase : 2,500 sheets of paper , which correspond to one fifth of brecht 's overall archival materials , and a typewriter now make up the victor n. cohen collection at the brecht archive . brecht 's wife helena weigel , who meticulously collected brecht 's unpublished writings after his death , seems to have completely forgotten about the materials which were left in switzerland .
brecht himself obviously did n't miss these materials after he returned to germany .
they document above all the time he spent in switzerland , but also shed some light on his exile years in the united states and , to a lesser extent , his earlier periods . new and spectacular bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht left the us in 1947 after testifying before the committee on un-american activities in washington , dc the swiss materials include two previously unknown drafts of the play " the caucasian chalk circle , " several short stories , an idea for a novel as well as political and theatrical essays .
among them is a prose text " my unforgettable character , " in which brecht , similar to what he did in the play the " the resistible rise of arturo ui , " makes a caricature out of hitler . the manuscripts also show that , while in the states , brecht was involved with the council for a democratic germany .
this association of german emigrants was founded in 1944 in response to the national committee free germany , which was based in the soviet union .
brecht composed opinions and letters , in which he urged prominent germans - such as writer alfred döblin - to become engaged .
the council was a temporary coalition which already during the war supported the idea of a unified germany with the possibility of a sovereign inner and foreign policy . theater plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht and his wife helene weigel are buried in berlin the materials also show the enthusiasm with which brecht was preparing for his work in the theater in post-war germany .
he corresponded with his friends and colleagues in germany , directors , actors and german as well as russian cultural officials .
he wanted to adapt all his plays in view of the end of the war .
" arturo ui " was the only play that brecht believed - because of its genre as a farce - as fitting for the stage confrontation with the nazi rule . despite the fact that brecht 's exile years were difficult and marked by lack of success , the 350 letters in the collection paint a picture of a self-confident and self-assertive poet . publications based on the new materials have already been announced .
in addition to brecht 's letters to helena weigel from 1923 to 1956 , german publishing house suhrkamp is also planning to publish a 150-page-long appendix to werner hecht 's 1997 chronicle , which documented brecht 's life from day to day . hecht sees a number of exciting challenges for brecht researchers . " it is , of course , peculiar that brecht was caught in the interpretation struggle between the east and the west , " hecht said .
" now is the time to paint an objective picture of brecht .
that is why discoveries of this kind are of such great value . " dunja welke -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de celebrating bertolt brecht click here for dw-world.de 's dossier on brecht 's life and international influence .

he also co-wrote " aggression and war : their biological and social bases , " which dissects human aggression and war .
until recently , he was the director general of the european institute for the media .
dw-world.de : in a general sense , what have you observed from the current conflict in the middle east and the role that the media has played ?
jo groebel : in the middle east there is the situation of political violence and the role of individual versus national aggression .
are these the actions of individuals who are caught up in the continual fighting or individual acts of violence ?
the role of communication and media in these situations shows that there is a certain unbalance .
they were not presented as victims on the israeli side , and people reacted to individual pictures - especially from hezbollah - which were presented differently to israel .
my assumption is that israel cared less about public opinion and people started to feel more sympathetic to hezbollah , which was a reaction to the images of violence and death that were shown on the hezbollah side .
although these events were still present on the israel side , they were not shown as constantly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : use of media for propaganda : hezbollah television al -manar what is your perception of the recent coverage of the conflict in lebanon ?
there is the whole question of what gets more attention - war or peace ?
the problem is that by being violent you get more attention , and this is has more news value .
people are more interested in the negatives than the positives .
from a rewards point of view , getting more attention means more publicity of the cause .
in this conflict , at the moment , there has been confirmation , especially from the hezbollah side , that there has been manipulation of media by showing certain images .
a few years ago , there was footage of a young child looking into the camera and this same type of image appeared recently in lebanon , whether this is a coincidence is questionable .
one tends to compare the recent conflicts to what happened in iraq about three years ago , where there were major discussions about the reporting and embedded journalists who were working in iraq .
in the case of recent events the discussion only started a couple of days ago , before that there was no discussion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an embedded time magazine journalist has up close experience with war in iraq there are three main issues that have influenced the coverage of the current conflict .
firstly , this is considered another kind of war .
people are used to seeing conflict , but unlike iraq , which held bad public opinion , the conflict in lebanon was not a surprise and inevitably lacked extreme impact .
secondly , people expect propaganda and therefore could be immune to , or even cynical about , the images that they see in this conflict because of the images that came from iraq .
thirdly , people get used to this sort of conflict .
if more people had died , it would have made big news .
in the case of germany 's coverage , it was in the news every 24 hours and there was permanent coverage .
however , for other european news it was amongst the top stories of the regular news bulletin , but there was not much more than coverage .
considering the recent development of a peace deal between the fighting parties , how do you think media audiences take this sort of outcome , in light of what you said previously about the expectation of conflict in the region ?
my assumption is that no one will assume that peace will happen .
however , all the sides that are involved in the conflict have both confirmed their will to act and to open dialogue .
there is some credibility to this process and hope for periodical peace .
but there is no assuming that this is will be certain .
are there any notable differences of the media coverage for the israel and hezbollah conflict compared to other conflicts around the world ?
what i find particularly interesting is the use of what is called amateur or informal media , like weblogs , web images and such , that has been applied in professional conflict reporting .
this has meant anyone who has access to camera and the internet , can post pictures on the web .
if you receive an image from someone who is actually there and has actual images , that can seem to be more credible information .
however , there are ethical dilemmas with this situation and ideally , a journalist is the one doing the stories and taking the pictures , because they are working by a code of ethics and have a certain standard of objectivity and do not have the same local ties as someone living there .
this is important , to be cautious about amateur photographs , because they can be digitally changed and manipulated and the impact that the pictures publicized by hezbollah have are an example of this . rachel ryan interviewed jo groebel send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : " it 's a long way to peace " in accordance with un resolution 1701 , a ceasefire in the conflict between israel and hezbollah in lebanon came into effect on monday morning .

he also co-wrote " aggression and war : their biological and social bases , " which dissects human aggression and war .
until recently , he was the director general of the european institute for the media .
dw-world.de : in a general sense , what have you observed from the current conflict in the middle east and the role that the media has played ?
jo groebel : in the middle east there is the situation of political violence and the role of individual versus national aggression .
are these the actions of individuals who are caught up in the continual fighting or individual acts of violence ?
the role of communication and media in these situations shows that there is a certain unbalance .
they were not presented as victims on the israeli side , and people reacted to individual pictures - especially from hezbollah - which were presented differently to israel .
my assumption is that israel cared less about public opinion and people started to feel more sympathetic to hezbollah , which was a reaction to the images of violence and death that were shown on the hezbollah side .
although these events were still present on the israel side , they were not shown as constantly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : use of media for propaganda : hezbollah television al -manar what is your perception of the recent coverage of the conflict in lebanon ?
there is the whole question of what gets more attention - war or peace ?
the problem is that by being violent you get more attention , and this is has more news value .
people are more interested in the negatives than the positives .
from a rewards point of view , getting more attention means more publicity of the cause .
in this conflict , at the moment , there has been confirmation , especially from the hezbollah side , that there has been manipulation of media by showing certain images .
a few years ago , there was footage of a young child looking into the camera and this same type of image appeared recently in lebanon , whether this is a coincidence is questionable .
one tends to compare the recent conflicts to what happened in iraq about three years ago , where there were major discussions about the reporting and embedded journalists who were working in iraq .
in the case of recent events the discussion only started a couple of days ago , before that there was no discussion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an embedded time magazine journalist has up close experience with war in iraq there are three main issues that have influenced the coverage of the current conflict .
firstly , this is considered another kind of war .
people are used to seeing conflict , but unlike iraq , which held bad public opinion , the conflict in lebanon was not a surprise and inevitably lacked extreme impact .
secondly , people expect propaganda and therefore could be immune to , or even cynical about , the images that they see in this conflict because of the images that came from iraq .
thirdly , people get used to this sort of conflict .
if more people had died , it would have made big news .
in the case of germany 's coverage , it was in the news every 24 hours and there was permanent coverage .
however , for other european news it was amongst the top stories of the regular news bulletin , but there was not much more than coverage .
considering the recent development of a peace deal between the fighting parties , how do you think media audiences take this sort of outcome , in light of what you said previously about the expectation of conflict in the region ?
my assumption is that no one will assume that peace will happen .
however , all the sides that are involved in the conflict have both confirmed their will to act and to open dialogue .
there is some credibility to this process and hope for periodical peace .
but there is no assuming that this is will be certain .
are there any notable differences of the media coverage for the israel and hezbollah conflict compared to other conflicts around the world ?
what i find particularly interesting is the use of what is called amateur or informal media , like weblogs , web images and such , that has been applied in professional conflict reporting .
this has meant anyone who has access to camera and the internet , can post pictures on the web .
if you receive an image from someone who is actually there and has actual images , that can seem to be more credible information .
however , there are ethical dilemmas with this situation and ideally , a journalist is the one doing the stories and taking the pictures , because they are working by a code of ethics and have a certain standard of objectivity and do not have the same local ties as someone living there .
this is important , to be cautious about amateur photographs , because they can be digitally changed and manipulated and the impact that the pictures publicized by hezbollah have are an example of this . rachel ryan interviewed jo groebel send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : " it 's a long way to peace " in accordance with un resolution 1701 , a ceasefire in the conflict between israel and hezbollah in lebanon came into effect on monday morning .

he also co-wrote " aggression and war : their biological and social bases , " which dissects human aggression and war .
until recently , he was the director general of the european institute for the media .
dw-world.de : in a general sense , what have you observed from the current conflict in the middle east and the role that the media has played ?
jo groebel : in the middle east there is the situation of political violence and the role of individual versus national aggression .
are these the actions of individuals who are caught up in the continual fighting or individual acts of violence ?
the role of communication and media in these situations shows that there is a certain unbalance .
they were not presented as victims on the israeli side , and people reacted to individual pictures - especially from hezbollah - which were presented differently to israel .
my assumption is that israel cared less about public opinion and people started to feel more sympathetic to hezbollah , which was a reaction to the images of violence and death that were shown on the hezbollah side .
although these events were still present on the israel side , they were not shown as constantly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : use of media for propaganda : hezbollah television al -manar what is your perception of the recent coverage of the conflict in lebanon ?
there is the whole question of what gets more attention - war or peace ?
the problem is that by being violent you get more attention , and this is has more news value .
people are more interested in the negatives than the positives .
from a rewards point of view , getting more attention means more publicity of the cause .
in this conflict , at the moment , there has been confirmation , especially from the hezbollah side , that there has been manipulation of media by showing certain images .
a few years ago , there was footage of a young child looking into the camera and this same type of image appeared recently in lebanon , whether this is a coincidence is questionable .
one tends to compare the recent conflicts to what happened in iraq about three years ago , where there were major discussions about the reporting and embedded journalists who were working in iraq .
in the case of recent events the discussion only started a couple of days ago , before that there was no discussion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an embedded time magazine journalist has up close experience with war in iraq there are three main issues that have influenced the coverage of the current conflict .
firstly , this is considered another kind of war .
people are used to seeing conflict , but unlike iraq , which held bad public opinion , the conflict in lebanon was not a surprise and inevitably lacked extreme impact .
secondly , people expect propaganda and therefore could be immune to , or even cynical about , the images that they see in this conflict because of the images that came from iraq .
thirdly , people get used to this sort of conflict .
if more people had died , it would have made big news .
in the case of germany 's coverage , it was in the news every 24 hours and there was permanent coverage .
however , for other european news it was amongst the top stories of the regular news bulletin , but there was not much more than coverage .
considering the recent development of a peace deal between the fighting parties , how do you think media audiences take this sort of outcome , in light of what you said previously about the expectation of conflict in the region ?
my assumption is that no one will assume that peace will happen .
however , all the sides that are involved in the conflict have both confirmed their will to act and to open dialogue .
there is some credibility to this process and hope for periodical peace .
but there is no assuming that this is will be certain .
are there any notable differences of the media coverage for the israel and hezbollah conflict compared to other conflicts around the world ?
what i find particularly interesting is the use of what is called amateur or informal media , like weblogs , web images and such , that has been applied in professional conflict reporting .
this has meant anyone who has access to camera and the internet , can post pictures on the web .
if you receive an image from someone who is actually there and has actual images , that can seem to be more credible information .
however , there are ethical dilemmas with this situation and ideally , a journalist is the one doing the stories and taking the pictures , because they are working by a code of ethics and have a certain standard of objectivity and do not have the same local ties as someone living there .
this is important , to be cautious about amateur photographs , because they can be digitally changed and manipulated and the impact that the pictures publicized by hezbollah have are an example of this . rachel ryan interviewed jo groebel send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : " it 's a long way to peace " in accordance with un resolution 1701 , a ceasefire in the conflict between israel and hezbollah in lebanon came into effect on monday morning .

but this is exactly what happened in the case of the greatest dramatist of the 20th century , bertolt brecht . ahead of 50th anniversary of brecht 's death , the academy of the arts in berlin and its brecht archive announced that brecht 's manuscripts , which were discovered in switzerland several years ago , have been added to the archive 's collection .
this is the largest expansion of the internationally renowned archive since its founding in 1956 .
the archive is used by approximately 240 researchers every year . previously , it was believed that no new materials could be added to the archive of the most performed german dramatist in the world .
but new brecht materials include brecht 's and other author 's manuscripts , his notebooks , contracts , documents , passports , check books , bills and letters that he wrote or received . all of these , brecht left with his friend , union leader and graphic artist , victor .
n. cohen in 1949 in goldbach on the lake of zurich .
brecht , 51 at the time , was living in switzerland - after years of exile in scandinavia and the united states - and preparing for his return to east berlin .
cohen was a left-inclined social democrat who wrote articles for union newspapers and rand social democratic campaigns and referendums .
he died in 1975 . but it was not until the late 1990s that cohen 's sons actually became aware of the valuable collection . it 's all brecht ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht 's finnish passport " they had to empty a warehouse , because their contract had expired , " said erdmut wizisla of the brecht archive .
" and victor 's stuff was there .
when they opened it , they thought : good god !
this is all brecht !
and then they went on to the next box and found again - all brecht . " the negotiations with the owners lasted eight years .
they were completed successfully because the deutsche klassenlotterie foundation , the german research foundation and the academy of the arts agreed to jointly finance the purchase : 2,500 sheets of paper , which correspond to one fifth of brecht 's overall archival materials , and a typewriter now make up the victor n. cohen collection at the brecht archive . brecht 's wife helena weigel , who meticulously collected brecht 's unpublished writings after his death , seems to have completely forgotten about the materials which were left in switzerland .
brecht himself obviously did n't miss these materials after he returned to germany .
they document above all the time he spent in switzerland , but also shed some light on his exile years in the united states and , to a lesser extent , his earlier periods . new and spectacular bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht left the us in 1947 after testifying before the committee on un-american activities in washington , dc the swiss materials include two previously unknown drafts of the play " the caucasian chalk circle , " several short stories , an idea for a novel as well as political and theatrical essays .
among them is a prose text " my unforgettable character , " in which brecht , similar to what he did in the play the " the resistible rise of arturo ui , " makes a caricature out of hitler . the manuscripts also show that , while in the states , brecht was involved with the council for a democratic germany .
this association of german emigrants was founded in 1944 in response to the national committee free germany , which was based in the soviet union .
brecht composed opinions and letters , in which he urged prominent germans - such as writer alfred döblin - to become engaged .
the council was a temporary coalition which already during the war supported the idea of a unified germany with the possibility of a sovereign inner and foreign policy . theater plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht and his wife helene weigel are buried in berlin the materials also show the enthusiasm with which brecht was preparing for his work in the theater in post-war germany .
he corresponded with his friends and colleagues in germany , directors , actors and german as well as russian cultural officials .
he wanted to adapt all his plays in view of the end of the war .
" arturo ui " was the only play that brecht believed - because of its genre as a farce - as fitting for the stage confrontation with the nazi rule . despite the fact that brecht 's exile years were difficult and marked by lack of success , the 350 letters in the collection paint a picture of a self-confident and self-assertive poet . publications based on the new materials have already been announced .
in addition to brecht 's letters to helena weigel from 1923 to 1956 , german publishing house suhrkamp is also planning to publish a 150-page-long appendix to werner hecht 's 1997 chronicle , which documented brecht 's life from day to day . hecht sees a number of exciting challenges for brecht researchers . " it is , of course , peculiar that brecht was caught in the interpretation struggle between the east and the west , " hecht said .
" now is the time to paint an objective picture of brecht .
that is why discoveries of this kind are of such great value . " dunja welke -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de celebrating bertolt brecht click here for dw-world.de 's dossier on brecht 's life and international influence .

with less than a day remaining , residents of delmenhorst near bremen are waiting with bated breath to see if efforts to raise the 3.4 million euros -lrb- $ 4.2 million -rrb- to buy a local hotel have been successful .
otherwise , the now empty hotel am stadtpark will become the property of a neo-nazi group .
in the past week , the ticker on the web site www.fuer-delmenhorst.de detailing donations has steadily risen .
as of tuesday afternoon , it reached 679,486 euros .
still , even with a matching town donation of 2 million euros , delmenhorst is coming up short .
but townsfolk said they remain hopeful .
" every euro makes a difference , " mayor carsten schwettmann said in a statement .
" it is a sign of the solidarity and commitment of the town . "
" nein " to neo-nazis the initiative began after hamburg lawyer jürgen rieger made an offer to buy the hotel , which is prominently situated across from the town hall in the center of the town .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 100-room hotel am stadtpark is at the center of the controversy rieger made an offer for the building on behalf of the wilhelm tietjen foundation for fertilization ltd , a mysterious group registered in london that promotes racial purity .
the organization is named for a rich nazi from bremen who died childless in 2002 .
the lawyer , who has defended a number of neo-nazis including holocaust denier ernst zündel and is known for speaking at neo-nazi rallies honoring hitler 's deputy rudolf hess , reportedly aims to transform the hotel into a neo-nazi center for research and conferences .
rieger , who owns property in hamburg , thuringia , a former german military building in dörverden near bremen as well as in sweden , has not said publicly why he wants to buy the hotel in the lower saxony town of fewer than 80,000 people .
he was unavailable for comment .
fighting fire with fire town officials said there is little they can do to prevent the sale other than offer the 2 million euros from their already-stretched budget , adding that their efforts to convince property owner günter mergel not to sell to rieger have been unsuccessful .
" we can not stop the current owner from selling to whomever he wants , " schwettmann told reporters .
" but i am proud of the solidarity the townspeople have shown in the past days . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lawyer jürgen rieger is well-known for his neo-nazi activities mergel , who told focus magazine that the empty 100-room hotel is bleeding him dry financially , said he has no choice : " i am up to my neck in hot water . "
" a crazy idea " as a result , locals took the burden into their own hands .
they have staged protests , held fundraisers such as " barbeques against the right " and rallies featuring rock music .
they have created petitions and weblogs and planned exhibitions .
more than 3,000 people from the town and around germany have donated to delmenhorst 's cause via a web page that launched on aug .
4 .
" it might be a crazy idea , " said town resident günter feith , a 58-year-old architect and founder of the initiative .
" but we are doing it anyway .
we have to . "
feith said at first , there were doubts about the chance of successfully derailing the sale .
but now , as thousands of euros pour in , those doubts are dissipating .
" we have a good chance of succeeding , " he said .

this is the largest expansion of the internationally renowned archive since its founding in 1956 .
the archive is used by approximately 240 researchers every year . previously , it was believed that no new materials could be added to the archive of the most performed german dramatist in the world .

among them is a prose text " my unforgettable character , " in which brecht , similar to what he did in the play the " the resistible rise of arturo ui , " makes a caricature out of hitler . the manuscripts also show that , while in the states , brecht was involved with the council for a democratic germany .
this association of german emigrants was founded in 1944 in response to the national committee free germany , which was based in the soviet union .

" arturo ui " was the only play that brecht believed - because of its genre as a farce - as fitting for the stage confrontation with the nazi rule . despite the fact that brecht 's exile years were difficult and marked by lack of success , the 350 letters in the collection paint a picture of a self-confident and self-assertive poet . publications based on the new materials have already been announced .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : günter grass grass defends long silence as book sales soar nobel prize winner grass under fire for belated ss confession opinion : a late confession is better than no confession at all " i do n't hold onto ideological distortions " reader response -pipe- 15.08.2006 judging grass großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grass has described the controversy as an attempt to turn him into a " non-person " dw-world.de readers comment on the controversy regarding german author günter grass ' ss past . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . the man , if judged at all , should be - as any person - judged by his entire life and what he accomplished , not what happened when one was 17 years old .
it is time to put to rest this stigma of those years and let the young people of today look to the future that is " theirs . "
who are we to judge at all as we all live in " glass houses . " - robert j. patulski , us ralph giordano hit the nail on the head .
no man is perfect , and given that , we should be happy that günter grass has come to terms with himself , and with germany .
let he who has not sinned cast the first stone .
he did what anyone would do , and did .
there are legions of these boys who were inducted in 1944 and 1945 at a young age , who are now 77 , 78 , 79 and dying .
i feel that germany should make clear to grass and to these many other soldier-citizens that there was no moral fault on their part for serving their country .
there is no salvation for the upper echelons of the hitler / nazi government - but there should be heartfelt and very open forgiveness expressed to these one-time youngsters . - wiley horne , us i believe günter grass should have much earlier revealed his past and should not have kept it hidden for the last 61 years .
i think he did not confess it earlier fearing that such a confession would prevent him from getting the nobel prize , which he eventually got in 1999 .
this whole episode only shows his hypocrisy and double-speak . - pialy mazumder , india it 's a sad thing that one of germany 's most famous authors , if not people , of the 20th century has come under such wide criticism .
unfortunately , this criticism in not quite undeserved .
it is not shameful to change your convictions , especially after a catastrophe as world war ii .
it is not shameful to call for openness on the topic ; in fact , there has probably been too much left unsaid .
however , it is a blow to the atmosphere of honesty , and to the entire public , when one of the advocates of the openness and honesty has hid such a secret for so long .
whether this admission is sincere , whether it is timed to advertise the book -lrb- consciously or not -rrb- and how much more there is about grass ' military service i can not know .
yet it is unfortunate that grass ' works wo n't ever be read the same way . - boyan penev , germany this confession only confirms my suspicions that as whole the german society is plagued by hypocrisy and to continue to have a superiority complex .
this man became the icon of german left politics , claiming to have the role as moral conscious of the modern world .
that günter grass lied to germany in this matter and that germany and germans believed him , only speaks that germany and german have no moral superiority with which to admonish the world on what is righteous or to show the world which is the ethical path .
recently germany , under chancellor gerhard schröder , again reclaimed the post of moral voice of the world by opposing and decrying the invasion of iraq by the us , britain and other nations .
the parochialism of german society continues as do the hypocrisy that permeates it .
unfortunately germans have not changed , but as we all know , the society that begot karl marx , friedrich engel and adolf hitler and company are nothing more than a bunch of liers and self-delusional people . - francisco a. olivas , nicaragua he should be stripped of the nobel prize , but not have his honorary citizenship of gdansk removed , because he was born there and he is a citizen of gdansk -lrb- danzig -rrb- .
whether we like it or not does not matter .
before we jump to conclusions , we need to investigate his role in the ss .
if grass proves not to be guilty , then all those who are " killing " grass owe him an apology in public . - danuta hejzner compiled by dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nobel prize winner grass under fire for belated ss confession nobel prize winning author günter grass is facing a backlash from contemporaries and commentators after he admitted that he was drafted into nazi germany 's notorious waffen ss elite force during world war ii .
-lrb- aug .
14 , 2006 -rrb- opinion : a late confession is better than no confession at all it is inexcusable that günter grass kept silent about his involvement with the waffen ss combat troops during world war ii .
but he at least admitted his own hypocrisy , said dw-world.de 's toma tasovac .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . the man , if judged at all , should be - as any person - judged by his entire life and what he accomplished , not what happened when one was 17 years old .
it is time to put to rest this stigma of those years and let the young people of today look to the future that is " theirs . "
who are we to judge at all as we all live in " glass houses . " - robert j. patulski , us ralph giordano hit the nail on the head .
no man is perfect , and given that , we should be happy that günter grass has come to terms with himself , and with germany .
let he who has not sinned cast the first stone .
he did what anyone would do , and did .
there are legions of these boys who were inducted in 1944 and 1945 at a young age , who are now 77 , 78 , 79 and dying .
i feel that germany should make clear to grass and to these many other soldier-citizens that there was no moral fault on their part for serving their country .
there is no salvation for the upper echelons of the hitler / nazi government - but there should be heartfelt and very open forgiveness expressed to these one-time youngsters . - wiley horne , us i believe günter grass should have much earlier revealed his past and should not have kept it hidden for the last 61 years .
i think he did not confess it earlier fearing that such a confession would prevent him from getting the nobel prize , which he eventually got in 1999 .
this whole episode only shows his hypocrisy and double-speak . - pialy mazumder , india it 's a sad thing that one of germany 's most famous authors , if not people , of the 20th century has come under such wide criticism .
unfortunately , this criticism in not quite undeserved .
it is not shameful to change your convictions , especially after a catastrophe as world war ii .
it is not shameful to call for openness on the topic ; in fact , there has probably been too much left unsaid .
however , it is a blow to the atmosphere of honesty , and to the entire public , when one of the advocates of the openness and honesty has hid such a secret for so long .
whether this admission is sincere , whether it is timed to advertise the book -lrb- consciously or not -rrb- and how much more there is about grass ' military service i can not know .
yet it is unfortunate that grass ' works wo n't ever be read the same way . - boyan penev , germany this confession only confirms my suspicions that as whole the german society is plagued by hypocrisy and to continue to have a superiority complex .
this man became the icon of german left politics , claiming to have the role as moral conscious of the modern world .
that günter grass lied to germany in this matter and that germany and germans believed him , only speaks that germany and german have no moral superiority with which to admonish the world on what is righteous or to show the world which is the ethical path .
recently germany , under chancellor gerhard schröder , again reclaimed the post of moral voice of the world by opposing and decrying the invasion of iraq by the us , britain and other nations .
the parochialism of german society continues as do the hypocrisy that permeates it .
unfortunately germans have not changed , but as we all know , the society that begot karl marx , friedrich engel and adolf hitler and company are nothing more than a bunch of liers and self-delusional people . - francisco a. olivas , nicaragua he should be stripped of the nobel prize , but not have his honorary citizenship of gdansk removed , because he was born there and he is a citizen of gdansk -lrb- danzig -rrb- .
whether we like it or not does not matter .
before we jump to conclusions , we need to investigate his role in the ss .
if grass proves not to be guilty , then all those who are " killing " grass owe him an apology in public . - danuta hejzner compiled by dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nobel prize winner grass under fire for belated ss confession nobel prize winning author günter grass is facing a backlash from contemporaries and commentators after he admitted that he was drafted into nazi germany 's notorious waffen ss elite force during world war ii .

but he at least admitted his own hypocrisy , said dw-world.de 's toma tasovac . oskar matzerath , the obscene and earth-bound narrator of grass 's most famous novel " the tin drum " willfully stopped growing at the age of three and , hence , observed the world from the vantage point of a child , looking up from below .
günter grass himself , on the other hand , always acted as if he had somehow grown taller than the rest of the world ; as if his head was , in fact , dwelling in a stratosphere of pure , guiltless thought ; a moral emporium beyond anybody else 's reach . in post-war germany , günter grass became a moral institution and a powerful force of reflection on what it meant to have had a nazi past .
as " the conscience of the post-war generation , " grass made a significant contribution to germany 's development into an open , democratic society that it is today . yet it is in the nature of any authority - whether it 's moral , political or military - to be talking down to its subjects .
günter grass has been talking down to germans for decades : when he , for a long time , looked favorably towards the soviet union while turning a blind eye toward the prison house that was the german democratic republic ; when he allowed himself to be shocked by the way east germans abandoned their socialist dreams and rushed across the border in pursuit of capitalist commodities ; when he said that the two germanys should not be united because germans had every reason to fear themselves as a unit . günter grass always knew better . a shocking revelation which is why his belated confession that he had been a member of the notorious waffen ss combat troops - admittedly , as a 17-year-old boy in 1944 - has come as such a shock to everybody , both in germany and abroad .
people do n't like to see the untouchables strip themselves naked .
if anything , people like to do the mud-dragging themselves . it is absolutely inexcusable that günter grass waited more than half of a century to come clean , after having spent that same half of a century teaching germans the moral imperative of coming to terms with their past .
it is disappointing and discomforting that grass , who once spoke passionately about the need of " preventing the past from coming to an end , " kept his own past hidden away for so long .
it is sad and embarrassing to see a man of his stature resort to sentimentality -lrb- " i have carried this blemish for 60 years " -rrb- or narcissism - he described the current avalanche of criticism on him as " an attempt at turning him into an non-person . " yet if anybody ever believed in the infallibility of günter grass as a kind of leftist answer to the holy father , then they were simply too naive for their own good .
infallibility is not a human trait . the end of a moral authority some commentators have pointed out that grass 's literary oeuvre will need to be completely reevaluated .
this is hardly true .
his monumental literary achievement will not be shaken one bit by the revelation of his weakness as a human being . those who - like wolfgang börnsen , the parliamentary spokesman on cultural affairs for the conservative christian democratic union - believe that grass should " honorably return the -lrb- nobel -rrb- prize " - are still unable to come to terms with a simple fact that günter grass , the writer , günter grass , the moralist , and günter grass , the father who did n't tell his children that he was a member of the waffen ss , are not the same persona and deserve to be seen and judged independently .
the fall of the moralist is not the fall of the writer . when all is said and done , however , it should be remembered that it was grass alone who revealed his own hypocrisy .
when he came out with the story - which will , no doubt , help him increase the sales of his forthcoming autobiography - he also decided that truth was more important than the comfort of secrecy .

günter grass has been talking down to germans for decades : when he , for a long time , looked favorably towards the soviet union while turning a blind eye toward the prison house that was the german democratic republic ; when he allowed himself to be shocked by the way east germans abandoned their socialist dreams and rushed across the border in pursuit of capitalist commodities ; when he said that the two germanys should not be united because germans had every reason to fear themselves as a unit . günter grass always knew better . a shocking revelation which is why his belated confession that he had been a member of the notorious waffen ss combat troops - admittedly , as a 17-year-old boy in 1944 - has come as such a shock to everybody , both in germany and abroad .
people do n't like to see the untouchables strip themselves naked .
if anything , people like to do the mud-dragging themselves . it is absolutely inexcusable that günter grass waited more than half of a century to come clean , after having spent that same half of a century teaching germans the moral imperative of coming to terms with their past .

infallibility is not a human trait . the end of a moral authority some commentators have pointed out that grass 's literary oeuvre will need to be completely reevaluated .
this is hardly true .
his monumental literary achievement will not be shaken one bit by the revelation of his weakness as a human being . those who - like wolfgang börnsen , the parliamentary spokesman on cultural affairs for the conservative christian democratic union - believe that grass should " honorably return the -lrb- nobel -rrb- prize " - are still unable to come to terms with a simple fact that günter grass , the writer , günter grass , the moralist , and günter grass , the father who did n't tell his children that he was a member of the waffen ss , are not the same persona and deserve to be seen and judged independently .

their love of shoes , of course . one thing the world has learned from " sex and the city " is that shoes are much more than mere footwear .
one does n't simply wear one 's shoes .
one loves them .
and one lives in them .
shoes are a world that fashionable men and women inhabit : a kind of portable apartment that children , pets and annoying relatives are not allowed to visit . people who love their shoes live their life as if it were an expensive caribbean vacation .
that is why sarah jessica parker alias carrie bradshaw always feels like she 's walking not on air , but , much more literally , money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roman worriors loved their sandals extensive research into the social structure of ancient rome has led some classical scholars to reinterpret the old latin proverb omnia mea mecum porto .
for centuries , this old saying was translated as " i carry all my possession with me . "
it implied that our intellect is our most precious possession . new evidence , however , suggests two different ways of reading this ancient pearl of wisdom : " all that i have , i invest in my sandals " or " i wish i could carry all my sandals with me . "
in view of the newly discovered roman obsession with shoes , stoicism is currently undergoing a radical reappraisal . what 's the big deal ? manly men - who , according to a very reliable deutsche welle source on current trends , are back in the game again , since the metrosexual crowd seems to have wasted its 15 minutes of glory on unnecessary facial peels and eyebrow plucking - always liked to make fun of women for their shopping habits and obsession with fashion . manly men could never understand how shoes could become objects of affection .
they always equaled footwear with a particularly bizarre form of fetishism that is often encountered in those disturbing works of art known as the french cinema . although , times are changing . winds of change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actually , mr. beckenbauer , it 's a shoe members of the german national soccer team - the manliest and most heroic of all teutons - have broken the new ground by standing up for the men who love their shoes . the team , which put a big , cheesy smile on their country 's face by winning third place in the world cup this summer , threatened to boycott the game against sweden , scheduled for wednesday , if not allowed to wear their own shoes . some of the soccer players are , namely , sick and tired of the deal that the german soccer association has with adidas , which stipulated that the players must wear exclusively the shoes made by the german footwear maker and soccer sponsor until 2010 .
the horror !
it 's like telling sarah jessica parker to wear only dr. scholl 's for four years . doctor who ? war of the shoes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarah jessica parker -lrb- second from left -rrb- understands the plight of german soccer players this unheard-of attack on the soccer player 's inborn right to feel comfortable and look fabulous while kicking the ball could easily escalate into a real shoe war . after several rounds of serious negotiations with their soccer association , the players agreed to play the match against sweden , after all .
but they set a new ultimatum for the management to figure out how to get out of its contract with adidas , sept .
2 .
on that day , germany play ireland in a european cup qualifier . " we owe it to our fans , not to get out on the pitch with a decimated team , " said theo zwanziger , president of the german soccer association . come sept .
2 , we may see a more colorful and diverse collection of footwear on the soccer pitch .
or - if things go terribly wrong - a bunch of manly men fighting for their rights in high heels , carrying a poster which says : " sarah jessica parker is on our side .

" through positive , constructive action , syria could regain the lost trust of the international community , he added . " but the basic prerequisite for this is a clear and unmistakable commitment to putting regional differences in interests aside , " steinmeier said while at amman 's airport .
" president assad 's speech today is a step in the opposing direction .
that 's why i have decided not to travel to damascus . " assad praises hezbollah bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : syrian president bashar al-assad in his speech , the syrian president praised hezbollah in its fight against israel , describing resistance against the " enemy " as legitimate even as israel said it should prepare for talks . " i say to all those who accuse syria of taking the side of the resistance that this is , for the syrian people , an honor , " he said in a wide-ranging speech that also took aim at washington and anti-damascus figures in lebanon . " this resistance is a medal to pin on the chest of every arab citizen , not only syria , " he said , adding that the lebanese guerrillas had " shattered the myth of an invincible army . " a total of 160 israelis have been killed since july 12 , most of them soldiers who lost their lives in combat with hezbollah . no peace in sight ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel has begun thinning its troops in southern lebanon to prepare for a un takeover in the hard-hitting address at the opening of a journalists ' conference in damascus , punctuated by cheers and chanting from the audience , assad accused the jewish state of not wanting peace . he said there was now a " new middle east " after the month-long war between israel and hezbollah in lebanon , which he described as a " planned aggression " by the jewish state .
he accused israel of using the capture of two soldiers in a hezbollah raid on july 12 as a pretext for launching its massive assault against lebanon , which came to a halt after a un-brokered ceasefire took hold on monday . " peace would involve israel returning occupied lands to their owners and restoring their rights , " assad said .
" israel is an enemy founded on the basis of aggression and hegemony . " " the peace process has failed .
it has failed since its inception , " he added .
" we do not expect peace in the near future . " a missed opportunity assad 's speech on tuesday , which lead the german foreign minister to cancel his planned visit to syria , was his first public speech since the start of the war in lebanon . in his speech , the syrian president also lashed out at us policies in the region , accusing president george w. bush of adopting " the principle of preventative war , which is in complete contradiction to the principle of peace . " syria held political and military sway in lebanon for years until it pulled out its troops in april 2005 under massive pressure following the murder of former lebanese premier rafiq hariri . steinmeier had planned to try to further involve syria in the peace process following the implementation of a ceasefire in southern lebanon , possibly by offering economic incentives in return . now , however , the foreign minister has said he would prefer to fly on to saudi arabia where he is due to end his middle east visit on wednesday . dw staff -lrb- dc / tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de steinmeier to press syria for greater commitment to peace german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier is on his third middle east trip within a month .

their love of shoes , of course . one thing the world has learned from " sex and the city " is that shoes are much more than mere footwear .
one does n't simply wear one 's shoes .
one loves them .
and one lives in them .
shoes are a world that fashionable men and women inhabit : a kind of portable apartment that children , pets and annoying relatives are not allowed to visit . people who love their shoes live their life as if it were an expensive caribbean vacation .
that is why sarah jessica parker alias carrie bradshaw always feels like she 's walking not on air , but , much more literally , money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roman worriors loved their sandals extensive research into the social structure of ancient rome has led some classical scholars to reinterpret the old latin proverb omnia mea mecum porto .
for centuries , this old saying was translated as " i carry all my possession with me . "
it implied that our intellect is our most precious possession . new evidence , however , suggests two different ways of reading this ancient pearl of wisdom : " all that i have , i invest in my sandals " or " i wish i could carry all my sandals with me . "
in view of the newly discovered roman obsession with shoes , stoicism is currently undergoing a radical reappraisal . what 's the big deal ? manly men - who , according to a very reliable deutsche welle source on current trends , are back in the game again , since the metrosexual crowd seems to have wasted its 15 minutes of glory on unnecessary facial peels and eyebrow plucking - always liked to make fun of women for their shopping habits and obsession with fashion . manly men could never understand how shoes could become objects of affection .
they always equaled footwear with a particularly bizarre form of fetishism that is often encountered in those disturbing works of art known as the french cinema . although , times are changing . winds of change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actually , mr. beckenbauer , it 's a shoe members of the german national soccer team - the manliest and most heroic of all teutons - have broken the new ground by standing up for the men who love their shoes . the team , which put a big , cheesy smile on their country 's face by winning third place in the world cup this summer , threatened to boycott the game against sweden , scheduled for wednesday , if not allowed to wear their own shoes . some of the soccer players are , namely , sick and tired of the deal that the german soccer association has with adidas , which stipulated that the players must wear exclusively the shoes made by the german footwear maker and soccer sponsor until 2010 .
the horror !
it 's like telling sarah jessica parker to wear only dr. scholl 's for four years . doctor who ? war of the shoes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarah jessica parker -lrb- second from left -rrb- understands the plight of german soccer players this unheard-of attack on the soccer player 's inborn right to feel comfortable and look fabulous while kicking the ball could easily escalate into a real shoe war . after several rounds of serious negotiations with their soccer association , the players agreed to play the match against sweden , after all .
but they set a new ultimatum for the management to figure out how to get out of its contract with adidas , sept .
2 .
on that day , germany play ireland in a european cup qualifier . " we owe it to our fans , not to get out on the pitch with a decimated team , " said theo zwanziger , president of the german soccer association . come sept .

" through positive , constructive action , syria could regain the lost trust of the international community , he added . " but the basic prerequisite for this is a clear and unmistakable commitment to putting regional differences in interests aside , " steinmeier said while at amman 's airport .
" president assad 's speech today is a step in the opposing direction .
that 's why i have decided not to travel to damascus . " assad praises hezbollah bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : syrian president bashar al-assad in his speech , the syrian president praised hezbollah in its fight against israel , describing resistance against the " enemy " as legitimate even as israel said it should prepare for talks . " i say to all those who accuse syria of taking the side of the resistance that this is , for the syrian people , an honor , " he said in a wide-ranging speech that also took aim at washington and anti-damascus figures in lebanon . " this resistance is a medal to pin on the chest of every arab citizen , not only syria , " he said , adding that the lebanese guerrillas had " shattered the myth of an invincible army . " a total of 160 israelis have been killed since july 12 , most of them soldiers who lost their lives in combat with hezbollah . no peace in sight ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel has begun thinning its troops in southern lebanon to prepare for a un takeover in the hard-hitting address at the opening of a journalists ' conference in damascus , punctuated by cheers and chanting from the audience , assad accused the jewish state of not wanting peace . he said there was now a " new middle east " after the month-long war between israel and hezbollah in lebanon , which he described as a " planned aggression " by the jewish state .
he accused israel of using the capture of two soldiers in a hezbollah raid on july 12 as a pretext for launching its massive assault against lebanon , which came to a halt after a un-brokered ceasefire took hold on monday . " peace would involve israel returning occupied lands to their owners and restoring their rights , " assad said .
" israel is an enemy founded on the basis of aggression and hegemony . " " the peace process has failed .
it has failed since its inception , " he added .
" we do not expect peace in the near future . " a missed opportunity assad 's speech on tuesday , which lead the german foreign minister to cancel his planned visit to syria , was his first public speech since the start of the war in lebanon . in his speech , the syrian president also lashed out at us policies in the region , accusing president george w. bush of adopting " the principle of preventative war , which is in complete contradiction to the principle of peace . " syria held political and military sway in lebanon for years until it pulled out its troops in april 2005 under massive pressure following the murder of former lebanese premier rafiq hariri . steinmeier had planned to try to further involve syria in the peace process following the implementation of a ceasefire in southern lebanon , possibly by offering economic incentives in return . now , however , the foreign minister has said he would prefer to fly on to saudi arabia where he is due to end his middle east visit on wednesday . dw staff -lrb- dc / tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de steinmeier to press syria for greater commitment to peace german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier is on his third middle east trip within a month .

but this is exactly what happened in the case of the greatest dramatist of the 20th century , bertolt brecht . ahead of 50th anniversary of brecht 's death , the academy of the arts in berlin and its brecht archive announced that brecht 's manuscripts , which were discovered in switzerland several years ago , have been added to the archive 's collection .
this is the largest expansion of the internationally renowned archive since its founding in 1956 .
the archive is used by approximately 240 researchers every year . previously , it was believed that no new materials could be added to the archive of the most performed german dramatist in the world .
but new brecht materials include brecht 's and other author 's manuscripts , his notebooks , contracts , documents , passports , check books , bills and letters that he wrote or received . all of these , brecht left with his friend , union leader and graphic artist , victor .
n. cohen in 1949 in goldbach on the lake of zurich .
brecht , 51 at the time , was living in switzerland - after years of exile in scandinavia and the united states - and preparing for his return to east berlin .
cohen was a left-inclined social democrat who wrote articles for union newspapers and rand social democratic campaigns and referendums .
he died in 1975 . but it was not until the late 1990s that cohen 's sons actually became aware of the valuable collection . it 's all brecht ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht 's finnish passport " they had to empty a warehouse , because their contract had expired , " said erdmut wizisla of the brecht archive .
" and victor 's stuff was there .
when they opened it , they thought : good god !
this is all brecht !
and then they went on to the next box and found again - all brecht . " the negotiations with the owners lasted eight years .
they were completed successfully because the deutsche klassenlotterie foundation , the german research foundation and the academy of the arts agreed to jointly finance the purchase : 2,500 sheets of paper , which correspond to one fifth of brecht 's overall archival materials , and a typewriter now make up the victor n. cohen collection at the brecht archive . brecht 's wife helena weigel , who meticulously collected brecht 's unpublished writings after his death , seems to have completely forgotten about the materials which were left in switzerland .
brecht himself obviously did n't miss these materials after he returned to germany .
they document above all the time he spent in switzerland , but also shed some light on his exile years in the united states and , to a lesser extent , his earlier periods . new and spectacular bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht left the us in 1947 after testifying before the committee on un-american activities in washington , dc the swiss materials include two previously unknown drafts of the play " the caucasian chalk circle , " several short stories , an idea for a novel as well as political and theatrical essays .
among them is a prose text " my unforgettable character , " in which brecht , similar to what he did in the play the " the resistible rise of arturo ui , " makes a caricature out of hitler . the manuscripts also show that , while in the states , brecht was involved with the council for a democratic germany .
this association of german emigrants was founded in 1944 in response to the national committee free germany , which was based in the soviet union .
brecht composed opinions and letters , in which he urged prominent germans - such as writer alfred döblin - to become engaged .
the council was a temporary coalition which already during the war supported the idea of a unified germany with the possibility of a sovereign inner and foreign policy . theater plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht and his wife helene weigel are buried in berlin the materials also show the enthusiasm with which brecht was preparing for his work in the theater in post-war germany .
he corresponded with his friends and colleagues in germany , directors , actors and german as well as russian cultural officials .
he wanted to adapt all his plays in view of the end of the war .
" arturo ui " was the only play that brecht believed - because of its genre as a farce - as fitting for the stage confrontation with the nazi rule . despite the fact that brecht 's exile years were difficult and marked by lack of success , the 350 letters in the collection paint a picture of a self-confident and self-assertive poet . publications based on the new materials have already been announced .
in addition to brecht 's letters to helena weigel from 1923 to 1956 , german publishing house suhrkamp is also planning to publish a 150-page-long appendix to werner hecht 's 1997 chronicle , which documented brecht 's life from day to day . hecht sees a number of exciting challenges for brecht researchers . " it is , of course , peculiar that brecht was caught in the interpretation struggle between the east and the west , " hecht said .
" now is the time to paint an objective picture of brecht .
that is why discoveries of this kind are of such great value . " dunja welke -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : celebrating bertolt brecht click here for dw-world.de 's dossier on brecht 's life and international influence .

there is still likely to be some disruption .
and on friday , ba said that some 20,000 bags had been lost in the past week , but three quarters of those had now been returned to passengers .
earlier this week on breakfast : we looked at what you can do to prevent your bags going astray .
lost baggage : what can you do ?
the british airports authority - baa - says that individual airlines are responsible for the management and security of baggage .
so , if your luggage does go missing , it 's absolutely vital to report it straight away to the lost baggage desk at the airport .
you 'll need to fill in a form - but your bags may not be officially declared lost for three weeks .
british airways says it asks customers for the make , model and colour of their bags - and the receipt they were given at check-in .
it then gives each customer a ten digit reference number , so they can check on the progress of their search either by phone or online .
if a bag still has n't turned up after 21 days , it 's officially declared lost .
and you then have a further week to make a claim .
a more complicated question can be who pays for lost valuables ?
the airlines say their liability is limited by the montreal convention - to around £ 800 compensation per person .
british airways advises customers to claim on their own travel insurance .
but many people may find that that their policies do not cover valuables put into baggage stowed in the hold .
and british airways ' website also says it wo n't accept liability for valuables such as computers and jewellery which go into the hold - which could leave customers in a black hole .
alice beer 's tips you can never completely guarantee that your luggage wo n't go missing , says alice , but there are some extra things you can do to help keep it safe : keep your packing list : you can use it as an inventory if the worst happens put a piece of paper inside each piece of luggage with your name and contact details on it , in case the label falls off the outside of your bag -lrb- do n't put your house keys in the same bag -rrb- .
if you do need to go shopping on holiday to replace missing clothes , remember the compensation limit is £ 800 : this is not a moment to go designer mad .
consider a service such as flymycase , which will transport your luggage anywhere in the world for a small fee .
if you 're a british airways passenger specifically , your absolute last chance might be to try the auction house greasbys in tooting , south london which sells off unclaimed ba luggage , among other things and remember , only a tiny proportion of luggage is actually permanently lost each year : most cases are eventually reunited with their owners .
hand baggage : what can you take ?
each passenger is permitted to carry one item of cabin baggage through the airport security search point .
this must be no bigger than 45cm long , 35cm wide and of 16cm deep -lrb- 17.7 " × 13.7 " × 6.2 " approx -rrb- including wheels , handles , side pockets etc .
other bags , such as handbags ca n't be carried separately .
they must go into the single item of cabin baggage .
all items carried by passengers will be screened by x-ray .
you will be able to take books , magazines and electrical items like personal stereos .
but you are still not allowed to take liquids of any type in your hand baggage - except for : prescription medicines in liquid form which you need for the flight -lrb- eg diabetic kit -rrb- , as long as verified as authentic .
baby milk and liquid baby food -lrb- the contents of each bottle or jar must be tasted by the accompanying passenger -rrb- .
this includes gels , pastes , lotions and cans - for instance toothpaste , hair gel , drinks , soups , syrups , perfume , deodorant , shaving foam , aerosols all laptops and large electrical items must be removed from the bag and placed in a tray so they can be seen properly pushchairs and walking aids are permitted but must be x-ray screened .
wheelchairs are permitted but must be thoroughly searched .
passengers on transatlantic flights will be searched again at the departure gates .
any liquids , including those bought airside will be confiscated .
the department for transport say they will work closely with operators to introduce these new arrangements , seeking to keep disruption to passengers to a minimum .
they say they will keep these measures under review .
if passengers have any questions on their travel arrangements or security in place at airports they should contact the airport or their airline .
airport operator baa has asked passengers not to bring hand baggage until the latest changes have been phased in at heathrow , gatwick and stansted .
other useful information delays and cancellations are still affecting flights , especially from the airports around london .
if you 're due to travel today , check with your airline or with the airport itself .
please note that the airports are saying that hand luggage wo n't be allowed until at least this afternoon .
british airports authority -lrb- baa -rrb- this will give you advice on what 's happening at london heathrow , gatwick , stansted airports .
it also has links for glasgow , edinburgh , aberdeen and southampton .
the security service mi5 , has now downgraded the threat level to its second highest .
british airways british airways has cancelled 39 short haul and five long haul flights from heathrow today .
it 's also cancelled all its domestic flights from gatwick .
you can find more on its website , ba.com air transport users council the auc is the consumer watchdog for the aviation industry - it 's part of the caa 's website abta the association of british travel agents - abta - has information on its website regarding the disruption for holidaymakers .

earlier this week on breakfast : we looked at what you can do to prevent your bags going astray. watch our interview again with alice beer lost baggage : what can you do ?
the british airports authority - baa - says that individual airlines are responsible for the management and security of baggage .
so , if your luggage does go missing , it 's absolutely vital to report it straight away to the lost baggage desk at the airport .
you 'll need to fill in a form - but your bags may not be officially declared lost for three weeks .
british airways says it asks customers for the make , model and colour of their bags - and the receipt they were given at check-in .
it then gives each customer a ten digit reference number , so they can check on the progress of their search either by phone or online .
if a bag still has n't turned up after 21 days , it 's officially declared lost .
and you then have a further week to make a claim .
a more complicated question can be who pays for lost valuables ?
the airlines say their liability is limited by the montreal convention - to around £ 800 compensation per person .
british airways advises customers to claim on their own travel insurance .
but many people may find that that their policies do not cover valuables put into baggage stowed in the hold .
and british airways ' website also says it wo n't accept liability for valuables such as computers and jewellery which go into the hold - which could leave customers in a black hole .
alice beer 's tips you can never completely guarantee that your luggage wo n't go missing , says alice , but there are some extra things you can do to help keep it safe : do n't panic : your bags may well turn up , says alice keep your packing list : you can use it as an inventory if the worst happens put a piece of paper inside each piece of luggage with your name and contact details on it , in case the label falls off the outside of your bag -lrb- do n't put your house keys in the same bag -rrb- .
if you do need to go shopping on holiday to replace missing clothes , remember the compensation limit is £ 800 : this is not a moment to go designer mad .
consider a service such as flymycase , which will transport your luggage anywhere in the world for a small fee .
if you 're a british airways passenger specifically , your absolute last chance might be to try the auction house greasbys in tooting , south london which sells off unclaimed ba luggage , among other things greasby 's website has photos and basic descriptions of what 's up for auction and remember , only a tiny proportion of luggage is actually permanently lost each year : most cases are eventually reunited with their owners .

earlier this week on breakfast : we looked at what you can do to prevent your bags going astray. watch our interview again with alice beer lost baggage : what can you do ?
the british airports authority - baa - says that individual airlines are responsible for the management and security of baggage .
so , if your luggage does go missing , it 's absolutely vital to report it straight away to the lost baggage desk at the airport .
you 'll need to fill in a form - but your bags may not be officially declared lost for three weeks .
british airways says it asks customers for the make , model and colour of their bags - and the receipt they were given at check-in .
it then gives each customer a ten digit reference number , so they can check on the progress of their search either by phone or online .
if a bag still has n't turned up after 21 days , it 's officially declared lost .
and you then have a further week to make a claim .
a more complicated question can be who pays for lost valuables ?
the airlines say their liability is limited by the montreal convention - to around £ 800 compensation per person .
british airways advises customers to claim on their own travel insurance .
but many people may find that that their policies do not cover valuables put into baggage stowed in the hold .

if you do need to go shopping on holiday to replace missing clothes , remember the compensation limit is £ 800 : this is not a moment to go designer mad .
consider a service such as flymycase , which will transport your luggage anywhere in the world for a small fee .
if you 're a british airways passenger specifically , your absolute last chance might be to try the auction house greasbys in tooting , south london which sells off unclaimed ba luggage , among other things greasby 's website has photos and basic descriptions of what 's up for auction and remember , only a tiny proportion of luggage is actually permanently lost each year : most cases are eventually reunited with their owners .

it is dedicated to the souls of about 2.5 million japanese men , women and children who died in the name of their country since that time .
they include soldiers , war-time nurses , students who entered into battle , and those who committed suicide in shame at the end of world war ii .
at the centre of the shrine 's controversy is the fact that those venerated include 14 convicted class a war criminals , including prime minister general hideki tojo .
within the shrine , the souls of the dead are worshipped rather than just remembered .
according to japan 's national shinto religion , humans are transformed into " kami " or deities when they die , and as such are worshipped by their descendants .
the kami of remarkable people are enshrined .
surrounded by war banners and military regalia , the yasukuni kami are venerated by hundreds of thousands of visitors who attend the shrine each year .
compared with most shinto shrines , which were founded hundreds of years ago , the dedication of the yasukuni shrine was a relatively recent affair .
analysts say that because the main wars it commemorates are those with china and the us , it appears to the political left to symbolise foreign invasions .
to the right , it is a symbol of patriotism .
heated debate the shrine is frequently at the centre of political storms .
there have been several parliamentary debates aimed at removing general tojo 's kami , but these have been blocked every time by nationalists .
the debate intensifies in the lead up to 15 august - the anniversary of japan 's surrender in world war ii .
several cabinet ministers pay their respects at the shrine each year , but only one prime minister , yasuhiro nakasone in 1985 , has made an official visit since the war .
former prime minister ryutaro hashimoto made what he said was a private visit , on his birthday in july 1996 .
current prime minister junichiro koizumi has made six visits to yasukuni since he took office in 2001 .
arguments have ensued over whether these were made in a private or official capacity , although mr koizumi has denied such a distinction can exist for a country 's leader .
" i 'm both a public and private person , " he has said .
mr koizumi has repeatedly argued that his visits are to pray for peace and that japan should never go to war again .
but the visits have angered japan 's asian neighbours , especially china and korea , who were victims of the country 's military aggression in the first half of the 20th century .

it is dedicated to the souls of about 2.5 million japanese men , women and children who died in the name of their country since that time .
they include soldiers , war-time nurses , students who entered into battle , and those who committed suicide in shame at the end of world war ii .
at the centre of the shrine 's controversy is the fact that those venerated include 14 convicted class a war criminals , including prime minister general hideki tojo .
within the shrine , the souls of the dead are worshipped rather than just remembered .
according to japan 's national shinto religion , humans are transformed into " kami " or deities when they die , and as such are worshipped by their descendants .
the kami of remarkable people are enshrined .
surrounded by war banners and military regalia , the yasukuni kami are venerated by hundreds of thousands of visitors who attend the shrine each year .
compared with most shinto shrines , which were founded hundreds of years ago , the dedication of the yasukuni shrine was a relatively recent affair .
analysts say that because the main wars it commemorates are those with china and the us , it appears to the political left to symbolise foreign invasions .
to the right , it is a symbol of patriotism .
heated debate the shrine is frequently at the centre of political storms .
there have been several parliamentary debates aimed at removing general tojo 's kami , but these have been blocked every time by nationalists .
the debate intensifies in the lead up to 15 august - the anniversary of japan 's surrender in world war ii .
several cabinet ministers pay their respects at the shrine each year , but only one prime minister , yasuhiro nakasone in 1985 , has made an official visit since the war .
former prime minister ryutaro hashimoto made what he said was a private visit , on his birthday in july 1996 .
mr koizumi has visited the shrine six times as prime minister current prime minister junichiro koizumi has made six visits to yasukuni since he took office in 2001 .
arguments have ensued over whether these were made in a private or official capacity , although mr koizumi has denied such a distinction can exist for a country 's leader .
" i 'm both a public and private person , " he has said .

it is dedicated to the souls of about 2.5 million japanese men , women and children who died in the name of their country since that time .
they include soldiers , war-time nurses , students who entered into battle , and those who committed suicide in shame at the end of world war ii .
at the centre of the shrine 's controversy is the fact that those venerated include 14 convicted class a war criminals , including prime minister general hideki tojo .
within the shrine , the souls of the dead are worshipped rather than just remembered .
according to japan 's national shinto religion , humans are transformed into " kami " or deities when they die , and as such are worshipped by their descendants .
the kami of remarkable people are enshrined .
surrounded by war banners and military regalia , the yasukuni kami are venerated by hundreds of thousands of visitors who attend the shrine each year .
compared with most shinto shrines , which were founded hundreds of years ago , the dedication of the yasukuni shrine was a relatively recent affair .
analysts say that because the main wars it commemorates are those with china and the us , it appears to the political left to symbolise foreign invasions .
to the right , it is a symbol of patriotism .
heated debate the shrine is frequently at the centre of political storms .
there have been several parliamentary debates aimed at removing general tojo 's kami , but these have been blocked every time by nationalists .
the debate intensifies in the lead up to 15 august - the anniversary of japan 's surrender in world war ii .
several cabinet ministers pay their respects at the shrine each year , but only one prime minister , yasuhiro nakasone in 1985 , has made an official visit since the war .
former prime minister ryutaro hashimoto made what he said was a private visit , on his birthday in july 1996 .
mr koizumi has visited the shrine six times as prime minister current prime minister junichiro koizumi has made six visits to yasukuni since he took office in 2001 .
arguments have ensued over whether these were made in a private or official capacity , although mr koizumi has denied such a distinction can exist for a country 's leader .
" i 'm both a public and private person , " he has said .
mr koizumi has repeatedly argued that his visits are to pray for peace and that japan should never go to war again .
but the visits have angered japan 's asian neighbours , especially china and korea , who were victims of the country 's military aggression in the first half of the 20th century .

it will be a war of recriminations and blame , but it will also be a struggle to determine the true lessons of the fighting in lebanon .
it is a struggle from which few of israel 's political or military leaders may emerge unbruised .
and it is a struggle that will determine the fate not just of prime minister ehud olmert , but also of his plan to withdraw israeli settlers from significant parts of the occupied west bank .
almost from the outset , the government 's conduct of this conflict confused the israeli public and confounded many of the country 's most experienced defence experts .
there was the initial reliance upon air power to deal with the hezbollah missile threat .
then there was a series of ground incursions a short way into lebanon , which produced fierce skirmishes but little change to the overall strategic picture .
then , almost at the same time as the united nations was putting the final touches to a new security council resolution to end the fighting , there was israel 's last-minute push northwards towards the litani river .
barrage of criticism the analysis of what went wrong and what went right has already begun in the israeli press .
but this is only a prelude to what may come .
there is a long tradition in israel of searching , full-scale inquiries into national setbacks .
one obvious parallel is with the agranat commission , under the chief justice of israel 's supreme court .
that was appointed to investigate why israel was caught by surprise by the onslaught from egypt and syria at the outbreak of the 1973 yom kippur war .
as a result of its report , the then chief of staff of the israel defense forces -lrb- idf -rrb- was forced to resign and other senior officers were removed from their posts .
although largely vindicated , israel 's then prime minister golda meir resigned shortly afterwards .
today , both israel 's military and political leadership have come in for a barrage of criticism .
many members of parliament are calling for a committee of inquiry into the conduct of the war , most recently yossi beilin , the chairman of the opposition meretz party .
a whole range of issues relating to the preparedness of the civil defence infrastructure are likely to be taken up by the state comptroller , whose regular investigations have criticised readiness in the past .
searching questions professor shai feldman , director of the crown centre for middle eastern studies at brandeis university , is a leading commentator on israeli affairs and has spent most of the conflict in israel .
" a full-scale judicial inquiry , " he believes , " is more likely than not . "
but , one way or another , he says that the olmert government 's handling of this crisis is going to come under huge scrutiny .
any inquiry , says prof feldman , will not be about the principle of a strong response to the initial hezbollah attack .
for that , there remains a strong consensus .
but he sets out a range of searching questions for which , he believes , there will need to be answers .
what exactly did israel 's military chiefs tell their political masters about what could be expected from an air assault against hezbollah ?
when , a week or so into the conflict , air power was not halting the missile fire , why was the leadership 's learning curve so steep ?
and why , he asks , when limited ground operations proved equally ineffective was the decision to mount a major offensive taken only a short time before a likely cease-fire ?
key figures then there are questions about the idf 's intelligence .
it seems to have known about most of the modern weapons systems deployed by hezbollah , with the possible exception of the iranian-supplied anti-shipping missile that hit an israeli vessel early on in the conflict .
but the idf did not appear to realise the scale and complexity of hezbollah 's fortifications in southern lebanon .
" to what extent did the idf seek to adjust its doctrine and tactics to the real challenge facing it ? " asks prof feldman .
any inquiry is bound to examine the performance not just of mr olmert himself , but also of other key figures like defence minister amir peretz , chief of staff dan halutz and other senior commanders .
the way the government was managed and the way the relationship between the military and the civilian leadership was handled is also certain to be a matter of debate .
political legacy this , though , is not just a battle over what happened in the recent past .
it will be a battle for mr olmert 's political project for the future - disengagement from more of the west bank .
this project , according to many well-placed analysts , is the explanation for israel 's massive response to the hezbollah attack .
with missiles flying into israel from the gaza strip ever since israeli troops withdrew a year ago , and now with missiles being fired from lebanon -lrb- from which the un is satisfied israel withdrew in 2000 -rrb- , mr olmert determined that he was fighting for what may be his political legacy .
without a strong and effective response to the hezbollah missile threat he would , says prof feldman , find it impossible to convince the israeli public that a further withdrawal would be in israel 's interests .
indeed , prof feldman warns , creating a new consensus for a further pull-out could now be " mission impossible " .

the coming struggle may decide ehud olmert 's political future it will be a war of recriminations and blame , but it will also be a struggle to determine the true lessons of the fighting in lebanon .
it is a struggle from which few of israel 's political or military leaders may emerge unbruised .
and it is a struggle that will determine the fate not just of prime minister ehud olmert , but also of his plan to withdraw israeli settlers from significant parts of the occupied west bank .
almost from the outset , the government 's conduct of this conflict confused the israeli public and confounded many of the country 's most experienced defence experts .
there was the initial reliance upon air power to deal with the hezbollah missile threat .
then there was a series of ground incursions a short way into lebanon , which produced fierce skirmishes but little change to the overall strategic picture .
then , almost at the same time as the united nations was putting the final touches to a new security council resolution to end the fighting , there was israel 's last-minute push northwards towards the litani river .
barrage of criticism the analysis of what went wrong and what went right has already begun in the israeli press .
but this is only a prelude to what may come .
there is a long tradition in israel of searching , full-scale inquiries into national setbacks .
golda meir resigned after an inquiry into the 1973 yom kippur war one obvious parallel is with the agranat commission , under the chief justice of israel 's supreme court .
that was appointed to investigate why israel was caught by surprise by the onslaught from egypt and syria at the outbreak of the 1973 yom kippur war .
as a result of its report , the then chief of staff of the israel defense forces -lrb- idf -rrb- was forced to resign and other senior officers were removed from their posts .
although largely vindicated , israel 's then prime minister golda meir resigned shortly afterwards .
today , both israel 's military and political leadership have come in for a barrage of criticism .
many members of parliament are calling for a committee of inquiry into the conduct of the war , most recently yossi beilin , the chairman of the opposition meretz party .
a whole range of issues relating to the preparedness of the civil defence infrastructure are likely to be taken up by the state comptroller , whose regular investigations have criticised readiness in the past .
searching questions professor shai feldman , director of the crown centre for middle eastern studies at brandeis university , is a leading commentator on israeli affairs and has spent most of the conflict in israel .
questions may be asked about israel 's use of air power in lebanon " a full-scale judicial inquiry , " he believes , " is more likely than not . "
but , one way or another , he says that the olmert government 's handling of this crisis is going to come under huge scrutiny .
any inquiry , says prof feldman , will not be about the principle of a strong response to the initial hezbollah attack .
for that , there remains a strong consensus .
but he sets out a range of searching questions for which , he believes , there will need to be answers .
what exactly did israel 's military chiefs tell their political masters about what could be expected from an air assault against hezbollah ?
when , a week or so into the conflict , air power was not halting the missile fire , why was the leadership 's learning curve so steep ?
and why , he asks , when limited ground operations proved equally ineffective was the decision to mount a major offensive taken only a short time before a likely cease-fire ?
key figures then there are questions about the idf 's intelligence .
the performance of chief of staff dan halutz may be examined it seems to have known about most of the modern weapons systems deployed by hezbollah , with the possible exception of the iranian-supplied anti-shipping missile that hit an israeli vessel early on in the conflict .
but the idf did not appear to realise the scale and complexity of hezbollah 's fortifications in southern lebanon .
" to what extent did the idf seek to adjust its doctrine and tactics to the real challenge facing it ? " asks prof feldman .
any inquiry is bound to examine the performance not just of mr olmert himself , but also of other key figures like defence minister amir peretz , chief of staff dan halutz and other senior commanders .
the way the government was managed and the way the relationship between the military and the civilian leadership was handled is also certain to be a matter of debate .
political legacy this , though , is not just a battle over what happened in the recent past .
it will be a battle for mr olmert 's political project for the future - disengagement from more of the west bank .

the coming struggle may decide ehud olmert 's political future it will be a war of recriminations and blame , but it will also be a struggle to determine the true lessons of the fighting in lebanon .
it is a struggle from which few of israel 's political or military leaders may emerge unbruised .
and it is a struggle that will determine the fate not just of prime minister ehud olmert , but also of his plan to withdraw israeli settlers from significant parts of the occupied west bank .
almost from the outset , the government 's conduct of this conflict confused the israeli public and confounded many of the country 's most experienced defence experts .
there was the initial reliance upon air power to deal with the hezbollah missile threat .
then there was a series of ground incursions a short way into lebanon , which produced fierce skirmishes but little change to the overall strategic picture .
then , almost at the same time as the united nations was putting the final touches to a new security council resolution to end the fighting , there was israel 's last-minute push northwards towards the litani river .
barrage of criticism the analysis of what went wrong and what went right has already begun in the israeli press .
but this is only a prelude to what may come .
there is a long tradition in israel of searching , full-scale inquiries into national setbacks .
golda meir resigned after an inquiry into the 1973 yom kippur war one obvious parallel is with the agranat commission , under the chief justice of israel 's supreme court .
that was appointed to investigate why israel was caught by surprise by the onslaught from egypt and syria at the outbreak of the 1973 yom kippur war .
as a result of its report , the then chief of staff of the israel defense forces -lrb- idf -rrb- was forced to resign and other senior officers were removed from their posts .
although largely vindicated , israel 's then prime minister golda meir resigned shortly afterwards .
today , both israel 's military and political leadership have come in for a barrage of criticism .
many members of parliament are calling for a committee of inquiry into the conduct of the war , most recently yossi beilin , the chairman of the opposition meretz party .
a whole range of issues relating to the preparedness of the civil defence infrastructure are likely to be taken up by the state comptroller , whose regular investigations have criticised readiness in the past .
searching questions professor shai feldman , director of the crown centre for middle eastern studies at brandeis university , is a leading commentator on israeli affairs and has spent most of the conflict in israel .
questions may be asked about israel 's use of air power in lebanon " a full-scale judicial inquiry , " he believes , " is more likely than not . "
but , one way or another , he says that the olmert government 's handling of this crisis is going to come under huge scrutiny .
any inquiry , says prof feldman , will not be about the principle of a strong response to the initial hezbollah attack .
for that , there remains a strong consensus .
but he sets out a range of searching questions for which , he believes , there will need to be answers .
what exactly did israel 's military chiefs tell their political masters about what could be expected from an air assault against hezbollah ?
when , a week or so into the conflict , air power was not halting the missile fire , why was the leadership 's learning curve so steep ?
and why , he asks , when limited ground operations proved equally ineffective was the decision to mount a major offensive taken only a short time before a likely cease-fire ?
key figures then there are questions about the idf 's intelligence .
the performance of chief of staff dan halutz may be examined it seems to have known about most of the modern weapons systems deployed by hezbollah , with the possible exception of the iranian-supplied anti-shipping missile that hit an israeli vessel early on in the conflict .
but the idf did not appear to realise the scale and complexity of hezbollah 's fortifications in southern lebanon .
" to what extent did the idf seek to adjust its doctrine and tactics to the real challenge facing it ? " asks prof feldman .
any inquiry is bound to examine the performance not just of mr olmert himself , but also of other key figures like defence minister amir peretz , chief of staff dan halutz and other senior commanders .
the way the government was managed and the way the relationship between the military and the civilian leadership was handled is also certain to be a matter of debate .
political legacy this , though , is not just a battle over what happened in the recent past .
it will be a battle for mr olmert 's political project for the future - disengagement from more of the west bank .
this project , according to many well-placed analysts , is the explanation for israel 's massive response to the hezbollah attack .
with missiles flying into israel from the gaza strip ever since israeli troops withdrew a year ago , and now with missiles being fired from lebanon -lrb- from which the un is satisfied israel withdrew in 2000 -rrb- , mr olmert determined that he was fighting for what may be his political legacy .
without a strong and effective response to the hezbollah missile threat he would , says prof feldman , find it impossible to convince the israeli public that a further withdrawal would be in israel 's interests .
indeed , prof feldman warns , creating a new consensus for a further pull-out could now be " mission impossible " .

within eight hours of throwing away his l-plates , tom martin , 17 , from cardiff , took four friends out in the family peugeot 306 , lost control and crashed .
road safety wales says one way to cut back on accident is to encourage new drivers to take an additional course to give them experience of driving in different conditions .

he and his friends managed to get out of the wreckage with cuts and bruises , but they were extremely shocked .
" my life flashed before me , i was more upset than anything else as well because it was my mum 's car , but i realise it could have much worse , " he said .
" my friends were fine .
i realise now the people in my car are my responsibility , when i crashed i did n't realise that .
