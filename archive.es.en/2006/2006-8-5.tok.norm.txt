program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.08.2006 merkel criticizes russia for treatment of former yukos boss großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mikhail khodorkovsky faces harsh and violent conditions in his siberian prison camp german chancellor angela merkel has criticized the current prison conditions of the founder of the former russian oil firm yukos , mikhail khodorkovsky . replying to a letter from opposition liberal democrat chief guido westerwelle , merkel said the government in berlin would continue to use its good working relationship with the russian president to push for a speedy improvement of conditions for khodorkovsky who 's serving an 8-year sentence in a prison camp in siberia after being convicted of tax evasion and embezzlement . in a letter to fdp chief westerwelle , german chancellor angela merkel wrote that she had repeatedly pointed out to russian president vladimir putin that prison conditions for khodorkovsky - once the richest man in russia - were simply unacceptable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is not afraid to put her point across she urged the russian government to adhere to international standards .
the founder of the former top oil producer yukos is serving his prison sentence in siberia in very harsh conditions meant to isolate him completely from the outer world . former liberal democrat justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger who 's now a legal rights spokesperson has been following the khodorkovsky case very closely and shares the widely held opinion that the recent liquidation of the yukos firm and the way khodorkovsky is being treated are the kremlin 's retaliation for the latter 's long-standing opposition to president putin punishment for putin opposition ? " he was placed in solitary confinement several times , " leutheusser-schnarrenberger said .
" and he 's being treated in a very arbitrary way .
if he drinks his tea in the wrong place , he faces severe punishment , for instance .
and then there was the incident in which he was attacked with a knife by another inmate and injured in his face .
which goes to show that khodorkovsky is n't safe in this camp , and this is what we 're criticizing and what needs to be changed . " along with fdp chief guido westerwelle , leutheuser-schnarrenberger wants the government in berlin to raise the issue more clearly with the kremlin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger " the chancellor deserves some credit for at least calling khodorkovsky 's prison conditions unacceptable , " leutheusser-schnarrenberger said .
" but i do believe that the government has to do more than just casually mentioning the issue in talks with the russian president . " calls for increased eu pressure " there are eu-wide initiatives by politicians with much stronger criticism of the kremlin 's policy , and chancellor merkel should also step up her efforts to influence putin .
because we all know that nothing happens in khodorkovsky 's camp without his knowledge and consent . " the khodorkovsky case was also reported to have been touched upon during the recent visit to germany by us president george w. bush .
he put the case in the wider context of russia 's poor human rights record and promised that he would not tire of telling putin what he did n't approve of , but he did n't think much of pillorying the russian president in public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush never tires of chiding putin in private " nobody likes to be lectured a lot .
if you want to be effective , what you do n't go is scold the person publicly all the time .
you remind him where we may have a difference of opinion , and you do so in a respectful way .
so you can then sit down and have a constructive dialogue , " bush said . germany 's ruling and opposition parties are in agreement that it 's vital to show the kremlin that khodorkovsky 's fate is being followed closely in the west and that any irregularities will draw even more criticism from leaders here . hardy graupner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans criticize khordorkovsky verdict german politicians on tuesday condemned the jailing of yukos oil founder mikhail khordorkovsky , who was convicted of fraud and tax evasion by a russian court .

because we all know that nothing happens in khodorkovsky 's camp without his knowledge and consent . " the khodorkovsky case was also reported to have been touched upon during the recent visit to germany by us president george w. bush .
he put the case in the wider context of russia 's poor human rights record and promised that he would not tire of telling putin what he did n't approve of , but he did n't think much of pillorying the russian president in public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush never tires of chiding putin in private " nobody likes to be lectured a lot .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : violence in the middle east steinmeier cancels talks with syrian president propaganda wars fight for headlines in the middle east " germany should take part in lebanon peace-keeping mission " eu takes charge in cleaning oil spill on lebanese coast europe -pipe- 05.08.2006 an elusive goal : a common middle east policy for europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has called for an " immediate cessation of hostilities " in lebabon the european union says it wants to have a common foreign policy , but is deeply split over the middle east crisis .
we took a look at a few eu countries and their neighbors and what divides them on the issue . despite repeated efforts , europe has not been able to find a common approach to the middle east crisis .
the possibility of sending an international peacekeeping force to the region remains open , but the opinions of the various european countries and their key partners remain across the board . some countries - including france , sweden , norway , slovakia , canada , germany , turkey , italy , spain , belgium , and ireland - have already expressed a willingness to participate in an international peace effort by sending troops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : historical ties are influencing europe 's stance a ceasefire and an international mandate , however , are seen as a prerequisite for involvement , whether it takes places under the banner of nato , the un or the european union . there is hope among europeans that the middle east would also join in and contribute to a peacekeeping effort , particularly egypt . dw-world.de looked at a few of the key players in the greater european area , what is at stake for them , and why they ca n't find a common line . germany israel 's president ehud olmert said in an interview with the süddeutsche zeitung daily that he has " absolutely no problem with german soldiers in southern lebanon … .at the moment , no other nation is as friendly to israel as germany .
if germany can contribute to the security of the israeli people , this would be a rewarding task … " olmert 's expectation of german involvement rests on the tight but history-laden relationship the two countries have developed since world war ii . not only were the nazis responsible for the death of six million jews during the holocaust , the state of israel was established in 1948 as a direct response to the nazi persecution .
the international community felt obligated to secure a jewish state for the survivors . germany 's history has made it very reluctant to send soldiers into combat since world war ii . germany 's defense minister franz josef jung -lrb- cdu -rrb- has said he considers german participation in an international peacekeeping force a possibility , while chancellor angela merkel and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier -lrb- spd -rrb- are more cautious .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo is still a painful memory for the eu " we do n't necessarily dismiss involvement , but we are hesitant , " said merkel , as reported by germany news agency dpa . within germany 's political parties , opinions are split .
some see germany 's history as an obligation to participate , other see precisely that as a reason to stay out of it , wrote dw-world.de 's peter philip . history is not the only factor in germany 's hesitancy .
its army , the bundeswehr , has current obligations in other crisis areas , such as dr congo and afghanistan , and it could become increasingly difficult to convince the german population of the need to take part in the israel-lebanon crisis as well . england a traditional american ally and supporter of the iraq war , britain , along with germany , was one of the countries to call for a " cessation of hostilities " instead of an immediate ceasefire in the eu foreign ministers ' joint statement . lebanese president fuad siniora has , however , called on tony blair to advocate an immediate ceasefire , reported afp . the british government supports a gradual ceasefire , along with the united states , so that hezbollah can be weakened before the hostilities stop since the lebanese army is not as strong as the extremist group . with troops currently in iraq and afghanistan , britain 's resources are already stretched thin and it has not expressed a willingness to engage troops in lebanon or israel . turkey turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan was one of the very first heads of state to announce a willingness to send troops , wrote the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- daily .
he 's a practicing muslim himself and his government acted as a mediator between israel and hamas this spring . the country , which has been negotiating for years with the european union on future accession , has been mentioned as a possible leader in an international mission due to its proximity to the region .
however , recent statements have indicated france is more likely to lead a mission . erdogan has yet to convince the population of turkey that military involvement in the crisis would be beneficial , wrote the faz . russia russia renewed demands for an immediate end to hostilities in the middle east , reported the financial times deutschland daily .

we took a look at a few eu countries and their neighbors and what divides them on the issue . despite repeated efforts , europe has not been able to find a common approach to the middle east crisis .
the possibility of sending an international peacekeeping force to the region remains open , but the opinions of the various european countries and their key partners remain across the board . some countries - including france , sweden , norway , slovakia , canada , germany , turkey , italy , spain , belgium , and ireland - have already expressed a willingness to participate in an international peace effort by sending troops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : historical ties are influencing europe 's stance a ceasefire and an international mandate , however , are seen as a prerequisite for involvement , whether it takes places under the banner of nato , the un or the european union . there is hope among europeans that the middle east would also join in and contribute to a peacekeeping effort , particularly egypt . dw-world.de looked at a few of the key players in the greater european area , what is at stake for them , and why they ca n't find a common line . germany israel 's president ehud olmert said in an interview with the süddeutsche zeitung daily that he has " absolutely no problem with german soldiers in southern lebanon … .at the moment , no other nation is as friendly to israel as germany .
if germany can contribute to the security of the israeli people , this would be a rewarding task … " olmert 's expectation of german involvement rests on the tight but history-laden relationship the two countries have developed since world war ii . not only were the nazis responsible for the death of six million jews during the holocaust , the state of israel was established in 1948 as a direct response to the nazi persecution .
the international community felt obligated to secure a jewish state for the survivors . germany 's history has made it very reluctant to send soldiers into combat since world war ii . germany 's defense minister franz josef jung -lrb- cdu -rrb- has said he considers german participation in an international peacekeeping force a possibility , while chancellor angela merkel and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier -lrb- spd -rrb- are more cautious .

he 's a practicing muslim himself and his government acted as a mediator between israel and hamas this spring . the country , which has been negotiating for years with the european union on future accession , has been mentioned as a possible leader in an international mission due to its proximity to the region .

dw-world 's peter stützle says that the country 's mood may soon see itself reflected in the government 's policies as well . in her first reaction to the israeli attack on lebanon , german chancellor angela merkel struck the right chord with the german people when she said that israel had to make sure not to destabilize lebanon .
one week later , the people and the chancellor were no longer on the same page about this issue . according to a representative poll , three quarters of the german population believed the israeli military offensive was inappropriate ; only 12 percent approved of it , while the rest was unsure either way .
the chancellor did urge the israelis to use proportional force , but , at the same time , she asked hezbollah to release the captured israeli soldiers and stop the shelling of israeli cities in order for israel to put an end to its operations .
since it was clear from the outset that a terrorist organization like hezbollah would ignore such a request , the german position amounted to giving the israelis carte blanche for their military offensive . agony on both sides bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli soldier alon fintuha was killed on thursday in southern lebanon there is a broad consensus among the german public that the shelling of israeli cities is not acceptable .
germans are generally put off by hezbollah fighters and their iranian backers who want to wipe israel off the map . the occasional claim that germans are only paying attention to the suffering of the lebanese civilians while ignoring that of the israelis is completely unwarranted .
for years , every single terror attack in israel has received widespread coverage in the german media - often wider than thousands of victims in african wars .
nowadays , too , there are reports about the suffering on both sides . germans , on the other hand , expect higher moral standards from israel than from a terrorist organization .
that is not an unfair expectation , rather it is a sign of high esteem .
when israel fought for its survival during the six day war in 1967 , germans responded with an outpouring of sympathy for the jewish state .
but when israel responds to terrorist attacks against civilians by causing ten times the casualties , germans do not find that acceptable . a missed opportunity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli attacks have lead some moderate lebanese citizens to sympathyze with hezbollah politically aware germans know very well that lebanon was on the verge of liberating itself from the syrian grasp .
after all , it was germany 's chief prosecutor , detlev mehlis , who made a significant contribution to the process with his investigation into the murder of the former lebanese prime minister rafik hariri in feb .
2005 . this is why many germans are now bitter about the fact that the current war could destroy the democratization of lebanon as well as the prospects for peace along israel 's northern border .
and even those who do not analyze these things with great subtlety feel that israel 's reaction to the terrorist provocations may be ruining chances for peace . the growing rejection of israeli policies by the german public has manifested itself in the rising opposition to the german participation in a possible peacekeeping mission in the middle east .
almost two thirds of polled germans are against it .
under these circumstances , the german government could hardly send any soldiers , should an international mission be organized . nobody should be surprised if the german government gradually became impatient with israel .
even in foreign policy , the country 's mood can not be totally ignored . peter stützle -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " germany should take part in lebanon peace-keeping mission " former israeli ambassador to germany avi primor backed the idea of german troops participating in a possible international peacekeeping mission in lebanon as long as they were not stationed on the border with israel .

dw-world 's peter stützle says that the country 's mood may soon see itself reflected in the government 's policies as well . in her first reaction to the israeli attack on lebanon , german chancellor angela merkel struck the right chord with the german people when she said that israel had to make sure not to destabilize lebanon .
one week later , the people and the chancellor were no longer on the same page about this issue . according to a representative poll , three quarters of the german population believed the israeli military offensive was inappropriate ; only 12 percent approved of it , while the rest was unsure either way .
the chancellor did urge the israelis to use proportional force , but , at the same time , she asked hezbollah to release the captured israeli soldiers and stop the shelling of israeli cities in order for israel to put an end to its operations .
since it was clear from the outset that a terrorist organization like hezbollah would ignore such a request , the german position amounted to giving the israelis carte blanche for their military offensive . agony on both sides bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli soldier alon fintuha was killed on thursday in southern lebanon there is a broad consensus among the german public that the shelling of israeli cities is not acceptable .

the founder of the former top oil producer yukos is serving his prison sentence in siberia in very harsh conditions meant to isolate him completely from the outer world . former liberal democrat justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger who 's now a legal rights spokesperson has been following the khodorkovsky case very closely and shares the widely held opinion that the recent liquidation of the yukos firm and the way khodorkovsky is being treated are the kremlin 's retaliation for the latter 's long-standing opposition to president putin punishment for putin opposition ? " he was placed in solitary confinement several times , " leutheusser-schnarrenberger said .
" and he 's being treated in a very arbitrary way .
if he drinks his tea in the wrong place , he faces severe punishment , for instance .

which goes to show that khodorkovsky is n't safe in this camp , and this is what we 're criticizing and what needs to be changed .

" but i do believe that the government has to do more than just casually mentioning the issue in talks with the russian president . " calls for increased eu pressure " there are eu-wide initiatives by politicians with much stronger criticism of the kremlin 's policy , and chancellor merkel should also step up her efforts to influence putin .
because we all know that nothing happens in khodorkovsky 's camp without his knowledge and consent . " the khodorkovsky case was also reported to have been touched upon during the recent visit to germany by us president george w. bush .
he put the case in the wider context of russia 's poor human rights record and promised that he would not tire of telling putin what he did n't approve of , but he did n't think much of pillorying the russian president in public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush never tires of chiding putin in private " nobody likes to be lectured a lot .
if you want to be effective , what you do n't go is scold the person publicly all the time .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 05.08.2006 new blow to cycling as tour winner landis tests positive großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : floyd landis celebrates winning the tour de france , a title he may be stripped off tour de france winner floyd landis is set to become the first victor of the race to be stripped of his title after his b sample confirmed he had abnormal levels of testosterone on saturday . the 30-year-old american - who was also sacked by his phonak team following the announcement - had failed a drugs test after the 17th stage of the tour de france which he had won to get his way back into the race just a day after he had faded out of contention . however the sport 's governing body uci revealed on saturday that the b sample had simply confirmed the initial findings - though landis 's camp had already accepted that it would . " uci communicates that the analysis of the sample b of floyd landis 's urine has confirmed the result of an adverse analytical finding notified by the anti-doping laboratory of paris on 26th july , following the analysis of the sample a , " said a uci statement . " in accordance to the anti-doping rules , the anti-doping commission of the uci will request that the usa cycling federation open a disciplinary procedure against the rider . " landis , though , protested his innocence and announced on his website that he would appeal against the findings . " landis will pursue the appeal procedures established by the uci in order to overturn the laboratory results .
it is expected that the matter will now be referred to usa cycling . tour winner maintains innocence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : landis faces a fall from grace " landis , who has not used performance-enhancing substances , maintains his innocence in this case and believes that he will be vindicated of the doping charges . " landis 's attorney , howard jacobs , has begun preparing the case for arbitration .
if the case follows the normal protocol , it is expected to be resolved within four to six months . " at this point in time , i am waiting to receive the full laboratory documentation for the b test .
in consultation with some of the leading medical and scientific experts , we will prove that floyd landis 's victory in the 2006 tour de france was not aided in any respect by the use of any banned substances , " said jacobs . landis and jacobs will also argue against the uci 's premature release of the a sample findings as well as the anonymous leak of the carbon-isotope test results to the new york times on july 31 . legal team complains of bias bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : landis with champagne , not a sample " i call on the uci to start following its own rules and to allow this process to proceed without the further taint of public comment by uci officials , " added jacobs . " the anti-doping process must be free from the perception that sports federations and anti-doping authorities , who hold great political and financial sway over sport , are attempting to influence the outcome of a pending case by issuing inappropriate public comments . " christophe prudhomme , the tour de france race director , said he was not in the least bit surprised by the b sample findings but added that responsibility also lay with the american 's team , phonak , who have had a series of high profile drugs cases in the past few years including landis ' compatriot tyler hamilton . the soiled yellow jersey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a false champion ?
" the body blow came last week , " he told reporters .
" we know that virtually the whole time the b sample confirms the initial result .
my feeling is that it is a real waste but also that we have to battle really hard against drug taking . " " we can not tolerate the yellow jersey being soiled . " " taking the landis case into account , it is imperative that the managers , the team directors , the doctors or indeed those who pretend to be doctors are also punished , " added prudhomme , echoing comments made by athletics governing body the iaaf earlier this week about the group surrounding athletics world 100m joint record holder justin gatlin , who also tested positive for testosterone . landis had said prior to the b sample result that he would go to the limit to prove his innocence .
" i ask not to be judged and much less to be sentenced by anyone , " landis said over a week ago . " i will proceed to undergo all of these tests " to show the levels " are absolutely natural and produced by my own organism " , he promised on friday . the american added that he wished to state " categorically that my tour win was exclusively due to many years of training and dedication " to his sport . " i declare convincingly and categorically that my winning the tour de france has been exclusively due to many years of training and my complete devotion to cycling . " i was the strongest guy .

the founder of the former top oil producer yukos is serving his prison sentence in siberia in very harsh conditions meant to isolate him completely from the outer world . former liberal democrat justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger who 's now a legal rights spokesperson has been following the khodorkovsky case very closely and shares the widely held opinion that the recent liquidation of the yukos firm and the way khodorkovsky is being treated are the kremlin 's retaliation for the latter 's long-standing opposition to president putin punishment for putin opposition ? " he was placed in solitary confinement several times , " leutheusser-schnarrenberger said .
" and he 's being treated in a very arbitrary way .
if he drinks his tea in the wrong place , he faces severe punishment , for instance .
and then there was the incident in which he was attacked with a knife by another inmate and injured in his face .
which goes to show that khodorkovsky is n't safe in this camp , and this is what we 're criticizing and what needs to be changed .

" but i do believe that the government has to do more than just casually mentioning the issue in talks with the russian president . " calls for increased eu pressure " there are eu-wide initiatives by politicians with much stronger criticism of the kremlin 's policy , and chancellor merkel should also step up her efforts to influence putin .
because we all know that nothing happens in khodorkovsky 's camp without his knowledge and consent . " the khodorkovsky case was also reported to have been touched upon during the recent visit to germany by us president george w. bush .
he put the case in the wider context of russia 's poor human rights record and promised that he would not tire of telling putin what he did n't approve of , but he did n't think much of pillorying the russian president in public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush never tires of chiding putin in private " nobody likes to be lectured a lot .

the founder of the former top oil producer yukos is serving his prison sentence in siberia in very harsh conditions meant to isolate him completely from the outer world . former liberal democrat justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger who 's now a legal rights spokesperson has been following the khodorkovsky case very closely and shares the widely held opinion that the recent liquidation of the yukos firm and the way khodorkovsky is being treated are the kremlin 's retaliation for the latter 's long-standing opposition to president putin punishment for putin opposition ? " he was placed in solitary confinement several times , " leutheusser-schnarrenberger said .
" and he 's being treated in a very arbitrary way .
if he drinks his tea in the wrong place , he faces severe punishment , for instance .
and then there was the incident in which he was attacked with a knife by another inmate and injured in his face .
which goes to show that khodorkovsky is n't safe in this camp , and this is what we 're criticizing and what needs to be changed . " along with fdp chief guido westerwelle , leutheuser-schnarrenberger wants the government in berlin to raise the issue more clearly with the kremlin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger " the chancellor deserves some credit for at least calling khodorkovsky 's prison conditions unacceptable , " leutheusser-schnarrenberger said .
" but i do believe that the government has to do more than just casually mentioning the issue in talks with the russian president . " calls for increased eu pressure " there are eu-wide initiatives by politicians with much stronger criticism of the kremlin 's policy , and chancellor merkel should also step up her efforts to influence putin .
because we all know that nothing happens in khodorkovsky 's camp without his knowledge and consent . " the khodorkovsky case was also reported to have been touched upon during the recent visit to germany by us president george w. bush .
he put the case in the wider context of russia 's poor human rights record and promised that he would not tire of telling putin what he did n't approve of , but he did n't think much of pillorying the russian president in public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush never tires of chiding putin in private " nobody likes to be lectured a lot .
if you want to be effective , what you do n't go is scold the person publicly all the time .
you remind him where we may have a difference of opinion , and you do so in a respectful way .
so you can then sit down and have a constructive dialogue , " bush said . germany 's ruling and opposition parties are in agreement that it 's vital to show the kremlin that khodorkovsky 's fate is being followed closely in the west and that any irregularities will draw even more criticism from leaders here . hardy graupner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans criticize khordorkovsky verdict german politicians on tuesday condemned the jailing of yukos oil founder mikhail khordorkovsky , who was convicted of fraud and tax evasion by a russian court .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.08.2006 opinion : germans expect higher moral standards from israel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli missiles have started targeting bridges in the christian heartland north of beirut germans are increasingly disenchanted with israel 's response to hezbollah 's terrorist acts .
dw-world 's peter stützle says that the country 's mood may soon see itself reflected in the government 's policies as well . in her first reaction to the israeli attack on lebanon , german chancellor angela merkel struck the right chord with the german people when she said that israel had to make sure not to destabilize lebanon .
one week later , the people and the chancellor were no longer on the same page about this issue . according to a representative poll , three quarters of the german population believed the israeli military offensive was inappropriate ; only 12 percent approved of it , while the rest was unsure either way .
the chancellor did urge the israelis to use proportional force , but , at the same time , she asked hezbollah to release the captured israeli soldiers and stop the shelling of israeli cities in order for israel to put an end to its operations .
since it was clear from the outset that a terrorist organization like hezbollah would ignore such a request , the german position amounted to giving the israelis carte blanche for their military offensive . agony on both sides bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli soldier alon fintuha was killed on thursday in southern lebanon there is a broad consensus among the german public that the shelling of israeli cities is not acceptable .
germans are generally put off by hezbollah fighters and their iranian backers who want to wipe israel off the map . the occasional claim that germans are only paying attention to the suffering of the lebanese civilians while ignoring that of the israelis is completely unwarranted .
for years , every single terror attack in israel has received widespread coverage in the german media - often wider than thousands of victims in african wars .
nowadays , too , there are reports about the suffering on both sides . germans , on the other hand , expect higher moral standards from israel than from a terrorist organization .
that is not an unfair expectation , rather it is a sign of high esteem .
when israel fought for its survival during the six day war in 1967 , germans responded with an outpouring of sympathy for the jewish state .
but when israel responds to terrorist attacks against civilians by causing ten times the casualties , germans do not find that acceptable . a missed opportunity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli attacks have lead some moderate lebanese citizens to sympathyze with hezbollah politically aware germans know very well that lebanon was on the verge of liberating itself from the syrian grasp .
after all , it was germany 's chief prosecutor , detlev mehlis , who made a significant contribution to the process with his investigation into the murder of the former lebanese prime minister rafik hariri in feb .
2005 . this is why many germans are now bitter about the fact that the current war could destroy the democratization of lebanon as well as the prospects for peace along israel 's northern border .
and even those who do not analyze these things with great subtlety feel that israel 's reaction to the terrorist provocations may be ruining chances for peace . the growing rejection of israeli policies by the german public has manifested itself in the rising opposition to the german participation in a possible peacekeeping mission in the middle east .
almost two thirds of polled germans are against it .
under these circumstances , the german government could hardly send any soldiers , should an international mission be organized . nobody should be surprised if the german government gradually became impatient with israel .
even in foreign policy , the country 's mood can not be totally ignored . peter stützle -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " germany should take part in lebanon peace-keeping mission " former israeli ambassador to germany avi primor backed the idea of german troops participating in a possible international peacekeeping mission in lebanon as long as they were not stationed on the border with israel .

dw-world 's peter stützle says that the country 's mood may soon see itself reflected in the government 's policies as well . in her first reaction to the israeli attack on lebanon , german chancellor angela merkel struck the right chord with the german people when she said that israel had to make sure not to destabilize lebanon .
one week later , the people and the chancellor were no longer on the same page about this issue . according to a representative poll , three quarters of the german population believed the israeli military offensive was inappropriate ; only 12 percent approved of it , while the rest was unsure either way .
the chancellor did urge the israelis to use proportional force , but , at the same time , she asked hezbollah to release the captured israeli soldiers and stop the shelling of israeli cities in order for israel to put an end to its operations .
since it was clear from the outset that a terrorist organization like hezbollah would ignore such a request , the german position amounted to giving the israelis carte blanche for their military offensive . agony on both sides bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli soldier alon fintuha was killed on thursday in southern lebanon there is a broad consensus among the german public that the shelling of israeli cities is not acceptable .
germans are generally put off by hezbollah fighters and their iranian backers who want to wipe israel off the map . the occasional claim that germans are only paying attention to the suffering of the lebanese civilians while ignoring that of the israelis is completely unwarranted .
for years , every single terror attack in israel has received widespread coverage in the german media - often wider than thousands of victims in african wars .
nowadays , too , there are reports about the suffering on both sides . germans , on the other hand , expect higher moral standards from israel than from a terrorist organization .
that is not an unfair expectation , rather it is a sign of high esteem .
when israel fought for its survival during the six day war in 1967 , germans responded with an outpouring of sympathy for the jewish state .
but when israel responds to terrorist attacks against civilians by causing ten times the casualties , germans do not find that acceptable . a missed opportunity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli attacks have lead some moderate lebanese citizens to sympathyze with hezbollah politically aware germans know very well that lebanon was on the verge of liberating itself from the syrian grasp .
after all , it was germany 's chief prosecutor , detlev mehlis , who made a significant contribution to the process with his investigation into the murder of the former lebanese prime minister rafik hariri in feb .
2005 . this is why many germans are now bitter about the fact that the current war could destroy the democratization of lebanon as well as the prospects for peace along israel 's northern border .
and even those who do not analyze these things with great subtlety feel that israel 's reaction to the terrorist provocations may be ruining chances for peace . the growing rejection of israeli policies by the german public has manifested itself in the rising opposition to the german participation in a possible peacekeeping mission in the middle east .
almost two thirds of polled germans are against it .
under these circumstances , the german government could hardly send any soldiers , should an international mission be organized . nobody should be surprised if the german government gradually became impatient with israel .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : violence in the middle east steinmeier cancels talks with syrian president propaganda wars fight for headlines in the middle east " germany should take part in lebanon peace-keeping mission " eu takes charge in cleaning oil spill on lebanese coast europe -pipe- 05.08.2006 an elusive goal : a common middle east policy for europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has called for an " immediate cessation of hostilities " in lebabon the european union says it wants to have a common foreign policy , but is deeply split over the middle east crisis .
we took a look at a few eu countries and their neighbors and what divides them on the issue . despite repeated efforts , europe has not been able to find a common approach to the middle east crisis .
the possibility of sending an international peacekeeping force to the region remains open , but the opinions of the various european countries and their key partners remain across the board . some countries - including france , sweden , norway , slovakia , canada , germany , turkey , italy , spain , belgium , and ireland - have already expressed a willingness to participate in an international peace effort by sending troops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : historical ties are influencing europe 's stance a ceasefire and an international mandate , however , are seen as a prerequisite for involvement , whether it takes places under the banner of nato , the un or the european union . there is hope among europeans that the middle east would also join in and contribute to a peacekeeping effort , particularly egypt . dw-world.de looked at a few of the key players in the greater european area , what is at stake for them , and why they ca n't find a common line . germany israel 's president ehud olmert said in an interview with the süddeutsche zeitung daily that he has " absolutely no problem with german soldiers in southern lebanon … .at the moment , no other nation is as friendly to israel as germany .
if germany can contribute to the security of the israeli people , this would be a rewarding task … " olmert 's expectation of german involvement rests on the tight but history-laden relationship the two countries have developed since world war ii . not only were the nazis responsible for the death of six million jews during the holocaust , the state of israel was established in 1948 as a direct response to the nazi persecution .
the international community felt obligated to secure a jewish state for the survivors . germany 's history has made it very reluctant to send soldiers into combat since world war ii . germany 's defense minister franz josef jung -lrb- cdu -rrb- has said he considers german participation in an international peacekeeping force a possibility , while chancellor angela merkel and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier -lrb- spd -rrb- are more cautious .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo is still a painful memory for the eu " we do n't necessarily dismiss involvement , but we are hesitant , " said merkel , as reported by germany news agency dpa . within germany 's political parties , opinions are split .
some see germany 's history as an obligation to participate , other see precisely that as a reason to stay out of it , wrote dw-world.de 's peter philip . history is not the only factor in germany 's hesitancy .
its army , the bundeswehr , has current obligations in other crisis areas , such as dr congo and afghanistan , and it could become increasingly difficult to convince the german population of the need to take part in the israel-lebanon crisis as well . england a traditional american ally and supporter of the iraq war , britain , along with germany , was one of the countries to call for a " cessation of hostilities " instead of an immediate ceasefire in the eu foreign ministers ' joint statement . lebanese president fuad siniora has , however , called on tony blair to advocate an immediate ceasefire , reported afp . the british government supports a gradual ceasefire , along with the united states , so that hezbollah can be weakened before the hostilities stop since the lebanese army is not as strong as the extremist group . with troops currently in iraq and afghanistan , britain 's resources are already stretched thin and it has not expressed a willingness to engage troops in lebanon or israel . turkey turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan was one of the very first heads of state to announce a willingness to send troops , wrote the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- daily .
he 's a practicing muslim himself and his government acted as a mediator between israel and hamas this spring . the country , which has been negotiating for years with the european union on future accession , has been mentioned as a possible leader in an international mission due to its proximity to the region .
however , recent statements have indicated france is more likely to lead a mission . erdogan has yet to convince the population of turkey that military involvement in the crisis would be beneficial , wrote the faz . russia russia renewed demands for an immediate end to hostilities in the middle east , reported the financial times deutschland daily .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : douste-blazy and steinmeier in rome an immediate ceasefire " is the only way to establish a foundation for a political solution , " said the director of the security council igor ivanov on friday after a meeting with saad hariri , the majority leader in the lebanese parliament , reported dpa . russia has been critical of the us , saying it is undermining the position of the un in the middle east conflict by supporting israel . " the discontentment among the countries in the -lrb- un -rrb- security council has grown recently since the us is ready to block any decision that could put pressure on israel , " russian un ambassador vitali tzurkin told the russia newspaper isvestia . russia is not a member of the european union , but is a member of the group of eight and the united nations . france french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy has announced france would participate in an international peacekeeping effort , reported the faz .
the french government , however , has remained somewhat more hesitant , stipulating a ceasefire and an international mandate before sending troops . a commentary in le figaro daily added that israel , lebanon and the world are expecting france to head up the international force , but the country is waiting for a ceasefire . the financial times deutschland reported that france would be able to send as many as 5,000 well-equipped soldiers quickly as part of an international mission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : potential members of a peacekeeping mission are waiting for a ceasefire as in the iraq war , france has taken a position staunchly opposed to the united states .
twice this week , france refused to attend un peace talks on the middle east , hoping to put pressure on the us . france is a traditional ally of lebanon , which was a mandated territory after the end of world war i , along with syria .
lebanon gained independence in 1943 when france was occupied by the nazis . italy italy 's government was voted out of office for supporting the united states in the iraq war .
it sent troops to support the international efforts in kosovo , afghanistan and iraq , though president romano prodi pulled italian soldiers out of iraq after he took office in may . foreign minister massimo d 'alema has emphasized his country 's readiness to send troops to the middle east . " italy 's unified decision -lrb- to send troops -rrb- came as a surprise because the 9-party governing coalition already had trouble agreeing on involvement in afghanistan , " wrote the faz . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de violence in the middle east click on the links to read dw-world.de 's compilation of articles on the conflict and the search for peace .

the founder of the former top oil producer yukos is serving his prison sentence in siberia in very harsh conditions meant to isolate him completely from the outer world . former liberal democrat justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger who 's now a legal rights spokesperson has been following the khodorkovsky case very closely and shares the widely held opinion that the recent liquidation of the yukos firm and the way khodorkovsky is being treated are the kremlin 's retaliation for the latter 's long-standing opposition to president putin punishment for putin opposition ? " he was placed in solitary confinement several times , " leutheusser-schnarrenberger said .
" and he 's being treated in a very arbitrary way .
if he drinks his tea in the wrong place , he faces severe punishment , for instance .
and then there was the incident in which he was attacked with a knife by another inmate and injured in his face .
which goes to show that khodorkovsky is n't safe in this camp , and this is what we 're criticizing and what needs to be changed . " along with fdp chief guido westerwelle , leutheuser-schnarrenberger wants the government in berlin to raise the issue more clearly with the kremlin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger " the chancellor deserves some credit for at least calling khodorkovsky 's prison conditions unacceptable , " leutheusser-schnarrenberger said .
" but i do believe that the government has to do more than just casually mentioning the issue in talks with the russian president . " calls for increased eu pressure " there are eu-wide initiatives by politicians with much stronger criticism of the kremlin 's policy , and chancellor merkel should also step up her efforts to influence putin .
because we all know that nothing happens in khodorkovsky 's camp without his knowledge and consent . " the khodorkovsky case was also reported to have been touched upon during the recent visit to germany by us president george w. bush .
he put the case in the wider context of russia 's poor human rights record and promised that he would not tire of telling putin what he did n't approve of , but he did n't think much of pillorying the russian president in public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush never tires of chiding putin in private " nobody likes to be lectured a lot .
if you want to be effective , what you do n't go is scold the person publicly all the time .
you remind him where we may have a difference of opinion , and you do so in a respectful way .
so you can then sit down and have a constructive dialogue , " bush said . germany 's ruling and opposition parties are in agreement that it 's vital to show the kremlin that khodorkovsky 's fate is being followed closely in the west and that any irregularities will draw even more criticism from leaders here . hardy graupner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans criticize khordorkovsky verdict german politicians on tuesday condemned the jailing of yukos oil founder mikhail khordorkovsky , who was convicted of fraud and tax evasion by a russian court .

" i do n't see such a thing happening , " christian schmidt , secretary of state at the defence ministry , said in comments published in saturday 's edition of the stuttgarter zeitung newspaper . " our political possibilities are outside the military field , " he said . " i am impressed by the level of trust that the -lrb- israeli -rrb- prime minister has shown us .

" i would like german soldiers to participate , " olmert said .
" i told chancellor angela merkel that we have absolutely no problem with the presence of german troops in south lebanon , " he was quoted as saying . weight of history germany is split over the use of its army to keep apart israel and the lebanese hezbollah guerrillas , whose conflict has killed hundreds , mainly civilians , in the last three weeks . some politicians claim it would be impossible for german troops to fire on israeli forces if necessary , given germany 's persecution of europe 's jews during its nazi past . last weekend , merkel said it was unlikely that germany would send troops to the middle east as its army already participated in many operations around the world . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " germany should take part in lebanon peace-keeping mission " former israeli ambassador to germany avi primor backed the idea of german troops participating in a possible international peacekeeping mission in lebanon as long as they were not stationed on the border with israel .

we took a look at a few eu countries and their neighbors and what divides them on the issue . despite repeated efforts , europe has not been able to find a common approach to the middle east crisis .
the possibility of sending an international peacekeeping force to the region remains open , but the opinions of the various european countries and their key partners remain across the board . some countries - including france , sweden , norway , slovakia , canada , germany , turkey , italy , spain , belgium , and ireland - have already expressed a willingness to participate in an international peace effort by sending troops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : historical ties are influencing europe 's stance a ceasefire and an international mandate , however , are seen as a prerequisite for involvement , whether it takes places under the banner of nato , the un or the european union . there is hope among europeans that the middle east would also join in and contribute to a peacekeeping effort , particularly egypt . dw-world.de looked at a few of the key players in the greater european area , what is at stake for them , and why they ca n't find a common line . germany israel 's president ehud olmert said in an interview with the süddeutsche zeitung daily that he has " absolutely no problem with german soldiers in southern lebanon … .at the moment , no other nation is as friendly to israel as germany .
if germany can contribute to the security of the israeli people , this would be a rewarding task … " olmert 's expectation of german involvement rests on the tight but history-laden relationship the two countries have developed since world war ii . not only were the nazis responsible for the death of six million jews during the holocaust , the state of israel was established in 1948 as a direct response to the nazi persecution .
the international community felt obligated to secure a jewish state for the survivors . germany 's history has made it very reluctant to send soldiers into combat since world war ii . germany 's defense minister franz josef jung -lrb- cdu -rrb- has said he considers german participation in an international peacekeeping force a possibility , while chancellor angela merkel and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier -lrb- spd -rrb- are more cautious .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo is still a painful memory for the eu " we do n't necessarily dismiss involvement , but we are hesitant , " said merkel , as reported by germany news agency dpa . within germany 's political parties , opinions are split .
some see germany 's history as an obligation to participate , other see precisely that as a reason to stay out of it , wrote dw-world.de 's peter philip . history is not the only factor in germany 's hesitancy .
its army , the bundeswehr , has current obligations in other crisis areas , such as dr congo and afghanistan , and it could become increasingly difficult to convince the german population of the need to take part in the israel-lebanon crisis as well . england a traditional american ally and supporter of the iraq war , britain , along with germany , was one of the countries to call for a " cessation of hostilities " instead of an immediate ceasefire in the eu foreign ministers ' joint statement . lebanese president fuad siniora has , however , called on tony blair to advocate an immediate ceasefire , reported afp . the british government supports a gradual ceasefire , along with the united states , so that hezbollah can be weakened before the hostilities stop since the lebanese army is not as strong as the extremist group . with troops currently in iraq and afghanistan , britain 's resources are already stretched thin and it has not expressed a willingness to engage troops in lebanon or israel . turkey turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan was one of the very first heads of state to announce a willingness to send troops , wrote the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- daily .
he 's a practicing muslim himself and his government acted as a mediator between israel and hamas this spring . the country , which has been negotiating for years with the european union on future accession , has been mentioned as a possible leader in an international mission due to its proximity to the region .
however , recent statements have indicated france is more likely to lead a mission . erdogan has yet to convince the population of turkey that military involvement in the crisis would be beneficial , wrote the faz . russia russia renewed demands for an immediate end to hostilities in the middle east , reported the financial times deutschland daily .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : douste-blazy and steinmeier in rome an immediate ceasefire " is the only way to establish a foundation for a political solution , " said the director of the security council igor ivanov on friday after a meeting with saad hariri , the majority leader in the lebanese parliament , reported dpa . russia has been critical of the us , saying it is undermining the position of the un in the middle east conflict by supporting israel . " the discontentment among the countries in the -lrb- un -rrb- security council has grown recently since the us is ready to block any decision that could put pressure on israel , " russian un ambassador vitali tzurkin told the russia newspaper isvestia . russia is not a member of the european union , but is a member of the group of eight and the united nations . france french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy has announced france would participate in an international peacekeeping effort , reported the faz .
the french government , however , has remained somewhat more hesitant , stipulating a ceasefire and an international mandate before sending troops . a commentary in le figaro daily added that israel , lebanon and the world are expecting france to head up the international force , but the country is waiting for a ceasefire . the financial times deutschland reported that france would be able to send as many as 5,000 well-equipped soldiers quickly as part of an international mission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : potential members of a peacekeeping mission are waiting for a ceasefire as in the iraq war , france has taken a position staunchly opposed to the united states .
twice this week , france refused to attend un peace talks on the middle east , hoping to put pressure on the us . france is a traditional ally of lebanon , which was a mandated territory after the end of world war i , along with syria .
lebanon gained independence in 1943 when france was occupied by the nazis . italy italy 's government was voted out of office for supporting the united states in the iraq war .
it sent troops to support the international efforts in kosovo , afghanistan and iraq , though president romano prodi pulled italian soldiers out of iraq after he took office in may . foreign minister massimo d 'alema has emphasized his country 's readiness to send troops to the middle east .

dw-world 's peter stützle says that the country 's mood may soon see itself reflected in the government 's policies as well . in her first reaction to the israeli attack on lebanon , german chancellor angela merkel struck the right chord with the german people when she said that israel had to make sure not to destabilize lebanon .
one week later , the people and the chancellor were no longer on the same page about this issue . according to a representative poll , three quarters of the german population believed the israeli military offensive was inappropriate ; only 12 percent approved of it , while the rest was unsure either way .
the chancellor did urge the israelis to use proportional force , but , at the same time , she asked hezbollah to release the captured israeli soldiers and stop the shelling of israeli cities in order for israel to put an end to its operations .
since it was clear from the outset that a terrorist organization like hezbollah would ignore such a request , the german position amounted to giving the israelis carte blanche for their military offensive . agony on both sides bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli soldier alon fintuha was killed on thursday in southern lebanon there is a broad consensus among the german public that the shelling of israeli cities is not acceptable .
germans are generally put off by hezbollah fighters and their iranian backers who want to wipe israel off the map . the occasional claim that germans are only paying attention to the suffering of the lebanese civilians while ignoring that of the israelis is completely unwarranted .
for years , every single terror attack in israel has received widespread coverage in the german media - often wider than thousands of victims in african wars .
nowadays , too , there are reports about the suffering on both sides . germans , on the other hand , expect higher moral standards from israel than from a terrorist organization .
that is not an unfair expectation , rather it is a sign of high esteem .
when israel fought for its survival during the six day war in 1967 , germans responded with an outpouring of sympathy for the jewish state .
but when israel responds to terrorist attacks against civilians by causing ten times the casualties , germans do not find that acceptable . a missed opportunity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli attacks have lead some moderate lebanese citizens to sympathyze with hezbollah politically aware germans know very well that lebanon was on the verge of liberating itself from the syrian grasp .
after all , it was germany 's chief prosecutor , detlev mehlis , who made a significant contribution to the process with his investigation into the murder of the former lebanese prime minister rafik hariri in feb .
2005 . this is why many germans are now bitter about the fact that the current war could destroy the democratization of lebanon as well as the prospects for peace along israel 's northern border .
and even those who do not analyze these things with great subtlety feel that israel 's reaction to the terrorist provocations may be ruining chances for peace . the growing rejection of israeli policies by the german public has manifested itself in the rising opposition to the german participation in a possible peacekeeping mission in the middle east .
almost two thirds of polled germans are against it .
under these circumstances , the german government could hardly send any soldiers , should an international mission be organized . nobody should be surprised if the german government gradually became impatient with israel .
even in foreign policy , the country 's mood can not be totally ignored . peter stützle -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " germany should take part in lebanon peace-keeping mission " former israeli ambassador to germany avi primor backed the idea of german troops participating in a possible international peacekeeping mission in lebanon as long as they were not stationed on the border with israel .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.08.2006 merkel criticizes russia for treatment of former yukos boss großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mikhail khodorkovsky faces harsh and violent conditions in his siberian prison camp german chancellor angela merkel has criticized the current prison conditions of the founder of the former russian oil firm yukos , mikhail khodorkovsky . replying to a letter from opposition liberal democrat chief guido westerwelle , merkel said the government in berlin would continue to use its good working relationship with the russian president to push for a speedy improvement of conditions for khodorkovsky who 's serving an 8-year sentence in a prison camp in siberia after being convicted of tax evasion and embezzlement . in a letter to fdp chief westerwelle , german chancellor angela merkel wrote that she had repeatedly pointed out to russian president vladimir putin that prison conditions for khodorkovsky - once the richest man in russia - were simply unacceptable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is not afraid to put her point across she urged the russian government to adhere to international standards .
the founder of the former top oil producer yukos is serving his prison sentence in siberia in very harsh conditions meant to isolate him completely from the outer world . former liberal democrat justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger who 's now a legal rights spokesperson has been following the khodorkovsky case very closely and shares the widely held opinion that the recent liquidation of the yukos firm and the way khodorkovsky is being treated are the kremlin 's retaliation for the latter 's long-standing opposition to president putin punishment for putin opposition ? " he was placed in solitary confinement several times , " leutheusser-schnarrenberger said .
" and he 's being treated in a very arbitrary way .
if he drinks his tea in the wrong place , he faces severe punishment , for instance .
and then there was the incident in which he was attacked with a knife by another inmate and injured in his face .
which goes to show that khodorkovsky is n't safe in this camp , and this is what we 're criticizing and what needs to be changed . " along with fdp chief guido westerwelle , leutheuser-schnarrenberger wants the government in berlin to raise the issue more clearly with the kremlin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger " the chancellor deserves some credit for at least calling khodorkovsky 's prison conditions unacceptable , " leutheusser-schnarrenberger said .
" but i do believe that the government has to do more than just casually mentioning the issue in talks with the russian president . " calls for increased eu pressure " there are eu-wide initiatives by politicians with much stronger criticism of the kremlin 's policy , and chancellor merkel should also step up her efforts to influence putin .
because we all know that nothing happens in khodorkovsky 's camp without his knowledge and consent . " the khodorkovsky case was also reported to have been touched upon during the recent visit to germany by us president george w. bush .
he put the case in the wider context of russia 's poor human rights record and promised that he would not tire of telling putin what he did n't approve of , but he did n't think much of pillorying the russian president in public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush never tires of chiding putin in private " nobody likes to be lectured a lot .
if you want to be effective , what you do n't go is scold the person publicly all the time .
you remind him where we may have a difference of opinion , and you do so in a respectful way .
so you can then sit down and have a constructive dialogue , " bush said . germany 's ruling and opposition parties are in agreement that it 's vital to show the kremlin that khodorkovsky 's fate is being followed closely in the west and that any irregularities will draw even more criticism from leaders here . hardy graupner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans criticize khordorkovsky verdict german politicians on tuesday condemned the jailing of yukos oil founder mikhail khordorkovsky , who was convicted of fraud and tax evasion by a russian court .

dw-world 's peter stützle says that the country 's mood may soon see itself reflected in the government 's policies as well . in her first reaction to the israeli attack on lebanon , german chancellor angela merkel struck the right chord with the german people when she said that israel had to make sure not to destabilize lebanon .
one week later , the people and the chancellor were no longer on the same page about this issue . according to a representative poll , three quarters of the german population believed the israeli military offensive was inappropriate ; only 12 percent approved of it , while the rest was unsure either way .
the chancellor did urge the israelis to use proportional force , but , at the same time , she asked hezbollah to release the captured israeli soldiers and stop the shelling of israeli cities in order for israel to put an end to its operations .
since it was clear from the outset that a terrorist organization like hezbollah would ignore such a request , the german position amounted to giving the israelis carte blanche for their military offensive . agony on both sides bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli soldier alon fintuha was killed on thursday in southern lebanon there is a broad consensus among the german public that the shelling of israeli cities is not acceptable .
germans are generally put off by hezbollah fighters and their iranian backers who want to wipe israel off the map . the occasional claim that germans are only paying attention to the suffering of the lebanese civilians while ignoring that of the israelis is completely unwarranted .
for years , every single terror attack in israel has received widespread coverage in the german media - often wider than thousands of victims in african wars .
nowadays , too , there are reports about the suffering on both sides . germans , on the other hand , expect higher moral standards from israel than from a terrorist organization .
that is not an unfair expectation , rather it is a sign of high esteem .
when israel fought for its survival during the six day war in 1967 , germans responded with an outpouring of sympathy for the jewish state .
but when israel responds to terrorist attacks against civilians by causing ten times the casualties , germans do not find that acceptable . a missed opportunity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli attacks have lead some moderate lebanese citizens to sympathyze with hezbollah politically aware germans know very well that lebanon was on the verge of liberating itself from the syrian grasp .
after all , it was germany 's chief prosecutor , detlev mehlis , who made a significant contribution to the process with his investigation into the murder of the former lebanese prime minister rafik hariri in feb .
2005 . this is why many germans are now bitter about the fact that the current war could destroy the democratization of lebanon as well as the prospects for peace along israel 's northern border .
and even those who do not analyze these things with great subtlety feel that israel 's reaction to the terrorist provocations may be ruining chances for peace . the growing rejection of israeli policies by the german public has manifested itself in the rising opposition to the german participation in a possible peacekeeping mission in the middle east .
almost two thirds of polled germans are against it .
under these circumstances , the german government could hardly send any soldiers , should an international mission be organized . nobody should be surprised if the german government gradually became impatient with israel .
even in foreign policy , the country 's mood can not be totally ignored . peter stützle -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " germany should take part in lebanon peace-keeping mission " former israeli ambassador to germany avi primor backed the idea of german troops participating in a possible international peacekeeping mission in lebanon as long as they were not stationed on the border with israel .

4 , 2006 -rrb- israel pushes deep into lebanon as eu envoy arrives for talks in its deepest incursion since hostilities erupted 22 days ago , the israeli defense force hit hezbollah positions and captured prisoners in lebanon as spain 's foreign minister held crisis talks with officials in beirut .

we took a look at a few eu countries and their neighbors and what divides them on the issue . despite repeated efforts , europe has not been able to find a common approach to the middle east crisis .
the possibility of sending an international peacekeeping force to the region remains open , but the opinions of the various european countries and their key partners remain across the board . some countries - including france , sweden , norway , slovakia , canada , germany , turkey , italy , spain , belgium , and ireland - have already expressed a willingness to participate in an international peace effort by sending troops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : historical ties are influencing europe 's stance a ceasefire and an international mandate , however , are seen as a prerequisite for involvement , whether it takes places under the banner of nato , the un or the european union . there is hope among europeans that the middle east would also join in and contribute to a peacekeeping effort , particularly egypt . dw-world.de looked at a few of the key players in the greater european area , what is at stake for them , and why they ca n't find a common line . germany israel 's president ehud olmert said in an interview with the süddeutsche zeitung daily that he has " absolutely no problem with german soldiers in southern lebanon … .at the moment , no other nation is as friendly to israel as germany .
if germany can contribute to the security of the israeli people , this would be a rewarding task … " olmert 's expectation of german involvement rests on the tight but history-laden relationship the two countries have developed since world war ii . not only were the nazis responsible for the death of six million jews during the holocaust , the state of israel was established in 1948 as a direct response to the nazi persecution .
the international community felt obligated to secure a jewish state for the survivors . germany 's history has made it very reluctant to send soldiers into combat since world war ii . germany 's defense minister franz josef jung -lrb- cdu -rrb- has said he considers german participation in an international peacekeeping force a possibility , while chancellor angela merkel and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier -lrb- spd -rrb- are more cautious .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo is still a painful memory for the eu " we do n't necessarily dismiss involvement , but we are hesitant , " said merkel , as reported by germany news agency dpa . within germany 's political parties , opinions are split .
some see germany 's history as an obligation to participate , other see precisely that as a reason to stay out of it , wrote dw-world.de 's peter philip . history is not the only factor in germany 's hesitancy .
its army , the bundeswehr , has current obligations in other crisis areas , such as dr congo and afghanistan , and it could become increasingly difficult to convince the german population of the need to take part in the israel-lebanon crisis as well . england a traditional american ally and supporter of the iraq war , britain , along with germany , was one of the countries to call for a " cessation of hostilities " instead of an immediate ceasefire in the eu foreign ministers ' joint statement . lebanese president fuad siniora has , however , called on tony blair to advocate an immediate ceasefire , reported afp . the british government supports a gradual ceasefire , along with the united states , so that hezbollah can be weakened before the hostilities stop since the lebanese army is not as strong as the extremist group . with troops currently in iraq and afghanistan , britain 's resources are already stretched thin and it has not expressed a willingness to engage troops in lebanon or israel . turkey turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan was one of the very first heads of state to announce a willingness to send troops , wrote the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- daily .
he 's a practicing muslim himself and his government acted as a mediator between israel and hamas this spring . the country , which has been negotiating for years with the european union on future accession , has been mentioned as a possible leader in an international mission due to its proximity to the region .
however , recent statements have indicated france is more likely to lead a mission . erdogan has yet to convince the population of turkey that military involvement in the crisis would be beneficial , wrote the faz . russia russia renewed demands for an immediate end to hostilities in the middle east , reported the financial times deutschland daily .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : douste-blazy and steinmeier in rome an immediate ceasefire " is the only way to establish a foundation for a political solution , " said the director of the security council igor ivanov on friday after a meeting with saad hariri , the majority leader in the lebanese parliament , reported dpa . russia has been critical of the us , saying it is undermining the position of the un in the middle east conflict by supporting israel . " the discontentment among the countries in the -lrb- un -rrb- security council has grown recently since the us is ready to block any decision that could put pressure on israel , " russian un ambassador vitali tzurkin told the russia newspaper isvestia . russia is not a member of the european union , but is a member of the group of eight and the united nations . france french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy has announced france would participate in an international peacekeeping effort , reported the faz .
the french government , however , has remained somewhat more hesitant , stipulating a ceasefire and an international mandate before sending troops . a commentary in le figaro daily added that israel , lebanon and the world are expecting france to head up the international force , but the country is waiting for a ceasefire . the financial times deutschland reported that france would be able to send as many as 5,000 well-equipped soldiers quickly as part of an international mission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : potential members of a peacekeeping mission are waiting for a ceasefire as in the iraq war , france has taken a position staunchly opposed to the united states .
twice this week , france refused to attend un peace talks on the middle east , hoping to put pressure on the us . france is a traditional ally of lebanon , which was a mandated territory after the end of world war i , along with syria .
lebanon gained independence in 1943 when france was occupied by the nazis . italy italy 's government was voted out of office for supporting the united states in the iraq war .
it sent troops to support the international efforts in kosovo , afghanistan and iraq , though president romano prodi pulled italian soldiers out of iraq after he took office in may . foreign minister massimo d 'alema has emphasized his country 's readiness to send troops to the middle east . " italy 's unified decision -lrb- to send troops -rrb- came as a surprise because the 9-party governing coalition already had trouble agreeing on involvement in afghanistan , " wrote the faz . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de violence in the middle east click on the links to read dw-world.de 's compilation of articles on the conflict and the search for peace .

the founder of the former top oil producer yukos is serving his prison sentence in siberia in very harsh conditions meant to isolate him completely from the outer world . former liberal democrat justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger who 's now a legal rights spokesperson has been following the khodorkovsky case very closely and shares the widely held opinion that the recent liquidation of the yukos firm and the way khodorkovsky is being treated are the kremlin 's retaliation for the latter 's long-standing opposition to president putin punishment for putin opposition ?

" and he 's being treated in a very arbitrary way .
if he drinks his tea in the wrong place , he faces severe punishment , for instance .

" calls for increased eu pressure " there are eu-wide initiatives by politicians with much stronger criticism of the kremlin 's policy , and chancellor merkel should also step up her efforts to influence putin .
because we all know that nothing happens in khodorkovsky 's camp without his knowledge and consent . " the khodorkovsky case was also reported to have been touched upon during the recent visit to germany by us president george w. bush .
he put the case in the wider context of russia 's poor human rights record and promised that he would not tire of telling putin what he did n't approve of , but he did n't think much of pillorying the russian president in public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush never tires of chiding putin in private " nobody likes to be lectured a lot .

we took a look at a few eu countries and their neighbors and what divides them on the issue . despite repeated efforts , europe has not been able to find a common approach to the middle east crisis .
the possibility of sending an international peacekeeping force to the region remains open , but the opinions of the various european countries and their key partners remain across the board . some countries - including france , sweden , norway , slovakia , canada , germany , turkey , italy , spain , belgium , and ireland - have already expressed a willingness to participate in an international peace effort by sending troops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : historical ties are influencing europe 's stance a ceasefire and an international mandate , however , are seen as a prerequisite for involvement , whether it takes places under the banner of nato , the un or the european union . there is hope among europeans that the middle east would also join in and contribute to a peacekeeping effort , particularly egypt . dw-world.de looked at a few of the key players in the greater european area , what is at stake for them , and why they ca n't find a common line . germany israel 's president ehud olmert said in an interview with the süddeutsche zeitung daily that he has " absolutely no problem with german soldiers in southern lebanon … .at the moment , no other nation is as friendly to israel as germany .
if germany can contribute to the security of the israeli people , this would be a rewarding task … " olmert 's expectation of german involvement rests on the tight but history-laden relationship the two countries have developed since world war ii . not only were the nazis responsible for the death of six million jews during the holocaust , the state of israel was established in 1948 as a direct response to the nazi persecution .
the international community felt obligated to secure a jewish state for the survivors . germany 's history has made it very reluctant to send soldiers into combat since world war ii . germany 's defense minister franz josef jung -lrb- cdu -rrb- has said he considers german participation in an international peacekeeping force a possibility , while chancellor angela merkel and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier -lrb- spd -rrb- are more cautious .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo is still a painful memory for the eu " we do n't necessarily dismiss involvement , but we are hesitant , " said merkel , as reported by germany news agency dpa . within germany 's political parties , opinions are split .
some see germany 's history as an obligation to participate , other see precisely that as a reason to stay out of it , wrote dw-world.de 's peter philip . history is not the only factor in germany 's hesitancy .
its army , the bundeswehr , has current obligations in other crisis areas , such as dr congo and afghanistan , and it could become increasingly difficult to convince the german population of the need to take part in the israel-lebanon crisis as well . england a traditional american ally and supporter of the iraq war , britain , along with germany , was one of the countries to call for a " cessation of hostilities " instead of an immediate ceasefire in the eu foreign ministers ' joint statement . lebanese president fuad siniora has , however , called on tony blair to advocate an immediate ceasefire , reported afp . the british government supports a gradual ceasefire , along with the united states , so that hezbollah can be weakened before the hostilities stop since the lebanese army is not as strong as the extremist group . with troops currently in iraq and afghanistan , britain 's resources are already stretched thin and it has not expressed a willingness to engage troops in lebanon or israel . turkey turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan was one of the very first heads of state to announce a willingness to send troops , wrote the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- daily .
he 's a practicing muslim himself and his government acted as a mediator between israel and hamas this spring . the country , which has been negotiating for years with the european union on future accession , has been mentioned as a possible leader in an international mission due to its proximity to the region .
however , recent statements have indicated france is more likely to lead a mission . erdogan has yet to convince the population of turkey that military involvement in the crisis would be beneficial , wrote the faz . russia russia renewed demands for an immediate end to hostilities in the middle east , reported the financial times deutschland daily .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : douste-blazy and steinmeier in rome an immediate ceasefire " is the only way to establish a foundation for a political solution , " said the director of the security council igor ivanov on friday after a meeting with saad hariri , the majority leader in the lebanese parliament , reported dpa . russia has been critical of the us , saying it is undermining the position of the un in the middle east conflict by supporting israel . " the discontentment among the countries in the -lrb- un -rrb- security council has grown recently since the us is ready to block any decision that could put pressure on israel , " russian un ambassador vitali tzurkin told the russia newspaper isvestia . russia is not a member of the european union , but is a member of the group of eight and the united nations . france french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy has announced france would participate in an international peacekeeping effort , reported the faz .
the french government , however , has remained somewhat more hesitant , stipulating a ceasefire and an international mandate before sending troops . a commentary in le figaro daily added that israel , lebanon and the world are expecting france to head up the international force , but the country is waiting for a ceasefire . the financial times deutschland reported that france would be able to send as many as 5,000 well-equipped soldiers quickly as part of an international mission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : potential members of a peacekeeping mission are waiting for a ceasefire as in the iraq war , france has taken a position staunchly opposed to the united states .
twice this week , france refused to attend un peace talks on the middle east , hoping to put pressure on the us . france is a traditional ally of lebanon , which was a mandated territory after the end of world war i , along with syria .
lebanon gained independence in 1943 when france was occupied by the nazis . italy italy 's government was voted out of office for supporting the united states in the iraq war .
it sent troops to support the international efforts in kosovo , afghanistan and iraq , though president romano prodi pulled italian soldiers out of iraq after he took office in may . foreign minister massimo d 'alema has emphasized his country 's readiness to send troops to the middle east . " italy 's unified decision -lrb- to send troops -rrb- came as a surprise because the 9-party governing coalition already had trouble agreeing on involvement in afghanistan , " wrote the faz . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de violence in the middle east click on the links to read dw-world.de 's compilation of articles on the conflict and the search for peace .

" i do n't see such a thing happening , " christian schmidt , secretary of state at the defence ministry , said in comments published in saturday 's edition of the stuttgarter zeitung newspaper . " our political possibilities are outside the military field , " he said . " i am impressed by the level of trust that the -lrb- israeli -rrb- prime minister has shown us .
but i do n't think that we will be able to build a strong mandate , both on a political level and regarding the capacity of the bundeswehr -lrb- german army -rrb- , " schmidt explained . in friday 's sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper , israeli premier ehud olmert called for germany to participate in an international military force , which is supposed to be deployed to help the lebanese army gain effective control over southern lebanon and prevent future hezbollah attacks on israel . " i would like german soldiers to participate , " olmert said .
" i told chancellor angela merkel that we have absolutely no problem with the presence of german troops in south lebanon , " he was quoted as saying . weight of history germany is split over the use of its army to keep apart israel and the lebanese hezbollah guerrillas , whose conflict has killed hundreds , mainly civilians , in the last three weeks . some politicians claim it would be impossible for german troops to fire on israeli forces if necessary , given germany 's persecution of europe 's jews during its nazi past . last weekend , merkel said it was unlikely that germany would send troops to the middle east as its army already participated in many operations around the world . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " germany should take part in lebanon peace-keeping mission " former israeli ambassador to germany avi primor backed the idea of german troops participating in a possible international peacekeeping mission in lebanon as long as they were not stationed on the border with israel .

the founder of the former top oil producer yukos is serving his prison sentence in siberia in very harsh conditions meant to isolate him completely from the outer world . former liberal democrat justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger who 's now a legal rights spokesperson has been following the khodorkovsky case very closely and shares the widely held opinion that the recent liquidation of the yukos firm and the way khodorkovsky is being treated are the kremlin 's retaliation for the latter 's long-standing opposition to president putin punishment for putin opposition ? " he was placed in solitary confinement several times , " leutheusser-schnarrenberger said .
" and he 's being treated in a very arbitrary way .
if he drinks his tea in the wrong place , he faces severe punishment , for instance .
and then there was the incident in which he was attacked with a knife by another inmate and injured in his face .
which goes to show that khodorkovsky is n't safe in this camp , and this is what we 're criticizing and what needs to be changed . " along with fdp chief guido westerwelle , leutheuser-schnarrenberger wants the government in berlin to raise the issue more clearly with the kremlin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger " the chancellor deserves some credit for at least calling khodorkovsky 's prison conditions unacceptable , " leutheusser-schnarrenberger said .
" but i do believe that the government has to do more than just casually mentioning the issue in talks with the russian president . " calls for increased eu pressure " there are eu-wide initiatives by politicians with much stronger criticism of the kremlin 's policy , and chancellor merkel should also step up her efforts to influence putin .
because we all know that nothing happens in khodorkovsky 's camp without his knowledge and consent . " the khodorkovsky case was also reported to have been touched upon during the recent visit to germany by us president george w. bush .
he put the case in the wider context of russia 's poor human rights record and promised that he would not tire of telling putin what he did n't approve of , but he did n't think much of pillorying the russian president in public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush never tires of chiding putin in private " nobody likes to be lectured a lot .
if you want to be effective , what you do n't go is scold the person publicly all the time .
you remind him where we may have a difference of opinion , and you do so in a respectful way .
so you can then sit down and have a constructive dialogue , " bush said . germany 's ruling and opposition parties are in agreement that it 's vital to show the kremlin that khodorkovsky 's fate is being followed closely in the west and that any irregularities will draw even more criticism from leaders here . hardy graupner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans criticize khordorkovsky verdict german politicians on tuesday condemned the jailing of yukos oil founder mikhail khordorkovsky , who was convicted of fraud and tax evasion by a russian court .

dw-world 's peter stützle says that the country 's mood may soon see itself reflected in the government 's policies as well . in her first reaction to the israeli attack on lebanon , german chancellor angela merkel struck the right chord with the german people when she said that israel had to make sure not to destabilize lebanon .
one week later , the people and the chancellor were no longer on the same page about this issue . according to a representative poll , three quarters of the german population believed the israeli military offensive was inappropriate ; only 12 percent approved of it , while the rest was unsure either way .
the chancellor did urge the israelis to use proportional force , but , at the same time , she asked hezbollah to release the captured israeli soldiers and stop the shelling of israeli cities in order for israel to put an end to its operations .
since it was clear from the outset that a terrorist organization like hezbollah would ignore such a request , the german position amounted to giving the israelis carte blanche for their military offensive . agony on both sides bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli soldier alon fintuha was killed on thursday in southern lebanon there is a broad consensus among the german public that the shelling of israeli cities is not acceptable .
germans are generally put off by hezbollah fighters and their iranian backers who want to wipe israel off the map . the occasional claim that germans are only paying attention to the suffering of the lebanese civilians while ignoring that of the israelis is completely unwarranted .
for years , every single terror attack in israel has received widespread coverage in the german media - often wider than thousands of victims in african wars .
nowadays , too , there are reports about the suffering on both sides . germans , on the other hand , expect higher moral standards from israel than from a terrorist organization .
that is not an unfair expectation , rather it is a sign of high esteem .
when israel fought for its survival during the six day war in 1967 , germans responded with an outpouring of sympathy for the jewish state .
but when israel responds to terrorist attacks against civilians by causing ten times the casualties , germans do not find that acceptable . a missed opportunity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli attacks have lead some moderate lebanese citizens to sympathyze with hezbollah politically aware germans know very well that lebanon was on the verge of liberating itself from the syrian grasp .
after all , it was germany 's chief prosecutor , detlev mehlis , who made a significant contribution to the process with his investigation into the murder of the former lebanese prime minister rafik hariri in feb .
2005 . this is why many germans are now bitter about the fact that the current war could destroy the democratization of lebanon as well as the prospects for peace along israel 's northern border .
and even those who do not analyze these things with great subtlety feel that israel 's reaction to the terrorist provocations may be ruining chances for peace . the growing rejection of israeli policies by the german public has manifested itself in the rising opposition to the german participation in a possible peacekeeping mission in the middle east .
almost two thirds of polled germans are against it .
under these circumstances , the german government could hardly send any soldiers , should an international mission be organized . nobody should be surprised if the german government gradually became impatient with israel .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : violence in the middle east steinmeier cancels talks with syrian president propaganda wars fight for headlines in the middle east " germany should take part in lebanon peace-keeping mission " eu takes charge in cleaning oil spill on lebanese coast europe -pipe- 05.08.2006 an elusive goal : a common middle east policy for europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has called for an " immediate cessation of hostilities " in lebabon the european union says it wants to have a common foreign policy , but is deeply split over the middle east crisis .
we took a look at a few eu countries and their neighbors and what divides them on the issue . despite repeated efforts , europe has not been able to find a common approach to the middle east crisis .
the possibility of sending an international peacekeeping force to the region remains open , but the opinions of the various european countries and their key partners remain across the board . some countries - including france , sweden , norway , slovakia , canada , germany , turkey , italy , spain , belgium , and ireland - have already expressed a willingness to participate in an international peace effort by sending troops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : historical ties are influencing europe 's stance a ceasefire and an international mandate , however , are seen as a prerequisite for involvement , whether it takes places under the banner of nato , the un or the european union . there is hope among europeans that the middle east would also join in and contribute to a peacekeeping effort , particularly egypt . dw-world.de looked at a few of the key players in the greater european area , what is at stake for them , and why they ca n't find a common line . germany israel 's president ehud olmert said in an interview with the süddeutsche zeitung daily that he has " absolutely no problem with german soldiers in southern lebanon … .at the moment , no other nation is as friendly to israel as germany .
if germany can contribute to the security of the israeli people , this would be a rewarding task … " olmert 's expectation of german involvement rests on the tight but history-laden relationship the two countries have developed since world war ii . not only were the nazis responsible for the death of six million jews during the holocaust , the state of israel was established in 1948 as a direct response to the nazi persecution .
the international community felt obligated to secure a jewish state for the survivors . germany 's history has made it very reluctant to send soldiers into combat since world war ii . germany 's defense minister franz josef jung -lrb- cdu -rrb- has said he considers german participation in an international peacekeeping force a possibility , while chancellor angela merkel and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier -lrb- spd -rrb- are more cautious .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo is still a painful memory for the eu " we do n't necessarily dismiss involvement , but we are hesitant , " said merkel , as reported by germany news agency dpa . within germany 's political parties , opinions are split .
some see germany 's history as an obligation to participate , other see precisely that as a reason to stay out of it , wrote dw-world.de 's peter philip . history is not the only factor in germany 's hesitancy .
its army , the bundeswehr , has current obligations in other crisis areas , such as dr congo and afghanistan , and it could become increasingly difficult to convince the german population of the need to take part in the israel-lebanon crisis as well . england a traditional american ally and supporter of the iraq war , britain , along with germany , was one of the countries to call for a " cessation of hostilities " instead of an immediate ceasefire in the eu foreign ministers ' joint statement . lebanese president fuad siniora has , however , called on tony blair to advocate an immediate ceasefire , reported afp . the british government supports a gradual ceasefire , along with the united states , so that hezbollah can be weakened before the hostilities stop since the lebanese army is not as strong as the extremist group . with troops currently in iraq and afghanistan , britain 's resources are already stretched thin and it has not expressed a willingness to engage troops in lebanon or israel . turkey turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan was one of the very first heads of state to announce a willingness to send troops , wrote the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- daily .
he 's a practicing muslim himself and his government acted as a mediator between israel and hamas this spring . the country , which has been negotiating for years with the european union on future accession , has been mentioned as a possible leader in an international mission due to its proximity to the region .
however , recent statements have indicated france is more likely to lead a mission . erdogan has yet to convince the population of turkey that military involvement in the crisis would be beneficial , wrote the faz . russia russia renewed demands for an immediate end to hostilities in the middle east , reported the financial times deutschland daily .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : douste-blazy and steinmeier in rome an immediate ceasefire " is the only way to establish a foundation for a political solution , " said the director of the security council igor ivanov on friday after a meeting with saad hariri , the majority leader in the lebanese parliament , reported dpa . russia has been critical of the us , saying it is undermining the position of the un in the middle east conflict by supporting israel . " the discontentment among the countries in the -lrb- un -rrb- security council has grown recently since the us is ready to block any decision that could put pressure on israel , " russian un ambassador vitali tzurkin told the russia newspaper isvestia . russia is not a member of the european union , but is a member of the group of eight and the united nations . france french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy has announced france would participate in an international peacekeeping effort , reported the faz .
the french government , however , has remained somewhat more hesitant , stipulating a ceasefire and an international mandate before sending troops . a commentary in le figaro daily added that israel , lebanon and the world are expecting france to head up the international force , but the country is waiting for a ceasefire . the financial times deutschland reported that france would be able to send as many as 5,000 well-equipped soldiers quickly as part of an international mission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : potential members of a peacekeeping mission are waiting for a ceasefire as in the iraq war , france has taken a position staunchly opposed to the united states .
twice this week , france refused to attend un peace talks on the middle east , hoping to put pressure on the us . france is a traditional ally of lebanon , which was a mandated territory after the end of world war i , along with syria .
lebanon gained independence in 1943 when france was occupied by the nazis . italy italy 's government was voted out of office for supporting the united states in the iraq war .
it sent troops to support the international efforts in kosovo , afghanistan and iraq , though president romano prodi pulled italian soldiers out of iraq after he took office in may . foreign minister massimo d 'alema has emphasized his country 's readiness to send troops to the middle east . " italy 's unified decision -lrb- to send troops -rrb- came as a surprise because the 9-party governing coalition already had trouble agreeing on involvement in afghanistan , " wrote the faz . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de violence in the middle east click on the links to read dw-world.de 's compilation of articles on the conflict and the search for peace .

-lrb- aug .
3 , 2006 -rrb- germans face dilemma as israel warms to un peace force talk of a multinational peace-keeping force for lebanon is causing germany a political headache as it debates sending troops to israel 's borders .
germany prefers a diplomatic contribution rather than a military one .

since it was clear from the outset that a terrorist organization like hezbollah would ignore such a request , the german position amounted to giving the israelis carte blanche for their military offensive . agony on both sides bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli soldier alon fintuha was killed on thursday in southern lebanon there is a broad consensus among the german public that the shelling of israeli cities is not acceptable .
germans are generally put off by hezbollah fighters and their iranian backers who want to wipe israel off the map . the occasional claim that germans are only paying attention to the suffering of the lebanese civilians while ignoring that of the israelis is completely unwarranted .
for years , every single terror attack in israel has received widespread coverage in the german media - often wider than thousands of victims in african wars .
nowadays , too , there are reports about the suffering on both sides . germans , on the other hand , expect higher moral standards from israel than from a terrorist organization .
that is not an unfair expectation , rather it is a sign of high esteem .
when israel fought for its survival during the six day war in 1967 , germans responded with an outpouring of sympathy for the jewish state .
but when israel responds to terrorist attacks against civilians by causing ten times the casualties , germans do not find that acceptable . a missed opportunity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli attacks have lead some moderate lebanese citizens to sympathyze with hezbollah politically aware germans know very well that lebanon was on the verge of liberating itself from the syrian grasp .
after all , it was germany 's chief prosecutor , detlev mehlis , who made a significant contribution to the process with his investigation into the murder of the former lebanese prime minister rafik hariri in feb .
2005 . this is why many germans are now bitter about the fact that the current war could destroy the democratization of lebanon as well as the prospects for peace along israel 's northern border .
and even those who do not analyze these things with great subtlety feel that israel 's reaction to the terrorist provocations may be ruining chances for peace . the growing rejection of israeli policies by the german public has manifested itself in the rising opposition to the german participation in a possible peacekeeping mission in the middle east .
almost two thirds of polled germans are against it .
under these circumstances , the german government could hardly send any soldiers , should an international mission be organized . nobody should be surprised if the german government gradually became impatient with israel .
even in foreign policy , the country 's mood can not be totally ignored . peter stützle -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " germany should take part in lebanon peace-keeping mission " former israeli ambassador to germany avi primor backed the idea of german troops participating in a possible international peacekeeping mission in lebanon as long as they were not stationed on the border with israel .

we took a look at a few eu countries and their neighbors and what divides them on the issue . despite repeated efforts , europe has not been able to find a common approach to the middle east crisis .
the possibility of sending an international peacekeeping force to the region remains open , but the opinions of the various european countries and their key partners remain across the board . some countries - including france , sweden , norway , slovakia , canada , germany , turkey , italy , spain , belgium , and ireland - have already expressed a willingness to participate in an international peace effort by sending troops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : historical ties are influencing europe 's stance a ceasefire and an international mandate , however , are seen as a prerequisite for involvement , whether it takes places under the banner of nato , the un or the european union . there is hope among europeans that the middle east would also join in and contribute to a peacekeeping effort , particularly egypt . dw-world.de looked at a few of the key players in the greater european area , what is at stake for them , and why they ca n't find a common line . germany israel 's president ehud olmert said in an interview with the süddeutsche zeitung daily that he has " absolutely no problem with german soldiers in southern lebanon … .at the moment , no other nation is as friendly to israel as germany .
if germany can contribute to the security of the israeli people , this would be a rewarding task … " olmert 's expectation of german involvement rests on the tight but history-laden relationship the two countries have developed since world war ii . not only were the nazis responsible for the death of six million jews during the holocaust , the state of israel was established in 1948 as a direct response to the nazi persecution .
the international community felt obligated to secure a jewish state for the survivors . germany 's history has made it very reluctant to send soldiers into combat since world war ii . germany 's defense minister franz josef jung -lrb- cdu -rrb- has said he considers german participation in an international peacekeeping force a possibility , while chancellor angela merkel and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier -lrb- spd -rrb- are more cautious .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo is still a painful memory for the eu " we do n't necessarily dismiss involvement , but we are hesitant , " said merkel , as reported by germany news agency dpa . within germany 's political parties , opinions are split .
some see germany 's history as an obligation to participate , other see precisely that as a reason to stay out of it , wrote dw-world.de 's peter philip . history is not the only factor in germany 's hesitancy .
its army , the bundeswehr , has current obligations in other crisis areas , such as dr congo and afghanistan , and it could become increasingly difficult to convince the german population of the need to take part in the israel-lebanon crisis as well . england a traditional american ally and supporter of the iraq war , britain , along with germany , was one of the countries to call for a " cessation of hostilities " instead of an immediate ceasefire in the eu foreign ministers ' joint statement . lebanese president fuad siniora has , however , called on tony blair to advocate an immediate ceasefire , reported afp . the british government supports a gradual ceasefire , along with the united states , so that hezbollah can be weakened before the hostilities stop since the lebanese army is not as strong as the extremist group . with troops currently in iraq and afghanistan , britain 's resources are already stretched thin and it has not expressed a willingness to engage troops in lebanon or israel . turkey turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan was one of the very first heads of state to announce a willingness to send troops , wrote the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- daily .
he 's a practicing muslim himself and his government acted as a mediator between israel and hamas this spring . the country , which has been negotiating for years with the european union on future accession , has been mentioned as a possible leader in an international mission due to its proximity to the region .
however , recent statements have indicated france is more likely to lead a mission . erdogan has yet to convince the population of turkey that military involvement in the crisis would be beneficial , wrote the faz . russia russia renewed demands for an immediate end to hostilities in the middle east , reported the financial times deutschland daily .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : douste-blazy and steinmeier in rome an immediate ceasefire " is the only way to establish a foundation for a political solution , " said the director of the security council igor ivanov on friday after a meeting with saad hariri , the majority leader in the lebanese parliament , reported dpa . russia has been critical of the us , saying it is undermining the position of the un in the middle east conflict by supporting israel . " the discontentment among the countries in the -lrb- un -rrb- security council has grown recently since the us is ready to block any decision that could put pressure on israel , " russian un ambassador vitali tzurkin told the russia newspaper isvestia . russia is not a member of the european union , but is a member of the group of eight and the united nations . france french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy has announced france would participate in an international peacekeeping effort , reported the faz .
the french government , however , has remained somewhat more hesitant , stipulating a ceasefire and an international mandate before sending troops . a commentary in le figaro daily added that israel , lebanon and the world are expecting france to head up the international force , but the country is waiting for a ceasefire . the financial times deutschland reported that france would be able to send as many as 5,000 well-equipped soldiers quickly as part of an international mission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : potential members of a peacekeeping mission are waiting for a ceasefire as in the iraq war , france has taken a position staunchly opposed to the united states .
twice this week , france refused to attend un peace talks on the middle east , hoping to put pressure on the us . france is a traditional ally of lebanon , which was a mandated territory after the end of world war i , along with syria .
lebanon gained independence in 1943 when france was occupied by the nazis . italy italy 's government was voted out of office for supporting the united states in the iraq war .
it sent troops to support the international efforts in kosovo , afghanistan and iraq , though president romano prodi pulled italian soldiers out of iraq after he took office in may . foreign minister massimo d 'alema has emphasized his country 's readiness to send troops to the middle east . " italy 's unified decision -lrb- to send troops -rrb- came as a surprise because the 9-party governing coalition already had trouble agreeing on involvement in afghanistan , " wrote the faz . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de violence in the middle east click on the links to read dw-world.de 's compilation of articles on the conflict and the search for peace .

" i do n't see such a thing happening , " christian schmidt , secretary of state at the defence ministry , said in comments published in saturday 's edition of the stuttgarter zeitung newspaper . " our political possibilities are outside the military field , " he said . " i am impressed by the level of trust that the -lrb- israeli -rrb- prime minister has shown us .
but i do n't think that we will be able to build a strong mandate , both on a political level and regarding the capacity of the bundeswehr -lrb- german army -rrb- , " schmidt explained . in friday 's sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper , israeli premier ehud olmert called for germany to participate in an international military force , which is supposed to be deployed to help the lebanese army gain effective control over southern lebanon and prevent future hezbollah attacks on israel . " i would like german soldiers to participate , " olmert said .
" i told chancellor angela merkel that we have absolutely no problem with the presence of german troops in south lebanon , " he was quoted as saying . weight of history germany is split over the use of its army to keep apart israel and the lebanese hezbollah guerrillas , whose conflict has killed hundreds , mainly civilians , in the last three weeks . some politicians claim it would be impossible for german troops to fire on israeli forces if necessary , given germany 's persecution of europe 's jews during its nazi past . last weekend , merkel said it was unlikely that germany would send troops to the middle east as its army already participated in many operations around the world . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " germany should take part in lebanon peace-keeping mission " former israeli ambassador to germany avi primor backed the idea of german troops participating in a possible international peacekeeping mission in lebanon as long as they were not stationed on the border with israel .

dw-world 's peter stützle says that the country 's mood may soon see itself reflected in the government 's policies as well . in her first reaction to the israeli attack on lebanon , german chancellor angela merkel struck the right chord with the german people when she said that israel had to make sure not to destabilize lebanon .
one week later , the people and the chancellor were no longer on the same page about this issue . according to a representative poll , three quarters of the german population believed the israeli military offensive was inappropriate ; only 12 percent approved of it , while the rest was unsure either way .
the chancellor did urge the israelis to use proportional force , but , at the same time , she asked hezbollah to release the captured israeli soldiers and stop the shelling of israeli cities in order for israel to put an end to its operations .
since it was clear from the outset that a terrorist organization like hezbollah would ignore such a request , the german position amounted to giving the israelis carte blanche for their military offensive . agony on both sides bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli soldier alon fintuha was killed on thursday in southern lebanon there is a broad consensus among the german public that the shelling of israeli cities is not acceptable .
germans are generally put off by hezbollah fighters and their iranian backers who want to wipe israel off the map . the occasional claim that germans are only paying attention to the suffering of the lebanese civilians while ignoring that of the israelis is completely unwarranted .
for years , every single terror attack in israel has received widespread coverage in the german media - often wider than thousands of victims in african wars .
nowadays , too , there are reports about the suffering on both sides . germans , on the other hand , expect higher moral standards from israel than from a terrorist organization .
that is not an unfair expectation , rather it is a sign of high esteem .
when israel fought for its survival during the six day war in 1967 , germans responded with an outpouring of sympathy for the jewish state .
but when israel responds to terrorist attacks against civilians by causing ten times the casualties , germans do not find that acceptable . a missed opportunity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli attacks have lead some moderate lebanese citizens to sympathyze with hezbollah politically aware germans know very well that lebanon was on the verge of liberating itself from the syrian grasp .
after all , it was germany 's chief prosecutor , detlev mehlis , who made a significant contribution to the process with his investigation into the murder of the former lebanese prime minister rafik hariri in feb .
2005 . this is why many germans are now bitter about the fact that the current war could destroy the democratization of lebanon as well as the prospects for peace along israel 's northern border .
and even those who do not analyze these things with great subtlety feel that israel 's reaction to the terrorist provocations may be ruining chances for peace . the growing rejection of israeli policies by the german public has manifested itself in the rising opposition to the german participation in a possible peacekeeping mission in the middle east .
almost two thirds of polled germans are against it .
under these circumstances , the german government could hardly send any soldiers , should an international mission be organized . nobody should be surprised if the german government gradually became impatient with israel .
even in foreign policy , the country 's mood can not be totally ignored . peter stützle -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " germany should take part in lebanon peace-keeping mission " former israeli ambassador to germany avi primor backed the idea of german troops participating in a possible international peacekeeping mission in lebanon as long as they were not stationed on the border with israel .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.08.2006 merkel criticizes russia for treatment of former yukos boss großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mikhail khodorkovsky faces harsh and violent conditions in his siberian prison camp german chancellor angela merkel has criticized the current prison conditions of the founder of the former russian oil firm yukos , mikhail khodorkovsky . replying to a letter from opposition liberal democrat chief guido westerwelle , merkel said the government in berlin would continue to use its good working relationship with the russian president to push for a speedy improvement of conditions for khodorkovsky who 's serving an 8-year sentence in a prison camp in siberia after being convicted of tax evasion and embezzlement . in a letter to fdp chief westerwelle , german chancellor angela merkel wrote that she had repeatedly pointed out to russian president vladimir putin that prison conditions for khodorkovsky - once the richest man in russia - were simply unacceptable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is not afraid to put her point across she urged the russian government to adhere to international standards .
the founder of the former top oil producer yukos is serving his prison sentence in siberia in very harsh conditions meant to isolate him completely from the outer world . former liberal democrat justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger who 's now a legal rights spokesperson has been following the khodorkovsky case very closely and shares the widely held opinion that the recent liquidation of the yukos firm and the way khodorkovsky is being treated are the kremlin 's retaliation for the latter 's long-standing opposition to president putin punishment for putin opposition ? " he was placed in solitary confinement several times , " leutheusser-schnarrenberger said .
" and he 's being treated in a very arbitrary way .
if he drinks his tea in the wrong place , he faces severe punishment , for instance .
and then there was the incident in which he was attacked with a knife by another inmate and injured in his face .
which goes to show that khodorkovsky is n't safe in this camp , and this is what we 're criticizing and what needs to be changed . " along with fdp chief guido westerwelle , leutheuser-schnarrenberger wants the government in berlin to raise the issue more clearly with the kremlin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger " the chancellor deserves some credit for at least calling khodorkovsky 's prison conditions unacceptable , " leutheusser-schnarrenberger said .
" but i do believe that the government has to do more than just casually mentioning the issue in talks with the russian president . " calls for increased eu pressure " there are eu-wide initiatives by politicians with much stronger criticism of the kremlin 's policy , and chancellor merkel should also step up her efforts to influence putin .
because we all know that nothing happens in khodorkovsky 's camp without his knowledge and consent . " the khodorkovsky case was also reported to have been touched upon during the recent visit to germany by us president george w. bush .
he put the case in the wider context of russia 's poor human rights record and promised that he would not tire of telling putin what he did n't approve of , but he did n't think much of pillorying the russian president in public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush never tires of chiding putin in private " nobody likes to be lectured a lot .
if you want to be effective , what you do n't go is scold the person publicly all the time .
you remind him where we may have a difference of opinion , and you do so in a respectful way .
so you can then sit down and have a constructive dialogue , " bush said . germany 's ruling and opposition parties are in agreement that it 's vital to show the kremlin that khodorkovsky 's fate is being followed closely in the west and that any irregularities will draw even more criticism from leaders here . hardy graupner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans criticize khordorkovsky verdict german politicians on tuesday condemned the jailing of yukos oil founder mikhail khordorkovsky , who was convicted of fraud and tax evasion by a russian court .
the european union declined to comment on the matter .

" uci communicates that the analysis of the sample b of floyd landis 's urine has confirmed the result of an adverse analytical finding notified by the anti-doping laboratory of paris on 26th july , following the analysis of the sample a , " said a uci statement . " in accordance to the anti-doping rules , the anti-doping commission of the uci will request that the usa cycling federation open a disciplinary procedure against the rider . " landis , though , protested his innocence and announced on his website that he would appeal against the findings . " landis will pursue the appeal procedures established by the uci in order to overturn the laboratory results .
it is expected that the matter will now be referred to usa cycling . tour winner maintains innocence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : landis faces a fall from grace " landis , who has not used performance-enhancing substances , maintains his innocence in this case and believes that he will be vindicated of the doping charges . " landis 's attorney , howard jacobs , has begun preparing the case for arbitration .
if the case follows the normal protocol , it is expected to be resolved within four to six months . " at this point in time , i am waiting to receive the full laboratory documentation for the b test .
in consultation with some of the leading medical and scientific experts , we will prove that floyd landis 's victory in the 2006 tour de france was not aided in any respect by the use of any banned substances , " said jacobs . landis and jacobs will also argue against the uci 's premature release of the a sample findings as well as the anonymous leak of the carbon-isotope test results to the new york times on july 31 . legal team complains of bias bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : landis with champagne , not a sample " i call on the uci to start following its own rules and to allow this process to proceed without the further taint of public comment by uci officials , " added jacobs . " the anti-doping process must be free from the perception that sports federations and anti-doping authorities , who hold great political and financial sway over sport , are attempting to influence the outcome of a pending case by issuing inappropriate public comments . " christophe prudhomme , the tour de france race director , said he was not in the least bit surprised by the b sample findings but added that responsibility also lay with the american 's team , phonak , who have had a series of high profile drugs cases in the past few years including landis ' compatriot tyler hamilton . the soiled yellow jersey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a false champion ?
" the body blow came last week , " he told reporters .
" we know that virtually the whole time the b sample confirms the initial result .
my feeling is that it is a real waste but also that we have to battle really hard against drug taking . " " we can not tolerate the yellow jersey being soiled . " " taking the landis case into account , it is imperative that the managers , the team directors , the doctors or indeed those who pretend to be doctors are also punished , " added prudhomme , echoing comments made by athletics governing body the iaaf earlier this week about the group surrounding athletics world 100m joint record holder justin gatlin , who also tested positive for testosterone . landis had said prior to the b sample result that he would go to the limit to prove his innocence .
" i ask not to be judged and much less to be sentenced by anyone , " landis said over a week ago . " i will proceed to undergo all of these tests " to show the levels " are absolutely natural and produced by my own organism " , he promised on friday . the american added that he wished to state " categorically that my tour win was exclusively due to many years of training and dedication " to his sport . " i declare convincingly and categorically that my winning the tour de france has been exclusively due to many years of training and my complete devotion to cycling . " i was the strongest guy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.08.2006 opinion : germans expect higher moral standards from israel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli missiles have started targeting bridges in the christian heartland north of beirut germans are increasingly disenchanted with israel 's response to hezbollah 's terrorist acts .
dw-world 's peter stützle says that the country 's mood may soon see itself reflected in the government 's policies as well . in her first reaction to the israeli attack on lebanon , german chancellor angela merkel struck the right chord with the german people when she said that israel had to make sure not to destabilize lebanon .
one week later , the people and the chancellor were no longer on the same page about this issue . according to a representative poll , three quarters of the german population believed the israeli military offensive was inappropriate ; only 12 percent approved of it , while the rest was unsure either way .
the chancellor did urge the israelis to use proportional force , but , at the same time , she asked hezbollah to release the captured israeli soldiers and stop the shelling of israeli cities in order for israel to put an end to its operations .
since it was clear from the outset that a terrorist organization like hezbollah would ignore such a request , the german position amounted to giving the israelis carte blanche for their military offensive . agony on both sides bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli soldier alon fintuha was killed on thursday in southern lebanon there is a broad consensus among the german public that the shelling of israeli cities is not acceptable .
germans are generally put off by hezbollah fighters and their iranian backers who want to wipe israel off the map . the occasional claim that germans are only paying attention to the suffering of the lebanese civilians while ignoring that of the israelis is completely unwarranted .
for years , every single terror attack in israel has received widespread coverage in the german media - often wider than thousands of victims in african wars .
nowadays , too , there are reports about the suffering on both sides . germans , on the other hand , expect higher moral standards from israel than from a terrorist organization .
that is not an unfair expectation , rather it is a sign of high esteem .
when israel fought for its survival during the six day war in 1967 , germans responded with an outpouring of sympathy for the jewish state .
but when israel responds to terrorist attacks against civilians by causing ten times the casualties , germans do not find that acceptable . a missed opportunity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli attacks have lead some moderate lebanese citizens to sympathyze with hezbollah politically aware germans know very well that lebanon was on the verge of liberating itself from the syrian grasp .
after all , it was germany 's chief prosecutor , detlev mehlis , who made a significant contribution to the process with his investigation into the murder of the former lebanese prime minister rafik hariri in feb .
2005 . this is why many germans are now bitter about the fact that the current war could destroy the democratization of lebanon as well as the prospects for peace along israel 's northern border .
and even those who do not analyze these things with great subtlety feel that israel 's reaction to the terrorist provocations may be ruining chances for peace . the growing rejection of israeli policies by the german public has manifested itself in the rising opposition to the german participation in a possible peacekeeping mission in the middle east .
almost two thirds of polled germans are against it .
under these circumstances , the german government could hardly send any soldiers , should an international mission be organized . nobody should be surprised if the german government gradually became impatient with israel .
even in foreign policy , the country 's mood can not be totally ignored . peter stützle -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " germany should take part in lebanon peace-keeping mission " former israeli ambassador to germany avi primor backed the idea of german troops participating in a possible international peacekeeping mission in lebanon as long as they were not stationed on the border with israel .

the founder of the former top oil producer yukos is serving his prison sentence in siberia in very harsh conditions meant to isolate him completely from the outer world . former liberal democrat justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger who 's now a legal rights spokesperson has been following the khodorkovsky case very closely and shares the widely held opinion that the recent liquidation of the yukos firm and the way khodorkovsky is being treated are the kremlin 's retaliation for the latter 's long-standing opposition to president putin punishment for putin opposition ? " he was placed in solitary confinement several times , " leutheusser-schnarrenberger said .
" and he 's being treated in a very arbitrary way .
if he drinks his tea in the wrong place , he faces severe punishment , for instance .
and then there was the incident in which he was attacked with a knife by another inmate and injured in his face .
which goes to show that khodorkovsky is n't safe in this camp , and this is what we 're criticizing and what needs to be changed . " along with fdp chief guido westerwelle , leutheuser-schnarrenberger wants the government in berlin to raise the issue more clearly with the kremlin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger " the chancellor deserves some credit for at least calling khodorkovsky 's prison conditions unacceptable , " leutheusser-schnarrenberger said .
" but i do believe that the government has to do more than just casually mentioning the issue in talks with the russian president . " calls for increased eu pressure " there are eu-wide initiatives by politicians with much stronger criticism of the kremlin 's policy , and chancellor merkel should also step up her efforts to influence putin .
because we all know that nothing happens in khodorkovsky 's camp without his knowledge and consent . " the khodorkovsky case was also reported to have been touched upon during the recent visit to germany by us president george w. bush .
he put the case in the wider context of russia 's poor human rights record and promised that he would not tire of telling putin what he did n't approve of , but he did n't think much of pillorying the russian president in public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush never tires of chiding putin in private " nobody likes to be lectured a lot .
if you want to be effective , what you do n't go is scold the person publicly all the time .
you remind him where we may have a difference of opinion , and you do so in a respectful way .
so you can then sit down and have a constructive dialogue , " bush said . germany 's ruling and opposition parties are in agreement that it 's vital to show the kremlin that khodorkovsky 's fate is being followed closely in the west and that any irregularities will draw even more criticism from leaders here . hardy graupner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans criticize khordorkovsky verdict german politicians on tuesday condemned the jailing of yukos oil founder mikhail khordorkovsky , who was convicted of fraud and tax evasion by a russian court .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 05.08.2006 new blow to cycling as tour winner landis tests positive großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : floyd landis celebrates winning the tour de france , a title he may be stripped off tour de france winner floyd landis is set to become the first victor of the race to be stripped of his title after his b sample confirmed he had abnormal levels of testosterone on saturday . the 30-year-old american - who was also sacked by his phonak team following the announcement - had failed a drugs test after the 17th stage of the tour de france which he had won to get his way back into the race just a day after he had faded out of contention . however the sport 's governing body uci revealed on saturday that the b sample had simply confirmed the initial findings - though landis 's camp had already accepted that it would . " uci communicates that the analysis of the sample b of floyd landis 's urine has confirmed the result of an adverse analytical finding notified by the anti-doping laboratory of paris on 26th july , following the analysis of the sample a , " said a uci statement . " in accordance to the anti-doping rules , the anti-doping commission of the uci will request that the usa cycling federation open a disciplinary procedure against the rider . " landis , though , protested his innocence and announced on his website that he would appeal against the findings . " landis will pursue the appeal procedures established by the uci in order to overturn the laboratory results .
it is expected that the matter will now be referred to usa cycling . tour winner maintains innocence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : landis faces a fall from grace " landis , who has not used performance-enhancing substances , maintains his innocence in this case and believes that he will be vindicated of the doping charges . " landis 's attorney , howard jacobs , has begun preparing the case for arbitration .
if the case follows the normal protocol , it is expected to be resolved within four to six months . " at this point in time , i am waiting to receive the full laboratory documentation for the b test .
in consultation with some of the leading medical and scientific experts , we will prove that floyd landis 's victory in the 2006 tour de france was not aided in any respect by the use of any banned substances , " said jacobs . landis and jacobs will also argue against the uci 's premature release of the a sample findings as well as the anonymous leak of the carbon-isotope test results to the new york times on july 31 . legal team complains of bias bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : landis with champagne , not a sample " i call on the uci to start following its own rules and to allow this process to proceed without the further taint of public comment by uci officials , " added jacobs . " the anti-doping process must be free from the perception that sports federations and anti-doping authorities , who hold great political and financial sway over sport , are attempting to influence the outcome of a pending case by issuing inappropriate public comments . " christophe prudhomme , the tour de france race director , said he was not in the least bit surprised by the b sample findings but added that responsibility also lay with the american 's team , phonak , who have had a series of high profile drugs cases in the past few years including landis ' compatriot tyler hamilton . the soiled yellow jersey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a false champion ?
" the body blow came last week , " he told reporters .
" we know that virtually the whole time the b sample confirms the initial result .
my feeling is that it is a real waste but also that we have to battle really hard against drug taking . " " we can not tolerate the yellow jersey being soiled . " " taking the landis case into account , it is imperative that the managers , the team directors , the doctors or indeed those who pretend to be doctors are also punished , " added prudhomme , echoing comments made by athletics governing body the iaaf earlier this week about the group surrounding athletics world 100m joint record holder justin gatlin , who also tested positive for testosterone . landis had said prior to the b sample result that he would go to the limit to prove his innocence .
" i ask not to be judged and much less to be sentenced by anyone , " landis said over a week ago . " i will proceed to undergo all of these tests " to show the levels " are absolutely natural and produced by my own organism " , he promised on friday . the american added that he wished to state " categorically that my tour win was exclusively due to many years of training and dedication " to his sport . " i declare convincingly and categorically that my winning the tour de france has been exclusively due to many years of training and my complete devotion to cycling . " i was the strongest guy .

we took a look at a few eu countries and their neighbors and what divides them on the issue . despite repeated efforts , europe has not been able to find a common approach to the middle east crisis .
the possibility of sending an international peacekeeping force to the region remains open , but the opinions of the various european countries and their key partners remain across the board . some countries - including france , sweden , norway , slovakia , canada , germany , turkey , italy , spain , belgium , and ireland - have already expressed a willingness to participate in an international peace effort by sending troops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : historical ties are influencing europe 's stance a ceasefire and an international mandate , however , are seen as a prerequisite for involvement , whether it takes places under the banner of nato , the un or the european union . there is hope among europeans that the middle east would also join in and contribute to a peacekeeping effort , particularly egypt . dw-world.de looked at a few of the key players in the greater european area , what is at stake for them , and why they ca n't find a common line . germany israel 's president ehud olmert said in an interview with the süddeutsche zeitung daily that he has " absolutely no problem with german soldiers in southern lebanon … .at the moment , no other nation is as friendly to israel as germany .
if germany can contribute to the security of the israeli people , this would be a rewarding task … " olmert 's expectation of german involvement rests on the tight but history-laden relationship the two countries have developed since world war ii . not only were the nazis responsible for the death of six million jews during the holocaust , the state of israel was established in 1948 as a direct response to the nazi persecution .
the international community felt obligated to secure a jewish state for the survivors . germany 's history has made it very reluctant to send soldiers into combat since world war ii . germany 's defense minister franz josef jung -lrb- cdu -rrb- has said he considers german participation in an international peacekeeping force a possibility , while chancellor angela merkel and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier -lrb- spd -rrb- are more cautious .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo is still a painful memory for the eu " we do n't necessarily dismiss involvement , but we are hesitant , " said merkel , as reported by germany news agency dpa . within germany 's political parties , opinions are split .
some see germany 's history as an obligation to participate , other see precisely that as a reason to stay out of it , wrote dw-world.de 's peter philip . history is not the only factor in germany 's hesitancy .
its army , the bundeswehr , has current obligations in other crisis areas , such as dr congo and afghanistan , and it could become increasingly difficult to convince the german population of the need to take part in the israel-lebanon crisis as well . england a traditional american ally and supporter of the iraq war , britain , along with germany , was one of the countries to call for a " cessation of hostilities " instead of an immediate ceasefire in the eu foreign ministers ' joint statement . lebanese president fuad siniora has , however , called on tony blair to advocate an immediate ceasefire , reported afp . the british government supports a gradual ceasefire , along with the united states , so that hezbollah can be weakened before the hostilities stop since the lebanese army is not as strong as the extremist group . with troops currently in iraq and afghanistan , britain 's resources are already stretched thin and it has not expressed a willingness to engage troops in lebanon or israel . turkey turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan was one of the very first heads of state to announce a willingness to send troops , wrote the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- daily .
he 's a practicing muslim himself and his government acted as a mediator between israel and hamas this spring . the country , which has been negotiating for years with the european union on future accession , has been mentioned as a possible leader in an international mission due to its proximity to the region .
however , recent statements have indicated france is more likely to lead a mission . erdogan has yet to convince the population of turkey that military involvement in the crisis would be beneficial , wrote the faz . russia russia renewed demands for an immediate end to hostilities in the middle east , reported the financial times deutschland daily .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : douste-blazy and steinmeier in rome an immediate ceasefire " is the only way to establish a foundation for a political solution , " said the director of the security council igor ivanov on friday after a meeting with saad hariri , the majority leader in the lebanese parliament , reported dpa . russia has been critical of the us , saying it is undermining the position of the un in the middle east conflict by supporting israel . " the discontentment among the countries in the -lrb- un -rrb- security council has grown recently since the us is ready to block any decision that could put pressure on israel , " russian un ambassador vitali tzurkin told the russia newspaper isvestia . russia is not a member of the european union , but is a member of the group of eight and the united nations . france french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy has announced france would participate in an international peacekeeping effort , reported the faz .
the french government , however , has remained somewhat more hesitant , stipulating a ceasefire and an international mandate before sending troops . a commentary in le figaro daily added that israel , lebanon and the world are expecting france to head up the international force , but the country is waiting for a ceasefire . the financial times deutschland reported that france would be able to send as many as 5,000 well-equipped soldiers quickly as part of an international mission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : potential members of a peacekeeping mission are waiting for a ceasefire as in the iraq war , france has taken a position staunchly opposed to the united states .
twice this week , france refused to attend un peace talks on the middle east , hoping to put pressure on the us . france is a traditional ally of lebanon , which was a mandated territory after the end of world war i , along with syria .
lebanon gained independence in 1943 when france was occupied by the nazis . italy italy 's government was voted out of office for supporting the united states in the iraq war .
it sent troops to support the international efforts in kosovo , afghanistan and iraq , though president romano prodi pulled italian soldiers out of iraq after he took office in may . foreign minister massimo d 'alema has emphasized his country 's readiness to send troops to the middle east . " italy 's unified decision -lrb- to send troops -rrb- came as a surprise because the 9-party governing coalition already had trouble agreeing on involvement in afghanistan , " wrote the faz . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de violence in the middle east click on the links to read dw-world.de 's compilation of articles on the conflict and the search for peace .

we took a look at a few eu countries and their neighbors and what divides them on the issue . despite repeated efforts , europe has not been able to find a common approach to the middle east crisis .
the possibility of sending an international peacekeeping force to the region remains open , but the opinions of the various european countries and their key partners remain across the board . some countries - including france , sweden , norway , slovakia , canada , germany , turkey , italy , spain , belgium , and ireland - have already expressed a willingness to participate in an international peace effort by sending troops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : historical ties are influencing europe 's stance a ceasefire and an international mandate , however , are seen as a prerequisite for involvement , whether it takes places under the banner of nato , the un or the european union . there is hope among europeans that the middle east would also join in and contribute to a peacekeeping effort , particularly egypt . dw-world.de looked at a few of the key players in the greater european area , what is at stake for them , and why they ca n't find a common line . germany israel 's president ehud olmert said in an interview with the süddeutsche zeitung daily that he has " absolutely no problem with german soldiers in southern lebanon … .at the moment , no other nation is as friendly to israel as germany .
if germany can contribute to the security of the israeli people , this would be a rewarding task … " olmert 's expectation of german involvement rests on the tight but history-laden relationship the two countries have developed since world war ii . not only were the nazis responsible for the death of six million jews during the holocaust , the state of israel was established in 1948 as a direct response to the nazi persecution .
the international community felt obligated to secure a jewish state for the survivors . germany 's history has made it very reluctant to send soldiers into combat since world war ii . germany 's defense minister franz josef jung -lrb- cdu -rrb- has said he considers german participation in an international peacekeeping force a possibility , while chancellor angela merkel and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier -lrb- spd -rrb- are more cautious .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo is still a painful memory for the eu " we do n't necessarily dismiss involvement , but we are hesitant , " said merkel , as reported by germany news agency dpa . within germany 's political parties , opinions are split .
some see germany 's history as an obligation to participate , other see precisely that as a reason to stay out of it , wrote dw-world.de 's peter philip . history is not the only factor in germany 's hesitancy .
its army , the bundeswehr , has current obligations in other crisis areas , such as dr congo and afghanistan , and it could become increasingly difficult to convince the german population of the need to take part in the israel-lebanon crisis as well . england a traditional american ally and supporter of the iraq war , britain , along with germany , was one of the countries to call for a " cessation of hostilities " instead of an immediate ceasefire in the eu foreign ministers ' joint statement . lebanese president fuad siniora has , however , called on tony blair to advocate an immediate ceasefire , reported afp . the british government supports a gradual ceasefire , along with the united states , so that hezbollah can be weakened before the hostilities stop since the lebanese army is not as strong as the extremist group . with troops currently in iraq and afghanistan , britain 's resources are already stretched thin and it has not expressed a willingness to engage troops in lebanon or israel . turkey turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan was one of the very first heads of state to announce a willingness to send troops , wrote the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- daily .
he 's a practicing muslim himself and his government acted as a mediator between israel and hamas this spring . the country , which has been negotiating for years with the european union on future accession , has been mentioned as a possible leader in an international mission due to its proximity to the region .
however , recent statements have indicated france is more likely to lead a mission . erdogan has yet to convince the population of turkey that military involvement in the crisis would be beneficial , wrote the faz . russia russia renewed demands for an immediate end to hostilities in the middle east , reported the financial times deutschland daily .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : douste-blazy and steinmeier in rome an immediate ceasefire " is the only way to establish a foundation for a political solution , " said the director of the security council igor ivanov on friday after a meeting with saad hariri , the majority leader in the lebanese parliament , reported dpa . russia has been critical of the us , saying it is undermining the position of the un in the middle east conflict by supporting israel . " the discontentment among the countries in the -lrb- un -rrb- security council has grown recently since the us is ready to block any decision that could put pressure on israel , " russian un ambassador vitali tzurkin told the russia newspaper isvestia . russia is not a member of the european union , but is a member of the group of eight and the united nations . france french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy has announced france would participate in an international peacekeeping effort , reported the faz .
the french government , however , has remained somewhat more hesitant , stipulating a ceasefire and an international mandate before sending troops . a commentary in le figaro daily added that israel , lebanon and the world are expecting france to head up the international force , but the country is waiting for a ceasefire . the financial times deutschland reported that france would be able to send as many as 5,000 well-equipped soldiers quickly as part of an international mission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : potential members of a peacekeeping mission are waiting for a ceasefire as in the iraq war , france has taken a position staunchly opposed to the united states .
twice this week , france refused to attend un peace talks on the middle east , hoping to put pressure on the us . france is a traditional ally of lebanon , which was a mandated territory after the end of world war i , along with syria .
lebanon gained independence in 1943 when france was occupied by the nazis . italy italy 's government was voted out of office for supporting the united states in the iraq war .
it sent troops to support the international efforts in kosovo , afghanistan and iraq , though president romano prodi pulled italian soldiers out of iraq after he took office in may . foreign minister massimo d 'alema has emphasized his country 's readiness to send troops to the middle east . " italy 's unified decision -lrb- to send troops -rrb- came as a surprise because the 9-party governing coalition already had trouble agreeing on involvement in afghanistan , " wrote the faz . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de violence in the middle east click on the links to read dw-world.de 's compilation of articles on the conflict and the search for peace .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.08.2006 opinion : germans expect higher moral standards from israel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli missiles have started targeting bridges in the christian heartland north of beirut germans are increasingly disenchanted with israel 's response to hezbollah 's terrorist acts .
dw-world 's peter stützle says that the country 's mood may soon see itself reflected in the government 's policies as well . in her first reaction to the israeli attack on lebanon , german chancellor angela merkel struck the right chord with the german people when she said that israel had to make sure not to destabilize lebanon .
one week later , the people and the chancellor were no longer on the same page about this issue . according to a representative poll , three quarters of the german population believed the israeli military offensive was inappropriate ; only 12 percent approved of it , while the rest was unsure either way .
the chancellor did urge the israelis to use proportional force , but , at the same time , she asked hezbollah to release the captured israeli soldiers and stop the shelling of israeli cities in order for israel to put an end to its operations .
since it was clear from the outset that a terrorist organization like hezbollah would ignore such a request , the german position amounted to giving the israelis carte blanche for their military offensive . agony on both sides bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli soldier alon fintuha was killed on thursday in southern lebanon there is a broad consensus among the german public that the shelling of israeli cities is not acceptable .
germans are generally put off by hezbollah fighters and their iranian backers who want to wipe israel off the map . the occasional claim that germans are only paying attention to the suffering of the lebanese civilians while ignoring that of the israelis is completely unwarranted .
for years , every single terror attack in israel has received widespread coverage in the german media - often wider than thousands of victims in african wars .
nowadays , too , there are reports about the suffering on both sides . germans , on the other hand , expect higher moral standards from israel than from a terrorist organization .
that is not an unfair expectation , rather it is a sign of high esteem .
when israel fought for its survival during the six day war in 1967 , germans responded with an outpouring of sympathy for the jewish state .
but when israel responds to terrorist attacks against civilians by causing ten times the casualties , germans do not find that acceptable . a missed opportunity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli attacks have lead some moderate lebanese citizens to sympathyze with hezbollah politically aware germans know very well that lebanon was on the verge of liberating itself from the syrian grasp .
after all , it was germany 's chief prosecutor , detlev mehlis , who made a significant contribution to the process with his investigation into the murder of the former lebanese prime minister rafik hariri in feb .
2005 . this is why many germans are now bitter about the fact that the current war could destroy the democratization of lebanon as well as the prospects for peace along israel 's northern border .
and even those who do not analyze these things with great subtlety feel that israel 's reaction to the terrorist provocations may be ruining chances for peace . the growing rejection of israeli policies by the german public has manifested itself in the rising opposition to the german participation in a possible peacekeeping mission in the middle east .
almost two thirds of polled germans are against it .
under these circumstances , the german government could hardly send any soldiers , should an international mission be organized . nobody should be surprised if the german government gradually became impatient with israel .
even in foreign policy , the country 's mood can not be totally ignored . peter stützle -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " germany should take part in lebanon peace-keeping mission " former israeli ambassador to germany avi primor backed the idea of german troops participating in a possible international peacekeeping mission in lebanon as long as they were not stationed on the border with israel .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.08.2006 opinion : germans expect higher moral standards from israel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli missiles have started targeting bridges in the christian heartland north of beirut germans are increasingly disenchanted with israel 's response to hezbollah 's terrorist acts .
dw-world 's peter stützle says that the country 's mood may soon see itself reflected in the government 's policies as well . in her first reaction to the israeli attack on lebanon , german chancellor angela merkel struck the right chord with the german people when she said that israel had to make sure not to destabilize lebanon .
one week later , the people and the chancellor were no longer on the same page about this issue . according to a representative poll , three quarters of the german population believed the israeli military offensive was inappropriate ; only 12 percent approved of it , while the rest was unsure either way .
the chancellor did urge the israelis to use proportional force , but , at the same time , she asked hezbollah to release the captured israeli soldiers and stop the shelling of israeli cities in order for israel to put an end to its operations .
since it was clear from the outset that a terrorist organization like hezbollah would ignore such a request , the german position amounted to giving the israelis carte blanche for their military offensive . agony on both sides bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli soldier alon fintuha was killed on thursday in southern lebanon there is a broad consensus among the german public that the shelling of israeli cities is not acceptable .
germans are generally put off by hezbollah fighters and their iranian backers who want to wipe israel off the map . the occasional claim that germans are only paying attention to the suffering of the lebanese civilians while ignoring that of the israelis is completely unwarranted .
for years , every single terror attack in israel has received widespread coverage in the german media - often wider than thousands of victims in african wars .
nowadays , too , there are reports about the suffering on both sides . germans , on the other hand , expect higher moral standards from israel than from a terrorist organization .
that is not an unfair expectation , rather it is a sign of high esteem .
when israel fought for its survival during the six day war in 1967 , germans responded with an outpouring of sympathy for the jewish state .
but when israel responds to terrorist attacks against civilians by causing ten times the casualties , germans do not find that acceptable . a missed opportunity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli attacks have lead some moderate lebanese citizens to sympathyze with hezbollah politically aware germans know very well that lebanon was on the verge of liberating itself from the syrian grasp .
after all , it was germany 's chief prosecutor , detlev mehlis , who made a significant contribution to the process with his investigation into the murder of the former lebanese prime minister rafik hariri in feb .
2005 . this is why many germans are now bitter about the fact that the current war could destroy the democratization of lebanon as well as the prospects for peace along israel 's northern border .
and even those who do not analyze these things with great subtlety feel that israel 's reaction to the terrorist provocations may be ruining chances for peace . the growing rejection of israeli policies by the german public has manifested itself in the rising opposition to the german participation in a possible peacekeeping mission in the middle east .
almost two thirds of polled germans are against it .
under these circumstances , the german government could hardly send any soldiers , should an international mission be organized . nobody should be surprised if the german government gradually became impatient with israel .
even in foreign policy , the country 's mood can not be totally ignored . peter stützle -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " germany should take part in lebanon peace-keeping mission " former israeli ambassador to germany avi primor backed the idea of german troops participating in a possible international peacekeeping mission in lebanon as long as they were not stationed on the border with israel .

we took a look at a few eu countries and their neighbors and what divides them on the issue . despite repeated efforts , europe has not been able to find a common approach to the middle east crisis .
the possibility of sending an international peacekeeping force to the region remains open , but the opinions of the various european countries and their key partners remain across the board . some countries - including france , sweden , norway , slovakia , canada , germany , turkey , italy , spain , belgium , and ireland - have already expressed a willingness to participate in an international peace effort by sending troops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : historical ties are influencing europe 's stance a ceasefire and an international mandate , however , are seen as a prerequisite for involvement , whether it takes places under the banner of nato , the un or the european union . there is hope among europeans that the middle east would also join in and contribute to a peacekeeping effort , particularly egypt . dw-world.de looked at a few of the key players in the greater european area , what is at stake for them , and why they ca n't find a common line . germany israel 's president ehud olmert said in an interview with the süddeutsche zeitung daily that he has " absolutely no problem with german soldiers in southern lebanon … .at the moment , no other nation is as friendly to israel as germany .
if germany can contribute to the security of the israeli people , this would be a rewarding task … " olmert 's expectation of german involvement rests on the tight but history-laden relationship the two countries have developed since world war ii . not only were the nazis responsible for the death of six million jews during the holocaust , the state of israel was established in 1948 as a direct response to the nazi persecution .
the international community felt obligated to secure a jewish state for the survivors . germany 's history has made it very reluctant to send soldiers into combat since world war ii . germany 's defense minister franz josef jung -lrb- cdu -rrb- has said he considers german participation in an international peacekeeping force a possibility , while chancellor angela merkel and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier -lrb- spd -rrb- are more cautious .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo is still a painful memory for the eu " we do n't necessarily dismiss involvement , but we are hesitant , " said merkel , as reported by germany news agency dpa . within germany 's political parties , opinions are split .
some see germany 's history as an obligation to participate , other see precisely that as a reason to stay out of it , wrote dw-world.de 's peter philip . history is not the only factor in germany 's hesitancy .
its army , the bundeswehr , has current obligations in other crisis areas , such as dr congo and afghanistan , and it could become increasingly difficult to convince the german population of the need to take part in the israel-lebanon crisis as well . england a traditional american ally and supporter of the iraq war , britain , along with germany , was one of the countries to call for a " cessation of hostilities " instead of an immediate ceasefire in the eu foreign ministers ' joint statement . lebanese president fuad siniora has , however , called on tony blair to advocate an immediate ceasefire , reported afp . the british government supports a gradual ceasefire , along with the united states , so that hezbollah can be weakened before the hostilities stop since the lebanese army is not as strong as the extremist group . with troops currently in iraq and afghanistan , britain 's resources are already stretched thin and it has not expressed a willingness to engage troops in lebanon or israel . turkey turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan was one of the very first heads of state to announce a willingness to send troops , wrote the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- daily .
he 's a practicing muslim himself and his government acted as a mediator between israel and hamas this spring . the country , which has been negotiating for years with the european union on future accession , has been mentioned as a possible leader in an international mission due to its proximity to the region .
however , recent statements have indicated france is more likely to lead a mission . erdogan has yet to convince the population of turkey that military involvement in the crisis would be beneficial , wrote the faz . russia russia renewed demands for an immediate end to hostilities in the middle east , reported the financial times deutschland daily .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : douste-blazy and steinmeier in rome an immediate ceasefire " is the only way to establish a foundation for a political solution , " said the director of the security council igor ivanov on friday after a meeting with saad hariri , the majority leader in the lebanese parliament , reported dpa . russia has been critical of the us , saying it is undermining the position of the un in the middle east conflict by supporting israel .

the french government , however , has remained somewhat more hesitant , stipulating a ceasefire and an international mandate before sending troops . a commentary in le figaro daily added that israel , lebanon and the world are expecting france to head up the international force , but the country is waiting for a ceasefire . the financial times deutschland reported that france would be able to send as many as 5,000 well-equipped soldiers quickly as part of an international mission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : potential members of a peacekeeping mission are waiting for a ceasefire as in the iraq war , france has taken a position staunchly opposed to the united states .

the founder of the former top oil producer yukos is serving his prison sentence in siberia in very harsh conditions meant to isolate him completely from the outer world . former liberal democrat justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger who 's now a legal rights spokesperson has been following the khodorkovsky case very closely and shares the widely held opinion that the recent liquidation of the yukos firm and the way khodorkovsky is being treated are the kremlin 's retaliation for the latter 's long-standing opposition to president putin punishment for putin opposition ? " he was placed in solitary confinement several times , " leutheusser-schnarrenberger said .
" and he 's being treated in a very arbitrary way .
if he drinks his tea in the wrong place , he faces severe punishment , for instance .
and then there was the incident in which he was attacked with a knife by another inmate and injured in his face .
which goes to show that khodorkovsky is n't safe in this camp , and this is what we 're criticizing and what needs to be changed . " along with fdp chief guido westerwelle , leutheuser-schnarrenberger wants the government in berlin to raise the issue more clearly with the kremlin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger " the chancellor deserves some credit for at least calling khodorkovsky 's prison conditions unacceptable , " leutheusser-schnarrenberger said .
" but i do believe that the government has to do more than just casually mentioning the issue in talks with the russian president . " calls for increased eu pressure " there are eu-wide initiatives by politicians with much stronger criticism of the kremlin 's policy , and chancellor merkel should also step up her efforts to influence putin .
because we all know that nothing happens in khodorkovsky 's camp without his knowledge and consent . " the khodorkovsky case was also reported to have been touched upon during the recent visit to germany by us president george w. bush .
he put the case in the wider context of russia 's poor human rights record and promised that he would not tire of telling putin what he did n't approve of , but he did n't think much of pillorying the russian president in public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush never tires of chiding putin in private " nobody likes to be lectured a lot .
if you want to be effective , what you do n't go is scold the person publicly all the time .
you remind him where we may have a difference of opinion , and you do so in a respectful way .
so you can then sit down and have a constructive dialogue , " bush said . germany 's ruling and opposition parties are in agreement that it 's vital to show the kremlin that khodorkovsky 's fate is being followed closely in the west and that any irregularities will draw even more criticism from leaders here . hardy graupner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans criticize khordorkovsky verdict german politicians on tuesday condemned the jailing of yukos oil founder mikhail khordorkovsky , who was convicted of fraud and tax evasion by a russian court .

dw-world 's peter stützle says that the country 's mood may soon see itself reflected in the government 's policies as well . in her first reaction to the israeli attack on lebanon , german chancellor angela merkel struck the right chord with the german people when she said that israel had to make sure not to destabilize lebanon .
one week later , the people and the chancellor were no longer on the same page about this issue . according to a representative poll , three quarters of the german population believed the israeli military offensive was inappropriate ; only 12 percent approved of it , while the rest was unsure either way .
the chancellor did urge the israelis to use proportional force , but , at the same time , she asked hezbollah to release the captured israeli soldiers and stop the shelling of israeli cities in order for israel to put an end to its operations .
since it was clear from the outset that a terrorist organization like hezbollah would ignore such a request , the german position amounted to giving the israelis carte blanche for their military offensive . agony on both sides bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli soldier alon fintuha was killed on thursday in southern lebanon there is a broad consensus among the german public that the shelling of israeli cities is not acceptable .
germans are generally put off by hezbollah fighters and their iranian backers who want to wipe israel off the map . the occasional claim that germans are only paying attention to the suffering of the lebanese civilians while ignoring that of the israelis is completely unwarranted .
for years , every single terror attack in israel has received widespread coverage in the german media - often wider than thousands of victims in african wars .
nowadays , too , there are reports about the suffering on both sides . germans , on the other hand , expect higher moral standards from israel than from a terrorist organization .
that is not an unfair expectation , rather it is a sign of high esteem .
when israel fought for its survival during the six day war in 1967 , germans responded with an outpouring of sympathy for the jewish state .
but when israel responds to terrorist attacks against civilians by causing ten times the casualties , germans do not find that acceptable . a missed opportunity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli attacks have lead some moderate lebanese citizens to sympathyze with hezbollah politically aware germans know very well that lebanon was on the verge of liberating itself from the syrian grasp .
after all , it was germany 's chief prosecutor , detlev mehlis , who made a significant contribution to the process with his investigation into the murder of the former lebanese prime minister rafik hariri in feb .
2005 . this is why many germans are now bitter about the fact that the current war could destroy the democratization of lebanon as well as the prospects for peace along israel 's northern border .
and even those who do not analyze these things with great subtlety feel that israel 's reaction to the terrorist provocations may be ruining chances for peace . the growing rejection of israeli policies by the german public has manifested itself in the rising opposition to the german participation in a possible peacekeeping mission in the middle east .
almost two thirds of polled germans are against it .
under these circumstances , the german government could hardly send any soldiers , should an international mission be organized . nobody should be surprised if the german government gradually became impatient with israel .
even in foreign policy , the country 's mood can not be totally ignored . peter stützle -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " germany should take part in lebanon peace-keeping mission " former israeli ambassador to germany avi primor backed the idea of german troops participating in a possible international peacekeeping mission in lebanon as long as they were not stationed on the border with israel .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.08.2006 merkel criticizes russia for treatment of former yukos boss großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mikhail khodorkovsky faces harsh and violent conditions in his siberian prison camp german chancellor angela merkel has criticized the current prison conditions of the founder of the former russian oil firm yukos , mikhail khodorkovsky . replying to a letter from opposition liberal democrat chief guido westerwelle , merkel said the government in berlin would continue to use its good working relationship with the russian president to push for a speedy improvement of conditions for khodorkovsky who 's serving an 8-year sentence in a prison camp in siberia after being convicted of tax evasion and embezzlement . in a letter to fdp chief westerwelle , german chancellor angela merkel wrote that she had repeatedly pointed out to russian president vladimir putin that prison conditions for khodorkovsky - once the richest man in russia - were simply unacceptable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is not afraid to put her point across she urged the russian government to adhere to international standards .
the founder of the former top oil producer yukos is serving his prison sentence in siberia in very harsh conditions meant to isolate him completely from the outer world . former liberal democrat justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger who 's now a legal rights spokesperson has been following the khodorkovsky case very closely and shares the widely held opinion that the recent liquidation of the yukos firm and the way khodorkovsky is being treated are the kremlin 's retaliation for the latter 's long-standing opposition to president putin punishment for putin opposition ? " he was placed in solitary confinement several times , " leutheusser-schnarrenberger said .
" and he 's being treated in a very arbitrary way .
if he drinks his tea in the wrong place , he faces severe punishment , for instance .
and then there was the incident in which he was attacked with a knife by another inmate and injured in his face .
which goes to show that khodorkovsky is n't safe in this camp , and this is what we 're criticizing and what needs to be changed . " along with fdp chief guido westerwelle , leutheuser-schnarrenberger wants the government in berlin to raise the issue more clearly with the kremlin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger " the chancellor deserves some credit for at least calling khodorkovsky 's prison conditions unacceptable , " leutheusser-schnarrenberger said .
" but i do believe that the government has to do more than just casually mentioning the issue in talks with the russian president . " calls for increased eu pressure " there are eu-wide initiatives by politicians with much stronger criticism of the kremlin 's policy , and chancellor merkel should also step up her efforts to influence putin .
because we all know that nothing happens in khodorkovsky 's camp without his knowledge and consent . " the khodorkovsky case was also reported to have been touched upon during the recent visit to germany by us president george w. bush .
he put the case in the wider context of russia 's poor human rights record and promised that he would not tire of telling putin what he did n't approve of , but he did n't think much of pillorying the russian president in public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush never tires of chiding putin in private " nobody likes to be lectured a lot .
if you want to be effective , what you do n't go is scold the person publicly all the time .
you remind him where we may have a difference of opinion , and you do so in a respectful way .
so you can then sit down and have a constructive dialogue , " bush said . germany 's ruling and opposition parties are in agreement that it 's vital to show the kremlin that khodorkovsky 's fate is being followed closely in the west and that any irregularities will draw even more criticism from leaders here . hardy graupner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans criticize khordorkovsky verdict german politicians on tuesday condemned the jailing of yukos oil founder mikhail khordorkovsky , who was convicted of fraud and tax evasion by a russian court .

we took a look at a few eu countries and their neighbors and what divides them on the issue . despite repeated efforts , europe has not been able to find a common approach to the middle east crisis .
the possibility of sending an international peacekeeping force to the region remains open , but the opinions of the various european countries and their key partners remain across the board . some countries - including france , sweden , norway , slovakia , canada , germany , turkey , italy , spain , belgium , and ireland - have already expressed a willingness to participate in an international peace effort by sending troops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : historical ties are influencing europe 's stance a ceasefire and an international mandate , however , are seen as a prerequisite for involvement , whether it takes places under the banner of nato , the un or the european union . there is hope among europeans that the middle east would also join in and contribute to a peacekeeping effort , particularly egypt . dw-world.de looked at a few of the key players in the greater european area , what is at stake for them , and why they ca n't find a common line . germany israel 's president ehud olmert said in an interview with the süddeutsche zeitung daily that he has " absolutely no problem with german soldiers in southern lebanon … .at the moment , no other nation is as friendly to israel as germany .
if germany can contribute to the security of the israeli people , this would be a rewarding task … " olmert 's expectation of german involvement rests on the tight but history-laden relationship the two countries have developed since world war ii . not only were the nazis responsible for the death of six million jews during the holocaust , the state of israel was established in 1948 as a direct response to the nazi persecution .
the international community felt obligated to secure a jewish state for the survivors . germany 's history has made it very reluctant to send soldiers into combat since world war ii . germany 's defense minister franz josef jung -lrb- cdu -rrb- has said he considers german participation in an international peacekeeping force a possibility , while chancellor angela merkel and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier -lrb- spd -rrb- are more cautious .

its army , the bundeswehr , has current obligations in other crisis areas , such as dr congo and afghanistan , and it could become increasingly difficult to convince the german population of the need to take part in the israel-lebanon crisis as well . england a traditional american ally and supporter of the iraq war , britain , along with germany , was one of the countries to call for a " cessation of hostilities " instead of an immediate ceasefire in the eu foreign ministers ' joint statement . lebanese president fuad siniora has , however , called on tony blair to advocate an immediate ceasefire , reported afp . the british government supports a gradual ceasefire , along with the united states , so that hezbollah can be weakened before the hostilities stop since the lebanese army is not as strong as the extremist group . with troops currently in iraq and afghanistan , britain 's resources are already stretched thin and it has not expressed a willingness to engage troops in lebanon or israel . turkey turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan was one of the very first heads of state to announce a willingness to send troops , wrote the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- daily .
he 's a practicing muslim himself and his government acted as a mediator between israel and hamas this spring . the country , which has been negotiating for years with the european union on future accession , has been mentioned as a possible leader in an international mission due to its proximity to the region .
however , recent statements have indicated france is more likely to lead a mission . erdogan has yet to convince the population of turkey that military involvement in the crisis would be beneficial , wrote the faz . russia russia renewed demands for an immediate end to hostilities in the middle east , reported the financial times deutschland daily .

the french government , however , has remained somewhat more hesitant , stipulating a ceasefire and an international mandate before sending troops . a commentary in le figaro daily added that israel , lebanon and the world are expecting france to head up the international force , but the country is waiting for a ceasefire . the financial times deutschland reported that france would be able to send as many as 5,000 well-equipped soldiers quickly as part of an international mission .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo is still a painful memory for the eu " we do n't necessarily dismiss involvement , but we are hesitant , " said merkel , as reported by germany news agency dpa . within germany 's political parties , opinions are split .
some see germany 's history as an obligation to participate , other see precisely that as a reason to stay out of it , wrote dw-world.de 's peter philip . history is not the only factor in germany 's hesitancy .
its army , the bundeswehr , has current obligations in other crisis areas , such as dr congo and afghanistan , and it could become increasingly difficult to convince the german population of the need to take part in the israel-lebanon crisis as well . england a traditional american ally and supporter of the iraq war , britain , along with germany , was one of the countries to call for a " cessation of hostilities " instead of an immediate ceasefire in the eu foreign ministers ' joint statement . lebanese president fuad siniora has , however , called on tony blair to advocate an immediate ceasefire , reported afp . the british government supports a gradual ceasefire , along with the united states , so that hezbollah can be weakened before the hostilities stop since the lebanese army is not as strong as the extremist group . with troops currently in iraq and afghanistan , britain 's resources are already stretched thin and it has not expressed a willingness to engage troops in lebanon or israel . turkey turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan was one of the very first heads of state to announce a willingness to send troops , wrote the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- daily .
he 's a practicing muslim himself and his government acted as a mediator between israel and hamas this spring . the country , which has been negotiating for years with the european union on future accession , has been mentioned as a possible leader in an international mission due to its proximity to the region .
however , recent statements have indicated france is more likely to lead a mission . erdogan has yet to convince the population of turkey that military involvement in the crisis would be beneficial , wrote the faz . russia russia renewed demands for an immediate end to hostilities in the middle east , reported the financial times deutschland daily .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : douste-blazy and steinmeier in rome an immediate ceasefire " is the only way to establish a foundation for a political solution , " said the director of the security council igor ivanov on friday after a meeting with saad hariri , the majority leader in the lebanese parliament , reported dpa . russia has been critical of the us , saying it is undermining the position of the un in the middle east conflict by supporting israel . " the discontentment among the countries in the -lrb- un -rrb- security council has grown recently since the us is ready to block any decision that could put pressure on israel , " russian un ambassador vitali tzurkin told the russia newspaper isvestia . russia is not a member of the european union , but is a member of the group of eight and the united nations . france french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy has announced france would participate in an international peacekeeping effort , reported the faz .
the french government , however , has remained somewhat more hesitant , stipulating a ceasefire and an international mandate before sending troops . a commentary in le figaro daily added that israel , lebanon and the world are expecting france to head up the international force , but the country is waiting for a ceasefire . the financial times deutschland reported that france would be able to send as many as 5,000 well-equipped soldiers quickly as part of an international mission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : potential members of a peacekeeping mission are waiting for a ceasefire as in the iraq war , france has taken a position staunchly opposed to the united states .
twice this week , france refused to attend un peace talks on the middle east , hoping to put pressure on the us . france is a traditional ally of lebanon , which was a mandated territory after the end of world war i , along with syria .
lebanon gained independence in 1943 when france was occupied by the nazis . italy italy 's government was voted out of office for supporting the united states in the iraq war .
it sent troops to support the international efforts in kosovo , afghanistan and iraq , though president romano prodi pulled italian soldiers out of iraq after he took office in may . foreign minister massimo d 'alema has emphasized his country 's readiness to send troops to the middle east . " italy 's unified decision -lrb- to send troops -rrb- came as a surprise because the 9-party governing coalition already had trouble agreeing on involvement in afghanistan , " wrote the faz . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de violence in the middle east click on the links to read dw-world.de 's compilation of articles on the conflict and the search for peace .

" i do n't see such a thing happening , " christian schmidt , secretary of state at the defence ministry , said in comments published in saturday 's edition of the stuttgarter zeitung newspaper . " our political possibilities are outside the military field , " he said . " i am impressed by the level of trust that the -lrb- israeli -rrb- prime minister has shown us .

" i would like german soldiers to participate , " olmert said .
" i told chancellor angela merkel that we have absolutely no problem with the presence of german troops in south lebanon , " he was quoted as saying . weight of history germany is split over the use of its army to keep apart israel and the lebanese hezbollah guerrillas , whose conflict has killed hundreds , mainly civilians , in the last three weeks . some politicians claim it would be impossible for german troops to fire on israeli forces if necessary , given germany 's persecution of europe 's jews during its nazi past . last weekend , merkel said it was unlikely that germany would send troops to the middle east as its army already participated in many operations around the world . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " germany should take part in lebanon peace-keeping mission " former israeli ambassador to germany avi primor backed the idea of german troops participating in a possible international peacekeeping mission in lebanon as long as they were not stationed on the border with israel .

the founder of the former top oil producer yukos is serving his prison sentence in siberia in very harsh conditions meant to isolate him completely from the outer world . former liberal democrat justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger who 's now a legal rights spokesperson has been following the khodorkovsky case very closely and shares the widely held opinion that the recent liquidation of the yukos firm and the way khodorkovsky is being treated are the kremlin 's retaliation for the latter 's long-standing opposition to president putin punishment for putin opposition ? " he was placed in solitary confinement several times , " leutheusser-schnarrenberger said .
" and he 's being treated in a very arbitrary way .
if he drinks his tea in the wrong place , he faces severe punishment , for instance .
and then there was the incident in which he was attacked with a knife by another inmate and injured in his face .
which goes to show that khodorkovsky is n't safe in this camp , and this is what we 're criticizing and what needs to be changed .

" calls for increased eu pressure " there are eu-wide initiatives by politicians with much stronger criticism of the kremlin 's policy , and chancellor merkel should also step up her efforts to influence putin .
because we all know that nothing happens in khodorkovsky 's camp without his knowledge and consent . " the khodorkovsky case was also reported to have been touched upon during the recent visit to germany by us president george w. bush .
he put the case in the wider context of russia 's poor human rights record and promised that he would not tire of telling putin what he did n't approve of , but he did n't think much of pillorying the russian president in public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush never tires of chiding putin in private " nobody likes to be lectured a lot .

turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan is to attend an inauguration ceremony for the proposed ilisu dam on saturday , despite continuing concerns over its impact on people living in the area .
the dam - which would be the second largest in turkey by volume of water - is to be sited on the upper tigris river , in the mainly kurdish south-east of the country .
the turkish government says the project , planned for more than two decades , will provide much-needed hydro-electric energy and jobs in a poor region .
but opponents believe it will devastate the area 's environment and cultural heritage , as well as displacing more than 50,000 people .
among hundreds of sites to be flooded would be the ancient town of hasankeyf , considered an archaeological treasure and home to at least 3,800 people .
dozens of local government ministries , community groups and ngos have formed a coalition , the initiative to keep hasankeyf alive , to oppose the dam .
in pictures : hasankeyf speaking from diyarbakir , the region 's main city , spokeswoman caglayan ayhan said people were upset they had not been consulted about a project that , if it goes ahead , could lose them their homes .
" we are really not happy about this - but no-one will listen to us , " she told the bbc news website .
" we want to show that hasankeyf and its cultural heritage is important for turkey and the world , not only the people here .
" we are not resisting development - we are just saying , does it have to be this way ? "
up to 10,000 people were expected to join a solidarity concert held at hasankeyf ahead of the symbolic ground-breaking ceremony , 100km -lrb- 60 miles -rrb- away in ilisu village .
resettlement fears the protesters ' biggest concern is what they see as inadequate plans for resettling and compensating an estimated 55,000 to 78,000 people displaced by the waters .
some 199 settlements would be affected by the dam , ms ayhan said , but the consultants who drew up the resettlement plans had had access to only limited information . "
you go to hasankeyf and you see the river and cliffs and caves - and you see an ancient site that is still alive , with people living in it " campaigner caglayan ayhan many of those displaced would be likely to head for nearby batman and diyarbakir , both of which have seen clashes between security forces and kurdish protesters in recent months .
the government plans to build a new town to re-house residents of hasankeyf - and has said it will preserve much of the site 's heritage in a " cultural park " open to tourists .
but opponents say little has changed since questions over planning and legal issues caused the project 's financial backing to collapse four years ago .
british construction firm balfour beatty and swiss bank ubs , part of the european-turkish consortium involved , pulled out amid international concerns about the project 's social and environmental impact .
ilisu dam plans dam to be located on tigris river , 45km from syrian border height 135m , measuring 1,820m along the crest predicted average annual energy generation 3.833 billion kwh capacity to hold 11 billion cubic metres of water reservoir to cover 313 sq km projected completion date 2013 source : turkish energy ministry a new consortium has now been formed , headed by austrian firm va tech hydro , but its applications for export credit guarantees from the austrian , swiss and german governments have not yet been decided .
ngos in several countries are appealing for the guarantees - given by governments to protect firms from risk in big overseas infrastructure projects - not to be granted .
heike drillisch , spokeswoman for weed , a german ngo campaigning on environmental and development issues , said the project " clearly violates all the international standards the export agencies have " .
but , she said , campaigners fear the decision will be made on political grounds , with european countries keen to access the turkish market and build good relations with ankara .
unfound treasures ?
maggie ronayne , an archaeology lecturer at the national university of ireland , galway , who has studied the area around hasankeyf since 1999 , has condemned the dam as a " weapon of mass cultural destruction " .
at risk is not only hasankeyf - thought to date back 10-12,000 years and bearing evidence of assyrian , roman , byzantine , seljuk turk and ottoman civilisations - but potentially thousands of sites yet to be discovered , she says .
she calculates only 20 % of the area to be submerged has been surveyed by archaeologists , with the government 's own estimate only at 40 % .
although hasankeyf has been protected under turkish law since 1978 , the area has been largely inaccessible because of years of conflict between government troops and kurdish separatist forces .
ms ronayne , who has been working with the charity global women 's strike , warns that the region 's many poverty-stricken women will be those to suffer most , because they may not receive compensation and will struggle to care for their families if displaced .
at stake is also the cultural heritage of the ethnic kurdish people , she said , as well as ancient muslim and christian sites .
solution ' possible ' kerim yildiz , executive director of the london-based kurdish human rights project , said it would be challenging the project in the international courts .
meanwhile , the european court of human rights agreed last month to hear an application against the dam lodged by archaeologists , journalists and lawyers , who say hasankeyf must be preserved in its natural state .
ms ayhan agrees : " you go to hasankeyf and you see the river and cliffs and caves - and you see an ancient site that is still alive , with people living in it .
it has incredible natural beauty , it 's really unique . "
she remains optimistic the campaign will save hasankeyf a second time .
" i think in a normal working democracy where people are listened to ... solutions can be found .
but it may take a while . "

historic hasankeyf will be flooded if the ilisu dam goes ahead enlarge image turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan is to attend an inauguration ceremony for the proposed ilisu dam on saturday , despite continuing concerns over its impact on people living in the area .
the dam - which would be the second largest in turkey by volume of water - is to be sited on the upper tigris river , in the mainly kurdish south-east of the country .
the turkish government says the project , planned for more than two decades , will provide much-needed hydro-electric energy and jobs in a poor region .
but opponents believe it will devastate the area 's environment and cultural heritage , as well as displacing more than 50,000 people .
among hundreds of sites to be flooded would be the ancient town of hasankeyf , considered an archaeological treasure and home to at least 3,800 people .
see map of the affected area dozens of local government ministries , community groups and ngos have formed a coalition , the initiative to keep hasankeyf alive , to oppose the dam .
in pictures : hasankeyf speaking from diyarbakir , the region 's main city , spokeswoman caglayan ayhan said people were upset they had not been consulted about a project that , if it goes ahead , could lose them their homes .
" we are really not happy about this - but no-one will listen to us , " she told the bbc news website .
" we want to show that hasankeyf and its cultural heritage is important for turkey and the world , not only the people here .
" we are not resisting development - we are just saying , does it have to be this way ? "
up to 10,000 people were expected to join a solidarity concert held at hasankeyf ahead of the symbolic ground-breaking ceremony , 100km -lrb- 60 miles -rrb- away in ilisu village .
resettlement fears the protesters ' biggest concern is what they see as inadequate plans for resettling and compensating an estimated 55,000 to 78,000 people displaced by the waters .
some 199 settlements would be affected by the dam , ms ayhan said , but the consultants who drew up the resettlement plans had had access to only limited information .
you go to hasankeyf and you see the river and cliffs and caves - and you see an ancient site that is still alive , with people living in it campaigner caglayan ayhan many of those displaced would be likely to head for nearby batman and diyarbakir , both of which have seen clashes between security forces and kurdish protesters in recent months .
the government plans to build a new town to re-house residents of hasankeyf - and has said it will preserve much of the site 's heritage in a " cultural park " open to tourists .
but opponents say little has changed since questions over planning and legal issues caused the project 's financial backing to collapse four years ago .
british construction firm balfour beatty and swiss bank ubs , part of the european-turkish consortium involved , pulled out amid international concerns about the project 's social and environmental impact .
ilisu dam plans dam to be located on tigris river , 45km from syrian border height 135m , measuring 1,820m along the crest predicted average annual energy generation 3.833 billion kwh capacity to hold 11 billion cubic metres of water reservoir to cover 313 sq km projected completion date 2013 source : turkish energy ministry a new consortium has now been formed , headed by austrian firm va tech hydro , but its applications for export credit guarantees from the austrian , swiss and german governments have not yet been decided .
ngos in several countries are appealing for the guarantees - given by governments to protect firms from risk in big overseas infrastructure projects - not to be granted .
heike drillisch , spokeswoman for weed , a german ngo campaigning on environmental and development issues , said the project " clearly violates all the international standards the export agencies have " .
but , she said , campaigners fear the decision will be made on political grounds , with european countries keen to access the turkish market and build good relations with ankara .
unfound treasures ?
maggie ronayne , an archaeology lecturer at the national university of ireland , galway , who has studied the area around hasankeyf since 1999 , has condemned the dam as a " weapon of mass cultural destruction " .
the remains of a 12th-century bridge on the tigris at hasankeyf at risk is not only hasankeyf - thought to date back 10-12,000 years and bearing evidence of assyrian , roman , byzantine , seljuk turk and ottoman civilisations - but potentially thousands of sites yet to be discovered , she says .
she calculates only 20 % of the area to be submerged has been surveyed by archaeologists , with the government 's own estimate only at 40 % .
although hasankeyf has been protected under turkish law since 1978 , the area has been largely inaccessible because of years of conflict between government troops and kurdish separatist forces .
ms ronayne , who has been working with the charity global women 's strike , warns that the region 's many poverty-stricken women will be those to suffer most , because they may not receive compensation and will struggle to care for their families if displaced .
at stake is also the cultural heritage of the ethnic kurdish people , she said , as well as ancient muslim and christian sites .
solution ' possible ' kerim yildiz , executive director of the london-based kurdish human rights project , said it would be challenging the project in the international courts .
meanwhile , the european court of human rights agreed last month to hear an application against the dam lodged by archaeologists , journalists and lawyers , who say hasankeyf must be preserved in its natural state .
ms ayhan agrees : " you go to hasankeyf and you see the river and cliffs and caves - and you see an ancient site that is still alive , with people living in it .
it has incredible natural beauty , it 's really unique . "
she remains optimistic the campaign will save hasankeyf a second time .
" i think in a normal working democracy where people are listened to ... solutions can be found .

historic hasankeyf will be flooded if the ilisu dam goes ahead enlarge image turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan is to attend an inauguration ceremony for the proposed ilisu dam on saturday , despite continuing concerns over its impact on people living in the area .
the dam - which would be the second largest in turkey by volume of water - is to be sited on the upper tigris river , in the mainly kurdish south-east of the country .
the turkish government says the project , planned for more than two decades , will provide much-needed hydro-electric energy and jobs in a poor region .
but opponents believe it will devastate the area 's environment and cultural heritage , as well as displacing more than 50,000 people .
among hundreds of sites to be flooded would be the ancient town of hasankeyf , considered an archaeological treasure and home to at least 3,800 people .
see map of the affected area dozens of local government ministries , community groups and ngos have formed a coalition , the initiative to keep hasankeyf alive , to oppose the dam .
in pictures : hasankeyf speaking from diyarbakir , the region 's main city , spokeswoman caglayan ayhan said people were upset they had not been consulted about a project that , if it goes ahead , could lose them their homes .
" we are really not happy about this - but no-one will listen to us , " she told the bbc news website .
" we want to show that hasankeyf and its cultural heritage is important for turkey and the world , not only the people here .
" we are not resisting development - we are just saying , does it have to be this way ? "
up to 10,000 people were expected to join a solidarity concert held at hasankeyf ahead of the symbolic ground-breaking ceremony , 100km -lrb- 60 miles -rrb- away in ilisu village .
resettlement fears the protesters ' biggest concern is what they see as inadequate plans for resettling and compensating an estimated 55,000 to 78,000 people displaced by the waters .
some 199 settlements would be affected by the dam , ms ayhan said , but the consultants who drew up the resettlement plans had had access to only limited information .
you go to hasankeyf and you see the river and cliffs and caves - and you see an ancient site that is still alive , with people living in it campaigner caglayan ayhan many of those displaced would be likely to head for nearby batman and diyarbakir , both of which have seen clashes between security forces and kurdish protesters in recent months .
the government plans to build a new town to re-house residents of hasankeyf - and has said it will preserve much of the site 's heritage in a " cultural park " open to tourists .
but opponents say little has changed since questions over planning and legal issues caused the project 's financial backing to collapse four years ago .
british construction firm balfour beatty and swiss bank ubs , part of the european-turkish consortium involved , pulled out amid international concerns about the project 's social and environmental impact .
ilisu dam plans dam to be located on tigris river , 45km from syrian border height 135m , measuring 1,820m along the crest predicted average annual energy generation 3.833 billion kwh capacity to hold 11 billion cubic metres of water reservoir to cover 313 sq km projected completion date 2013 source : turkish energy ministry a new consortium has now been formed , headed by austrian firm va tech hydro , but its applications for export credit guarantees from the austrian , swiss and german governments have not yet been decided .
ngos in several countries are appealing for the guarantees - given by governments to protect firms from risk in big overseas infrastructure projects - not to be granted .
heike drillisch , spokeswoman for weed , a german ngo campaigning on environmental and development issues , said the project " clearly violates all the international standards the export agencies have " .
but , she said , campaigners fear the decision will be made on political grounds , with european countries keen to access the turkish market and build good relations with ankara .
unfound treasures ?
maggie ronayne , an archaeology lecturer at the national university of ireland , galway , who has studied the area around hasankeyf since 1999 , has condemned the dam as a " weapon of mass cultural destruction " .
the remains of a 12th-century bridge on the tigris at hasankeyf at risk is not only hasankeyf - thought to date back 10-12,000 years and bearing evidence of assyrian , roman , byzantine , seljuk turk and ottoman civilisations - but potentially thousands of sites yet to be discovered , she says .
she calculates only 20 % of the area to be submerged has been surveyed by archaeologists , with the government 's own estimate only at 40 % .
although hasankeyf has been protected under turkish law since 1978 , the area has been largely inaccessible because of years of conflict between government troops and kurdish separatist forces .
ms ronayne , who has been working with the charity global women 's strike , warns that the region 's many poverty-stricken women will be those to suffer most , because they may not receive compensation and will struggle to care for their families if displaced .
at stake is also the cultural heritage of the ethnic kurdish people , she said , as well as ancient muslim and christian sites .
solution ' possible ' kerim yildiz , executive director of the london-based kurdish human rights project , said it would be challenging the project in the international courts .
meanwhile , the european court of human rights agreed last month to hear an application against the dam lodged by archaeologists , journalists and lawyers , who say hasankeyf must be preserved in its natural state .
ms ayhan agrees : " you go to hasankeyf and you see the river and cliffs and caves - and you see an ancient site that is still alive , with people living in it .
it has incredible natural beauty , it 's really unique . "
she remains optimistic the campaign will save hasankeyf a second time .
" i think in a normal working democracy where people are listened to ... solutions can be found .
but it may take a while . "

when the eisteddfod 's director elfed roberts says the eisteddfod is a process and not an event , you know he 's not coining a phrase .
for him and the dozens of local committees in the swansea valley who have exceeded their target of raising £ 300,000 and kept on going , the week long festival is the culmination of many years work and lobbying for financial support .
elfed roberts knows there are plenty of critics who question why the eisteddfod has needed to be propped up financially .
should n't it cut its cloth according to the revenue it can attract ?
he counters that few other cultural bodies - and that 's what the eisteddfod is not a welsh language festival - has come under such pressure to more than match the public money it gets .
and he 's banking on this year 's festival making a profit .
if three out of 10 festivals fail to make money , that 's a burden the organisation can carry .
if a fourth fails to hit the mark , then they 're in trouble .
the assembly government has given the eisteddfod £ 408,000 plus another £ 50,000 one-off sum .
marketing man 's dream alun pugh will be at the maes - the site - for three days this year .
he can be sure that no opportunity will be missed to argue that the £ 50,000 should be part of the festival 's basic grant .
a total £ 400,000 has been raised from private sector sponsorship , broadcasting and catering rights bring in another £ 500,000 .
the eisteddfod director is looking to make a profit a new deal with the welsh local government association has been reached to ensure support for some years to come , but all eyes will be on ticket sales .
good weather means good attendance and that means healthy ticket sales . £ 10 for adults and £ 2 for children now buys you entry not just to the maes now but also to the pavilion .
and talking about the pavilion - anyone driving past the felindre turn-off on the m4 will have seen it .
it 's bright pink .
an unusual home for competitors and chairing ceremonies but a marketing man 's dream .
insulting choice what you wo n't see are the six miles of cables underground and the four miles of water pipes .
there 's a new awareness this year that the eisteddfod , with its diesel-driven generators , could do more to minimise its effect on the environment .
there was talk of an experiment with harnessing wind power , but for this year you 'll see bio-degradable cups and an open discussion on the festival 's " carbon footprint " .
there 'll be no ceremony to welcome welsh visitors from overseas this year .
some will barely notice the change , others will be up in arms .
will there be more protests about the choice of a folk song for the groups competition - tafarn y rhos - which refers to wife-beating ?
again no doubt some will shrug their shoulders , while others protest that it 's an inappropriate and insulting choice .
for elfed roberts - who already has his sights on mold , home of next year 's festival - it 's all part of the process .

when the eisteddfod 's director elfed roberts says the eisteddfod is a process and not an event , you know he 's not coining a phrase .
for him and the dozens of local committees in the swansea valley who have exceeded their target of raising £ 300,000 and kept on going , the week long festival is the culmination of many years work and lobbying for financial support .
elfed roberts knows there are plenty of critics who question why the eisteddfod has needed to be propped up financially .
should n't it cut its cloth according to the revenue it can attract ?
he counters that few other cultural bodies - and that 's what the eisteddfod is not a welsh language festival - has come under such pressure to more than match the public money it gets .
and he 's banking on this year 's festival making a profit .
if three out of 10 festivals fail to make money , that 's a burden the organisation can carry .
if a fourth fails to hit the mark , then they 're in trouble .
the assembly government has given the eisteddfod £ 408,000 plus another £ 50,000 one-off sum .
marketing man 's dream alun pugh will be at the maes - the site - for three days this year .
he can be sure that no opportunity will be missed to argue that the £ 50,000 should be part of the festival 's basic grant .
a total £ 400,000 has been raised from private sector sponsorship , broadcasting and catering rights bring in another £ 500,000 .
a new deal with the welsh local government association has been reached to ensure support for some years to come , but all eyes will be on ticket sales .
good weather means good attendance and that means healthy ticket sales . £ 10 for adults and £ 2 for children now buys you entry not just to the maes now but also to the pavilion .
and talking about the pavilion - anyone driving past the felindre turn-off on the m4 will have seen it .
it 's bright pink .
an unusual home for competitors and chairing ceremonies but a marketing man 's dream .
insulting choice what you wo n't see are the six miles of cables underground and the four miles of water pipes .
there 's a new awareness this year that the eisteddfod , with its diesel-driven generators , could do more to minimise its effect on the environment .
there was talk of an experiment with harnessing wind power , but for this year you 'll see bio-degradable cups and an open discussion on the festival 's " carbon footprint " .
there 'll be no ceremony to welcome welsh visitors from overseas this year .
some will barely notice the change , others will be up in arms .
will there be more protests about the choice of a folk song for the groups competition - tafarn y rhos - which refers to wife-beating ?
again no doubt some will shrug their shoulders , while others protest that it 's an inappropriate and insulting choice .
for elfed roberts - who already has his sights on mold , home of next year 's festival - it 's all part of the process .

the publication , by tim berners-lee , began the spread of computer interaction that has lead to the web as we know it .
there are now 882 million people around the world online reading more than 100 million websites , and with each website offering potentially millions of pages of content .
to mark the birthday we 've drawn together a panel of web-users from across the world , to give us their thoughts on the birth , the worst , and the future of the web .
today 's question to the panel : when was the first time you ever used the internet ?
joe annapolis , usa karen prague , czech rep david tehran , iran gabriel lusaka , zambia elson campinas , brazil gail seoul , south korea click here to read the panel 's response to friday 's question have your say : how has the internet changed your life ?
joe dynamo , annapolis , usa " a friend of mine was very into pcs .
he came over one day with a card board box full of parts and we built my first computer from his spares and a new hard drive i bought .
we got an operating system on it and i managed to get it upgraded enough to run windows 3.11 , i had a game and a word processor .
i also got a really nice label and sign making program and managed to do a ton of printing for my business on it .
then my friend started with the windows 95 beta program .
i could not run anything so fancy .
i got a modem and upgraded my system over and over again .
i got on local online bulletin boards with internet links .
there was not much out there . "
i had a group of friends that i spent every waking minute with whom i had never seen " i wound up on internt relay chat - an early and still running online messaging system - downloading the first web browser i had ever seen within weeks of getting my computer running the first time .
there was almost exactly nothing on the internet then .
i had a group of friends that i spent every waking minute with whom i had never even seen .
isolated in dark rooms chatting away via text .
there is a kind of connectedness out there that is very odd .
it was very real to me and the group of people i was with .
on a good day i can still hear the computers talking to me .
there really is magic out there , if you let it happen . "
gabriel kalonde chingwe , lusaka , zambia " i travelled abroad to dublin , ireland , and london , uk , in 1999 to do a banking development course as i am a banker by profession .
i knew i needed to contact my family at home urgently throughout that time so before i left i walked into an internet cafe in lusaka and asked the attendant to help me open an account .
whilst abroad i had to get some info i forgot from home and this was sent to me without any ado !
it was a whole new experience , especially compared with the business world i came from . "
i gradually started browsing info on investment , shares , mortgages " even though the net was predominantly dial up it cut down the time drastically for me to get the information i wanted and i progressed well with my training programme .
i gradually started browsing information on investment , shares , mortgages , wall street and the financial news .
those were my first websites .
i eventually browsed about my profession and what it offers worldwide , i still do .
now my favorite sites are business , science , health , news and technology .
i am sure no one misses the news and videos of the nasa shuttle missions ! "
karen inda , prague , czech republic " trygve , my husband , was on compuserve in 1987 .

elson silva , phd , campinas , brazil " internet can let us solve easily very difficult problems .
lost causes can end up with amazing successes .
the first time i used the internet was in 1993 to bargain rainfall information allowing me to complete a set of databases enough to study the distribution of rainfall in the amazon .
i had sent five letters to my sponsoring institution in brazil , asking people there to provide me with data i was requesting for my phd .
having some data at hand , using the web i was able to find people with similar data and exchange it with them .
the web helped me develop an appropriate analytical method , to squeeze the best information from such poor data , resulting in an outstanding phd dissertation with three hypothesis and honors approval .
my cause was near lost because my college was in animal production and my masters in animal nutrition .
i was pursuing a phd degree in soil science far out of my league . "
i learned in the very beginning that nature always allows many different solutions " so , i turned to hydrology , working deeply on applied spatial analysis and toward insights that led me afterwards to a sort of ' scientific discovery ' .
without the web i could and would not have done any of this .
i am good at putting things together and i learned in the very beginning that nature always allows many different solutions to a unique problem , and the internet can only expand such potential .
afterwards , i was able to open a company in the us and my seven patents are under way , three of which are already issued and delivering important claims to bring changes that will stay forever .
i saw then that a new power of communication had begun with the web . "
david mohammad yaghoobi , tehran , iran " " what are you doing ? " asked a passing friend as i sat in a swivel chair in the university library .
" i 've been sent an image by a friend " , i smugly responded as we both glared at a screen of random characters .
" it 's one of those magic eye things , but i ca n't seem to decipher this one " , i continued .
to my embarrassment , after a few emails , i learned that the mail program was unable to read the attachment and the jargon before was simply an error .
that was in 1997 .
it had never occurred to me that one could send a digital format photograph through e-mail .
in fact , i was n't really sure what e-mail was .
initially my engagement with the internet was through my new e-mail account , which consumed too much of my first university term .
i had suddenly evolved from sending hand-written letters to friends at other universities to sending random one-liners to anyone i had an address for .
what was lost in loving attention was gained in ease . "
the thrill of learning that pixiechick78 from nevada has two cats and enjoys basketball soon wore off " " i 'm chatting to a girl from texas " , i proudly stated to another passing friend .
being able to trade nothing-conversations with a faceless-anybody over a chat-room was a revelation , invariably the conversations were short-lived as either 13-year old boys filled the screen with foul words or the " f 21 ny " mysteriously disappeared .
these pre-messenger days simply consumed time and achieved little .
the thrill of learning that pixiechick78 from nevada has two cats and enjoys basketball soon wore off .
in those early days there seemed to be little of relevance to me through netscape navigator , just brightly coloured screens with text for text 's sake .
having a website was nerdy yet oddly a great status symbol regardless of whether it did anything .
gradually , relevant sites arrived and my ability to find them increased and i eventually learned how to send a picture attachment . "
gail , seoul , south korea " i was on a computer in a restaurant in glasgow about 10 years ago .
i think we immediately looked up some of those particular sites to see if the rumours about the internet were true and were quite shocked to find that they were !
then we were a bit stumped and did n't really know what to look for so we checked some sports teams out , finished our drinks and went home feeling chuffed to have entered cyber space for the first time .
i think we knew even then that it was here to stay , but could n't really imagine what it would be like .
when we moved to brazil , the internet was really taking off and i found a job translating business news from portuguese into english for a newspaper there . "
it is amazing how integral the internet is " so that was the first time that the internet really changed my life i guess .
i even presented news bulletins on the company 's internet tv site which was good fun -lrb- and meant i got my hair done for free for a year or so ! -rrb-
it is amazing to think how integral the internet is to every aspect of our lives these days : when the tsunami happened and we lived in bangkok we did not have our tv connected in the house , so we only saw images and footage of that event on our computer . "

click here to read the panel 's response to friday 's question have your say : how has the internet changed your life ?
joe dynamo , annapolis , usa joe used to live in a school bus , now he 's an it consultant a friend of mine was very into pcs .
he came over one day with a card board box full of parts and we built my first computer from his spares and a new hard drive i bought .
we got an operating system on it and i managed to get it upgraded enough to run windows 3.11 , i had a game and a word processor .
i also got a really nice label and sign making program and managed to do a ton of printing for my business on it .
then my friend started with the windows 95 beta program .
i could not run anything so fancy .
i got a modem and upgraded my system over and over again .
i got on local online bulletin boards with internet links .
there was not much out there .
i had a group of friends that i spent every waking minute with whom i had never seen i wound up on internt relay chat - an early and still running online messaging system - downloading the first web browser i had ever seen within weeks of getting my computer running the first time .
there was almost exactly nothing on the internet then .
i had a group of friends that i spent every waking minute with whom i had never even seen .
isolated in dark rooms chatting away via text .
there is a kind of connectedness out there that is very odd .
it was very real to me and the group of people i was with .
on a good day i can still hear the computers talking to me .
there really is magic out there , if you let it happen .
click here to return gabriel kalonde chingwe , lusaka , zambia gabriel is a fan of bbc africa have your say i travelled abroad to dublin , ireland , and london , uk , in 1999 to do a banking development course as i am a banker by profession .
i knew i needed to contact my family at home urgently throughout that time so before i left i walked into an internet cafe in lusaka and asked the attendant to help me open an account .
whilst abroad i had to get some info i forgot from home and this was sent to me without any ado !
it was a whole new experience , especially compared with the business world i came from .
i gradually started browsing info on investment , shares , mortgages even though the net was predominantly dial up it cut down the time drastically for me to get the information i wanted and i progressed well with my training programme .
i gradually started browsing information on investment , shares , mortgages , wall street and the financial news .
those were my first websites .
i eventually browsed about my profession and what it offers worldwide , i still do .
now my favorite sites are business , science , health , news and technology .
i am sure no one misses the news and videos of the nasa shuttle missions !
click here to return karen inda , prague , czech republic karen and her husband run their business from laptops trygve , my husband , was on compuserve in 1987 .
back then he dialled in at 1200bps !
compuserve was all text-based and worked like many early bulletin board systems , except that it was national -lrb- and much later -rrb- international in scope .
i first used a bulletin board system in about 1995 , mostly to converse with other a-ha fans !
i did n't know anything about computers , but was thrilled to find out the latest news on my favourite band .
trygve and i met in 1996 and i started helping him with the administrative aspects of the business .
our website went online in april 1998 and we had e-commerce active by october .
it was amazing how many " new " customers wrote to us , saying they had been using our software for years , but were too lazy to send us a cheque .
with online payments , it 's much easier for people to pay and be paid .
click here to return elson silva , phd , campinas , brazil elson researches hydro- and thermo-dynamics online internet can let us solve easily very difficult problems .
lost causes can end up with amazing successes .
the first time i used the internet was in 1993 to bargain rainfall information allowing me to complete a set of databases enough to study the distribution of rainfall in the amazon .
i had sent five letters to my sponsoring institution in brazil , asking people there to provide me with data i was requesting for my phd .
having some data at hand , using the web i was able to find people with similar data and exchange it with them .
the web helped me develop an appropriate analytical method , to squeeze the best information from such poor data , resulting in an outstanding phd dissertation with three hypothesis and honors approval .
my cause was near lost because my college was in animal production and my masters in animal nutrition .
i was pursuing a phd degree in soil science far out of my league .
i learned in the very beginning that nature always allows many different solutions so , i turned to hydrology , working deeply on applied spatial analysis and toward insights that led me afterwards to a sort of ' scientific discovery ' .
without the web i could and would not have done any of this .
i am good at putting things together and i learned in the very beginning that nature always allows many different solutions to a unique problem , and the internet can only expand such potential .
afterwards , i was able to open a company in the us and my seven patents are under way , three of which are already issued and delivering important claims to bring changes that will stay forever .
i saw then that a new power of communication had begun with the web .
click here to return david mohammad yaghoobi , tehran , iran david runs a blog and a business from tehran " what are you doing ? " asked a passing friend as i sat in a swivel chair in the university library .
" i 've been sent an image by a friend " , i smugly responded as we both glared at a screen of random characters .
" it 's one of those magic eye things , but i ca n't seem to decipher this one " , i continued .
to my embarrassment , after a few emails , i learned that the mail program was unable to read the attachment and the jargon before was simply an error .
that was in 1997 .
it had never occurred to me that one could send a digital format photograph through e-mail .
in fact , i was n't really sure what e-mail was .
initially my engagement with the internet was through my new e-mail account , which consumed too much of my first university term .
i had suddenly evolved from sending hand-written letters to friends at other universities to sending random one-liners to anyone i had an address for .
what was lost in loving attention was gained in ease .
the thrill of learning that pixiechick78 from nevada has two cats and enjoys basketball soon wore off " i 'm chatting to a girl from texas " , i proudly stated to another passing friend .
being able to trade nothing-conversations with a faceless-anybody over a chat-room was a revelation , invariably the conversations were short-lived as either 13-year old boys filled the screen with foul words or the " f 21 ny " mysteriously disappeared .
these pre-messenger days simply consumed time and achieved little .
the thrill of learning that pixiechick78 from nevada has two cats and enjoys basketball soon wore off .
in those early days there seemed to be little of relevance to me through netscape navigator , just brightly coloured screens with text for text 's sake .
having a website was nerdy yet oddly a great status symbol regardless of whether it did anything .
gradually , relevant sites arrived and my ability to find them increased and i eventually learned how to send a picture attachment .
click here to return gail , seoul , south korea gail is a lifestyle and travel writer , based in seoul i was on a computer in a restaurant in glasgow about 10 years ago .
i think we immediately looked up some of those particular sites to see if the rumours about the internet were true and were quite shocked to find that they were !
then we were a bit stumped and did n't really know what to look for so we checked some sports teams out , finished our drinks and went home feeling chuffed to have entered cyber space for the first time .
i think we knew even then that it was here to stay , but could n't really imagine what it would be like .
when we moved to brazil , the internet was really taking off and i found a job translating business news from portuguese into english for a newspaper there .
it is amazing how integral the internet is so that was the first time that the internet really changed my life i guess .
i even presented news bulletins on the company 's internet tv site which was good fun -lrb- and meant i got my hair done for free for a year or so ! -rrb-
it is amazing to think how integral the internet is to every aspect of our lives these days : when the tsunami happened and we lived in bangkok we did not have our tv connected in the house , so we only saw images and footage of that event on our computer .
