" companies want practical , technical knowledge that goes well beyond what you get in school , " said meilgen , who took at position at lvq-wp in the industrial ruhr region of western germany after defending his thesis at kaiserslautern 's technical university this month .

there is already a general agreement that children from migrant families should be given extra help in schools to develop their german language schools but the citizenship test question is another matter . böhmer 's draft test , which will be presented and debated in government , is designed along the lines of citizenship courses in the united states to " help those who want to become naturalized germans " by teaching and testing migrants on the german constitution , the history of the country but while " remaining sympathetic to their own values . " " the united states gives courses in the constitution , the history , culture and the values of the country , " she said .
" since those who come here do n't only want to live and work in germany but to become german , we should give them as much help as possible . " ehrhart körting , from berlin 's interior ministry , is one of those who , in theory , is in favor of the tests although he sees very little point in asking those immigrants who have lived in germany for ten to 15 years to take the test .
" the main focus should be on integration courses for new immigrants coming into the country for the first time , " he told reporters recently . critics want viable alternatives to citizenship tests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some politicians feel that an alternative to courses should be found rhineland-palatinate 's minister of the interior karl peter bruch is one who will oppose the tests .
" we will not have such a test , " the social democrat minister assured .
bruch is not against reasonable alternatives , he stressed , where a person is interviewed on whether they " respect the constitution and the democratic processes of germany " and fully supports the improvement of language courses . there is certainly a deficit in the language tuition of migrant children , something maria böhmer wants to address .
she believes that every euro invested in improving language courses will be paid back several times by well-equipped and integrated members of society contributing to the economy . böhmer sees the future of integration in germany also taking the form of more educational opportunities and employment chances for youngsters from migrant families .
she admits to casting envious glances over the border to france where there is a charter designed to give young migrant workers the chance to find work . " i have had conversations with trade associations , and i am now involved in bringing the subject of migration into the sphere of the large companies in germany , " böhmer said .

everything must be done , he said , to develop the understanding between faiths and to do everything to prevent parallel societies . böhmer agrees that cultural and religious understanding is an integral part of the integration question : " we in our very secularized world should consider what religion actually means to others , what honor is reserved for religious symbols and what level of sensitivity we must adopt when dealing with people with very strong religious beliefs .

there is already a general agreement that children from migrant families should be given extra help in schools to develop their german language schools but the citizenship test question is another matter . böhmer 's draft test , which will be presented and debated in government , is designed along the lines of citizenship courses in the united states to " help those who want to become naturalized germans " by teaching and testing migrants on the german constitution , the history of the country but while " remaining sympathetic to their own values . " " the united states gives courses in the constitution , the history , culture and the values of the country , " she said .
" since those who come here do n't only want to live and work in germany but to become german , we should give them as much help as possible . " ehrhart körting , from berlin 's interior ministry , is one of those who , in theory , is in favor of the tests although he sees very little point in asking those immigrants who have lived in germany for ten to 15 years to take the test .
" the main focus should be on integration courses for new immigrants coming into the country for the first time , " he told reporters recently . critics want viable alternatives to citizenship tests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some politicians feel that an alternative to courses should be found rhineland-palatinate 's minister of the interior karl peter bruch is one who will oppose the tests .
" we will not have such a test , " the social democrat minister assured .
bruch is not against reasonable alternatives , he stressed , where a person is interviewed on whether they " respect the constitution and the democratic processes of germany " and fully supports the improvement of language courses . there is certainly a deficit in the language tuition of migrant children , something maria böhmer wants to address .
she believes that every euro invested in improving language courses will be paid back several times by well-equipped and integrated members of society contributing to the economy . böhmer sees the future of integration in germany also taking the form of more educational opportunities and employment chances for youngsters from migrant families .
she admits to casting envious glances over the border to france where there is a charter designed to give young migrant workers the chance to find work . " i have had conversations with trade associations , and i am now involved in bringing the subject of migration into the sphere of the large companies in germany , " böhmer said .
" in france , large enterprises are obliged to give youngsters with a migrant background the chance to learn a profession .
this is a good model . " language and cultural lessons to preven parallel societies christoph böhr from the cdu wants german language tuition to begin at preschool level and for migrant children to have tests before they move on into the school system .
böher also wants parents whose children do not take part to face a penalty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education is seen as an important bridge between cultures christian social union secretary general markus söder has also called for islamic religious lesson to be included in the general syllabus .
everything must be done , he said , to develop the understanding between faiths and to do everything to prevent parallel societies . böhmer agrees that cultural and religious understanding is an integral part of the integration question : " we in our very secularized world should consider what religion actually means to others , what honor is reserved for religious symbols and what level of sensitivity we must adopt when dealing with people with very strong religious beliefs .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.02.2006 more diesels needed in land of goethe and schiller großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany could fall behind unless more students become interested in engineering germany is suffering from a lack of 15,000 engineers .
making the profession more appealing could be a boon for german companies and help boost the economy , according to one of the country 's engineering groups . though christoph meilgen had to face rejection letters similar to those seen by germany 's five million unemployed , his doctorate in mechanical engineering helped him into a position many unemployed dream of : being able to turn down two positions and hold out for a job he wanted . " companies want practical , technical knowledge that goes well beyond what you get in school , " said meilgen , who took at position at lvq-wp in the industrial ruhr region of western germany after defending his thesis at kaiserslautern 's technical university this month .
" but there 's a need for engineers , you do n't need to take any offer . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finding research engineers is already difficult for many companies meilgen 's position is not an unusual one for recent graduates with engineering credentials .
seventy-three percent of middle-sized german companies said they see finding qualified employees as their most demanding task for the next five years , according to a february poll by tns infratest . germany 's position as a technological leader could be in danger if companies are n't able to find skilled new hires , according to michael schwartz , a spokesperson for the association of german engineers -lrb- vdi -rrb- . " germany today is lacking 15,000 engineers , 11,500 in small and middle-sized business alone , " he said .
" the difficulties many research and development companies are having filling positions could impair or even hold off innovation . " program encourages more students to " make things " after watching the number of students entering engineering fields drop 12 percent since a high of 87,542 in 2003 , the vdi , along with a group of 44 partners , including deutsche welle as a media partner , decided to start an initiative called sachen machen -lrb- make things -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : men make up nearly 84 percent of students in technical fields financed by the vdi and its partners , the program , slated to last at least five years , has set itself the goal of making germany the home of new technology by 2015 by achieving the world 's per capita leader in graduates with math , technical , it and natural science degrees ; employees in research and development ; research spending and patent registration . " we can not afford not to be successful , " schwarz said , referring to the program 's goal of boosting interest in technical fields among students and optimizing cooperation between science and businesses .
" if there are no new comers to fill the positions , products and services wo n't be able to be offered . " some engineers still ca n't find work that 's an argument germany 's 64,000 unemployed engineers do n't understand .
a number of factors are keeping these engineers from finding work , according to the german federal labor office 's beate raabe . " many of the unemployed are over 50 and some companies have the preconception that they do not have the most up-to-date technical knowledge , " she said in an interview with münchner merkur newspaper . while companies are looking for mechanical and electrical engineers , the market for architects and civil engineers is saturated , creating a mismatch between what they can offer and what is needed , schwarz added . employment affects more than just engineers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : engineers ' higher pay means more money to spend in stores the ones that do find a job can usually look forward to above-average salaries .
while recent graduate meilgen declined to say how much he would earn at his new job , starting salaries range from 30,000 euros to 45,000 euros -lrb- $ 35,938 to $ 53,908 -rrb- .
more experienced employees average 65,000 euros a year , according to vdi statistics . in 2003 , the most recently recorded year , the average german employee earned 26,700 euros , according to germany 's federal statistics office . the social benefits of getting open engineering positions filled could be a windfall for germany 's sluggish economy and languishing labor market , schwarz added . newly employed engineers along with their above-average paychecks and buying power typically have the potential to create 2.3 additional jobs in other fields , including production and retail , theoretically leading to 35,000 new jobs if the vdi 's estimate of 15,000 open engineering positions were filled . germans critical of innovation made in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans rank their own innovativeness below that of japan and the us other than getting jobs filled , one of sachen machen 's most difficult tasks will be convincing germans of their country 's abilities , which many foreign countries already recognize . despite having registered more patents than any other european country , a 2004 vdi survey showed only 6 percent of germans ranked their native land as the most innovative .
japan and the united states respectively scored 40 percent and 21 percent . internationally , however , germany 's engineers continue to enjoy the positive reputation earned on the back of names like mercedes , zeiss and siemens .
a 2005 study by ernst & young reported that 28 percent of international companies surveyed ranked german employees as europe 's most qualified . " we can not be cheaper than the workers in china , india or eastern europe , but we can be better , " sepp heckmann , chairman of deutsche messe said at sachen machen 's opening press conference at the beginning of february .

the use of foreign words in german is nothing new , but more and more anglicisms are creeping in , upsetting some language mavens .
the new " living german " campaign advocates finding german equivalents of english words . to the initiators of the campaign , words like cou n tdow n , shareholder value and homepage are unnecessary .
not in english , where they are at home , but in german , where they are used more frequently by german speakers . the " living german " campaign wants germans to use german words for these ideas , and not depend on english imports , which , they say , many people simply do n't understand .
and , to top it off , many are simply " ugly , " according to those supporting the campaign . instead of shareholder value , why not use the good old teutonic aktio n ärs n utze n ?
instead of the internet-age homepage , why not startseite ?
it does use a borrowed english word , " start , " but it 's well-known in germany and is short , pithy and to the point , making it acceptable to the language watchdogs . " we affirm the enriching of german through foreign languages and we even welcome certain imports from english , " said the campaign 's organizers in a statement .
" our initiative is aimed only against anglomania , against excess . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another anglicism ?
some germans are throwing their hands in the air the language experts who are spearheading this attempt to clean up the german tongue - author wolf schneider , german teachers ' association president josef kraus and head of the german language association walter krämer - insist they are not being fuddy-duddies who want to take german back to some utopian " purity . "
they simply want language to serve the function it is meant to , communication . they point to a 2003 study that looked at whether germans actually understood 12 english expressions that were used by german companies in their marketing or advertising materials .
the results were not promising ; a maximum of 59 percent understood what the companies were trying to get across .
for some expressions , a full 90 percent of germans had no idea what was being talked about . lo n g history attempts to weed foreignisms from german go back centuries .
in the early 1500s , there were already battles to keep latin , french and english expressions out of the language , with very mixed results . in 1617 , on the eve of the thirty years ' war , a patriotic society was founded that sought to preserve the " manful german hero 's tongue " against the influence of french , because german would n't tolerate " anything womanly . " some , if not all , of the efforts of this particular germanizing purge had some staying power , such as auge n blick instead of mome n t , rechtsschreibu n g in place of orthographie , and tagebuch for jour n al .
all of these are common german words today . cool … or just embarrassi n g ? today , french is no longer the bad guy , but english .
to many germans , especially younger ones , english is cool , and they pepper their speech with as much english as possible .
marketers and advertising executives also wanted to project a cool , modern image , and thought english would be a perfect vehicle for that . the results of this public english usage by non-native speakers are sometimes cheesy , sometimes baffling , and according to those behind " living german , " unnecessary .
german can stand on its own two feet , they say , and proudly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the campaign says german has enough of its own words to get along in most situations , thank you very much " we should stop being embarrassed by the german language , " their manifesto proclaims .

the use of foreign words in german is nothing new , but more and more anglicisms are creeping in , upsetting some language mavens .
the new " living german " campaign advocates finding german equivalents of english words . to the initiators of the campaign , words like cou n tdow n , shareholder value and homepage are unnecessary .
not in english , where they are at home , but in german , where they are used more frequently by german speakers . the " living german " campaign wants germans to use german words for these ideas , and not depend on english imports , which , they say , many people simply do n't understand .
and , to top it off , many are simply " ugly , " according to those supporting the campaign . instead of shareholder value , why not use the good old teutonic aktio n ärs n utze n ?
instead of the internet-age homepage , why not startseite ?
it does use a borrowed english word , " start , " but it 's well-known in germany and is short , pithy and to the point , making it acceptable to the language watchdogs . " we affirm the enriching of german through foreign languages and we even welcome certain imports from english , " said the campaign 's organizers in a statement .
" our initiative is aimed only against anglomania , against excess . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another anglicism ?
some germans are throwing their hands in the air the language experts who are spearheading this attempt to clean up the german tongue - author wolf schneider , german teachers ' association president josef kraus and head of the german language association walter krämer - insist they are not being fuddy-duddies who want to take german back to some utopian " purity . "
they simply want language to serve the function it is meant to , communication . they point to a 2003 study that looked at whether germans actually understood 12 english expressions that were used by german companies in their marketing or advertising materials .
the results were not promising ; a maximum of 59 percent understood what the companies were trying to get across .
for some expressions , a full 90 percent of germans had no idea what was being talked about . lo n g history attempts to weed foreignisms from german go back centuries .
in the early 1500s , there were already battles to keep latin , french and english expressions out of the language , with very mixed results . in 1617 , on the eve of the thirty years ' war , a patriotic society was founded that sought to preserve the " manful german hero 's tongue " against the influence of french , because german would n't tolerate " anything womanly . " some , if not all , of the efforts of this particular germanizing purge had some staying power , such as auge n blick instead of mome n t , rechtsschreibu n g in place of orthographie , and tagebuch for jour n al .
all of these are common german words today . cool … or just embarrassi n g ? today , french is no longer the bad guy , but english .
to many germans , especially younger ones , english is cool , and they pepper their speech with as much english as possible .
marketers and advertising executives also wanted to project a cool , modern image , and thought english would be a perfect vehicle for that . the results of this public english usage by non-native speakers are sometimes cheesy , sometimes baffling , and according to those behind " living german , " unnecessary .
german can stand on its own two feet , they say , and proudly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the campaign says german has enough of its own words to get along in most situations , thank you very much " we should stop being embarrassed by the german language , " their manifesto proclaims .
" it is one of the major cultural languages of the west , the largest language in the european union and after english and spanish , the most popular foreign language in the world . " the campaign plans on choosing three widely used anglicisms per month and asking the public to suggesting german equivalents .
teutonic versions of homepage and shareholder value were relatively easy to come by .
but cou n tdow n , word number three of the campaign 's first month , is proving a difficult nut to crack . up to now , no one has come up with a good german equivalent of the word , at least not one that is short , pithy and to the point .
duden , germany 's best-known dictionary , defines cou n tdow n as " a count that proceeds backwards toward the number zero for the initiation of an order to start . " does n't exactly trip off the tongue . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german-only school wins national prize a secondary school in berlin has decided to ban turkish and other foreign languages spoken by its pupils in an attempt to improve german language skills at the immigrant-dominated facility .

there is already a general agreement that children from migrant families should be given extra help in schools to develop their german language schools but the citizenship test question is another matter . böhmer 's draft test , which will be presented and debated in government , is designed along the lines of citizenship courses in the united states to " help those who want to become naturalized germans " by teaching and testing migrants on the german constitution , the history of the country but while " remaining sympathetic to their own values . " " the united states gives courses in the constitution , the history , culture and the values of the country , " she said .
" since those who come here do n't only want to live and work in germany but to become german , we should give them as much help as possible . " ehrhart körting , from berlin 's interior ministry , is one of those who , in theory , is in favor of the tests although he sees very little point in asking those immigrants who have lived in germany for ten to 15 years to take the test .
" the main focus should be on integration courses for new immigrants coming into the country for the first time , " he told reporters recently . critics want viable alternatives to citizenship tests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some politicians feel that an alternative to courses should be found rhineland-palatinate 's minister of the interior karl peter bruch is one who will oppose the tests .
" we will not have such a test , " the social democrat minister assured .
bruch is not against reasonable alternatives , he stressed , where a person is interviewed on whether they " respect the constitution and the democratic processes of germany " and fully supports the improvement of language courses . there is certainly a deficit in the language tuition of migrant children , something maria böhmer wants to address .
she believes that every euro invested in improving language courses will be paid back several times by well-equipped and integrated members of society contributing to the economy . böhmer sees the future of integration in germany also taking the form of more educational opportunities and employment chances for youngsters from migrant families .
she admits to casting envious glances over the border to france where there is a charter designed to give young migrant workers the chance to find work . " i have had conversations with trade associations , and i am now involved in bringing the subject of migration into the sphere of the large companies in germany , " böhmer said .
" in france , large enterprises are obliged to give youngsters with a migrant background the chance to learn a profession .
this is a good model . " language and cultural lessons to preven parallel societies christoph böhr from the cdu wants german language tuition to begin at preschool level and for migrant children to have tests before they move on into the school system .

everything must be done , he said , to develop the understanding between faiths and to do everything to prevent parallel societies . böhmer agrees that cultural and religious understanding is an integral part of the integration question : " we in our very secularized world should consider what religion actually means to others , what honor is reserved for religious symbols and what level of sensitivity we must adopt when dealing with people with very strong religious beliefs .

making the profession more appealing could be a boon for german companies and help boost the economy , according to one of the country 's engineering groups . though christoph meilgen had to face rejection letters similar to those seen by germany 's five million unemployed , his doctorate in mechanical engineering helped him into a position many unemployed dream of : being able to turn down two positions and hold out for a job he wanted . " companies want practical , technical knowledge that goes well beyond what you get in school , " said meilgen , who took at position at lvq-wp in the industrial ruhr region of western germany after defending his thesis at kaiserslautern 's technical university this month .
" but there 's a need for engineers , you do n't need to take any offer . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finding research engineers is already difficult for many companies meilgen 's position is not an unusual one for recent graduates with engineering credentials .
seventy-three percent of middle-sized german companies said they see finding qualified employees as their most demanding task for the next five years , according to a february poll by tns infratest . germany 's position as a technological leader could be in danger if companies are n't able to find skilled new hires , according to michael schwartz , a spokesperson for the association of german engineers -lrb- vdi -rrb- . " germany today is lacking 15,000 engineers , 11,500 in small and middle-sized business alone , " he said .
" the difficulties many research and development companies are having filling positions could impair or even hold off innovation . " program encourages more students to " make things " after watching the number of students entering engineering fields drop 12 percent since a high of 87,542 in 2003 , the vdi , along with a group of 44 partners , including deutsche welle as a media partner , decided to start an initiative called sachen machen -lrb- make things -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : men make up nearly 84 percent of students in technical fields financed by the vdi and its partners , the program , slated to last at least five years , has set itself the goal of making germany the home of new technology by 2015 by achieving the world 's per capita leader in graduates with math , technical , it and natural science degrees ; employees in research and development ; research spending and patent registration . " we can not afford not to be successful , " schwarz said , referring to the program 's goal of boosting interest in technical fields among students and optimizing cooperation between science and businesses .
" if there are no new comers to fill the positions , products and services wo n't be able to be offered . " some engineers still ca n't find work that 's an argument germany 's 64,000 unemployed engineers do n't understand .
a number of factors are keeping these engineers from finding work , according to the german federal labor office 's beate raabe . " many of the unemployed are over 50 and some companies have the preconception that they do not have the most up-to-date technical knowledge , " she said in an interview with münchner merkur newspaper . while companies are looking for mechanical and electrical engineers , the market for architects and civil engineers is saturated , creating a mismatch between what they can offer and what is needed , schwarz added . employment affects more than just engineers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : engineers ' higher pay means more money to spend in stores the ones that do find a job can usually look forward to above-average salaries .
while recent graduate meilgen declined to say how much he would earn at his new job , starting salaries range from 30,000 euros to 45,000 euros -lrb- $ 35,938 to $ 53,908 -rrb- .
more experienced employees average 65,000 euros a year , according to vdi statistics . in 2003 , the most recently recorded year , the average german employee earned 26,700 euros , according to germany 's federal statistics office . the social benefits of getting open engineering positions filled could be a windfall for germany 's sluggish economy and languishing labor market , schwarz added . newly employed engineers along with their above-average paychecks and buying power typically have the potential to create 2.3 additional jobs in other fields , including production and retail , theoretically leading to 35,000 new jobs if the vdi 's estimate of 15,000 open engineering positions were filled . germans critical of innovation made in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans rank their own innovativeness below that of japan and the us other than getting jobs filled , one of sachen machen 's most difficult tasks will be convincing germans of their country 's abilities , which many foreign countries already recognize . despite having registered more patents than any other european country , a 2004 vdi survey showed only 6 percent of germans ranked their native land as the most innovative .
japan and the united states respectively scored 40 percent and 21 percent . internationally , however , germany 's engineers continue to enjoy the positive reputation earned on the back of names like mercedes , zeiss and siemens .
a 2005 study by ernst & young reported that 28 percent of international companies surveyed ranked german employees as europe 's most qualified . " we can not be cheaper than the workers in china , india or eastern europe , but we can be better , " sepp heckmann , chairman of deutsche messe said at sachen machen 's opening press conference at the beginning of february .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.02.2006 politicians want migrants to be put to the test großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians will discuss whether us-style citizenship courses will aid integration the german government will again debate the possibility of nationwide citizenship tests for migrants in a special bundestag session monday . the hope is that politicians can agree on a program that will avoid the controversy that a migrant exam prototype in the state of baden-württemberg caused when it was proposed earlier this year . maria böhmer , the christian democratic union minister who was recently installed as the government 's point person for integration policy , is hopeful that some consensus can be found in discussions this week .
there is already a general agreement that children from migrant families should be given extra help in schools to develop their german language schools but the citizenship test question is another matter . böhmer 's draft test , which will be presented and debated in government , is designed along the lines of citizenship courses in the united states to " help those who want to become naturalized germans " by teaching and testing migrants on the german constitution , the history of the country but while " remaining sympathetic to their own values . " " the united states gives courses in the constitution , the history , culture and the values of the country , " she said .
" since those who come here do n't only want to live and work in germany but to become german , we should give them as much help as possible . " ehrhart körting , from berlin 's interior ministry , is one of those who , in theory , is in favor of the tests although he sees very little point in asking those immigrants who have lived in germany for ten to 15 years to take the test .
" the main focus should be on integration courses for new immigrants coming into the country for the first time , " he told reporters recently . critics want viable alternatives to citizenship tests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some politicians feel that an alternative to courses should be found rhineland-palatinate 's minister of the interior karl peter bruch is one who will oppose the tests .
" we will not have such a test , " the social democrat minister assured .
bruch is not against reasonable alternatives , he stressed , where a person is interviewed on whether they " respect the constitution and the democratic processes of germany " and fully supports the improvement of language courses . there is certainly a deficit in the language tuition of migrant children , something maria böhmer wants to address .
she believes that every euro invested in improving language courses will be paid back several times by well-equipped and integrated members of society contributing to the economy . böhmer sees the future of integration in germany also taking the form of more educational opportunities and employment chances for youngsters from migrant families .
she admits to casting envious glances over the border to france where there is a charter designed to give young migrant workers the chance to find work . " i have had conversations with trade associations , and i am now involved in bringing the subject of migration into the sphere of the large companies in germany , " böhmer said .
" in france , large enterprises are obliged to give youngsters with a migrant background the chance to learn a profession .

but critics are n't impressed . there was standing room only in the conference room at the hyatt hotel in downtown berlin on saturday afternoon as the cast of the much-awaited german competition entry " elementary particles " appeared to talk to the international media after the first screening of the film . " it 's often said that the german film scene does n't have any stars , but the podium here shows that is n't true , " said the moderator of the press conference as flash bulbs popped incessantly and the crush of journalists thrust a sea of microphones and tv cameras at the stage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from right , moritz bleibtreu , franka potente and nina hoss indeed , the line-up of " elementary particles " reads like a who 's who of german cinema .
starring moritz bleibtreu and franka potente -lrb- both of " run lola run " fame -rrb- , christian ulmen , martina gedeck and nina hoss -lrb- all household names in germany -rrb- , the movie is based on the eponymous book by french author michel houellebecq .
it 's directed by german director oskar roehler and produced by bernd eichinger -lrb- " the downfall " -rrb- . houellebecq 's book , published in 1998 , polarized opinion with its nihilistic view of the world , soulless sex and savage attacks against individualism , commercialization and the idealism of the 1968 generation . depressing and cynical the work , which caused an uproar in france , became a bestseller in europe and made houellebecq a literary star .
in germany , the book , with its mix of nietzschean philosophy , scientific experiment , pornographic scenes and jaded bitterness , became something of a sensation . over 80,000 hard-cover versions and 150,000 paperbacks were sold in germany as at least a dozen theaters toyed with the idea of turning it into a play . the movie reflects the bleakness of the book in the form of two half brothers bruno -lrb- bleibtreu -rrb- , a sex-obsessed school teacher who is n't so lucky with women in real life , and michel -lrb- ulmen -rrb- , a brilliant and inhibited molecular biologist who 's researching human cloning and has never slept with a woman .
both have gotten to know each other during their teenage years after their hippie mother -lrb- played by nina hoss -rrb- leaves them in the care of their grandmother and heads off to india to revel in sex , drugs and rock ' n ' roll . the film , which deals with bruno and michel 's frustration with life and women , is ultimately a quest by the brothers to find love in their own ways . film more conciliatory unlike the book , the film is much more conciliatory in tone , with both finding the right women at the end .
it also avoids much of the radicalism and repugnance that made the novel such a sensation . michel is reunited with his childhood friend annabelle -lrb- played by potente -rrb- , and bruno finds love , albeit temporarily , in the form of christiane -lrb- gedeck -rrb- , who he gets to know at a nudist spiritual camp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roehler admits he 's toned down the on-screen adaptation of elementary particles director oskar roehler said he could relate to houellebecq 's pessimism . " the question of whether it 's filmable or not , was n't important for me .
it simply fascinated me , " roehler said , adding that he saw himself as something of a pessimist too .
" forced optimism in the face of the current social situation is strange to me , " said the director , who took five years to make the movie . at the same time , roehler admitted that the film deliberately steers clear of the extreme darkness of the book . " i find it interesting to show what people do when they are in deep shit , " said roehler .
" but the completely fatalistic tone of the book could n't be just taken over , " roehler said .
" houellebecq gives us a key to understanding society that i find absolutely brilliant , " roehler said . " but i did n't want to take over houellebecq 's moral .
we did n't want to leave our protagonists in the lurch .
our film does n't deny faith in mankind . " producer bernd eichinger pointed out that the whole point had been to present an overall impression of houellebecq 's work .
" you ca n't film social criticism , only melodramas , " eichinger said . " huge testimony to love " of all the actors present on stage , martina gedeck - who plays bruno 's true love christiane , a sexually-uninhibited woman secretly battling a serious illness - was the most enthusiastic about the film . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martina gedeck and moritz bleibtreu " christiane has no sentimental expectations .
she 's a good loser and how she and bruno find each other is a huge testimony to love , " gedeck said . frank potente , who became known to international audiences as the sprinting redhead in " run lola run " and also starred in " the bourne identity " alongside matt damon , said she was excited about being represented at the competition category of the berlinale for the first time .
potente delivers a somewhat wooden performance in " elementary particles " as annabelle , a 30-plus lonely librarian in berlin . critics slam film despite its overwhelming star appeal , the film has largely received poor reviews in germany . the berlin-based newspaper die welt called the film " really straight , almost drab , " saying the punch was missing .
" the most trenchant scenes have been removed , others rendered harmless , the whole thing generally toned down .
houellebecq has been given some really gentle treatment . " " the most impressive thing about ' elementary particles ' is nina hoss ' face mask , " wrote news magazine der spiegel , referring to hoss ' decay as she lies on her death bed in one scene , her aged face mottled with bulging veins . " houllebecq , the cynic , drove his protagonists into the abyss with glee .
roehler , the director , on the other hand has sympathy with his characters , " it wrote . " all that the spectator is left with is the recognition that you ca n't film ' elementary particles ' .

" but the completely fatalistic tone of the book could n't be just taken over , " roehler said .
" houellebecq gives us a key to understanding society that i find absolutely brilliant , " roehler said . " but i did n't want to take over houellebecq 's moral .
we did n't want to leave our protagonists in the lurch .

but critics are n't impressed . there was standing room only in the conference room at the hyatt hotel in downtown berlin on saturday afternoon as the cast of the much-awaited german competition entry " elementary particles " appeared to talk to the international media after the first screening of the film . " it 's often said that the german film scene does n't have any stars , but the podium here shows that is n't true , " said the moderator of the press conference as flash bulbs popped incessantly and the crush of journalists thrust a sea of microphones and tv cameras at the stage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from right , moritz bleibtreu , franka potente and nina hoss indeed , the line-up of " elementary particles " reads like a who 's who of german cinema .
starring moritz bleibtreu and franka potente -lrb- both of " run lola run " fame -rrb- , christian ulmen , martina gedeck and nina hoss -lrb- all household names in germany -rrb- , the movie is based on the eponymous book by french author michel houellebecq .
it 's directed by german director oskar roehler and produced by bernd eichinger -lrb- " the downfall " -rrb- . houellebecq 's book , published in 1998 , polarized opinion with its nihilistic view of the world , soulless sex and savage attacks against individualism , commercialization and the idealism of the 1968 generation . depressing and cynical the work , which caused an uproar in france , became a bestseller in europe and made houellebecq a literary star .
in germany , the book , with its mix of nietzschean philosophy , scientific experiment , pornographic scenes and jaded bitterness , became something of a sensation . over 80,000 hard-cover versions and 150,000 paperbacks were sold in germany as at least a dozen theaters toyed with the idea of turning it into a play . the movie reflects the bleakness of the book in the form of two half brothers bruno -lrb- bleibtreu -rrb- , a sex-obsessed school teacher who is n't so lucky with women in real life , and michel -lrb- ulmen -rrb- , a brilliant and inhibited molecular biologist who 's researching human cloning and has never slept with a woman .
both have gotten to know each other during their teenage years after their hippie mother -lrb- played by nina hoss -rrb- leaves them in the care of their grandmother and heads off to india to revel in sex , drugs and rock ' n ' roll . the film , which deals with bruno and michel 's frustration with life and women , is ultimately a quest by the brothers to find love in their own ways . film more conciliatory unlike the book , the film is much more conciliatory in tone , with both finding the right women at the end .
it also avoids much of the radicalism and repugnance that made the novel such a sensation . michel is reunited with his childhood friend annabelle -lrb- played by potente -rrb- , and bruno finds love , albeit temporarily , in the form of christiane -lrb- gedeck -rrb- , who he gets to know at a nudist spiritual camp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roehler admits he 's toned down the on-screen adaptation of elementary particles director oskar roehler said he could relate to houellebecq 's pessimism .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 13.02.2006 new campaign seeks to calm germans ' anglomania großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will he grow up speaking german or some strange hybrid tongue ?
the use of foreign words in german is nothing new , but more and more anglicisms are creeping in , upsetting some language mavens .
the new " living german " campaign advocates finding german equivalents of english words . to the initiators of the campaign , words like cou n tdow n , shareholder value and homepage are unnecessary .
not in english , where they are at home , but in german , where they are used more frequently by german speakers . the " living german " campaign wants germans to use german words for these ideas , and not depend on english imports , which , they say , many people simply do n't understand .
and , to top it off , many are simply " ugly , " according to those supporting the campaign . instead of shareholder value , why not use the good old teutonic aktio n ärs n utze n ?
instead of the internet-age homepage , why not startseite ?
it does use a borrowed english word , " start , " but it 's well-known in germany and is short , pithy and to the point , making it acceptable to the language watchdogs . " we affirm the enriching of german through foreign languages and we even welcome certain imports from english , " said the campaign 's organizers in a statement .
" our initiative is aimed only against anglomania , against excess . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another anglicism ?
some germans are throwing their hands in the air the language experts who are spearheading this attempt to clean up the german tongue - author wolf schneider , german teachers ' association president josef kraus and head of the german language association walter krämer - insist they are not being fuddy-duddies who want to take german back to some utopian " purity . "
they simply want language to serve the function it is meant to , communication . they point to a 2003 study that looked at whether germans actually understood 12 english expressions that were used by german companies in their marketing or advertising materials .
the results were not promising ; a maximum of 59 percent understood what the companies were trying to get across .
for some expressions , a full 90 percent of germans had no idea what was being talked about . lo n g history attempts to weed foreignisms from german go back centuries .
in the early 1500s , there were already battles to keep latin , french and english expressions out of the language , with very mixed results . in 1617 , on the eve of the thirty years ' war , a patriotic society was founded that sought to preserve the " manful german hero 's tongue " against the influence of french , because german would n't tolerate " anything womanly . " some , if not all , of the efforts of this particular germanizing purge had some staying power , such as auge n blick instead of mome n t , rechtsschreibu n g in place of orthographie , and tagebuch for jour n al .
all of these are common german words today . cool … or just embarrassi n g ? today , french is no longer the bad guy , but english .
to many germans , especially younger ones , english is cool , and they pepper their speech with as much english as possible .
marketers and advertising executives also wanted to project a cool , modern image , and thought english would be a perfect vehicle for that . the results of this public english usage by non-native speakers are sometimes cheesy , sometimes baffling , and according to those behind " living german , " unnecessary .
german can stand on its own two feet , they say , and proudly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the campaign says german has enough of its own words to get along in most situations , thank you very much " we should stop being embarrassed by the german language , " their manifesto proclaims .
" it is one of the major cultural languages of the west , the largest language in the european union and after english and spanish , the most popular foreign language in the world . " the campaign plans on choosing three widely used anglicisms per month and asking the public to suggesting german equivalents .
teutonic versions of homepage and shareholder value were relatively easy to come by .
but cou n tdow n , word number three of the campaign 's first month , is proving a difficult nut to crack . up to now , no one has come up with a good german equivalent of the word , at least not one that is short , pithy and to the point .
duden , germany 's best-known dictionary , defines cou n tdow n as " a count that proceeds backwards toward the number zero for the initiation of an order to start . " does n't exactly trip off the tongue . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german-only school wins national prize a secondary school in berlin has decided to ban turkish and other foreign languages spoken by its pupils in an attempt to improve german language skills at the immigrant-dominated facility .

not in english , where they are at home , but in german , where they are used more frequently by german speakers . the " living german " campaign wants germans to use german words for these ideas , and not depend on english imports , which , they say , many people simply do n't understand .

for some expressions , a full 90 percent of germans had no idea what was being talked about . lo n g history attempts to weed foreignisms from german go back centuries .
in the early 1500s , there were already battles to keep latin , french and english expressions out of the language , with very mixed results . in 1617 , on the eve of the thirty years ' war , a patriotic society was founded that sought to preserve the " manful german hero 's tongue " against the influence of french , because german would n't tolerate " anything womanly .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : spotlight on the berlinale berlinale film lineup includes four german entries tracking the golden bear berlinale strikes a serious note " love never goes out of fashion " culture & lifestyle -pipe- 13.02.2006 german favorite at berlinale disappoints großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the film is studded with a who 's who of german cinema this year 's hottest german entry at the berlinale , " elementary particles , " an on-screen adaptation of the eponymous french novel , boasts a star-heavy cast .
but critics are n't impressed . there was standing room only in the conference room at the hyatt hotel in downtown berlin on saturday afternoon as the cast of the much-awaited german competition entry " elementary particles " appeared to talk to the international media after the first screening of the film . " it 's often said that the german film scene does n't have any stars , but the podium here shows that is n't true , " said the moderator of the press conference as flash bulbs popped incessantly and the crush of journalists thrust a sea of microphones and tv cameras at the stage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from right , moritz bleibtreu , franka potente and nina hoss indeed , the line-up of " elementary particles " reads like a who 's who of german cinema .
starring moritz bleibtreu and franka potente -lrb- both of " run lola run " fame -rrb- , christian ulmen , martina gedeck and nina hoss -lrb- all household names in germany -rrb- , the movie is based on the eponymous book by french author michel houellebecq .
it 's directed by german director oskar roehler and produced by bernd eichinger -lrb- " the downfall " -rrb- . houellebecq 's book , published in 1998 , polarized opinion with its nihilistic view of the world , soulless sex and savage attacks against individualism , commercialization and the idealism of the 1968 generation . depressing and cynical the work , which caused an uproar in france , became a bestseller in europe and made houellebecq a literary star .
in germany , the book , with its mix of nietzschean philosophy , scientific experiment , pornographic scenes and jaded bitterness , became something of a sensation . over 80,000 hard-cover versions and 150,000 paperbacks were sold in germany as at least a dozen theaters toyed with the idea of turning it into a play . the movie reflects the bleakness of the book in the form of two half brothers bruno -lrb- bleibtreu -rrb- , a sex-obsessed school teacher who is n't so lucky with women in real life , and michel -lrb- ulmen -rrb- , a brilliant and inhibited molecular biologist who 's researching human cloning and has never slept with a woman .
both have gotten to know each other during their teenage years after their hippie mother -lrb- played by nina hoss -rrb- leaves them in the care of their grandmother and heads off to india to revel in sex , drugs and rock ' n ' roll . the film , which deals with bruno and michel 's frustration with life and women , is ultimately a quest by the brothers to find love in their own ways . film more conciliatory unlike the book , the film is much more conciliatory in tone , with both finding the right women at the end .
it also avoids much of the radicalism and repugnance that made the novel such a sensation . michel is reunited with his childhood friend annabelle -lrb- played by potente -rrb- , and bruno finds love , albeit temporarily , in the form of christiane -lrb- gedeck -rrb- , who he gets to know at a nudist spiritual camp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roehler admits he 's toned down the on-screen adaptation of elementary particles director oskar roehler said he could relate to houellebecq 's pessimism . " the question of whether it 's filmable or not , was n't important for me .
it simply fascinated me , " roehler said , adding that he saw himself as something of a pessimist too .
" forced optimism in the face of the current social situation is strange to me , " said the director , who took five years to make the movie . at the same time , roehler admitted that the film deliberately steers clear of the extreme darkness of the book . " i find it interesting to show what people do when they are in deep shit , " said roehler .
" but the completely fatalistic tone of the book could n't be just taken over , " roehler said .
" houellebecq gives us a key to understanding society that i find absolutely brilliant , " roehler said . " but i did n't want to take over houellebecq 's moral .
we did n't want to leave our protagonists in the lurch .
our film does n't deny faith in mankind . " producer bernd eichinger pointed out that the whole point had been to present an overall impression of houellebecq 's work .
" you ca n't film social criticism , only melodramas , " eichinger said . " huge testimony to love " of all the actors present on stage , martina gedeck - who plays bruno 's true love christiane , a sexually-uninhibited woman secretly battling a serious illness - was the most enthusiastic about the film . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martina gedeck and moritz bleibtreu " christiane has no sentimental expectations .
she 's a good loser and how she and bruno find each other is a huge testimony to love , " gedeck said . frank potente , who became known to international audiences as the sprinting redhead in " run lola run " and also starred in " the bourne identity " alongside matt damon , said she was excited about being represented at the competition category of the berlinale for the first time .
potente delivers a somewhat wooden performance in " elementary particles " as annabelle , a 30-plus lonely librarian in berlin . critics slam film despite its overwhelming star appeal , the film has largely received poor reviews in germany . the berlin-based newspaper die welt called the film " really straight , almost drab , " saying the punch was missing .
" the most trenchant scenes have been removed , others rendered harmless , the whole thing generally toned down .
houellebecq has been given some really gentle treatment . " " the most impressive thing about ' elementary particles ' is nina hoss ' face mask , " wrote news magazine der spiegel , referring to hoss ' decay as she lies on her death bed in one scene , her aged face mottled with bulging veins . " houllebecq , the cynic , drove his protagonists into the abyss with glee .
roehler , the director , on the other hand has sympathy with his characters , " it wrote . " all that the spectator is left with is the recognition that you ca n't film ' elementary particles ' .

in iran nuclear crisis , all eyes turn to russia world powers split over iran nuclear program iran calls un referral " the end of diplomacy " europe -pipe- 13.02.2006 enrichment row escalates as iran crosses the line großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad takes the standoff to a new level iran has started putting uranium feedstock gas into centrifuges , defying the west with actual enrichment work on making what can be nuclear reactor fuel or atom bomb material , diplomats told reporters monday . uranium enrichment is seen as a red line by the united states and european union in the long-running international standoff over iran 's nuclear program , as it is crucial to making atomic weapons . putting uranium hexafluoride -lrb- uf6 -rrb- gas into centrifuges , which distill out enriched uranium , appears a major escalation by iran in its face-off with the west over a nuclear program which the united states claims hides secret atomic weapons development . iran said monday that it would resume uranium enrichment even before the un watchdog international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- meets next month in vienna to decide whether to recommend un security council action against tehran . the diplomats ' comments in vienna appear to show iran is following through with its threat . " iran has put gas into centrifuges at its pilot enrichment plant in natanz , " a diplomat said .
the diplomat , who asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue , said iran had not yet fired up the whole 164-centrifuge cascade but had " over the past two or three days " started work with some centrifuges . a second diplomat said iran was doing " preliminary work " with " stand-alone " centrifuges , almost certainly putting uranium gas into single machines rather than a whole cascade . first step in a potential full scale enrichment program bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has started preparation for widescale enrichment at natanz the diplomat said this was necessary in a step-by-step approach involving first getting centrifuges running , then operating a pilot plant , which iran has dubbed research , and then moving on to industrial-scale enrichment with thousands of centrifuges . iran says its nuclear program is a peaceful effort to generate electricity and that it only wants to produce low enriched uranium , which is not refined enough for weapons use .
but it wants to install over 50,000 centrifuges at natanz , an array which could produce enough highly enriched uranium every two or three weeks for one atom bomb . iran had suspended uranium enrichment until talks with an eu negotiating troika , aimed at winning guarantees that the program is peaceful , broke down last month . since august , though , it has been making the feedstock uf6 at a conversion plant in isfahan .
the west has seemed ready to let tehran continue with this work , which technically is part of nuclear fuel activities the eu says should be suspended , as long as the islamic republic did not actually enrich . asked monday in tehran whether iran would wait for the march 6 iaea board of governors ' meeting to resume industrial-scale enrichment , government spokesman gholam hossein elham told reporters " no , no .

public workers expanded their week-old work stoppage on monday in a dispute over longer hours . this first widespread stoppage in 14 years has targeted trash collection , child care facilities , hospitals and road works , and on monday , public workers in nine of germany 's 14 federal states walked off the job , compared to only two last week . the regions effected by the strike include germany 's most populous state , north rhine-westphalia , home to some 17 million people . however , not all workers are striking simultaneously , which has limited the disruption . the strike started a week ago in the state of baden-württemberg and was called by the public sector union ver.di to prevent the employers from extending the working week from 38.5 to 40 hours . in a strike ballot , 94.5 percent of ver.di members voted in favor of industrial action . " there could not have been a more decisive outcome of this ballot or a more decisive vote in favor a strike , " said the head of the public-service union , frank bsirske . despite negotiations on the weekend between unions and employers , no agreement was reached . ca n't dictate work hours bsirske told the mass circulation tabloid bild on monday that strikes would continue until employers realized that they could not dictate to their staff how long should they should work . a 40-hour week would mean extending the working day by 18 minutes .
bsirske says this may not sound like much , but is equivalent to working an extra two weeks a year without pay . he also accused the employers of using longer working hours as an excuse to cut jobs , of which he said a quarter of a million were at risk . speaking for employers , the finance minister of the state of lower saxony , hartmut möllring , recalled that germany 's public sector worked a forty-hour week until 1989 .
that was acceptable in those days , he said , when local authorities , relatively speaking , had plenty of money at their disposal .
it should also be acceptable now , he added . he also pointed out a forty-hour week was already being worked in eastern germany .
möllring emphasised that workers in the public sector had secure jobs . " surely a secure job is worth working an extra 18 minutes a day , " möllring said . bsirske dismisses the secure jobs argument as fiction .

public workers expanded their week-old work stoppage on monday in a dispute over longer hours . this first widespread stoppage in 14 years has targeted trash collection , child care facilities , hospitals and road works , and on monday , public workers in nine of germany 's 14 federal states walked off the job , compared to only two last week . the regions effected by the strike include germany 's most populous state , north rhine-westphalia , home to some 17 million people . however , not all workers are striking simultaneously , which has limited the disruption . the strike started a week ago in the state of baden-württemberg and was called by the public sector union ver.di to prevent the employers from extending the working week from 38.5 to 40 hours . in a strike ballot , 94.5 percent of ver.di members voted in favor of industrial action . " there could not have been a more decisive outcome of this ballot or a more decisive vote in favor a strike , " said the head of the public-service union , frank bsirske . despite negotiations on the weekend between unions and employers , no agreement was reached . ca n't dictate work hours bsirske told the mass circulation tabloid bild on monday that strikes would continue until employers realized that they could not dictate to their staff how long should they should work . a 40-hour week would mean extending the working day by 18 minutes .
bsirske says this may not sound like much , but is equivalent to working an extra two weeks a year without pay . he also accused the employers of using longer working hours as an excuse to cut jobs , of which he said a quarter of a million were at risk . speaking for employers , the finance minister of the state of lower saxony , hartmut möllring , recalled that germany 's public sector worked a forty-hour week until 1989 .
that was acceptable in those days , he said , when local authorities , relatively speaking , had plenty of money at their disposal .
it should also be acceptable now , he added . he also pointed out a forty-hour week was already being worked in eastern germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 13.02.2006 new campaign seeks to calm germans ' anglomania großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will he grow up speaking german or some strange hybrid tongue ?
the use of foreign words in german is nothing new , but more and more anglicisms are creeping in , upsetting some language mavens .
the new " living german " campaign advocates finding german equivalents of english words . to the initiators of the campaign , words like cou n tdow n , shareholder value and homepage are unnecessary .
not in english , where they are at home , but in german , where they are used more frequently by german speakers . the " living german " campaign wants germans to use german words for these ideas , and not depend on english imports , which , they say , many people simply do n't understand .
and , to top it off , many are simply " ugly , " according to those supporting the campaign . instead of shareholder value , why not use the good old teutonic aktio n ärs n utze n ?
instead of the internet-age homepage , why not startseite ?
it does use a borrowed english word , " start , " but it 's well-known in germany and is short , pithy and to the point , making it acceptable to the language watchdogs . " we affirm the enriching of german through foreign languages and we even welcome certain imports from english , " said the campaign 's organizers in a statement .
" our initiative is aimed only against anglomania , against excess . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another anglicism ?
some germans are throwing their hands in the air the language experts who are spearheading this attempt to clean up the german tongue - author wolf schneider , german teachers ' association president josef kraus and head of the german language association walter krämer - insist they are not being fuddy-duddies who want to take german back to some utopian " purity . "
they simply want language to serve the function it is meant to , communication . they point to a 2003 study that looked at whether germans actually understood 12 english expressions that were used by german companies in their marketing or advertising materials .
the results were not promising ; a maximum of 59 percent understood what the companies were trying to get across .
for some expressions , a full 90 percent of germans had no idea what was being talked about . lo n g history attempts to weed foreignisms from german go back centuries .
in the early 1500s , there were already battles to keep latin , french and english expressions out of the language , with very mixed results . in 1617 , on the eve of the thirty years ' war , a patriotic society was founded that sought to preserve the " manful german hero 's tongue " against the influence of french , because german would n't tolerate " anything womanly . " some , if not all , of the efforts of this particular germanizing purge had some staying power , such as auge n blick instead of mome n t , rechtsschreibu n g in place of orthographie , and tagebuch for jour n al .
all of these are common german words today . cool … or just embarrassi n g ? today , french is no longer the bad guy , but english .
to many germans , especially younger ones , english is cool , and they pepper their speech with as much english as possible .
marketers and advertising executives also wanted to project a cool , modern image , and thought english would be a perfect vehicle for that . the results of this public english usage by non-native speakers are sometimes cheesy , sometimes baffling , and according to those behind " living german , " unnecessary .
german can stand on its own two feet , they say , and proudly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the campaign says german has enough of its own words to get along in most situations , thank you very much " we should stop being embarrassed by the german language , " their manifesto proclaims .
" it is one of the major cultural languages of the west , the largest language in the european union and after english and spanish , the most popular foreign language in the world . " the campaign plans on choosing three widely used anglicisms per month and asking the public to suggesting german equivalents .
teutonic versions of homepage and shareholder value were relatively easy to come by .
but cou n tdow n , word number three of the campaign 's first month , is proving a difficult nut to crack . up to now , no one has come up with a good german equivalent of the word , at least not one that is short , pithy and to the point .
duden , germany 's best-known dictionary , defines cou n tdow n as " a count that proceeds backwards toward the number zero for the initiation of an order to start . " does n't exactly trip off the tongue . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german-only school wins national prize a secondary school in berlin has decided to ban turkish and other foreign languages spoken by its pupils in an attempt to improve german language skills at the immigrant-dominated facility .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : spotlight on the berlinale berlinale film lineup includes four german entries tracking the golden bear berlinale strikes a serious note " love never goes out of fashion " culture & lifestyle -pipe- 13.02.2006 german favorite at berlinale disappoints großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the film is studded with a who 's who of german cinema this year 's hottest german entry at the berlinale , " elementary particles , " an on-screen adaptation of the eponymous french novel , boasts a star-heavy cast .
but critics are n't impressed . there was standing room only in the conference room at the hyatt hotel in downtown berlin on saturday afternoon as the cast of the much-awaited german competition entry " elementary particles " appeared to talk to the international media after the first screening of the film . " it 's often said that the german film scene does n't have any stars , but the podium here shows that is n't true , " said the moderator of the press conference as flash bulbs popped incessantly and the crush of journalists thrust a sea of microphones and tv cameras at the stage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from right , moritz bleibtreu , franka potente and nina hoss indeed , the line-up of " elementary particles " reads like a who 's who of german cinema .
starring moritz bleibtreu and franka potente -lrb- both of " run lola run " fame -rrb- , christian ulmen , martina gedeck and nina hoss -lrb- all household names in germany -rrb- , the movie is based on the eponymous book by french author michel houellebecq .
it 's directed by german director oskar roehler and produced by bernd eichinger -lrb- " the downfall " -rrb- . houellebecq 's book , published in 1998 , polarized opinion with its nihilistic view of the world , soulless sex and savage attacks against individualism , commercialization and the idealism of the 1968 generation . depressing and cynical the work , which caused an uproar in france , became a bestseller in europe and made houellebecq a literary star .
in germany , the book , with its mix of nietzschean philosophy , scientific experiment , pornographic scenes and jaded bitterness , became something of a sensation . over 80,000 hard-cover versions and 150,000 paperbacks were sold in germany as at least a dozen theaters toyed with the idea of turning it into a play . the movie reflects the bleakness of the book in the form of two half brothers bruno -lrb- bleibtreu -rrb- , a sex-obsessed school teacher who is n't so lucky with women in real life , and michel -lrb- ulmen -rrb- , a brilliant and inhibited molecular biologist who 's researching human cloning and has never slept with a woman .
both have gotten to know each other during their teenage years after their hippie mother -lrb- played by nina hoss -rrb- leaves them in the care of their grandmother and heads off to india to revel in sex , drugs and rock ' n ' roll . the film , which deals with bruno and michel 's frustration with life and women , is ultimately a quest by the brothers to find love in their own ways . film more conciliatory unlike the book , the film is much more conciliatory in tone , with both finding the right women at the end .
it also avoids much of the radicalism and repugnance that made the novel such a sensation . michel is reunited with his childhood friend annabelle -lrb- played by potente -rrb- , and bruno finds love , albeit temporarily , in the form of christiane -lrb- gedeck -rrb- , who he gets to know at a nudist spiritual camp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roehler admits he 's toned down the on-screen adaptation of elementary particles director oskar roehler said he could relate to houellebecq 's pessimism . " the question of whether it 's filmable or not , was n't important for me .
it simply fascinated me , " roehler said , adding that he saw himself as something of a pessimist too .
" forced optimism in the face of the current social situation is strange to me , " said the director , who took five years to make the movie . at the same time , roehler admitted that the film deliberately steers clear of the extreme darkness of the book . " i find it interesting to show what people do when they are in deep shit , " said roehler .
" but the completely fatalistic tone of the book could n't be just taken over , " roehler said .
" houellebecq gives us a key to understanding society that i find absolutely brilliant , " roehler said . " but i did n't want to take over houellebecq 's moral .
we did n't want to leave our protagonists in the lurch .
our film does n't deny faith in mankind . " producer bernd eichinger pointed out that the whole point had been to present an overall impression of houellebecq 's work .
" you ca n't film social criticism , only melodramas , " eichinger said . " huge testimony to love " of all the actors present on stage , martina gedeck - who plays bruno 's true love christiane , a sexually-uninhibited woman secretly battling a serious illness - was the most enthusiastic about the film . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martina gedeck and moritz bleibtreu " christiane has no sentimental expectations .
she 's a good loser and how she and bruno find each other is a huge testimony to love , " gedeck said . frank potente , who became known to international audiences as the sprinting redhead in " run lola run " and also starred in " the bourne identity " alongside matt damon , said she was excited about being represented at the competition category of the berlinale for the first time .
potente delivers a somewhat wooden performance in " elementary particles " as annabelle , a 30-plus lonely librarian in berlin . critics slam film despite its overwhelming star appeal , the film has largely received poor reviews in germany . the berlin-based newspaper die welt called the film " really straight , almost drab , " saying the punch was missing .
" the most trenchant scenes have been removed , others rendered harmless , the whole thing generally toned down .
houellebecq has been given some really gentle treatment . " " the most impressive thing about ' elementary particles ' is nina hoss ' face mask , " wrote news magazine der spiegel , referring to hoss ' decay as she lies on her death bed in one scene , her aged face mottled with bulging veins . " houllebecq , the cynic , drove his protagonists into the abyss with glee .
roehler , the director , on the other hand has sympathy with his characters , " it wrote . " all that the spectator is left with is the recognition that you ca n't film ' elementary particles ' .

there is already a general agreement that children from migrant families should be given extra help in schools to develop their german language schools but the citizenship test question is another matter . böhmer 's draft test , which will be presented and debated in government , is designed along the lines of citizenship courses in the united states to " help those who want to become naturalized germans " by teaching and testing migrants on the german constitution , the history of the country but while " remaining sympathetic to their own values . " " the united states gives courses in the constitution , the history , culture and the values of the country , " she said .
" since those who come here do n't only want to live and work in germany but to become german , we should give them as much help as possible . " ehrhart körting , from berlin 's interior ministry , is one of those who , in theory , is in favor of the tests although he sees very little point in asking those immigrants who have lived in germany for ten to 15 years to take the test .
" the main focus should be on integration courses for new immigrants coming into the country for the first time , " he told reporters recently . critics want viable alternatives to citizenship tests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some politicians feel that an alternative to courses should be found rhineland-palatinate 's minister of the interior karl peter bruch is one who will oppose the tests .
" we will not have such a test , " the social democrat minister assured .
bruch is not against reasonable alternatives , he stressed , where a person is interviewed on whether they " respect the constitution and the democratic processes of germany " and fully supports the improvement of language courses . there is certainly a deficit in the language tuition of migrant children , something maria böhmer wants to address .
she believes that every euro invested in improving language courses will be paid back several times by well-equipped and integrated members of society contributing to the economy . böhmer sees the future of integration in germany also taking the form of more educational opportunities and employment chances for youngsters from migrant families .
she admits to casting envious glances over the border to france where there is a charter designed to give young migrant workers the chance to find work . " i have had conversations with trade associations , and i am now involved in bringing the subject of migration into the sphere of the large companies in germany , " böhmer said .
" in france , large enterprises are obliged to give youngsters with a migrant background the chance to learn a profession .
this is a good model . " language and cultural lessons to preven parallel societies christoph böhr from the cdu wants german language tuition to begin at preschool level and for migrant children to have tests before they move on into the school system .
böher also wants parents whose children do not take part to face a penalty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education is seen as an important bridge between cultures christian social union secretary general markus söder has also called for islamic religious lesson to be included in the general syllabus .
everything must be done , he said , to develop the understanding between faiths and to do everything to prevent parallel societies . böhmer agrees that cultural and religious understanding is an integral part of the integration question : " we in our very secularized world should consider what religion actually means to others , what honor is reserved for religious symbols and what level of sensitivity we must adopt when dealing with people with very strong religious beliefs .

public workers expanded their week-old work stoppage on monday in a dispute over longer hours . this first widespread stoppage in 14 years has targeted trash collection , child care facilities , hospitals and road works , and on monday , public workers in nine of germany 's 14 federal states walked off the job , compared to only two last week . the regions effected by the strike include germany 's most populous state , north rhine-westphalia , home to some 17 million people . however , not all workers are striking simultaneously , which has limited the disruption . the strike started a week ago in the state of baden-württemberg and was called by the public sector union ver.di to prevent the employers from extending the working week from 38.5 to 40 hours . in a strike ballot , 94.5 percent of ver.di members voted in favor of industrial action . " there could not have been a more decisive outcome of this ballot or a more decisive vote in favor a strike , " said the head of the public-service union , frank bsirske . despite negotiations on the weekend between unions and employers , no agreement was reached . ca n't dictate work hours bsirske told the mass circulation tabloid bild on monday that strikes would continue until employers realized that they could not dictate to their staff how long should they should work . a 40-hour week would mean extending the working day by 18 minutes .
bsirske says this may not sound like much , but is equivalent to working an extra two weeks a year without pay . he also accused the employers of using longer working hours as an excuse to cut jobs , of which he said a quarter of a million were at risk . speaking for employers , the finance minister of the state of lower saxony , hartmut möllring , recalled that germany 's public sector worked a forty-hour week until 1989 .
that was acceptable in those days , he said , when local authorities , relatively speaking , had plenty of money at their disposal .
it should also be acceptable now , he added . he also pointed out a forty-hour week was already being worked in eastern germany .
möllring emphasised that workers in the public sector had secure jobs . " surely a secure job is worth working an extra 18 minutes a day , " möllring said . bsirske dismisses the secure jobs argument as fiction .
in child-care facilities and hospitals , almost three quarters of all workers are on short-term contracts , he explained . he warned local and regional authorities that the union had funds to support a strike lasting " many weeks .

public workers expanded their week-old work stoppage on monday in a dispute over longer hours . this first widespread stoppage in 14 years has targeted trash collection , child care facilities , hospitals and road works , and on monday , public workers in nine of germany 's 14 federal states walked off the job , compared to only two last week . the regions effected by the strike include germany 's most populous state , north rhine-westphalia , home to some 17 million people . however , not all workers are striking simultaneously , which has limited the disruption . the strike started a week ago in the state of baden-württemberg and was called by the public sector union ver.di to prevent the employers from extending the working week from 38.5 to 40 hours . in a strike ballot , 94.5 percent of ver.di members voted in favor of industrial action . " there could not have been a more decisive outcome of this ballot or a more decisive vote in favor a strike , " said the head of the public-service union , frank bsirske . despite negotiations on the weekend between unions and employers , no agreement was reached . ca n't dictate work hours bsirske told the mass circulation tabloid bild on monday that strikes would continue until employers realized that they could not dictate to their staff how long should they should work . a 40-hour week would mean extending the working day by 18 minutes .
bsirske says this may not sound like much , but is equivalent to working an extra two weeks a year without pay . he also accused the employers of using longer working hours as an excuse to cut jobs , of which he said a quarter of a million were at risk . speaking for employers , the finance minister of the state of lower saxony , hartmut möllring , recalled that germany 's public sector worked a forty-hour week until 1989 .
that was acceptable in those days , he said , when local authorities , relatively speaking , had plenty of money at their disposal .
it should also be acceptable now , he added . he also pointed out a forty-hour week was already being worked in eastern germany .
möllring emphasised that workers in the public sector had secure jobs . " surely a secure job is worth working an extra 18 minutes a day , " möllring said . bsirske dismisses the secure jobs argument as fiction .
in child-care facilities and hospitals , almost three quarters of all workers are on short-term contracts , he explained . he warned local and regional authorities that the union had funds to support a strike lasting " many weeks .

he called for europeans to show more sensitivity to the beliefs of muslims . " european integration is built upon the foundation of respect of other cultures , tolerance and the recognition of diversity , " schröder told the seventh annual edition of the forum , whose theme is : " honoring identity and celebrating common ground . " " this includes refraining from acts that hurt honest religious sentiment .
unfortunately in the last few months this sensitivity has been lacking in many places , including europe , " he added . diplomacy with iran during his trip , germany 's foreign minister will also be explaining his government 's stance on the iran issue .
although negotiations on tehran 's uranium enrichment program seem to have reached in impasse , steinmeier will make it clear that berlin is continuing to explore all diplomatic avenues to reach a peaceful settlement of the conflict . while the united states has not completely ruled out a military move against iran , the german foreign minister has strongly denied that his government is considering backing such a strategy .

there is already a general agreement that children from migrant families should be given extra help in schools to develop their german language schools but the citizenship test question is another matter . böhmer 's draft test , which will be presented and debated in government , is designed along the lines of citizenship courses in the united states to " help those who want to become naturalized germans " by teaching and testing migrants on the german constitution , the history of the country but while " remaining sympathetic to their own values . " " the united states gives courses in the constitution , the history , culture and the values of the country , " she said .
" since those who come here do n't only want to live and work in germany but to become german , we should give them as much help as possible . " ehrhart körting , from berlin 's interior ministry , is one of those who , in theory , is in favor of the tests although he sees very little point in asking those immigrants who have lived in germany for ten to 15 years to take the test .
" the main focus should be on integration courses for new immigrants coming into the country for the first time , " he told reporters recently . critics want viable alternatives to citizenship tests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some politicians feel that an alternative to courses should be found rhineland-palatinate 's minister of the interior karl peter bruch is one who will oppose the tests .
" we will not have such a test , " the social democrat minister assured .
bruch is not against reasonable alternatives , he stressed , where a person is interviewed on whether they " respect the constitution and the democratic processes of germany " and fully supports the improvement of language courses . there is certainly a deficit in the language tuition of migrant children , something maria böhmer wants to address .
she believes that every euro invested in improving language courses will be paid back several times by well-equipped and integrated members of society contributing to the economy . böhmer sees the future of integration in germany also taking the form of more educational opportunities and employment chances for youngsters from migrant families .
she admits to casting envious glances over the border to france where there is a charter designed to give young migrant workers the chance to find work . " i have had conversations with trade associations , and i am now involved in bringing the subject of migration into the sphere of the large companies in germany , " böhmer said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.02.2006 more diesels needed in land of goethe and schiller großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany could fall behind unless more students become interested in engineering germany is suffering from a lack of 15,000 engineers .
making the profession more appealing could be a boon for german companies and help boost the economy , according to one of the country 's engineering groups . though christoph meilgen had to face rejection letters similar to those seen by germany 's five million unemployed , his doctorate in mechanical engineering helped him into a position many unemployed dream of : being able to turn down two positions and hold out for a job he wanted . " companies want practical , technical knowledge that goes well beyond what you get in school , " said meilgen , who took at position at lvq-wp in the industrial ruhr region of western germany after defending his thesis at kaiserslautern 's technical university this month .
" but there 's a need for engineers , you do n't need to take any offer . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finding research engineers is already difficult for many companies meilgen 's position is not an unusual one for recent graduates with engineering credentials .
seventy-three percent of middle-sized german companies said they see finding qualified employees as their most demanding task for the next five years , according to a february poll by tns infratest . germany 's position as a technological leader could be in danger if companies are n't able to find skilled new hires , according to michael schwartz , a spokesperson for the association of german engineers -lrb- vdi -rrb- . " germany today is lacking 15,000 engineers , 11,500 in small and middle-sized business alone , " he said .
" the difficulties many research and development companies are having filling positions could impair or even hold off innovation . " program encourages more students to " make things " after watching the number of students entering engineering fields drop 12 percent since a high of 87,542 in 2003 , the vdi , along with a group of 44 partners , including deutsche welle as a media partner , decided to start an initiative called sachen machen -lrb- make things -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : men make up nearly 84 percent of students in technical fields financed by the vdi and its partners , the program , slated to last at least five years , has set itself the goal of making germany the home of new technology by 2015 by achieving the world 's per capita leader in graduates with math , technical , it and natural science degrees ; employees in research and development ; research spending and patent registration . " we can not afford not to be successful , " schwarz said , referring to the program 's goal of boosting interest in technical fields among students and optimizing cooperation between science and businesses .
" if there are no new comers to fill the positions , products and services wo n't be able to be offered . " some engineers still ca n't find work that 's an argument germany 's 64,000 unemployed engineers do n't understand .
a number of factors are keeping these engineers from finding work , according to the german federal labor office 's beate raabe . " many of the unemployed are over 50 and some companies have the preconception that they do not have the most up-to-date technical knowledge , " she said in an interview with münchner merkur newspaper . while companies are looking for mechanical and electrical engineers , the market for architects and civil engineers is saturated , creating a mismatch between what they can offer and what is needed , schwarz added . employment affects more than just engineers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : engineers ' higher pay means more money to spend in stores the ones that do find a job can usually look forward to above-average salaries .
while recent graduate meilgen declined to say how much he would earn at his new job , starting salaries range from 30,000 euros to 45,000 euros -lrb- $ 35,938 to $ 53,908 -rrb- .
more experienced employees average 65,000 euros a year , according to vdi statistics . in 2003 , the most recently recorded year , the average german employee earned 26,700 euros , according to germany 's federal statistics office . the social benefits of getting open engineering positions filled could be a windfall for germany 's sluggish economy and languishing labor market , schwarz added . newly employed engineers along with their above-average paychecks and buying power typically have the potential to create 2.3 additional jobs in other fields , including production and retail , theoretically leading to 35,000 new jobs if the vdi 's estimate of 15,000 open engineering positions were filled . germans critical of innovation made in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans rank their own innovativeness below that of japan and the us other than getting jobs filled , one of sachen machen 's most difficult tasks will be convincing germans of their country 's abilities , which many foreign countries already recognize . despite having registered more patents than any other european country , a 2004 vdi survey showed only 6 percent of germans ranked their native land as the most innovative .
japan and the united states respectively scored 40 percent and 21 percent . internationally , however , germany 's engineers continue to enjoy the positive reputation earned on the back of names like mercedes , zeiss and siemens .

in iran nuclear crisis , all eyes turn to russia world powers split over iran nuclear program iran calls un referral " the end of diplomacy " europe -pipe- 13.02.2006 enrichment row escalates as iran crosses the line großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad takes the standoff to a new level iran has started putting uranium feedstock gas into centrifuges , defying the west with actual enrichment work on making what can be nuclear reactor fuel or atom bomb material , diplomats told reporters monday . uranium enrichment is seen as a red line by the united states and european union in the long-running international standoff over iran 's nuclear program , as it is crucial to making atomic weapons . putting uranium hexafluoride -lrb- uf6 -rrb- gas into centrifuges , which distill out enriched uranium , appears a major escalation by iran in its face-off with the west over a nuclear program which the united states claims hides secret atomic weapons development . iran said monday that it would resume uranium enrichment even before the un watchdog international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- meets next month in vienna to decide whether to recommend un security council action against tehran . the diplomats ' comments in vienna appear to show iran is following through with its threat . " iran has put gas into centrifuges at its pilot enrichment plant in natanz , " a diplomat said .
the diplomat , who asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue , said iran had not yet fired up the whole 164-centrifuge cascade but had " over the past two or three days " started work with some centrifuges . a second diplomat said iran was doing " preliminary work " with " stand-alone " centrifuges , almost certainly putting uranium gas into single machines rather than a whole cascade . first step in a potential full scale enrichment program bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has started preparation for widescale enrichment at natanz the diplomat said this was necessary in a step-by-step approach involving first getting centrifuges running , then operating a pilot plant , which iran has dubbed research , and then moving on to industrial-scale enrichment with thousands of centrifuges . iran says its nuclear program is a peaceful effort to generate electricity and that it only wants to produce low enriched uranium , which is not refined enough for weapons use .
but it wants to install over 50,000 centrifuges at natanz , an array which could produce enough highly enriched uranium every two or three weeks for one atom bomb . iran had suspended uranium enrichment until talks with an eu negotiating troika , aimed at winning guarantees that the program is peaceful , broke down last month . since august , though , it has been making the feedstock uf6 at a conversion plant in isfahan .
the west has seemed ready to let tehran continue with this work , which technically is part of nuclear fuel activities the eu says should be suspended , as long as the islamic republic did not actually enrich . asked monday in tehran whether iran would wait for the march 6 iaea board of governors ' meeting to resume industrial-scale enrichment , government spokesman gholam hossein elham told reporters " no , no . " one month diplomacy window slamming shut bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the diplomacy window and russia 's offer have been ignored by iran the iaea had voted february 4 to report iran to the security council , but left a one-month window for diplomacy for iran to return to a full suspension of enrichment-related work and cooperate more with iaea inspectors . the iranian government spokesman also announced that talks between tehran and moscow would not go ahead as planned on thursday . the talks are aimed at negotiating a compromise in the standoff by having iranian uranium enriched on russian soil so that tehran would not master the technology itself . however , russian deputy foreign minister sergei kislyak said moscow still expected the iranian delegation , adding : " our offer for the 16th -lrb- february -rrb- still stands . " the iranian spokesman said " new elements " were responsible for the delay , notably the fact that the iranian government " insists that uranium enrichment for peaceful purposes is carried out inside the country .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.02.2006 politicians want migrants to be put to the test großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians will discuss whether us-style citizenship courses will aid integration the german government will again debate the possibility of nationwide citizenship tests for migrants in a special bundestag session monday . the hope is that politicians can agree on a program that will avoid the controversy that a migrant exam prototype in the state of baden-württemberg caused when it was proposed earlier this year . maria böhmer , the christian democratic union minister who was recently installed as the government 's point person for integration policy , is hopeful that some consensus can be found in discussions this week .
there is already a general agreement that children from migrant families should be given extra help in schools to develop their german language schools but the citizenship test question is another matter . böhmer 's draft test , which will be presented and debated in government , is designed along the lines of citizenship courses in the united states to " help those who want to become naturalized germans " by teaching and testing migrants on the german constitution , the history of the country but while " remaining sympathetic to their own values . " " the united states gives courses in the constitution , the history , culture and the values of the country , " she said .
" since those who come here do n't only want to live and work in germany but to become german , we should give them as much help as possible . " ehrhart körting , from berlin 's interior ministry , is one of those who , in theory , is in favor of the tests although he sees very little point in asking those immigrants who have lived in germany for ten to 15 years to take the test .
" the main focus should be on integration courses for new immigrants coming into the country for the first time , " he told reporters recently . critics want viable alternatives to citizenship tests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some politicians feel that an alternative to courses should be found rhineland-palatinate 's minister of the interior karl peter bruch is one who will oppose the tests .
" we will not have such a test , " the social democrat minister assured .
bruch is not against reasonable alternatives , he stressed , where a person is interviewed on whether they " respect the constitution and the democratic processes of germany " and fully supports the improvement of language courses . there is certainly a deficit in the language tuition of migrant children , something maria böhmer wants to address .
she believes that every euro invested in improving language courses will be paid back several times by well-equipped and integrated members of society contributing to the economy . böhmer sees the future of integration in germany also taking the form of more educational opportunities and employment chances for youngsters from migrant families .
she admits to casting envious glances over the border to france where there is a charter designed to give young migrant workers the chance to find work . " i have had conversations with trade associations , and i am now involved in bringing the subject of migration into the sphere of the large companies in germany , " böhmer said .
" in france , large enterprises are obliged to give youngsters with a migrant background the chance to learn a profession .
this is a good model . " language and cultural lessons to preven parallel societies christoph böhr from the cdu wants german language tuition to begin at preschool level and for migrant children to have tests before they move on into the school system .
böher also wants parents whose children do not take part to face a penalty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education is seen as an important bridge between cultures christian social union secretary general markus söder has also called for islamic religious lesson to be included in the general syllabus .
everything must be done , he said , to develop the understanding between faiths and to do everything to prevent parallel societies . böhmer agrees that cultural and religious understanding is an integral part of the integration question : " we in our very secularized world should consider what religion actually means to others , what honor is reserved for religious symbols and what level of sensitivity we must adopt when dealing with people with very strong religious beliefs .

" it 's often said that the german film scene does n't have any stars , but the podium here shows that is n't true , " said the moderator of the press conference as flash bulbs popped incessantly and the crush of journalists thrust a sea of microphones and tv cameras at the stage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from right , moritz bleibtreu , franka potente and nina hoss indeed , the line-up of " elementary particles " reads like a who 's who of german cinema .
starring moritz bleibtreu and franka potente -lrb- both of " run lola run " fame -rrb- , christian ulmen , martina gedeck and nina hoss -lrb- all household names in germany -rrb- , the movie is based on the eponymous book by french author michel houellebecq .
it 's directed by german director oskar roehler and produced by bernd eichinger -lrb- " the downfall " -rrb- . houellebecq 's book , published in 1998 , polarized opinion with its nihilistic view of the world , soulless sex and savage attacks against individualism , commercialization and the idealism of the 1968 generation . depressing and cynical the work , which caused an uproar in france , became a bestseller in europe and made houellebecq a literary star .
in germany , the book , with its mix of nietzschean philosophy , scientific experiment , pornographic scenes and jaded bitterness , became something of a sensation . over 80,000 hard-cover versions and 150,000 paperbacks were sold in germany as at least a dozen theaters toyed with the idea of turning it into a play . the movie reflects the bleakness of the book in the form of two half brothers bruno -lrb- bleibtreu -rrb- , a sex-obsessed school teacher who is n't so lucky with women in real life , and michel -lrb- ulmen -rrb- , a brilliant and inhibited molecular biologist who 's researching human cloning and has never slept with a woman .
both have gotten to know each other during their teenage years after their hippie mother -lrb- played by nina hoss -rrb- leaves them in the care of their grandmother and heads off to india to revel in sex , drugs and rock ' n ' roll . the film , which deals with bruno and michel 's frustration with life and women , is ultimately a quest by the brothers to find love in their own ways . film more conciliatory unlike the book , the film is much more conciliatory in tone , with both finding the right women at the end .
it also avoids much of the radicalism and repugnance that made the novel such a sensation . michel is reunited with his childhood friend annabelle -lrb- played by potente -rrb- , and bruno finds love , albeit temporarily , in the form of christiane -lrb- gedeck -rrb- , who he gets to know at a nudist spiritual camp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roehler admits he 's toned down the on-screen adaptation of elementary particles director oskar roehler said he could relate to houellebecq 's pessimism . " the question of whether it 's filmable or not , was n't important for me .
it simply fascinated me , " roehler said , adding that he saw himself as something of a pessimist too .
" forced optimism in the face of the current social situation is strange to me , " said the director , who took five years to make the movie . at the same time , roehler admitted that the film deliberately steers clear of the extreme darkness of the book . " i find it interesting to show what people do when they are in deep shit , " said roehler .
" but the completely fatalistic tone of the book could n't be just taken over , " roehler said .
" houellebecq gives us a key to understanding society that i find absolutely brilliant , " roehler said . " but i did n't want to take over houellebecq 's moral .
we did n't want to leave our protagonists in the lurch .
our film does n't deny faith in mankind . " producer bernd eichinger pointed out that the whole point had been to present an overall impression of houellebecq 's work .
" you ca n't film social criticism , only melodramas , " eichinger said . " huge testimony to love " of all the actors present on stage , martina gedeck - who plays bruno 's true love christiane , a sexually-uninhibited woman secretly battling a serious illness - was the most enthusiastic about the film . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martina gedeck and moritz bleibtreu " christiane has no sentimental expectations .
she 's a good loser and how she and bruno find each other is a huge testimony to love , " gedeck said . frank potente , who became known to international audiences as the sprinting redhead in " run lola run " and also starred in " the bourne identity " alongside matt damon , said she was excited about being represented at the competition category of the berlinale for the first time .
potente delivers a somewhat wooden performance in " elementary particles " as annabelle , a 30-plus lonely librarian in berlin . critics slam film despite its overwhelming star appeal , the film has largely received poor reviews in germany . the berlin-based newspaper die welt called the film " really straight , almost drab , " saying the punch was missing .
" the most trenchant scenes have been removed , others rendered harmless , the whole thing generally toned down .
houellebecq has been given some really gentle treatment . " " the most impressive thing about ' elementary particles ' is nina hoss ' face mask , " wrote news magazine der spiegel , referring to hoss ' decay as she lies on her death bed in one scene , her aged face mottled with bulging veins . " houllebecq , the cynic , drove his protagonists into the abyss with glee .
roehler , the director , on the other hand has sympathy with his characters , " it wrote . " all that the spectator is left with is the recognition that you ca n't film ' elementary particles ' .

he made the remarks after talks on monday with the acting israeli prime minister . frank-walter steinmeier 's trip to the middle east is clearly the most difficult mission since he became foreign minister in germany 's new grand coalition government .
following tradition , he starts political talks today with political leaders in israel before he moves on to the palestinian territories and later to turkey " it 's a difficult trip to a difficult region , " steinmeier said . there are several delicate issues that the foreign minister will have to maneuver , including the election results in the palestinian territories , where the militant group hamas won a majority .
the west is still struggling with working out how to respond .
elections in israel are approaching , although they have been overshadowed by the critical health condition of israeli prime minister ariel sharon . on monday , after meeting with the ehud olmert , israel 's acting prime minister , steinmeier said germany backed israel not be recognized unless it backs away from militancy and acknowledges israel 's right to exist .
hamas openly seeks israel 's destruction and has carried out scores of suicide bombings . " i want to let israel know that it can count on our solidarity , especially after the palestinian election , " he said . israel has been increasingly concerned that the international front against hamas is crumbling .
russian president vladimir putin has invited hamas leaders to moscow for a visit , saying that he will press the group to give up violence and recognize israel .
france has come out in support of moscow 's approach . steinmeier said the israelis were assured when he " made the conditions for talks -lrb- with hamas -rrb- very clear . " road ahead ? the top german diplomat is also to meet with palestinian president mahmud abbas on tuesday in ramallah before departing for jordan and turkey , but he has not scheduled any session with the islamist movement despite its landslide victory in a jan .
25 general election .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west is still trying to figure out out to handle the hamas victory steinmeier and german chancellor angela merkel have voiced their interest in returning to the middle east peace process as laid down in the so-called road map .
but the future of the peace negotiations remains unclear after the hamas victory . israel 's ambassador to germany , shimon stein , has reiterated that hamas would still have to acknowledge israel 's right to statehood and refrain from terrorist attacks before it could become a negotiating partner in the peace process " hamas remains on the european union 's list of terror organizations , " stein said .
" i see no reason why germany should change its attitude towards hamas simply because the latter were elected into power . " cartoon row the german foreign minister 's trip to the middle east also aims to defuse tensions between europe and the muslim world over the publication of caricatures depicting the prophet mohammed .
the depictions have led to violent riots in many muslim countries and have reignited the debate on whether the philosophical gulf between the west and the muslim world can be bridged .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students burn a danish flag protesting the caricatures " i 'm very much interested in de-escalating the current situation , " steinmeier said .
" we should all strive to return to something we already had a while ago - a dialogue between different cultures which also has to be a genuine dialogue between religions . ” former german chancellor gerhard schröder weighed in on the issue from the middle east at a conference he has been attending in the saudi city of jeddah .
he called for europeans to show more sensitivity to the beliefs of muslims . " european integration is built upon the foundation of respect of other cultures , tolerance and the recognition of diversity , " schröder told the seventh annual edition of the forum , whose theme is : " honoring identity and celebrating common ground . " " this includes refraining from acts that hurt honest religious sentiment .
unfortunately in the last few months this sensitivity has been lacking in many places , including europe , " he added . diplomacy with iran during his trip , germany 's foreign minister will also be explaining his government 's stance on the iran issue .
although negotiations on tehran 's uranium enrichment program seem to have reached in impasse , steinmeier will make it clear that berlin is continuing to explore all diplomatic avenues to reach a peaceful settlement of the conflict . while the united states has not completely ruled out a military move against iran , the german foreign minister has strongly denied that his government is considering backing such a strategy .
in an interview with german public television on the weekend , steinmeier said he was not willing to debate moves which he said were not on the agenda . hardy graupner -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de four killed in afghanistan in cartoon row , calm urged the un , eu and the organization of the islamic conference -lrb- oic -rrb- have urged restraint and dialogue as worldwide muslim fury against danish cartoons depicting the prophet mohammed claimed four lives in afghanistan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : spotlight on the berlinale berlinale film lineup includes four german entries tracking the golden bear berlinale strikes a serious note " love never goes out of fashion " culture & lifestyle -pipe- 13.02.2006 german favorite at berlinale disappoints großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the film is studded with a who 's who of german cinema this year 's hottest german entry at the berlinale , " elementary particles , " an on-screen adaptation of the eponymous french novel , boasts a star-heavy cast .
but critics are n't impressed . there was standing room only in the conference room at the hyatt hotel in downtown berlin on saturday afternoon as the cast of the much-awaited german competition entry " elementary particles " appeared to talk to the international media after the first screening of the film . " it 's often said that the german film scene does n't have any stars , but the podium here shows that is n't true , " said the moderator of the press conference as flash bulbs popped incessantly and the crush of journalists thrust a sea of microphones and tv cameras at the stage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from right , moritz bleibtreu , franka potente and nina hoss indeed , the line-up of " elementary particles " reads like a who 's who of german cinema .
starring moritz bleibtreu and franka potente -lrb- both of " run lola run " fame -rrb- , christian ulmen , martina gedeck and nina hoss -lrb- all household names in germany -rrb- , the movie is based on the eponymous book by french author michel houellebecq .
it 's directed by german director oskar roehler and produced by bernd eichinger -lrb- " the downfall " -rrb- . houellebecq 's book , published in 1998 , polarized opinion with its nihilistic view of the world , soulless sex and savage attacks against individualism , commercialization and the idealism of the 1968 generation . depressing and cynical the work , which caused an uproar in france , became a bestseller in europe and made houellebecq a literary star .
in germany , the book , with its mix of nietzschean philosophy , scientific experiment , pornographic scenes and jaded bitterness , became something of a sensation . over 80,000 hard-cover versions and 150,000 paperbacks were sold in germany as at least a dozen theaters toyed with the idea of turning it into a play . the movie reflects the bleakness of the book in the form of two half brothers bruno -lrb- bleibtreu -rrb- , a sex-obsessed school teacher who is n't so lucky with women in real life , and michel -lrb- ulmen -rrb- , a brilliant and inhibited molecular biologist who 's researching human cloning and has never slept with a woman .
both have gotten to know each other during their teenage years after their hippie mother -lrb- played by nina hoss -rrb- leaves them in the care of their grandmother and heads off to india to revel in sex , drugs and rock ' n ' roll . the film , which deals with bruno and michel 's frustration with life and women , is ultimately a quest by the brothers to find love in their own ways . film more conciliatory unlike the book , the film is much more conciliatory in tone , with both finding the right women at the end .
it also avoids much of the radicalism and repugnance that made the novel such a sensation . michel is reunited with his childhood friend annabelle -lrb- played by potente -rrb- , and bruno finds love , albeit temporarily , in the form of christiane -lrb- gedeck -rrb- , who he gets to know at a nudist spiritual camp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roehler admits he 's toned down the on-screen adaptation of elementary particles director oskar roehler said he could relate to houellebecq 's pessimism . " the question of whether it 's filmable or not , was n't important for me .
it simply fascinated me , " roehler said , adding that he saw himself as something of a pessimist too .
" forced optimism in the face of the current social situation is strange to me , " said the director , who took five years to make the movie . at the same time , roehler admitted that the film deliberately steers clear of the extreme darkness of the book . " i find it interesting to show what people do when they are in deep shit , " said roehler .
" but the completely fatalistic tone of the book could n't be just taken over , " roehler said .
" houellebecq gives us a key to understanding society that i find absolutely brilliant , " roehler said . " but i did n't want to take over houellebecq 's moral .
we did n't want to leave our protagonists in the lurch .
our film does n't deny faith in mankind . " producer bernd eichinger pointed out that the whole point had been to present an overall impression of houellebecq 's work .
" you ca n't film social criticism , only melodramas , " eichinger said . " huge testimony to love " of all the actors present on stage , martina gedeck - who plays bruno 's true love christiane , a sexually-uninhibited woman secretly battling a serious illness - was the most enthusiastic about the film . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martina gedeck and moritz bleibtreu " christiane has no sentimental expectations .
she 's a good loser and how she and bruno find each other is a huge testimony to love , " gedeck said . frank potente , who became known to international audiences as the sprinting redhead in " run lola run " and also starred in " the bourne identity " alongside matt damon , said she was excited about being represented at the competition category of the berlinale for the first time .
potente delivers a somewhat wooden performance in " elementary particles " as annabelle , a 30-plus lonely librarian in berlin . critics slam film despite its overwhelming star appeal , the film has largely received poor reviews in germany . the berlin-based newspaper die welt called the film " really straight , almost drab , " saying the punch was missing .
" the most trenchant scenes have been removed , others rendered harmless , the whole thing generally toned down .
houellebecq has been given some really gentle treatment . " " the most impressive thing about ' elementary particles ' is nina hoss ' face mask , " wrote news magazine der spiegel , referring to hoss ' decay as she lies on her death bed in one scene , her aged face mottled with bulging veins . " houllebecq , the cynic , drove his protagonists into the abyss with glee .
roehler , the director , on the other hand has sympathy with his characters , " it wrote . " all that the spectator is left with is the recognition that you ca n't film ' elementary particles ' .

but critics are n't impressed . there was standing room only in the conference room at the hyatt hotel in downtown berlin on saturday afternoon as the cast of the much-awaited german competition entry " elementary particles " appeared to talk to the international media after the first screening of the film . " it 's often said that the german film scene does n't have any stars , but the podium here shows that is n't true , " said the moderator of the press conference as flash bulbs popped incessantly and the crush of journalists thrust a sea of microphones and tv cameras at the stage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from right , moritz bleibtreu , franka potente and nina hoss indeed , the line-up of " elementary particles " reads like a who 's who of german cinema .
starring moritz bleibtreu and franka potente -lrb- both of " run lola run " fame -rrb- , christian ulmen , martina gedeck and nina hoss -lrb- all household names in germany -rrb- , the movie is based on the eponymous book by french author michel houellebecq .
it 's directed by german director oskar roehler and produced by bernd eichinger -lrb- " the downfall " -rrb- . houellebecq 's book , published in 1998 , polarized opinion with its nihilistic view of the world , soulless sex and savage attacks against individualism , commercialization and the idealism of the 1968 generation . depressing and cynical the work , which caused an uproar in france , became a bestseller in europe and made houellebecq a literary star .
in germany , the book , with its mix of nietzschean philosophy , scientific experiment , pornographic scenes and jaded bitterness , became something of a sensation . over 80,000 hard-cover versions and 150,000 paperbacks were sold in germany as at least a dozen theaters toyed with the idea of turning it into a play . the movie reflects the bleakness of the book in the form of two half brothers bruno -lrb- bleibtreu -rrb- , a sex-obsessed school teacher who is n't so lucky with women in real life , and michel -lrb- ulmen -rrb- , a brilliant and inhibited molecular biologist who 's researching human cloning and has never slept with a woman .
both have gotten to know each other during their teenage years after their hippie mother -lrb- played by nina hoss -rrb- leaves them in the care of their grandmother and heads off to india to revel in sex , drugs and rock ' n ' roll . the film , which deals with bruno and michel 's frustration with life and women , is ultimately a quest by the brothers to find love in their own ways . film more conciliatory unlike the book , the film is much more conciliatory in tone , with both finding the right women at the end .
it also avoids much of the radicalism and repugnance that made the novel such a sensation . michel is reunited with his childhood friend annabelle -lrb- played by potente -rrb- , and bruno finds love , albeit temporarily , in the form of christiane -lrb- gedeck -rrb- , who he gets to know at a nudist spiritual camp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roehler admits he 's toned down the on-screen adaptation of elementary particles director oskar roehler said he could relate to houellebecq 's pessimism . " the question of whether it 's filmable or not , was n't important for me .
it simply fascinated me , " roehler said , adding that he saw himself as something of a pessimist too .
" forced optimism in the face of the current social situation is strange to me , " said the director , who took five years to make the movie . at the same time , roehler admitted that the film deliberately steers clear of the extreme darkness of the book . " i find it interesting to show what people do when they are in deep shit , " said roehler .
" but the completely fatalistic tone of the book could n't be just taken over , " roehler said .
" houellebecq gives us a key to understanding society that i find absolutely brilliant , " roehler said . " but i did n't want to take over houellebecq 's moral .
we did n't want to leave our protagonists in the lurch .
our film does n't deny faith in mankind . " producer bernd eichinger pointed out that the whole point had been to present an overall impression of houellebecq 's work .
" you ca n't film social criticism , only melodramas , " eichinger said . " huge testimony to love " of all the actors present on stage , martina gedeck - who plays bruno 's true love christiane , a sexually-uninhibited woman secretly battling a serious illness - was the most enthusiastic about the film . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martina gedeck and moritz bleibtreu " christiane has no sentimental expectations .
she 's a good loser and how she and bruno find each other is a huge testimony to love , " gedeck said . frank potente , who became known to international audiences as the sprinting redhead in " run lola run " and also starred in " the bourne identity " alongside matt damon , said she was excited about being represented at the competition category of the berlinale for the first time .
potente delivers a somewhat wooden performance in " elementary particles " as annabelle , a 30-plus lonely librarian in berlin . critics slam film despite its overwhelming star appeal , the film has largely received poor reviews in germany . the berlin-based newspaper die welt called the film " really straight , almost drab , " saying the punch was missing .
" the most trenchant scenes have been removed , others rendered harmless , the whole thing generally toned down .
houellebecq has been given some really gentle treatment . " " the most impressive thing about ' elementary particles ' is nina hoss ' face mask , " wrote news magazine der spiegel , referring to hoss ' decay as she lies on her death bed in one scene , her aged face mottled with bulging veins . " houllebecq , the cynic , drove his protagonists into the abyss with glee .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.02.2006 more diesels needed in land of goethe and schiller großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany could fall behind unless more students become interested in engineering germany is suffering from a lack of 15,000 engineers .
making the profession more appealing could be a boon for german companies and help boost the economy , according to one of the country 's engineering groups . though christoph meilgen had to face rejection letters similar to those seen by germany 's five million unemployed , his doctorate in mechanical engineering helped him into a position many unemployed dream of : being able to turn down two positions and hold out for a job he wanted . " companies want practical , technical knowledge that goes well beyond what you get in school , " said meilgen , who took at position at lvq-wp in the industrial ruhr region of western germany after defending his thesis at kaiserslautern 's technical university this month .
" but there 's a need for engineers , you do n't need to take any offer . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finding research engineers is already difficult for many companies meilgen 's position is not an unusual one for recent graduates with engineering credentials .
seventy-three percent of middle-sized german companies said they see finding qualified employees as their most demanding task for the next five years , according to a february poll by tns infratest . germany 's position as a technological leader could be in danger if companies are n't able to find skilled new hires , according to michael schwartz , a spokesperson for the association of german engineers -lrb- vdi -rrb- . " germany today is lacking 15,000 engineers , 11,500 in small and middle-sized business alone , " he said .
" the difficulties many research and development companies are having filling positions could impair or even hold off innovation . " program encourages more students to " make things " after watching the number of students entering engineering fields drop 12 percent since a high of 87,542 in 2003 , the vdi , along with a group of 44 partners , including deutsche welle as a media partner , decided to start an initiative called sachen machen -lrb- make things -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : men make up nearly 84 percent of students in technical fields financed by the vdi and its partners , the program , slated to last at least five years , has set itself the goal of making germany the home of new technology by 2015 by achieving the world 's per capita leader in graduates with math , technical , it and natural science degrees ; employees in research and development ; research spending and patent registration . " we can not afford not to be successful , " schwarz said , referring to the program 's goal of boosting interest in technical fields among students and optimizing cooperation between science and businesses .
" if there are no new comers to fill the positions , products and services wo n't be able to be offered . " some engineers still ca n't find work that 's an argument germany 's 64,000 unemployed engineers do n't understand .
a number of factors are keeping these engineers from finding work , according to the german federal labor office 's beate raabe . " many of the unemployed are over 50 and some companies have the preconception that they do not have the most up-to-date technical knowledge , " she said in an interview with münchner merkur newspaper . while companies are looking for mechanical and electrical engineers , the market for architects and civil engineers is saturated , creating a mismatch between what they can offer and what is needed , schwarz added . employment affects more than just engineers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : engineers ' higher pay means more money to spend in stores the ones that do find a job can usually look forward to above-average salaries .
while recent graduate meilgen declined to say how much he would earn at his new job , starting salaries range from 30,000 euros to 45,000 euros -lrb- $ 35,938 to $ 53,908 -rrb- .
more experienced employees average 65,000 euros a year , according to vdi statistics . in 2003 , the most recently recorded year , the average german employee earned 26,700 euros , according to germany 's federal statistics office . the social benefits of getting open engineering positions filled could be a windfall for germany 's sluggish economy and languishing labor market , schwarz added . newly employed engineers along with their above-average paychecks and buying power typically have the potential to create 2.3 additional jobs in other fields , including production and retail , theoretically leading to 35,000 new jobs if the vdi 's estimate of 15,000 open engineering positions were filled . germans critical of innovation made in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans rank their own innovativeness below that of japan and the us other than getting jobs filled , one of sachen machen 's most difficult tasks will be convincing germans of their country 's abilities , which many foreign countries already recognize . despite having registered more patents than any other european country , a 2004 vdi survey showed only 6 percent of germans ranked their native land as the most innovative .
japan and the united states respectively scored 40 percent and 21 percent . internationally , however , germany 's engineers continue to enjoy the positive reputation earned on the back of names like mercedes , zeiss and siemens .
a 2005 study by ernst & young reported that 28 percent of international companies surveyed ranked german employees as europe 's most qualified . " we can not be cheaper than the workers in china , india or eastern europe , but we can be better , " sepp heckmann , chairman of deutsche messe said at sachen machen 's opening press conference at the beginning of february .

" the group , ansar al-tawheed wal sunnah -lrb- followers of unity and prophetic tradition -rrb- , threatened to kill the two hostages held in iraq if the government does not give in to the demands of the group , " said the channel 's presenter .

there is already a general agreement that children from migrant families should be given extra help in schools to develop their german language schools but the citizenship test question is another matter . böhmer 's draft test , which will be presented and debated in government , is designed along the lines of citizenship courses in the united states to " help those who want to become naturalized germans " by teaching and testing migrants on the german constitution , the history of the country but while " remaining sympathetic to their own values .

she admits to casting envious glances over the border to france where there is a charter designed to give young migrant workers the chance to find work .

the european commission - the bloc 's executive arm - says a shake-up is urgently needed to spur employment and growth in europe 's long-flagging economy . despite deep divisions in the past over the new eu laws , the main political groups in the parliament say that views are converging ahead of the long-awaited vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european parliament in strasbourg the emerging consensus only became possible after the european people 's party -lrb- epp -rrb- and the socialists , the two biggest groups , agreed last week to strike out the most controversial proposal , which would let service providers operate in other member states under the rules of their home country . that article stoked fears in older member states such as belgium , france and sweden of an influx of service providers - epitomized by ' polish plumbers ' - from newer , low-wage eu members undercutting local competitors . fragile compromise but the compromise between right and left is fragile and the text is likely to evolve in the days ahead of the vote as tough haggling gets underway to cement a broader position in the parliament . some hard bargaining is also in store over which services should be excluded from tougher cross-border competition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where will it come from in the future ?
although the most controversial element has been excised from the proposed text , unions want further changes to the plans .
they want public services like water distribution to be excluded and have promised a big demonstration on tuesday in strasbourg to keep the pressure up . but talk of raising the number of exclusions has also fuelled concern that that too many would empty the reform of substance . " too many exceptions would rip the heart out of the directive and undermine its original objective , " a spokesman for the liberal democrat group said . stayi n g o n track bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrations also took place in berlin saturday britain , the czech republic , hungary , the netherlands , poland and spain voiced concern on feb .
10 that the plans risked losing sight of their original aim if they were watered down too much . " in the quest for compromise , we must remain focused on the key objective of an effective internal market , while ensuring that legitimate concerns are met , " they said in a joint letter to the european commission . if eu lawmakers give the green light to the plans in a first reading , the package will then go to the commission and member states for review . austria , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , has said it wants an agreement on a text more or less in its final form before it hands over the eu reins to finland in june . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frits bolkestein by then , the package will have traveled a long way and stirred up much controversy since former internal market commissioner frits bolkestein put the plans on the table in early 2004 . although they went largely unnoticed at first , they became the emblem of perceived brussels neo-liberalism for leftwing campaigners against the eu 's draft constitution ahead of referenda in france and the netherlands last year . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu port services bill rejected by lawmakers eu lawmakers on wednesday rejected plans to free up europe 's port services in a vote two days after protestors brought docks to a standstill and staged violent demonstrations outside the european parliament .

the european commission - the bloc 's executive arm - says a shake-up is urgently needed to spur employment and growth in europe 's long-flagging economy . despite deep divisions in the past over the new eu laws , the main political groups in the parliament say that views are converging ahead of the long-awaited vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european parliament in strasbourg the emerging consensus only became possible after the european people 's party -lrb- epp -rrb- and the socialists , the two biggest groups , agreed last week to strike out the most controversial proposal , which would let service providers operate in other member states under the rules of their home country . that article stoked fears in older member states such as belgium , france and sweden of an influx of service providers - epitomized by ' polish plumbers ' - from newer , low-wage eu members undercutting local competitors . fragile compromise but the compromise between right and left is fragile and the text is likely to evolve in the days ahead of the vote as tough haggling gets underway to cement a broader position in the parliament . some hard bargaining is also in store over which services should be excluded from tougher cross-border competition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where will it come from in the future ?
although the most controversial element has been excised from the proposed text , unions want further changes to the plans .
they want public services like water distribution to be excluded and have promised a big demonstration on tuesday in strasbourg to keep the pressure up . but talk of raising the number of exclusions has also fuelled concern that that too many would empty the reform of substance . " too many exceptions would rip the heart out of the directive and undermine its original objective , " a spokesman for the liberal democrat group said . stayi n g o n track bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrations also took place in berlin saturday britain , the czech republic , hungary , the netherlands , poland and spain voiced concern on feb .
10 that the plans risked losing sight of their original aim if they were watered down too much . " in the quest for compromise , we must remain focused on the key objective of an effective internal market , while ensuring that legitimate concerns are met , " they said in a joint letter to the european commission . if eu lawmakers give the green light to the plans in a first reading , the package will then go to the commission and member states for review . austria , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , has said it wants an agreement on a text more or less in its final form before it hands over the eu reins to finland in june . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frits bolkestein by then , the package will have traveled a long way and stirred up much controversy since former internal market commissioner frits bolkestein put the plans on the table in early 2004 . although they went largely unnoticed at first , they became the emblem of perceived brussels neo-liberalism for leftwing campaigners against the eu 's draft constitution ahead of referenda in france and the netherlands last year . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu port services bill rejected by lawmakers eu lawmakers on wednesday rejected plans to free up europe 's port services in a vote two days after protestors brought docks to a standstill and staged violent demonstrations outside the european parliament .

there is already a general agreement that children from migrant families should be given extra help in schools to develop their german language schools but the citizenship test question is another matter . böhmer 's draft test , which will be presented and debated in government , is designed along the lines of citizenship courses in the united states to " help those who want to become naturalized germans " by teaching and testing migrants on the german constitution , the history of the country but while " remaining sympathetic to their own values . " " the united states gives courses in the constitution , the history , culture and the values of the country , " she said .
" since those who come here do n't only want to live and work in germany but to become german , we should give them as much help as possible . " ehrhart körting , from berlin 's interior ministry , is one of those who , in theory , is in favor of the tests although he sees very little point in asking those immigrants who have lived in germany for ten to 15 years to take the test .

bruch is not against reasonable alternatives , he stressed , where a person is interviewed on whether they " respect the constitution and the democratic processes of germany " and fully supports the improvement of language courses . there is certainly a deficit in the language tuition of migrant children , something maria böhmer wants to address .
she believes that every euro invested in improving language courses will be paid back several times by well-equipped and integrated members of society contributing to the economy . böhmer sees the future of integration in germany also taking the form of more educational opportunities and employment chances for youngsters from migrant families .
she admits to casting envious glances over the border to france where there is a charter designed to give young migrant workers the chance to find work . " i have had conversations with trade associations , and i am now involved in bringing the subject of migration into the sphere of the large companies in germany , " böhmer said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : spotlight on the berlinale berlinale film lineup includes four german entries tracking the golden bear berlinale strikes a serious note " love never goes out of fashion " culture & lifestyle -pipe- 13.02.2006 german favorite at berlinale disappoints großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the film is studded with a who 's who of german cinema this year 's hottest german entry at the berlinale , " elementary particles , " an on-screen adaptation of the eponymous french novel , boasts a star-heavy cast .
but critics are n't impressed . there was standing room only in the conference room at the hyatt hotel in downtown berlin on saturday afternoon as the cast of the much-awaited german competition entry " elementary particles " appeared to talk to the international media after the first screening of the film . " it 's often said that the german film scene does n't have any stars , but the podium here shows that is n't true , " said the moderator of the press conference as flash bulbs popped incessantly and the crush of journalists thrust a sea of microphones and tv cameras at the stage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from right , moritz bleibtreu , franka potente and nina hoss indeed , the line-up of " elementary particles " reads like a who 's who of german cinema .
starring moritz bleibtreu and franka potente -lrb- both of " run lola run " fame -rrb- , christian ulmen , martina gedeck and nina hoss -lrb- all household names in germany -rrb- , the movie is based on the eponymous book by french author michel houellebecq .
it 's directed by german director oskar roehler and produced by bernd eichinger -lrb- " the downfall " -rrb- . houellebecq 's book , published in 1998 , polarized opinion with its nihilistic view of the world , soulless sex and savage attacks against individualism , commercialization and the idealism of the 1968 generation . depressing and cynical the work , which caused an uproar in france , became a bestseller in europe and made houellebecq a literary star .
in germany , the book , with its mix of nietzschean philosophy , scientific experiment , pornographic scenes and jaded bitterness , became something of a sensation . over 80,000 hard-cover versions and 150,000 paperbacks were sold in germany as at least a dozen theaters toyed with the idea of turning it into a play . the movie reflects the bleakness of the book in the form of two half brothers bruno -lrb- bleibtreu -rrb- , a sex-obsessed school teacher who is n't so lucky with women in real life , and michel -lrb- ulmen -rrb- , a brilliant and inhibited molecular biologist who 's researching human cloning and has never slept with a woman .
both have gotten to know each other during their teenage years after their hippie mother -lrb- played by nina hoss -rrb- leaves them in the care of their grandmother and heads off to india to revel in sex , drugs and rock ' n ' roll . the film , which deals with bruno and michel 's frustration with life and women , is ultimately a quest by the brothers to find love in their own ways . film more conciliatory unlike the book , the film is much more conciliatory in tone , with both finding the right women at the end .
it also avoids much of the radicalism and repugnance that made the novel such a sensation . michel is reunited with his childhood friend annabelle -lrb- played by potente -rrb- , and bruno finds love , albeit temporarily , in the form of christiane -lrb- gedeck -rrb- , who he gets to know at a nudist spiritual camp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roehler admits he 's toned down the on-screen adaptation of elementary particles director oskar roehler said he could relate to houellebecq 's pessimism . " the question of whether it 's filmable or not , was n't important for me .
it simply fascinated me , " roehler said , adding that he saw himself as something of a pessimist too .
" forced optimism in the face of the current social situation is strange to me , " said the director , who took five years to make the movie . at the same time , roehler admitted that the film deliberately steers clear of the extreme darkness of the book . " i find it interesting to show what people do when they are in deep shit , " said roehler .
" but the completely fatalistic tone of the book could n't be just taken over , " roehler said .
" houellebecq gives us a key to understanding society that i find absolutely brilliant , " roehler said . " but i did n't want to take over houellebecq 's moral .
we did n't want to leave our protagonists in the lurch .
our film does n't deny faith in mankind . " producer bernd eichinger pointed out that the whole point had been to present an overall impression of houellebecq 's work .
" you ca n't film social criticism , only melodramas , " eichinger said . " huge testimony to love " of all the actors present on stage , martina gedeck - who plays bruno 's true love christiane , a sexually-uninhibited woman secretly battling a serious illness - was the most enthusiastic about the film . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martina gedeck and moritz bleibtreu " christiane has no sentimental expectations .
she 's a good loser and how she and bruno find each other is a huge testimony to love , " gedeck said . frank potente , who became known to international audiences as the sprinting redhead in " run lola run " and also starred in " the bourne identity " alongside matt damon , said she was excited about being represented at the competition category of the berlinale for the first time .
potente delivers a somewhat wooden performance in " elementary particles " as annabelle , a 30-plus lonely librarian in berlin . critics slam film despite its overwhelming star appeal , the film has largely received poor reviews in germany . the berlin-based newspaper die welt called the film " really straight , almost drab , " saying the punch was missing .
" the most trenchant scenes have been removed , others rendered harmless , the whole thing generally toned down .
houellebecq has been given some really gentle treatment . " " the most impressive thing about ' elementary particles ' is nina hoss ' face mask , " wrote news magazine der spiegel , referring to hoss ' decay as she lies on her death bed in one scene , her aged face mottled with bulging veins . " houllebecq , the cynic , drove his protagonists into the abyss with glee .
roehler , the director , on the other hand has sympathy with his characters , " it wrote . " all that the spectator is left with is the recognition that you ca n't film ' elementary particles ' .

in iran nuclear crisis , all eyes turn to russia world powers split over iran nuclear program iran calls un referral " the end of diplomacy " europe -pipe- 13.02.2006 enrichment row escalates as iran crosses the line großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad takes the standoff to a new level iran has started putting uranium feedstock gas into centrifuges , defying the west with actual enrichment work on making what can be nuclear reactor fuel or atom bomb material , diplomats told reporters monday . uranium enrichment is seen as a red line by the united states and european union in the long-running international standoff over iran 's nuclear program , as it is crucial to making atomic weapons . putting uranium hexafluoride -lrb- uf6 -rrb- gas into centrifuges , which distill out enriched uranium , appears a major escalation by iran in its face-off with the west over a nuclear program which the united states claims hides secret atomic weapons development . iran said monday that it would resume uranium enrichment even before the un watchdog international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- meets next month in vienna to decide whether to recommend un security council action against tehran . the diplomats ' comments in vienna appear to show iran is following through with its threat .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 13.02.2006 new campaign seeks to calm germans ' anglomania großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will he grow up speaking german or some strange hybrid tongue ?
the use of foreign words in german is nothing new , but more and more anglicisms are creeping in , upsetting some language mavens .
the new " living german " campaign advocates finding german equivalents of english words . to the initiators of the campaign , words like cou n tdow n , shareholder value and homepage are unnecessary .
not in english , where they are at home , but in german , where they are used more frequently by german speakers . the " living german " campaign wants germans to use german words for these ideas , and not depend on english imports , which , they say , many people simply do n't understand .
and , to top it off , many are simply " ugly , " according to those supporting the campaign . instead of shareholder value , why not use the good old teutonic aktio n ärs n utze n ?
instead of the internet-age homepage , why not startseite ?
it does use a borrowed english word , " start , " but it 's well-known in germany and is short , pithy and to the point , making it acceptable to the language watchdogs . " we affirm the enriching of german through foreign languages and we even welcome certain imports from english , " said the campaign 's organizers in a statement .
" our initiative is aimed only against anglomania , against excess . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another anglicism ?
some germans are throwing their hands in the air the language experts who are spearheading this attempt to clean up the german tongue - author wolf schneider , german teachers ' association president josef kraus and head of the german language association walter krämer - insist they are not being fuddy-duddies who want to take german back to some utopian " purity . "
they simply want language to serve the function it is meant to , communication . they point to a 2003 study that looked at whether germans actually understood 12 english expressions that were used by german companies in their marketing or advertising materials .
the results were not promising ; a maximum of 59 percent understood what the companies were trying to get across .

making the profession more appealing could be a boon for german companies and help boost the economy , according to one of the country 's engineering groups . though christoph meilgen had to face rejection letters similar to those seen by germany 's five million unemployed , his doctorate in mechanical engineering helped him into a position many unemployed dream of : being able to turn down two positions and hold out for a job he wanted . " companies want practical , technical knowledge that goes well beyond what you get in school , " said meilgen , who took at position at lvq-wp in the industrial ruhr region of western germany after defending his thesis at kaiserslautern 's technical university this month .
" but there 's a need for engineers , you do n't need to take any offer . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finding research engineers is already difficult for many companies meilgen 's position is not an unusual one for recent graduates with engineering credentials .
seventy-three percent of middle-sized german companies said they see finding qualified employees as their most demanding task for the next five years , according to a february poll by tns infratest . germany 's position as a technological leader could be in danger if companies are n't able to find skilled new hires , according to michael schwartz , a spokesperson for the association of german engineers -lrb- vdi -rrb- . " germany today is lacking 15,000 engineers , 11,500 in small and middle-sized business alone , " he said .
" the difficulties many research and development companies are having filling positions could impair or even hold off innovation . " program encourages more students to " make things " after watching the number of students entering engineering fields drop 12 percent since a high of 87,542 in 2003 , the vdi , along with a group of 44 partners , including deutsche welle as a media partner , decided to start an initiative called sachen machen -lrb- make things -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : men make up nearly 84 percent of students in technical fields financed by the vdi and its partners , the program , slated to last at least five years , has set itself the goal of making germany the home of new technology by 2015 by achieving the world 's per capita leader in graduates with math , technical , it and natural science degrees ; employees in research and development ; research spending and patent registration . " we can not afford not to be successful , " schwarz said , referring to the program 's goal of boosting interest in technical fields among students and optimizing cooperation between science and businesses .
" if there are no new comers to fill the positions , products and services wo n't be able to be offered . " some engineers still ca n't find work that 's an argument germany 's 64,000 unemployed engineers do n't understand .
a number of factors are keeping these engineers from finding work , according to the german federal labor office 's beate raabe . " many of the unemployed are over 50 and some companies have the preconception that they do not have the most up-to-date technical knowledge , " she said in an interview with münchner merkur newspaper . while companies are looking for mechanical and electrical engineers , the market for architects and civil engineers is saturated , creating a mismatch between what they can offer and what is needed , schwarz added . employment affects more than just engineers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : engineers ' higher pay means more money to spend in stores the ones that do find a job can usually look forward to above-average salaries .
while recent graduate meilgen declined to say how much he would earn at his new job , starting salaries range from 30,000 euros to 45,000 euros -lrb- $ 35,938 to $ 53,908 -rrb- .
more experienced employees average 65,000 euros a year , according to vdi statistics . in 2003 , the most recently recorded year , the average german employee earned 26,700 euros , according to germany 's federal statistics office . the social benefits of getting open engineering positions filled could be a windfall for germany 's sluggish economy and languishing labor market , schwarz added . newly employed engineers along with their above-average paychecks and buying power typically have the potential to create 2.3 additional jobs in other fields , including production and retail , theoretically leading to 35,000 new jobs if the vdi 's estimate of 15,000 open engineering positions were filled . germans critical of innovation made in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans rank their own innovativeness below that of japan and the us other than getting jobs filled , one of sachen machen 's most difficult tasks will be convincing germans of their country 's abilities , which many foreign countries already recognize . despite having registered more patents than any other european country , a 2004 vdi survey showed only 6 percent of germans ranked their native land as the most innovative .
japan and the united states respectively scored 40 percent and 21 percent . internationally , however , germany 's engineers continue to enjoy the positive reputation earned on the back of names like mercedes , zeiss and siemens .
a 2005 study by ernst & young reported that 28 percent of international companies surveyed ranked german employees as europe 's most qualified . " we can not be cheaper than the workers in china , india or eastern europe , but we can be better , " sepp heckmann , chairman of deutsche messe said at sachen machen 's opening press conference at the beginning of february .

public workers expanded their week-old work stoppage on monday in a dispute over longer hours . this first widespread stoppage in 14 years has targeted trash collection , child care facilities , hospitals and road works , and on monday , public workers in nine of germany 's 14 federal states walked off the job , compared to only two last week . the regions effected by the strike include germany 's most populous state , north rhine-westphalia , home to some 17 million people . however , not all workers are striking simultaneously , which has limited the disruption . the strike started a week ago in the state of baden-württemberg and was called by the public sector union ver.di to prevent the employers from extending the working week from 38.5 to 40 hours . in a strike ballot , 94.5 percent of ver.di members voted in favor of industrial action . " there could not have been a more decisive outcome of this ballot or a more decisive vote in favor a strike , " said the head of the public-service union , frank bsirske . despite negotiations on the weekend between unions and employers , no agreement was reached . ca n't dictate work hours bsirske told the mass circulation tabloid bild on monday that strikes would continue until employers realized that they could not dictate to their staff how long should they should work . a 40-hour week would mean extending the working day by 18 minutes .
bsirske says this may not sound like much , but is equivalent to working an extra two weeks a year without pay . he also accused the employers of using longer working hours as an excuse to cut jobs , of which he said a quarter of a million were at risk . speaking for employers , the finance minister of the state of lower saxony , hartmut möllring , recalled that germany 's public sector worked a forty-hour week until 1989 .
that was acceptable in those days , he said , when local authorities , relatively speaking , had plenty of money at their disposal .
it should also be acceptable now , he added . he also pointed out a forty-hour week was already being worked in eastern germany .
möllring emphasised that workers in the public sector had secure jobs . " surely a secure job is worth working an extra 18 minutes a day , " möllring said . bsirske dismisses the secure jobs argument as fiction .

public workers expanded their week-old work stoppage on monday in a dispute over longer hours . this first widespread stoppage in 14 years has targeted trash collection , child care facilities , hospitals and road works , and on monday , public workers in nine of germany 's 14 federal states walked off the job , compared to only two last week . the regions effected by the strike include germany 's most populous state , north rhine-westphalia , home to some 17 million people . however , not all workers are striking simultaneously , which has limited the disruption . the strike started a week ago in the state of baden-württemberg and was called by the public sector union ver.di to prevent the employers from extending the working week from 38.5 to 40 hours . in a strike ballot , 94.5 percent of ver.di members voted in favor of industrial action . " there could not have been a more decisive outcome of this ballot or a more decisive vote in favor a strike , " said the head of the public-service union , frank bsirske . despite negotiations on the weekend between unions and employers , no agreement was reached . ca n't dictate work hours bsirske told the mass circulation tabloid bild on monday that strikes would continue until employers realized that they could not dictate to their staff how long should they should work . a 40-hour week would mean extending the working day by 18 minutes .
bsirske says this may not sound like much , but is equivalent to working an extra two weeks a year without pay . he also accused the employers of using longer working hours as an excuse to cut jobs , of which he said a quarter of a million were at risk . speaking for employers , the finance minister of the state of lower saxony , hartmut möllring , recalled that germany 's public sector worked a forty-hour week until 1989 .
that was acceptable in those days , he said , when local authorities , relatively speaking , had plenty of money at their disposal .
it should also be acceptable now , he added . he also pointed out a forty-hour week was already being worked in eastern germany .
möllring emphasised that workers in the public sector had secure jobs . " surely a secure job is worth working an extra 18 minutes a day , " möllring said . bsirske dismisses the secure jobs argument as fiction .
in child-care facilities and hospitals , almost three quarters of all workers are on short-term contracts , he explained . he warned local and regional authorities that the union had funds to support a strike lasting " many weeks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.02.2006 german public sector strike expands großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the public-sector strike is getting bigger - and noisier germany 's public sector is facing large scale industrial action for the first time in more than a decade .
public workers expanded their week-old work stoppage on monday in a dispute over longer hours . this first widespread stoppage in 14 years has targeted trash collection , child care facilities , hospitals and road works , and on monday , public workers in nine of germany 's 14 federal states walked off the job , compared to only two last week . the regions effected by the strike include germany 's most populous state , north rhine-westphalia , home to some 17 million people . however , not all workers are striking simultaneously , which has limited the disruption . the strike started a week ago in the state of baden-württemberg and was called by the public sector union ver.di to prevent the employers from extending the working week from 38.5 to 40 hours . in a strike ballot , 94.5 percent of ver.di members voted in favor of industrial action . " there could not have been a more decisive outcome of this ballot or a more decisive vote in favor a strike , " said the head of the public-service union , frank bsirske . despite negotiations on the weekend between unions and employers , no agreement was reached . ca n't dictate work hours bsirske told the mass circulation tabloid bild on monday that strikes would continue until employers realized that they could not dictate to their staff how long should they should work . a 40-hour week would mean extending the working day by 18 minutes .
bsirske says this may not sound like much , but is equivalent to working an extra two weeks a year without pay . he also accused the employers of using longer working hours as an excuse to cut jobs , of which he said a quarter of a million were at risk . speaking for employers , the finance minister of the state of lower saxony , hartmut möllring , recalled that germany 's public sector worked a forty-hour week until 1989 .
that was acceptable in those days , he said , when local authorities , relatively speaking , had plenty of money at their disposal .
it should also be acceptable now , he added . he also pointed out a forty-hour week was already being worked in eastern germany .
möllring emphasised that workers in the public sector had secure jobs . " surely a secure job is worth working an extra 18 minutes a day , " möllring said . bsirske dismisses the secure jobs argument as fiction .
in child-care facilities and hospitals , almost three quarters of all workers are on short-term contracts , he explained . he warned local and regional authorities that the union had funds to support a strike lasting " many weeks .

public workers expanded their week-old work stoppage on monday in a dispute over longer hours . this first widespread stoppage in 14 years has targeted trash collection , child care facilities , hospitals and road works , and on monday , public workers in nine of germany 's 14 federal states walked off the job , compared to only two last week . the regions effected by the strike include germany 's most populous state , north rhine-westphalia , home to some 17 million people . however , not all workers are striking simultaneously , which has limited the disruption . the strike started a week ago in the state of baden-württemberg and was called by the public sector union ver.di to prevent the employers from extending the working week from 38.5 to 40 hours . in a strike ballot , 94.5 percent of ver.di members voted in favor of industrial action . " there could not have been a more decisive outcome of this ballot or a more decisive vote in favor a strike , " said the head of the public-service union , frank bsirske . despite negotiations on the weekend between unions and employers , no agreement was reached . ca n't dictate work hours bsirske told the mass circulation tabloid bild on monday that strikes would continue until employers realized that they could not dictate to their staff how long should they should work . a 40-hour week would mean extending the working day by 18 minutes .
bsirske says this may not sound like much , but is equivalent to working an extra two weeks a year without pay . he also accused the employers of using longer working hours as an excuse to cut jobs , of which he said a quarter of a million were at risk . speaking for employers , the finance minister of the state of lower saxony , hartmut möllring , recalled that germany 's public sector worked a forty-hour week until 1989 .
that was acceptable in those days , he said , when local authorities , relatively speaking , had plenty of money at their disposal .
it should also be acceptable now , he added . he also pointed out a forty-hour week was already being worked in eastern germany .
möllring emphasised that workers in the public sector had secure jobs . " surely a secure job is worth working an extra 18 minutes a day , " möllring said . bsirske dismisses the secure jobs argument as fiction .
in child-care facilities and hospitals , almost three quarters of all workers are on short-term contracts , he explained . he warned local and regional authorities that the union had funds to support a strike lasting " many weeks .

in iran nuclear crisis , all eyes turn to russia world powers split over iran nuclear program iran calls un referral " the end of diplomacy " europe -pipe- 13.02.2006 enrichment row escalates as iran crosses the line großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad takes the standoff to a new level iran has started putting uranium feedstock gas into centrifuges , defying the west with actual enrichment work on making what can be nuclear reactor fuel or atom bomb material , diplomats told reporters monday . uranium enrichment is seen as a red line by the united states and european union in the long-running international standoff over iran 's nuclear program , as it is crucial to making atomic weapons . putting uranium hexafluoride -lrb- uf6 -rrb- gas into centrifuges , which distill out enriched uranium , appears a major escalation by iran in its face-off with the west over a nuclear program which the united states claims hides secret atomic weapons development . iran said monday that it would resume uranium enrichment even before the un watchdog international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- meets next month in vienna to decide whether to recommend un security council action against tehran . the diplomats ' comments in vienna appear to show iran is following through with its threat . " iran has put gas into centrifuges at its pilot enrichment plant in natanz , " a diplomat said .
the diplomat , who asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue , said iran had not yet fired up the whole 164-centrifuge cascade but had " over the past two or three days " started work with some centrifuges . a second diplomat said iran was doing " preliminary work " with " stand-alone " centrifuges , almost certainly putting uranium gas into single machines rather than a whole cascade . first step in a potential full scale enrichment program bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has started preparation for widescale enrichment at natanz the diplomat said this was necessary in a step-by-step approach involving first getting centrifuges running , then operating a pilot plant , which iran has dubbed research , and then moving on to industrial-scale enrichment with thousands of centrifuges . iran says its nuclear program is a peaceful effort to generate electricity and that it only wants to produce low enriched uranium , which is not refined enough for weapons use .
but it wants to install over 50,000 centrifuges at natanz , an array which could produce enough highly enriched uranium every two or three weeks for one atom bomb . iran had suspended uranium enrichment until talks with an eu negotiating troika , aimed at winning guarantees that the program is peaceful , broke down last month . since august , though , it has been making the feedstock uf6 at a conversion plant in isfahan .
the west has seemed ready to let tehran continue with this work , which technically is part of nuclear fuel activities the eu says should be suspended , as long as the islamic republic did not actually enrich . asked monday in tehran whether iran would wait for the march 6 iaea board of governors ' meeting to resume industrial-scale enrichment , government spokesman gholam hossein elham told reporters " no , no . " one month diplomacy window slamming shut bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the diplomacy window and russia 's offer have been ignored by iran the iaea had voted february 4 to report iran to the security council , but left a one-month window for diplomacy for iran to return to a full suspension of enrichment-related work and cooperate more with iaea inspectors . the iranian government spokesman also announced that talks between tehran and moscow would not go ahead as planned on thursday . the talks are aimed at negotiating a compromise in the standoff by having iranian uranium enriched on russian soil so that tehran would not master the technology itself . however , russian deputy foreign minister sergei kislyak said moscow still expected the iranian delegation , adding : " our offer for the 16th -lrb- february -rrb- still stands . " the iranian spokesman said " new elements " were responsible for the delay , notably the fact that the iranian government " insists that uranium enrichment for peaceful purposes is carried out inside the country .

in iran nuclear crisis , all eyes turn to russia world powers split over iran nuclear program iran calls un referral " the end of diplomacy " europe -pipe- 13.02.2006 enrichment row escalates as iran crosses the line großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad takes the standoff to a new level iran has started putting uranium feedstock gas into centrifuges , defying the west with actual enrichment work on making what can be nuclear reactor fuel or atom bomb material , diplomats told reporters monday . uranium enrichment is seen as a red line by the united states and european union in the long-running international standoff over iran 's nuclear program , as it is crucial to making atomic weapons . putting uranium hexafluoride -lrb- uf6 -rrb- gas into centrifuges , which distill out enriched uranium , appears a major escalation by iran in its face-off with the west over a nuclear program which the united states claims hides secret atomic weapons development . iran said monday that it would resume uranium enrichment even before the un watchdog international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- meets next month in vienna to decide whether to recommend un security council action against tehran . the diplomats ' comments in vienna appear to show iran is following through with its threat . " iran has put gas into centrifuges at its pilot enrichment plant in natanz , " a diplomat said .
the diplomat , who asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue , said iran had not yet fired up the whole 164-centrifuge cascade but had " over the past two or three days " started work with some centrifuges . a second diplomat said iran was doing " preliminary work " with " stand-alone " centrifuges , almost certainly putting uranium gas into single machines rather than a whole cascade . first step in a potential full scale enrichment program bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has started preparation for widescale enrichment at natanz the diplomat said this was necessary in a step-by-step approach involving first getting centrifuges running , then operating a pilot plant , which iran has dubbed research , and then moving on to industrial-scale enrichment with thousands of centrifuges . iran says its nuclear program is a peaceful effort to generate electricity and that it only wants to produce low enriched uranium , which is not refined enough for weapons use .
but it wants to install over 50,000 centrifuges at natanz , an array which could produce enough highly enriched uranium every two or three weeks for one atom bomb . iran had suspended uranium enrichment until talks with an eu negotiating troika , aimed at winning guarantees that the program is peaceful , broke down last month . since august , though , it has been making the feedstock uf6 at a conversion plant in isfahan .
the west has seemed ready to let tehran continue with this work , which technically is part of nuclear fuel activities the eu says should be suspended , as long as the islamic republic did not actually enrich . asked monday in tehran whether iran would wait for the march 6 iaea board of governors ' meeting to resume industrial-scale enrichment , government spokesman gholam hossein elham told reporters " no , no .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : spotlight on the berlinale berlinale film lineup includes four german entries tracking the golden bear berlinale strikes a serious note " love never goes out of fashion " culture & lifestyle -pipe- 13.02.2006 german favorite at berlinale disappoints großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the film is studded with a who 's who of german cinema this year 's hottest german entry at the berlinale , " elementary particles , " an on-screen adaptation of the eponymous french novel , boasts a star-heavy cast .
but critics are n't impressed . there was standing room only in the conference room at the hyatt hotel in downtown berlin on saturday afternoon as the cast of the much-awaited german competition entry " elementary particles " appeared to talk to the international media after the first screening of the film . " it 's often said that the german film scene does n't have any stars , but the podium here shows that is n't true , " said the moderator of the press conference as flash bulbs popped incessantly and the crush of journalists thrust a sea of microphones and tv cameras at the stage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from right , moritz bleibtreu , franka potente and nina hoss indeed , the line-up of " elementary particles " reads like a who 's who of german cinema .
starring moritz bleibtreu and franka potente -lrb- both of " run lola run " fame -rrb- , christian ulmen , martina gedeck and nina hoss -lrb- all household names in germany -rrb- , the movie is based on the eponymous book by french author michel houellebecq .
it 's directed by german director oskar roehler and produced by bernd eichinger -lrb- " the downfall " -rrb- . houellebecq 's book , published in 1998 , polarized opinion with its nihilistic view of the world , soulless sex and savage attacks against individualism , commercialization and the idealism of the 1968 generation . depressing and cynical the work , which caused an uproar in france , became a bestseller in europe and made houellebecq a literary star .
in germany , the book , with its mix of nietzschean philosophy , scientific experiment , pornographic scenes and jaded bitterness , became something of a sensation . over 80,000 hard-cover versions and 150,000 paperbacks were sold in germany as at least a dozen theaters toyed with the idea of turning it into a play . the movie reflects the bleakness of the book in the form of two half brothers bruno -lrb- bleibtreu -rrb- , a sex-obsessed school teacher who is n't so lucky with women in real life , and michel -lrb- ulmen -rrb- , a brilliant and inhibited molecular biologist who 's researching human cloning and has never slept with a woman .
both have gotten to know each other during their teenage years after their hippie mother -lrb- played by nina hoss -rrb- leaves them in the care of their grandmother and heads off to india to revel in sex , drugs and rock ' n ' roll . the film , which deals with bruno and michel 's frustration with life and women , is ultimately a quest by the brothers to find love in their own ways . film more conciliatory unlike the book , the film is much more conciliatory in tone , with both finding the right women at the end .
it also avoids much of the radicalism and repugnance that made the novel such a sensation . michel is reunited with his childhood friend annabelle -lrb- played by potente -rrb- , and bruno finds love , albeit temporarily , in the form of christiane -lrb- gedeck -rrb- , who he gets to know at a nudist spiritual camp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roehler admits he 's toned down the on-screen adaptation of elementary particles director oskar roehler said he could relate to houellebecq 's pessimism .

" forced optimism in the face of the current social situation is strange to me , " said the director , who took five years to make the movie . at the same time , roehler admitted that the film deliberately steers clear of the extreme darkness of the book .

the european commission - the bloc 's executive arm - says a shake-up is urgently needed to spur employment and growth in europe 's long-flagging economy . despite deep divisions in the past over the new eu laws , the main political groups in the parliament say that views are converging ahead of the long-awaited vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european parliament in strasbourg the emerging consensus only became possible after the european people 's party -lrb- epp -rrb- and the socialists , the two biggest groups , agreed last week to strike out the most controversial proposal , which would let service providers operate in other member states under the rules of their home country . that article stoked fears in older member states such as belgium , france and sweden of an influx of service providers - epitomized by ' polish plumbers ' - from newer , low-wage eu members undercutting local competitors . fragile compromise but the compromise between right and left is fragile and the text is likely to evolve in the days ahead of the vote as tough haggling gets underway to cement a broader position in the parliament . some hard bargaining is also in store over which services should be excluded from tougher cross-border competition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where will it come from in the future ?
although the most controversial element has been excised from the proposed text , unions want further changes to the plans .
they want public services like water distribution to be excluded and have promised a big demonstration on tuesday in strasbourg to keep the pressure up . but talk of raising the number of exclusions has also fuelled concern that that too many would empty the reform of substance . " too many exceptions would rip the heart out of the directive and undermine its original objective , " a spokesman for the liberal democrat group said . stayi n g o n track bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrations also took place in berlin saturday britain , the czech republic , hungary , the netherlands , poland and spain voiced concern on feb .
10 that the plans risked losing sight of their original aim if they were watered down too much . " in the quest for compromise , we must remain focused on the key objective of an effective internal market , while ensuring that legitimate concerns are met , " they said in a joint letter to the european commission . if eu lawmakers give the green light to the plans in a first reading , the package will then go to the commission and member states for review . austria , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , has said it wants an agreement on a text more or less in its final form before it hands over the eu reins to finland in june . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frits bolkestein by then , the package will have traveled a long way and stirred up much controversy since former internal market commissioner frits bolkestein put the plans on the table in early 2004 . although they went largely unnoticed at first , they became the emblem of perceived brussels neo-liberalism for leftwing campaigners against the eu 's draft constitution ahead of referenda in france and the netherlands last year . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu port services bill rejected by lawmakers eu lawmakers on wednesday rejected plans to free up europe 's port services in a vote two days after protestors brought docks to a standstill and staged violent demonstrations outside the european parliament .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : spotlight on the berlinale berlinale film lineup includes four german entries tracking the golden bear berlinale strikes a serious note " love never goes out of fashion " culture & lifestyle -pipe- 13.02.2006 german favorite at berlinale disappoints großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the film is studded with a who 's who of german cinema this year 's hottest german entry at the berlinale , " elementary particles , " an on-screen adaptation of the eponymous french novel , boasts a star-heavy cast .
but critics are n't impressed . there was standing room only in the conference room at the hyatt hotel in downtown berlin on saturday afternoon as the cast of the much-awaited german competition entry " elementary particles " appeared to talk to the international media after the first screening of the film . " it 's often said that the german film scene does n't have any stars , but the podium here shows that is n't true , " said the moderator of the press conference as flash bulbs popped incessantly and the crush of journalists thrust a sea of microphones and tv cameras at the stage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from right , moritz bleibtreu , franka potente and nina hoss indeed , the line-up of " elementary particles " reads like a who 's who of german cinema .
starring moritz bleibtreu and franka potente -lrb- both of " run lola run " fame -rrb- , christian ulmen , martina gedeck and nina hoss -lrb- all household names in germany -rrb- , the movie is based on the eponymous book by french author michel houellebecq .
it 's directed by german director oskar roehler and produced by bernd eichinger -lrb- " the downfall " -rrb- . houellebecq 's book , published in 1998 , polarized opinion with its nihilistic view of the world , soulless sex and savage attacks against individualism , commercialization and the idealism of the 1968 generation . depressing and cynical the work , which caused an uproar in france , became a bestseller in europe and made houellebecq a literary star .
in germany , the book , with its mix of nietzschean philosophy , scientific experiment , pornographic scenes and jaded bitterness , became something of a sensation . over 80,000 hard-cover versions and 150,000 paperbacks were sold in germany as at least a dozen theaters toyed with the idea of turning it into a play . the movie reflects the bleakness of the book in the form of two half brothers bruno -lrb- bleibtreu -rrb- , a sex-obsessed school teacher who is n't so lucky with women in real life , and michel -lrb- ulmen -rrb- , a brilliant and inhibited molecular biologist who 's researching human cloning and has never slept with a woman .
both have gotten to know each other during their teenage years after their hippie mother -lrb- played by nina hoss -rrb- leaves them in the care of their grandmother and heads off to india to revel in sex , drugs and rock ' n ' roll . the film , which deals with bruno and michel 's frustration with life and women , is ultimately a quest by the brothers to find love in their own ways . film more conciliatory unlike the book , the film is much more conciliatory in tone , with both finding the right women at the end .
it also avoids much of the radicalism and repugnance that made the novel such a sensation . michel is reunited with his childhood friend annabelle -lrb- played by potente -rrb- , and bruno finds love , albeit temporarily , in the form of christiane -lrb- gedeck -rrb- , who he gets to know at a nudist spiritual camp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roehler admits he 's toned down the on-screen adaptation of elementary particles director oskar roehler said he could relate to houellebecq 's pessimism . " the question of whether it 's filmable or not , was n't important for me .
it simply fascinated me , " roehler said , adding that he saw himself as something of a pessimist too .
" forced optimism in the face of the current social situation is strange to me , " said the director , who took five years to make the movie . at the same time , roehler admitted that the film deliberately steers clear of the extreme darkness of the book . " i find it interesting to show what people do when they are in deep shit , " said roehler .
" but the completely fatalistic tone of the book could n't be just taken over , " roehler said .

but critics are n't impressed . there was standing room only in the conference room at the hyatt hotel in downtown berlin on saturday afternoon as the cast of the much-awaited german competition entry " elementary particles " appeared to talk to the international media after the first screening of the film . " it 's often said that the german film scene does n't have any stars , but the podium here shows that is n't true , " said the moderator of the press conference as flash bulbs popped incessantly and the crush of journalists thrust a sea of microphones and tv cameras at the stage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from right , moritz bleibtreu , franka potente and nina hoss indeed , the line-up of " elementary particles " reads like a who 's who of german cinema .
starring moritz bleibtreu and franka potente -lrb- both of " run lola run " fame -rrb- , christian ulmen , martina gedeck and nina hoss -lrb- all household names in germany -rrb- , the movie is based on the eponymous book by french author michel houellebecq .
it 's directed by german director oskar roehler and produced by bernd eichinger -lrb- " the downfall " -rrb- . houellebecq 's book , published in 1998 , polarized opinion with its nihilistic view of the world , soulless sex and savage attacks against individualism , commercialization and the idealism of the 1968 generation . depressing and cynical the work , which caused an uproar in france , became a bestseller in europe and made houellebecq a literary star .
in germany , the book , with its mix of nietzschean philosophy , scientific experiment , pornographic scenes and jaded bitterness , became something of a sensation . over 80,000 hard-cover versions and 150,000 paperbacks were sold in germany as at least a dozen theaters toyed with the idea of turning it into a play . the movie reflects the bleakness of the book in the form of two half brothers bruno -lrb- bleibtreu -rrb- , a sex-obsessed school teacher who is n't so lucky with women in real life , and michel -lrb- ulmen -rrb- , a brilliant and inhibited molecular biologist who 's researching human cloning and has never slept with a woman .
both have gotten to know each other during their teenage years after their hippie mother -lrb- played by nina hoss -rrb- leaves them in the care of their grandmother and heads off to india to revel in sex , drugs and rock ' n ' roll . the film , which deals with bruno and michel 's frustration with life and women , is ultimately a quest by the brothers to find love in their own ways . film more conciliatory unlike the book , the film is much more conciliatory in tone , with both finding the right women at the end .
it also avoids much of the radicalism and repugnance that made the novel such a sensation . michel is reunited with his childhood friend annabelle -lrb- played by potente -rrb- , and bruno finds love , albeit temporarily , in the form of christiane -lrb- gedeck -rrb- , who he gets to know at a nudist spiritual camp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roehler admits he 's toned down the on-screen adaptation of elementary particles director oskar roehler said he could relate to houellebecq 's pessimism . " the question of whether it 's filmable or not , was n't important for me .
it simply fascinated me , " roehler said , adding that he saw himself as something of a pessimist too .
" forced optimism in the face of the current social situation is strange to me , " said the director , who took five years to make the movie . at the same time , roehler admitted that the film deliberately steers clear of the extreme darkness of the book . " i find it interesting to show what people do when they are in deep shit , " said roehler .
" but the completely fatalistic tone of the book could n't be just taken over , " roehler said .
" houellebecq gives us a key to understanding society that i find absolutely brilliant , " roehler said . " but i did n't want to take over houellebecq 's moral .

there is already a general agreement that children from migrant families should be given extra help in schools to develop their german language schools but the citizenship test question is another matter . böhmer 's draft test , which will be presented and debated in government , is designed along the lines of citizenship courses in the united states to " help those who want to become naturalized germans " by teaching and testing migrants on the german constitution , the history of the country but while " remaining sympathetic to their own values . " " the united states gives courses in the constitution , the history , culture and the values of the country , " she said .
" since those who come here do n't only want to live and work in germany but to become german , we should give them as much help as possible . " ehrhart körting , from berlin 's interior ministry , is one of those who , in theory , is in favor of the tests although he sees very little point in asking those immigrants who have lived in germany for ten to 15 years to take the test .
" the main focus should be on integration courses for new immigrants coming into the country for the first time , " he told reporters recently . critics want viable alternatives to citizenship tests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some politicians feel that an alternative to courses should be found rhineland-palatinate 's minister of the interior karl peter bruch is one who will oppose the tests .
" we will not have such a test , " the social democrat minister assured .
bruch is not against reasonable alternatives , he stressed , where a person is interviewed on whether they " respect the constitution and the democratic processes of germany " and fully supports the improvement of language courses . there is certainly a deficit in the language tuition of migrant children , something maria böhmer wants to address .
she believes that every euro invested in improving language courses will be paid back several times by well-equipped and integrated members of society contributing to the economy . böhmer sees the future of integration in germany also taking the form of more educational opportunities and employment chances for youngsters from migrant families .
she admits to casting envious glances over the border to france where there is a charter designed to give young migrant workers the chance to find work . " i have had conversations with trade associations , and i am now involved in bringing the subject of migration into the sphere of the large companies in germany , " böhmer said .

there is already a general agreement that children from migrant families should be given extra help in schools to develop their german language schools but the citizenship test question is another matter . böhmer 's draft test , which will be presented and debated in government , is designed along the lines of citizenship courses in the united states to " help those who want to become naturalized germans " by teaching and testing migrants on the german constitution , the history of the country but while " remaining sympathetic to their own values . " " the united states gives courses in the constitution , the history , culture and the values of the country , " she said .
" since those who come here do n't only want to live and work in germany but to become german , we should give them as much help as possible . " ehrhart körting , from berlin 's interior ministry , is one of those who , in theory , is in favor of the tests although he sees very little point in asking those immigrants who have lived in germany for ten to 15 years to take the test .
" the main focus should be on integration courses for new immigrants coming into the country for the first time , " he told reporters recently . critics want viable alternatives to citizenship tests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some politicians feel that an alternative to courses should be found rhineland-palatinate 's minister of the interior karl peter bruch is one who will oppose the tests .
" we will not have such a test , " the social democrat minister assured .
bruch is not against reasonable alternatives , he stressed , where a person is interviewed on whether they " respect the constitution and the democratic processes of germany " and fully supports the improvement of language courses . there is certainly a deficit in the language tuition of migrant children , something maria böhmer wants to address .
she believes that every euro invested in improving language courses will be paid back several times by well-equipped and integrated members of society contributing to the economy . böhmer sees the future of integration in germany also taking the form of more educational opportunities and employment chances for youngsters from migrant families .
she admits to casting envious glances over the border to france where there is a charter designed to give young migrant workers the chance to find work . " i have had conversations with trade associations , and i am now involved in bringing the subject of migration into the sphere of the large companies in germany , " böhmer said .

" the group , ansar al-tawheed wal sunnah -lrb- followers of unity and prophetic tradition -rrb- , threatened to kill the two hostages held in iraq if the government does not give in to the demands of the group , " said the channel 's presenter .
" the group said that this is a last warning before they kill the two hostages , " she said , without giving details over the length of the ultimatum .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 13.02.2006 new campaign seeks to calm germans ' anglomania großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will he grow up speaking german or some strange hybrid tongue ?
the use of foreign words in german is nothing new , but more and more anglicisms are creeping in , upsetting some language mavens .
the new " living german " campaign advocates finding german equivalents of english words . to the initiators of the campaign , words like cou n tdow n , shareholder value and homepage are unnecessary .
not in english , where they are at home , but in german , where they are used more frequently by german speakers . the " living german " campaign wants germans to use german words for these ideas , and not depend on english imports , which , they say , many people simply do n't understand .
and , to top it off , many are simply " ugly , " according to those supporting the campaign . instead of shareholder value , why not use the good old teutonic aktio n ärs n utze n ?
instead of the internet-age homepage , why not startseite ?
it does use a borrowed english word , " start , " but it 's well-known in germany and is short , pithy and to the point , making it acceptable to the language watchdogs . " we affirm the enriching of german through foreign languages and we even welcome certain imports from english , " said the campaign 's organizers in a statement .
" our initiative is aimed only against anglomania , against excess . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another anglicism ?
some germans are throwing their hands in the air the language experts who are spearheading this attempt to clean up the german tongue - author wolf schneider , german teachers ' association president josef kraus and head of the german language association walter krämer - insist they are not being fuddy-duddies who want to take german back to some utopian " purity . "
they simply want language to serve the function it is meant to , communication . they point to a 2003 study that looked at whether germans actually understood 12 english expressions that were used by german companies in their marketing or advertising materials .
the results were not promising ; a maximum of 59 percent understood what the companies were trying to get across .

not in english , where they are at home , but in german , where they are used more frequently by german speakers . the " living german " campaign wants germans to use german words for these ideas , and not depend on english imports , which , they say , many people simply do n't understand .
and , to top it off , many are simply " ugly , " according to those supporting the campaign . instead of shareholder value , why not use the good old teutonic aktio n ärs n utze n ?
instead of the internet-age homepage , why not startseite ?
it does use a borrowed english word , " start , " but it 's well-known in germany and is short , pithy and to the point , making it acceptable to the language watchdogs .

the results were not promising ; a maximum of 59 percent understood what the companies were trying to get across .
for some expressions , a full 90 percent of germans had no idea what was being talked about . lo n g history attempts to weed foreignisms from german go back centuries .
in the early 1500s , there were already battles to keep latin , french and english expressions out of the language , with very mixed results . in 1617 , on the eve of the thirty years ' war , a patriotic society was founded that sought to preserve the " manful german hero 's tongue " against the influence of french , because german would n't tolerate " anything womanly .

starring moritz bleibtreu and franka potente -lrb- both of " run lola run " fame -rrb- , christian ulmen , martina gedeck and nina hoss -lrb- all household names in germany -rrb- , the movie is based on the eponymous book by french author michel houellebecq .
it 's directed by german director oskar roehler and produced by bernd eichinger -lrb- " the downfall " -rrb- . houellebecq 's book , published in 1998 , polarized opinion with its nihilistic view of the world , soulless sex and savage attacks against individualism , commercialization and the idealism of the 1968 generation . depressing and cynical the work , which caused an uproar in france , became a bestseller in europe and made houellebecq a literary star .
in germany , the book , with its mix of nietzschean philosophy , scientific experiment , pornographic scenes and jaded bitterness , became something of a sensation . over 80,000 hard-cover versions and 150,000 paperbacks were sold in germany as at least a dozen theaters toyed with the idea of turning it into a play . the movie reflects the bleakness of the book in the form of two half brothers bruno -lrb- bleibtreu -rrb- , a sex-obsessed school teacher who is n't so lucky with women in real life , and michel -lrb- ulmen -rrb- , a brilliant and inhibited molecular biologist who 's researching human cloning and has never slept with a woman .
both have gotten to know each other during their teenage years after their hippie mother -lrb- played by nina hoss -rrb- leaves them in the care of their grandmother and heads off to india to revel in sex , drugs and rock ' n ' roll . the film , which deals with bruno and michel 's frustration with life and women , is ultimately a quest by the brothers to find love in their own ways . film more conciliatory unlike the book , the film is much more conciliatory in tone , with both finding the right women at the end .
it also avoids much of the radicalism and repugnance that made the novel such a sensation . michel is reunited with his childhood friend annabelle -lrb- played by potente -rrb- , and bruno finds love , albeit temporarily , in the form of christiane -lrb- gedeck -rrb- , who he gets to know at a nudist spiritual camp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roehler admits he 's toned down the on-screen adaptation of elementary particles director oskar roehler said he could relate to houellebecq 's pessimism . " the question of whether it 's filmable or not , was n't important for me .
it simply fascinated me , " roehler said , adding that he saw himself as something of a pessimist too .
" forced optimism in the face of the current social situation is strange to me , " said the director , who took five years to make the movie . at the same time , roehler admitted that the film deliberately steers clear of the extreme darkness of the book . " i find it interesting to show what people do when they are in deep shit , " said roehler .
" but the completely fatalistic tone of the book could n't be just taken over , " roehler said .
" houellebecq gives us a key to understanding society that i find absolutely brilliant , " roehler said . " but i did n't want to take over houellebecq 's moral .
we did n't want to leave our protagonists in the lurch .
our film does n't deny faith in mankind . " producer bernd eichinger pointed out that the whole point had been to present an overall impression of houellebecq 's work .
" you ca n't film social criticism , only melodramas , " eichinger said . " huge testimony to love " of all the actors present on stage , martina gedeck - who plays bruno 's true love christiane , a sexually-uninhibited woman secretly battling a serious illness - was the most enthusiastic about the film . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martina gedeck and moritz bleibtreu " christiane has no sentimental expectations .
she 's a good loser and how she and bruno find each other is a huge testimony to love , " gedeck said . frank potente , who became known to international audiences as the sprinting redhead in " run lola run " and also starred in " the bourne identity " alongside matt damon , said she was excited about being represented at the competition category of the berlinale for the first time .
potente delivers a somewhat wooden performance in " elementary particles " as annabelle , a 30-plus lonely librarian in berlin . critics slam film despite its overwhelming star appeal , the film has largely received poor reviews in germany . the berlin-based newspaper die welt called the film " really straight , almost drab , " saying the punch was missing .
" the most trenchant scenes have been removed , others rendered harmless , the whole thing generally toned down .
houellebecq has been given some really gentle treatment . " " the most impressive thing about ' elementary particles ' is nina hoss ' face mask , " wrote news magazine der spiegel , referring to hoss ' decay as she lies on her death bed in one scene , her aged face mottled with bulging veins . " houllebecq , the cynic , drove his protagonists into the abyss with glee .
roehler , the director , on the other hand has sympathy with his characters , " it wrote . " all that the spectator is left with is the recognition that you ca n't film ' elementary particles ' .

but critics are n't impressed . there was standing room only in the conference room at the hyatt hotel in downtown berlin on saturday afternoon as the cast of the much-awaited german competition entry " elementary particles " appeared to talk to the international media after the first screening of the film . " it 's often said that the german film scene does n't have any stars , but the podium here shows that is n't true , " said the moderator of the press conference as flash bulbs popped incessantly and the crush of journalists thrust a sea of microphones and tv cameras at the stage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from right , moritz bleibtreu , franka potente and nina hoss indeed , the line-up of " elementary particles " reads like a who 's who of german cinema .
starring moritz bleibtreu and franka potente -lrb- both of " run lola run " fame -rrb- , christian ulmen , martina gedeck and nina hoss -lrb- all household names in germany -rrb- , the movie is based on the eponymous book by french author michel houellebecq .
it 's directed by german director oskar roehler and produced by bernd eichinger -lrb- " the downfall " -rrb- . houellebecq 's book , published in 1998 , polarized opinion with its nihilistic view of the world , soulless sex and savage attacks against individualism , commercialization and the idealism of the 1968 generation . depressing and cynical the work , which caused an uproar in france , became a bestseller in europe and made houellebecq a literary star .
in germany , the book , with its mix of nietzschean philosophy , scientific experiment , pornographic scenes and jaded bitterness , became something of a sensation . over 80,000 hard-cover versions and 150,000 paperbacks were sold in germany as at least a dozen theaters toyed with the idea of turning it into a play . the movie reflects the bleakness of the book in the form of two half brothers bruno -lrb- bleibtreu -rrb- , a sex-obsessed school teacher who is n't so lucky with women in real life , and michel -lrb- ulmen -rrb- , a brilliant and inhibited molecular biologist who 's researching human cloning and has never slept with a woman .
both have gotten to know each other during their teenage years after their hippie mother -lrb- played by nina hoss -rrb- leaves them in the care of their grandmother and heads off to india to revel in sex , drugs and rock ' n ' roll . the film , which deals with bruno and michel 's frustration with life and women , is ultimately a quest by the brothers to find love in their own ways . film more conciliatory unlike the book , the film is much more conciliatory in tone , with both finding the right women at the end .
it also avoids much of the radicalism and repugnance that made the novel such a sensation . michel is reunited with his childhood friend annabelle -lrb- played by potente -rrb- , and bruno finds love , albeit temporarily , in the form of christiane -lrb- gedeck -rrb- , who he gets to know at a nudist spiritual camp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roehler admits he 's toned down the on-screen adaptation of elementary particles director oskar roehler said he could relate to houellebecq 's pessimism . " the question of whether it 's filmable or not , was n't important for me .

the european commission - the bloc 's executive arm - says a shake-up is urgently needed to spur employment and growth in europe 's long-flagging economy . despite deep divisions in the past over the new eu laws , the main political groups in the parliament say that views are converging ahead of the long-awaited vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european parliament in strasbourg the emerging consensus only became possible after the european people 's party -lrb- epp -rrb- and the socialists , the two biggest groups , agreed last week to strike out the most controversial proposal , which would let service providers operate in other member states under the rules of their home country . that article stoked fears in older member states such as belgium , france and sweden of an influx of service providers - epitomized by ' polish plumbers ' - from newer , low-wage eu members undercutting local competitors . fragile compromise but the compromise between right and left is fragile and the text is likely to evolve in the days ahead of the vote as tough haggling gets underway to cement a broader position in the parliament . some hard bargaining is also in store over which services should be excluded from tougher cross-border competition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where will it come from in the future ?
although the most controversial element has been excised from the proposed text , unions want further changes to the plans .
they want public services like water distribution to be excluded and have promised a big demonstration on tuesday in strasbourg to keep the pressure up . but talk of raising the number of exclusions has also fuelled concern that that too many would empty the reform of substance . " too many exceptions would rip the heart out of the directive and undermine its original objective , " a spokesman for the liberal democrat group said . stayi n g o n track bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrations also took place in berlin saturday britain , the czech republic , hungary , the netherlands , poland and spain voiced concern on feb .
10 that the plans risked losing sight of their original aim if they were watered down too much . " in the quest for compromise , we must remain focused on the key objective of an effective internal market , while ensuring that legitimate concerns are met , " they said in a joint letter to the european commission . if eu lawmakers give the green light to the plans in a first reading , the package will then go to the commission and member states for review . austria , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , has said it wants an agreement on a text more or less in its final form before it hands over the eu reins to finland in june . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frits bolkestein by then , the package will have traveled a long way and stirred up much controversy since former internal market commissioner frits bolkestein put the plans on the table in early 2004 . although they went largely unnoticed at first , they became the emblem of perceived brussels neo-liberalism for leftwing campaigners against the eu 's draft constitution ahead of referenda in france and the netherlands last year . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu port services bill rejected by lawmakers eu lawmakers on wednesday rejected plans to free up europe 's port services in a vote two days after protestors brought docks to a standstill and staged violent demonstrations outside the european parliament .

in iran nuclear crisis , all eyes turn to russia world powers split over iran nuclear program iran calls un referral " the end of diplomacy " europe -pipe- 13.02.2006 enrichment row escalates as iran crosses the line großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad takes the standoff to a new level iran has started putting uranium feedstock gas into centrifuges , defying the west with actual enrichment work on making what can be nuclear reactor fuel or atom bomb material , diplomats told reporters monday . uranium enrichment is seen as a red line by the united states and european union in the long-running international standoff over iran 's nuclear program , as it is crucial to making atomic weapons . putting uranium hexafluoride -lrb- uf6 -rrb- gas into centrifuges , which distill out enriched uranium , appears a major escalation by iran in its face-off with the west over a nuclear program which the united states claims hides secret atomic weapons development . iran said monday that it would resume uranium enrichment even before the un watchdog international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- meets next month in vienna to decide whether to recommend un security council action against tehran . the diplomats ' comments in vienna appear to show iran is following through with its threat . " iran has put gas into centrifuges at its pilot enrichment plant in natanz , " a diplomat said .
the diplomat , who asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue , said iran had not yet fired up the whole 164-centrifuge cascade but had " over the past two or three days " started work with some centrifuges . a second diplomat said iran was doing " preliminary work " with " stand-alone " centrifuges , almost certainly putting uranium gas into single machines rather than a whole cascade . first step in a potential full scale enrichment program bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has started preparation for widescale enrichment at natanz the diplomat said this was necessary in a step-by-step approach involving first getting centrifuges running , then operating a pilot plant , which iran has dubbed research , and then moving on to industrial-scale enrichment with thousands of centrifuges . iran says its nuclear program is a peaceful effort to generate electricity and that it only wants to produce low enriched uranium , which is not refined enough for weapons use .
but it wants to install over 50,000 centrifuges at natanz , an array which could produce enough highly enriched uranium every two or three weeks for one atom bomb . iran had suspended uranium enrichment until talks with an eu negotiating troika , aimed at winning guarantees that the program is peaceful , broke down last month . since august , though , it has been making the feedstock uf6 at a conversion plant in isfahan .
the west has seemed ready to let tehran continue with this work , which technically is part of nuclear fuel activities the eu says should be suspended , as long as the islamic republic did not actually enrich . asked monday in tehran whether iran would wait for the march 6 iaea board of governors ' meeting to resume industrial-scale enrichment , government spokesman gholam hossein elham told reporters " no , no . " one month diplomacy window slamming shut bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the diplomacy window and russia 's offer have been ignored by iran the iaea had voted february 4 to report iran to the security council , but left a one-month window for diplomacy for iran to return to a full suspension of enrichment-related work and cooperate more with iaea inspectors . the iranian government spokesman also announced that talks between tehran and moscow would not go ahead as planned on thursday . the talks are aimed at negotiating a compromise in the standoff by having iranian uranium enriched on russian soil so that tehran would not master the technology itself . however , russian deputy foreign minister sergei kislyak said moscow still expected the iranian delegation , adding : " our offer for the 16th -lrb- february -rrb- still stands .

the diplomat , who asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue , said iran had not yet fired up the whole 164-centrifuge cascade but had " over the past two or three days " started work with some centrifuges . a second diplomat said iran was doing " preliminary work " with " stand-alone " centrifuges , almost certainly putting uranium gas into single machines rather than a whole cascade . first step in a potential full scale enrichment program bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has started preparation for widescale enrichment at natanz the diplomat said this was necessary in a step-by-step approach involving first getting centrifuges running , then operating a pilot plant , which iran has dubbed research , and then moving on to industrial-scale enrichment with thousands of centrifuges . iran says its nuclear program is a peaceful effort to generate electricity and that it only wants to produce low enriched uranium , which is not refined enough for weapons use .
but it wants to install over 50,000 centrifuges at natanz , an array which could produce enough highly enriched uranium every two or three weeks for one atom bomb . iran had suspended uranium enrichment until talks with an eu negotiating troika , aimed at winning guarantees that the program is peaceful , broke down last month . since august , though , it has been making the feedstock uf6 at a conversion plant in isfahan .
the west has seemed ready to let tehran continue with this work , which technically is part of nuclear fuel activities the eu says should be suspended , as long as the islamic republic did not actually enrich . asked monday in tehran whether iran would wait for the march 6 iaea board of governors ' meeting to resume industrial-scale enrichment , government spokesman gholam hossein elham told reporters " no , no .

public workers expanded their week-old work stoppage on monday in a dispute over longer hours . this first widespread stoppage in 14 years has targeted trash collection , child care facilities , hospitals and road works , and on monday , public workers in nine of germany 's 14 federal states walked off the job , compared to only two last week . the regions effected by the strike include germany 's most populous state , north rhine-westphalia , home to some 17 million people . however , not all workers are striking simultaneously , which has limited the disruption . the strike started a week ago in the state of baden-württemberg and was called by the public sector union ver.di to prevent the employers from extending the working week from 38.5 to 40 hours . in a strike ballot , 94.5 percent of ver.di members voted in favor of industrial action .

that was acceptable in those days , he said , when local authorities , relatively speaking , had plenty of money at their disposal .
it should also be acceptable now , he added . he also pointed out a forty-hour week was already being worked in eastern germany .
möllring emphasised that workers in the public sector had secure jobs . " surely a secure job is worth working an extra 18 minutes a day , " möllring said . bsirske dismisses the secure jobs argument as fiction .

that was acceptable in those days , he said , when local authorities , relatively speaking , had plenty of money at their disposal .
it should also be acceptable now , he added . he also pointed out a forty-hour week was already being worked in eastern germany .
möllring emphasised that workers in the public sector had secure jobs . " surely a secure job is worth working an extra 18 minutes a day , " möllring said . bsirske dismisses the secure jobs argument as fiction .

following tradition , he starts political talks today with political leaders in israel before he moves on to the palestinian territories and later to turkey " it 's a difficult trip to a difficult region , " steinmeier said . there are several delicate issues that the foreign minister will have to maneuver , including the election results in the palestinian territories , where the militant group hamas won a majority .
the west is still struggling with working out how to respond .
elections in israel are approaching , although they have been overshadowed by the critical health condition of israeli prime minister ariel sharon . on monday , after meeting with the ehud olmert , israel 's acting prime minister , steinmeier said germany backed israel not be recognized unless it backs away from militancy and acknowledges israel 's right to exist .

although negotiations on tehran 's uranium enrichment program seem to have reached in impasse , steinmeier will make it clear that berlin is continuing to explore all diplomatic avenues to reach a peaceful settlement of the conflict . while the united states has not completely ruled out a military move against iran , the german foreign minister has strongly denied that his government is considering backing such a strategy .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west is still trying to figure out out to handle the hamas victory steinmeier and german chancellor angela merkel have voiced their interest in returning to the middle east peace process as laid down in the so-called road map .
but the future of the peace negotiations remains unclear after the hamas victory . israel 's ambassador to germany , shimon stein , has reiterated that hamas would still have to acknowledge israel 's right to statehood and refrain from terrorist attacks before it could become a negotiating partner in the peace process " hamas remains on the european union 's list of terror organizations , " stein said .
" i see no reason why germany should change its attitude towards hamas simply because the latter were elected into power . " cartoon row the german foreign minister 's trip to the middle east also aims to defuse tensions between europe and the muslim world over the publication of caricatures depicting the prophet mohammed .
the depictions have led to violent riots in many muslim countries and have reignited the debate on whether the philosophical gulf between the west and the muslim world can be bridged .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students burn a danish flag protesting the caricatures " i 'm very much interested in de-escalating the current situation , " steinmeier said .

he called for europeans to show more sensitivity to the beliefs of muslims . " european integration is built upon the foundation of respect of other cultures , tolerance and the recognition of diversity , " schröder told the seventh annual edition of the forum , whose theme is : " honoring identity and celebrating common ground . " " this includes refraining from acts that hurt honest religious sentiment .
unfortunately in the last few months this sensitivity has been lacking in many places , including europe , " he added . diplomacy with iran during his trip , germany 's foreign minister will also be explaining his government 's stance on the iran issue .
although negotiations on tehran 's uranium enrichment program seem to have reached in impasse , steinmeier will make it clear that berlin is continuing to explore all diplomatic avenues to reach a peaceful settlement of the conflict . while the united states has not completely ruled out a military move against iran , the german foreign minister has strongly denied that his government is considering backing such a strategy .
in an interview with german public television on the weekend , steinmeier said he was not willing to debate moves which he said were not on the agenda . hardy graupner -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de four killed in afghanistan in cartoon row , calm urged the un , eu and the organization of the islamic conference -lrb- oic -rrb- have urged restraint and dialogue as worldwide muslim fury against danish cartoons depicting the prophet mohammed claimed four lives in afghanistan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.02.2006 more diesels needed in land of goethe and schiller großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany could fall behind unless more students become interested in engineering germany is suffering from a lack of 15,000 engineers .
making the profession more appealing could be a boon for german companies and help boost the economy , according to one of the country 's engineering groups . though christoph meilgen had to face rejection letters similar to those seen by germany 's five million unemployed , his doctorate in mechanical engineering helped him into a position many unemployed dream of : being able to turn down two positions and hold out for a job he wanted . " companies want practical , technical knowledge that goes well beyond what you get in school , " said meilgen , who took at position at lvq-wp in the industrial ruhr region of western germany after defending his thesis at kaiserslautern 's technical university this month .
" but there 's a need for engineers , you do n't need to take any offer . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finding research engineers is already difficult for many companies meilgen 's position is not an unusual one for recent graduates with engineering credentials .
seventy-three percent of middle-sized german companies said they see finding qualified employees as their most demanding task for the next five years , according to a february poll by tns infratest . germany 's position as a technological leader could be in danger if companies are n't able to find skilled new hires , according to michael schwartz , a spokesperson for the association of german engineers -lrb- vdi -rrb- . " germany today is lacking 15,000 engineers , 11,500 in small and middle-sized business alone , " he said .
" the difficulties many research and development companies are having filling positions could impair or even hold off innovation . " program encourages more students to " make things " after watching the number of students entering engineering fields drop 12 percent since a high of 87,542 in 2003 , the vdi , along with a group of 44 partners , including deutsche welle as a media partner , decided to start an initiative called sachen machen -lrb- make things -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : men make up nearly 84 percent of students in technical fields financed by the vdi and its partners , the program , slated to last at least five years , has set itself the goal of making germany the home of new technology by 2015 by achieving the world 's per capita leader in graduates with math , technical , it and natural science degrees ; employees in research and development ; research spending and patent registration . " we can not afford not to be successful , " schwarz said , referring to the program 's goal of boosting interest in technical fields among students and optimizing cooperation between science and businesses .
" if there are no new comers to fill the positions , products and services wo n't be able to be offered . " some engineers still ca n't find work that 's an argument germany 's 64,000 unemployed engineers do n't understand .
a number of factors are keeping these engineers from finding work , according to the german federal labor office 's beate raabe . " many of the unemployed are over 50 and some companies have the preconception that they do not have the most up-to-date technical knowledge , " she said in an interview with münchner merkur newspaper . while companies are looking for mechanical and electrical engineers , the market for architects and civil engineers is saturated , creating a mismatch between what they can offer and what is needed , schwarz added . employment affects more than just engineers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : engineers ' higher pay means more money to spend in stores the ones that do find a job can usually look forward to above-average salaries .
while recent graduate meilgen declined to say how much he would earn at his new job , starting salaries range from 30,000 euros to 45,000 euros -lrb- $ 35,938 to $ 53,908 -rrb- .
more experienced employees average 65,000 euros a year , according to vdi statistics . in 2003 , the most recently recorded year , the average german employee earned 26,700 euros , according to germany 's federal statistics office . the social benefits of getting open engineering positions filled could be a windfall for germany 's sluggish economy and languishing labor market , schwarz added . newly employed engineers along with their above-average paychecks and buying power typically have the potential to create 2.3 additional jobs in other fields , including production and retail , theoretically leading to 35,000 new jobs if the vdi 's estimate of 15,000 open engineering positions were filled . germans critical of innovation made in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans rank their own innovativeness below that of japan and the us other than getting jobs filled , one of sachen machen 's most difficult tasks will be convincing germans of their country 's abilities , which many foreign countries already recognize . despite having registered more patents than any other european country , a 2004 vdi survey showed only 6 percent of germans ranked their native land as the most innovative .
japan and the united states respectively scored 40 percent and 21 percent . internationally , however , germany 's engineers continue to enjoy the positive reputation earned on the back of names like mercedes , zeiss and siemens .
a 2005 study by ernst & young reported that 28 percent of international companies surveyed ranked german employees as europe 's most qualified . " we can not be cheaper than the workers in china , india or eastern europe , but we can be better , " sepp heckmann , chairman of deutsche messe said at sachen machen 's opening press conference at the beginning of february .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.02.2006 politicians want migrants to be put to the test großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians will discuss whether us-style citizenship courses will aid integration the german government will again debate the possibility of nationwide citizenship tests for migrants in a special bundestag session monday . the hope is that politicians can agree on a program that will avoid the controversy that a migrant exam prototype in the state of baden-württemberg caused when it was proposed earlier this year . maria böhmer , the christian democratic union minister who was recently installed as the government 's point person for integration policy , is hopeful that some consensus can be found in discussions this week .
there is already a general agreement that children from migrant families should be given extra help in schools to develop their german language schools but the citizenship test question is another matter . böhmer 's draft test , which will be presented and debated in government , is designed along the lines of citizenship courses in the united states to " help those who want to become naturalized germans " by teaching and testing migrants on the german constitution , the history of the country but while " remaining sympathetic to their own values . " " the united states gives courses in the constitution , the history , culture and the values of the country , " she said .
" since those who come here do n't only want to live and work in germany but to become german , we should give them as much help as possible . " ehrhart körting , from berlin 's interior ministry , is one of those who , in theory , is in favor of the tests although he sees very little point in asking those immigrants who have lived in germany for ten to 15 years to take the test .
" the main focus should be on integration courses for new immigrants coming into the country for the first time , " he told reporters recently . critics want viable alternatives to citizenship tests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some politicians feel that an alternative to courses should be found rhineland-palatinate 's minister of the interior karl peter bruch is one who will oppose the tests .
" we will not have such a test , " the social democrat minister assured .
bruch is not against reasonable alternatives , he stressed , where a person is interviewed on whether they " respect the constitution and the democratic processes of germany " and fully supports the improvement of language courses . there is certainly a deficit in the language tuition of migrant children , something maria böhmer wants to address .
she believes that every euro invested in improving language courses will be paid back several times by well-equipped and integrated members of society contributing to the economy . böhmer sees the future of integration in germany also taking the form of more educational opportunities and employment chances for youngsters from migrant families .
she admits to casting envious glances over the border to france where there is a charter designed to give young migrant workers the chance to find work . " i have had conversations with trade associations , and i am now involved in bringing the subject of migration into the sphere of the large companies in germany , " böhmer said .
" in france , large enterprises are obliged to give youngsters with a migrant background the chance to learn a profession .
this is a good model . " language and cultural lessons to preven parallel societies christoph böhr from the cdu wants german language tuition to begin at preschool level and for migrant children to have tests before they move on into the school system .
böher also wants parents whose children do not take part to face a penalty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education is seen as an important bridge between cultures christian social union secretary general markus söder has also called for islamic religious lesson to be included in the general syllabus .
everything must be done , he said , to develop the understanding between faiths and to do everything to prevent parallel societies . böhmer agrees that cultural and religious understanding is an integral part of the integration question : " we in our very secularized world should consider what religion actually means to others , what honor is reserved for religious symbols and what level of sensitivity we must adopt when dealing with people with very strong religious beliefs .

there is already a general agreement that children from migrant families should be given extra help in schools to develop their german language schools but the citizenship test question is another matter . böhmer 's draft test , which will be presented and debated in government , is designed along the lines of citizenship courses in the united states to " help those who want to become naturalized germans " by teaching and testing migrants on the german constitution , the history of the country but while " remaining sympathetic to their own values . " " the united states gives courses in the constitution , the history , culture and the values of the country , " she said .
" since those who come here do n't only want to live and work in germany but to become german , we should give them as much help as possible . " ehrhart körting , from berlin 's interior ministry , is one of those who , in theory , is in favor of the tests although he sees very little point in asking those immigrants who have lived in germany for ten to 15 years to take the test .
" the main focus should be on integration courses for new immigrants coming into the country for the first time , " he told reporters recently . critics want viable alternatives to citizenship tests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some politicians feel that an alternative to courses should be found rhineland-palatinate 's minister of the interior karl peter bruch is one who will oppose the tests .
" we will not have such a test , " the social democrat minister assured .
bruch is not against reasonable alternatives , he stressed , where a person is interviewed on whether they " respect the constitution and the democratic processes of germany " and fully supports the improvement of language courses . there is certainly a deficit in the language tuition of migrant children , something maria böhmer wants to address .
she believes that every euro invested in improving language courses will be paid back several times by well-equipped and integrated members of society contributing to the economy . böhmer sees the future of integration in germany also taking the form of more educational opportunities and employment chances for youngsters from migrant families .
she admits to casting envious glances over the border to france where there is a charter designed to give young migrant workers the chance to find work . " i have had conversations with trade associations , and i am now involved in bringing the subject of migration into the sphere of the large companies in germany , " böhmer said .
" in france , large enterprises are obliged to give youngsters with a migrant background the chance to learn a profession .
this is a good model . " language and cultural lessons to preven parallel societies christoph böhr from the cdu wants german language tuition to begin at preschool level and for migrant children to have tests before they move on into the school system .
böher also wants parents whose children do not take part to face a penalty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education is seen as an important bridge between cultures christian social union secretary general markus söder has also called for islamic religious lesson to be included in the general syllabus .
everything must be done , he said , to develop the understanding between faiths and to do everything to prevent parallel societies . böhmer agrees that cultural and religious understanding is an integral part of the integration question : " we in our very secularized world should consider what religion actually means to others , what honor is reserved for religious symbols and what level of sensitivity we must adopt when dealing with people with very strong religious beliefs .

the european commission - the bloc 's executive arm - says a shake-up is urgently needed to spur employment and growth in europe 's long-flagging economy . despite deep divisions in the past over the new eu laws , the main political groups in the parliament say that views are converging ahead of the long-awaited vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european parliament in strasbourg the emerging consensus only became possible after the european people 's party -lrb- epp -rrb- and the socialists , the two biggest groups , agreed last week to strike out the most controversial proposal , which would let service providers operate in other member states under the rules of their home country . that article stoked fears in older member states such as belgium , france and sweden of an influx of service providers - epitomized by ' polish plumbers ' - from newer , low-wage eu members undercutting local competitors . fragile compromise but the compromise between right and left is fragile and the text is likely to evolve in the days ahead of the vote as tough haggling gets underway to cement a broader position in the parliament . some hard bargaining is also in store over which services should be excluded from tougher cross-border competition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where will it come from in the future ?
although the most controversial element has been excised from the proposed text , unions want further changes to the plans .
they want public services like water distribution to be excluded and have promised a big demonstration on tuesday in strasbourg to keep the pressure up . but talk of raising the number of exclusions has also fuelled concern that that too many would empty the reform of substance . " too many exceptions would rip the heart out of the directive and undermine its original objective , " a spokesman for the liberal democrat group said . stayi n g o n track bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrations also took place in berlin saturday britain , the czech republic , hungary , the netherlands , poland and spain voiced concern on feb .
10 that the plans risked losing sight of their original aim if they were watered down too much . " in the quest for compromise , we must remain focused on the key objective of an effective internal market , while ensuring that legitimate concerns are met , " they said in a joint letter to the european commission . if eu lawmakers give the green light to the plans in a first reading , the package will then go to the commission and member states for review . austria , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , has said it wants an agreement on a text more or less in its final form before it hands over the eu reins to finland in june . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frits bolkestein by then , the package will have traveled a long way and stirred up much controversy since former internal market commissioner frits bolkestein put the plans on the table in early 2004 . although they went largely unnoticed at first , they became the emblem of perceived brussels neo-liberalism for leftwing campaigners against the eu 's draft constitution ahead of referenda in france and the netherlands last year . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu port services bill rejected by lawmakers eu lawmakers on wednesday rejected plans to free up europe 's port services in a vote two days after protestors brought docks to a standstill and staged violent demonstrations outside the european parliament .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : spotlight on the berlinale berlinale film lineup includes four german entries tracking the golden bear berlinale strikes a serious note " love never goes out of fashion " culture & lifestyle -pipe- 13.02.2006 german favorite at berlinale disappoints großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the film is studded with a who 's who of german cinema this year 's hottest german entry at the berlinale , " elementary particles , " an on-screen adaptation of the eponymous french novel , boasts a star-heavy cast .
but critics are n't impressed . there was standing room only in the conference room at the hyatt hotel in downtown berlin on saturday afternoon as the cast of the much-awaited german competition entry " elementary particles " appeared to talk to the international media after the first screening of the film . " it 's often said that the german film scene does n't have any stars , but the podium here shows that is n't true , " said the moderator of the press conference as flash bulbs popped incessantly and the crush of journalists thrust a sea of microphones and tv cameras at the stage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from right , moritz bleibtreu , franka potente and nina hoss indeed , the line-up of " elementary particles " reads like a who 's who of german cinema .
starring moritz bleibtreu and franka potente -lrb- both of " run lola run " fame -rrb- , christian ulmen , martina gedeck and nina hoss -lrb- all household names in germany -rrb- , the movie is based on the eponymous book by french author michel houellebecq .
it 's directed by german director oskar roehler and produced by bernd eichinger -lrb- " the downfall " -rrb- . houellebecq 's book , published in 1998 , polarized opinion with its nihilistic view of the world , soulless sex and savage attacks against individualism , commercialization and the idealism of the 1968 generation . depressing and cynical the work , which caused an uproar in france , became a bestseller in europe and made houellebecq a literary star .
in germany , the book , with its mix of nietzschean philosophy , scientific experiment , pornographic scenes and jaded bitterness , became something of a sensation . over 80,000 hard-cover versions and 150,000 paperbacks were sold in germany as at least a dozen theaters toyed with the idea of turning it into a play . the movie reflects the bleakness of the book in the form of two half brothers bruno -lrb- bleibtreu -rrb- , a sex-obsessed school teacher who is n't so lucky with women in real life , and michel -lrb- ulmen -rrb- , a brilliant and inhibited molecular biologist who 's researching human cloning and has never slept with a woman .
both have gotten to know each other during their teenage years after their hippie mother -lrb- played by nina hoss -rrb- leaves them in the care of their grandmother and heads off to india to revel in sex , drugs and rock ' n ' roll . the film , which deals with bruno and michel 's frustration with life and women , is ultimately a quest by the brothers to find love in their own ways . film more conciliatory unlike the book , the film is much more conciliatory in tone , with both finding the right women at the end .

" forced optimism in the face of the current social situation is strange to me , " said the director , who took five years to make the movie . at the same time , roehler admitted that the film deliberately steers clear of the extreme darkness of the book .

" houellebecq gives us a key to understanding society that i find absolutely brilliant , " roehler said . " but i did n't want to take over houellebecq 's moral .
we did n't want to leave our protagonists in the lurch .

but critics are n't impressed . there was standing room only in the conference room at the hyatt hotel in downtown berlin on saturday afternoon as the cast of the much-awaited german competition entry " elementary particles " appeared to talk to the international media after the first screening of the film . " it 's often said that the german film scene does n't have any stars , but the podium here shows that is n't true , " said the moderator of the press conference as flash bulbs popped incessantly and the crush of journalists thrust a sea of microphones and tv cameras at the stage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from right , moritz bleibtreu , franka potente and nina hoss indeed , the line-up of " elementary particles " reads like a who 's who of german cinema .
starring moritz bleibtreu and franka potente -lrb- both of " run lola run " fame -rrb- , christian ulmen , martina gedeck and nina hoss -lrb- all household names in germany -rrb- , the movie is based on the eponymous book by french author michel houellebecq .
it 's directed by german director oskar roehler and produced by bernd eichinger -lrb- " the downfall " -rrb- . houellebecq 's book , published in 1998 , polarized opinion with its nihilistic view of the world , soulless sex and savage attacks against individualism , commercialization and the idealism of the 1968 generation . depressing and cynical the work , which caused an uproar in france , became a bestseller in europe and made houellebecq a literary star .
in germany , the book , with its mix of nietzschean philosophy , scientific experiment , pornographic scenes and jaded bitterness , became something of a sensation . over 80,000 hard-cover versions and 150,000 paperbacks were sold in germany as at least a dozen theaters toyed with the idea of turning it into a play . the movie reflects the bleakness of the book in the form of two half brothers bruno -lrb- bleibtreu -rrb- , a sex-obsessed school teacher who is n't so lucky with women in real life , and michel -lrb- ulmen -rrb- , a brilliant and inhibited molecular biologist who 's researching human cloning and has never slept with a woman .
both have gotten to know each other during their teenage years after their hippie mother -lrb- played by nina hoss -rrb- leaves them in the care of their grandmother and heads off to india to revel in sex , drugs and rock ' n ' roll . the film , which deals with bruno and michel 's frustration with life and women , is ultimately a quest by the brothers to find love in their own ways . film more conciliatory unlike the book , the film is much more conciliatory in tone , with both finding the right women at the end .
it also avoids much of the radicalism and repugnance that made the novel such a sensation . michel is reunited with his childhood friend annabelle -lrb- played by potente -rrb- , and bruno finds love , albeit temporarily , in the form of christiane -lrb- gedeck -rrb- , who he gets to know at a nudist spiritual camp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roehler admits he 's toned down the on-screen adaptation of elementary particles director oskar roehler said he could relate to houellebecq 's pessimism . " the question of whether it 's filmable or not , was n't important for me .
it simply fascinated me , " roehler said , adding that he saw himself as something of a pessimist too .
" forced optimism in the face of the current social situation is strange to me , " said the director , who took five years to make the movie . at the same time , roehler admitted that the film deliberately steers clear of the extreme darkness of the book . " i find it interesting to show what people do when they are in deep shit , " said roehler .
" but the completely fatalistic tone of the book could n't be just taken over , " roehler said .
" houellebecq gives us a key to understanding society that i find absolutely brilliant , " roehler said . " but i did n't want to take over houellebecq 's moral .
we did n't want to leave our protagonists in the lurch .
our film does n't deny faith in mankind . " producer bernd eichinger pointed out that the whole point had been to present an overall impression of houellebecq 's work .
" you ca n't film social criticism , only melodramas , " eichinger said .

" iran has put gas into centrifuges at its pilot enrichment plant in natanz , " a diplomat said .
the diplomat , who asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue , said iran had not yet fired up the whole 164-centrifuge cascade but had " over the past two or three days " started work with some centrifuges . a second diplomat said iran was doing " preliminary work " with " stand-alone " centrifuges , almost certainly putting uranium gas into single machines rather than a whole cascade . first step in a potential full scale enrichment program bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has started preparation for widescale enrichment at natanz the diplomat said this was necessary in a step-by-step approach involving first getting centrifuges running , then operating a pilot plant , which iran has dubbed research , and then moving on to industrial-scale enrichment with thousands of centrifuges . iran says its nuclear program is a peaceful effort to generate electricity and that it only wants to produce low enriched uranium , which is not refined enough for weapons use .
but it wants to install over 50,000 centrifuges at natanz , an array which could produce enough highly enriched uranium every two or three weeks for one atom bomb . iran had suspended uranium enrichment until talks with an eu negotiating troika , aimed at winning guarantees that the program is peaceful , broke down last month . since august , though , it has been making the feedstock uf6 at a conversion plant in isfahan .

in iran nuclear crisis , all eyes turn to russia world powers split over iran nuclear program iran calls un referral " the end of diplomacy " europe -pipe- 13.02.2006 enrichment row escalates as iran crosses the line großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad takes the standoff to a new level iran has started putting uranium feedstock gas into centrifuges , defying the west with actual enrichment work on making what can be nuclear reactor fuel or atom bomb material , diplomats told reporters monday . uranium enrichment is seen as a red line by the united states and european union in the long-running international standoff over iran 's nuclear program , as it is crucial to making atomic weapons . putting uranium hexafluoride -lrb- uf6 -rrb- gas into centrifuges , which distill out enriched uranium , appears a major escalation by iran in its face-off with the west over a nuclear program which the united states claims hides secret atomic weapons development . iran said monday that it would resume uranium enrichment even before the un watchdog international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- meets next month in vienna to decide whether to recommend un security council action against tehran . the diplomats ' comments in vienna appear to show iran is following through with its threat . " iran has put gas into centrifuges at its pilot enrichment plant in natanz , " a diplomat said .
the diplomat , who asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue , said iran had not yet fired up the whole 164-centrifuge cascade but had " over the past two or three days " started work with some centrifuges . a second diplomat said iran was doing " preliminary work " with " stand-alone " centrifuges , almost certainly putting uranium gas into single machines rather than a whole cascade . first step in a potential full scale enrichment program bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has started preparation for widescale enrichment at natanz the diplomat said this was necessary in a step-by-step approach involving first getting centrifuges running , then operating a pilot plant , which iran has dubbed research , and then moving on to industrial-scale enrichment with thousands of centrifuges . iran says its nuclear program is a peaceful effort to generate electricity and that it only wants to produce low enriched uranium , which is not refined enough for weapons use .
but it wants to install over 50,000 centrifuges at natanz , an array which could produce enough highly enriched uranium every two or three weeks for one atom bomb . iran had suspended uranium enrichment until talks with an eu negotiating troika , aimed at winning guarantees that the program is peaceful , broke down last month . since august , though , it has been making the feedstock uf6 at a conversion plant in isfahan .

making the profession more appealing could be a boon for german companies and help boost the economy , according to one of the country 's engineering groups . though christoph meilgen had to face rejection letters similar to those seen by germany 's five million unemployed , his doctorate in mechanical engineering helped him into a position many unemployed dream of : being able to turn down two positions and hold out for a job he wanted . " companies want practical , technical knowledge that goes well beyond what you get in school , " said meilgen , who took at position at lvq-wp in the industrial ruhr region of western germany after defending his thesis at kaiserslautern 's technical university this month .
" but there 's a need for engineers , you do n't need to take any offer . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finding research engineers is already difficult for many companies meilgen 's position is not an unusual one for recent graduates with engineering credentials .
seventy-three percent of middle-sized german companies said they see finding qualified employees as their most demanding task for the next five years , according to a february poll by tns infratest . germany 's position as a technological leader could be in danger if companies are n't able to find skilled new hires , according to michael schwartz , a spokesperson for the association of german engineers -lrb- vdi -rrb- . " germany today is lacking 15,000 engineers , 11,500 in small and middle-sized business alone , " he said .

a number of factors are keeping these engineers from finding work , according to the german federal labor office 's beate raabe .

public workers expanded their week-old work stoppage on monday in a dispute over longer hours . this first widespread stoppage in 14 years has targeted trash collection , child care facilities , hospitals and road works , and on monday , public workers in nine of germany 's 14 federal states walked off the job , compared to only two last week . the regions effected by the strike include germany 's most populous state , north rhine-westphalia , home to some 17 million people . however , not all workers are striking simultaneously , which has limited the disruption . the strike started a week ago in the state of baden-württemberg and was called by the public sector union ver.di to prevent the employers from extending the working week from 38.5 to 40 hours . in a strike ballot , 94.5 percent of ver.di members voted in favor of industrial action .

bsirske says this may not sound like much , but is equivalent to working an extra two weeks a year without pay . he also accused the employers of using longer working hours as an excuse to cut jobs , of which he said a quarter of a million were at risk . speaking for employers , the finance minister of the state of lower saxony , hartmut möllring , recalled that germany 's public sector worked a forty-hour week until 1989 .
that was acceptable in those days , he said , when local authorities , relatively speaking , had plenty of money at their disposal .
it should also be acceptable now , he added . he also pointed out a forty-hour week was already being worked in eastern germany .
möllring emphasised that workers in the public sector had secure jobs . " surely a secure job is worth working an extra 18 minutes a day , " möllring said . bsirske dismisses the secure jobs argument as fiction .

there is already a general agreement that children from migrant families should be given extra help in schools to develop their german language schools but the citizenship test question is another matter . böhmer 's draft test , which will be presented and debated in government , is designed along the lines of citizenship courses in the united states to " help those who want to become naturalized germans " by teaching and testing migrants on the german constitution , the history of the country but while " remaining sympathetic to their own values . " " the united states gives courses in the constitution , the history , culture and the values of the country , " she said .
" since those who come here do n't only want to live and work in germany but to become german , we should give them as much help as possible . " ehrhart körting , from berlin 's interior ministry , is one of those who , in theory , is in favor of the tests although he sees very little point in asking those immigrants who have lived in germany for ten to 15 years to take the test .
" the main focus should be on integration courses for new immigrants coming into the country for the first time , " he told reporters recently . critics want viable alternatives to citizenship tests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some politicians feel that an alternative to courses should be found rhineland-palatinate 's minister of the interior karl peter bruch is one who will oppose the tests .
" we will not have such a test , " the social democrat minister assured .
bruch is not against reasonable alternatives , he stressed , where a person is interviewed on whether they " respect the constitution and the democratic processes of germany " and fully supports the improvement of language courses . there is certainly a deficit in the language tuition of migrant children , something maria böhmer wants to address .
she believes that every euro invested in improving language courses will be paid back several times by well-equipped and integrated members of society contributing to the economy . böhmer sees the future of integration in germany also taking the form of more educational opportunities and employment chances for youngsters from migrant families .
she admits to casting envious glances over the border to france where there is a charter designed to give young migrant workers the chance to find work . " i have had conversations with trade associations , and i am now involved in bringing the subject of migration into the sphere of the large companies in germany , " böhmer said .
" in france , large enterprises are obliged to give youngsters with a migrant background the chance to learn a profession .
this is a good model . " language and cultural lessons to preven parallel societies christoph böhr from the cdu wants german language tuition to begin at preschool level and for migrant children to have tests before they move on into the school system .
böher also wants parents whose children do not take part to face a penalty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education is seen as an important bridge between cultures christian social union secretary general markus söder has also called for islamic religious lesson to be included in the general syllabus .
everything must be done , he said , to develop the understanding between faiths and to do everything to prevent parallel societies . böhmer agrees that cultural and religious understanding is an integral part of the integration question : " we in our very secularized world should consider what religion actually means to others , what honor is reserved for religious symbols and what level of sensitivity we must adopt when dealing with people with very strong religious beliefs .

he made the remarks after talks on monday with the acting israeli prime minister . frank-walter steinmeier 's trip to the middle east is clearly the most difficult mission since he became foreign minister in germany 's new grand coalition government .
following tradition , he starts political talks today with political leaders in israel before he moves on to the palestinian territories and later to turkey " it 's a difficult trip to a difficult region , " steinmeier said . there are several delicate issues that the foreign minister will have to maneuver , including the election results in the palestinian territories , where the militant group hamas won a majority .
the west is still struggling with working out how to respond .
elections in israel are approaching , although they have been overshadowed by the critical health condition of israeli prime minister ariel sharon . on monday , after meeting with the ehud olmert , israel 's acting prime minister , steinmeier said germany backed israel not be recognized unless it backs away from militancy and acknowledges israel 's right to exist .
hamas openly seeks israel 's destruction and has carried out scores of suicide bombings . " i want to let israel know that it can count on our solidarity , especially after the palestinian election , " he said . israel has been increasingly concerned that the international front against hamas is crumbling .
russian president vladimir putin has invited hamas leaders to moscow for a visit , saying that he will press the group to give up violence and recognize israel .
france has come out in support of moscow 's approach . steinmeier said the israelis were assured when he " made the conditions for talks -lrb- with hamas -rrb- very clear .

public workers expanded their week-old work stoppage on monday in a dispute over longer hours . this first widespread stoppage in 14 years has targeted trash collection , child care facilities , hospitals and road works , and on monday , public workers in nine of germany 's 14 federal states walked off the job , compared to only two last week . the regions effected by the strike include germany 's most populous state , north rhine-westphalia , home to some 17 million people . however , not all workers are striking simultaneously , which has limited the disruption . the strike started a week ago in the state of baden-württemberg and was called by the public sector union ver.di to prevent the employers from extending the working week from 38.5 to 40 hours . in a strike ballot , 94.5 percent of ver.di members voted in favor of industrial action .

in iran nuclear crisis , all eyes turn to russia world powers split over iran nuclear program iran calls un referral " the end of diplomacy " europe -pipe- 13.02.2006 enrichment row escalates as iran crosses the line großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad takes the standoff to a new level iran has started putting uranium feedstock gas into centrifuges , defying the west with actual enrichment work on making what can be nuclear reactor fuel or atom bomb material , diplomats told reporters monday . uranium enrichment is seen as a red line by the united states and european union in the long-running international standoff over iran 's nuclear program , as it is crucial to making atomic weapons . putting uranium hexafluoride -lrb- uf6 -rrb- gas into centrifuges , which distill out enriched uranium , appears a major escalation by iran in its face-off with the west over a nuclear program which the united states claims hides secret atomic weapons development . iran said monday that it would resume uranium enrichment even before the un watchdog international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- meets next month in vienna to decide whether to recommend un security council action against tehran . the diplomats ' comments in vienna appear to show iran is following through with its threat . " iran has put gas into centrifuges at its pilot enrichment plant in natanz , " a diplomat said .
the diplomat , who asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue , said iran had not yet fired up the whole 164-centrifuge cascade but had " over the past two or three days " started work with some centrifuges . a second diplomat said iran was doing " preliminary work " with " stand-alone " centrifuges , almost certainly putting uranium gas into single machines rather than a whole cascade . first step in a potential full scale enrichment program bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has started preparation for widescale enrichment at natanz the diplomat said this was necessary in a step-by-step approach involving first getting centrifuges running , then operating a pilot plant , which iran has dubbed research , and then moving on to industrial-scale enrichment with thousands of centrifuges . iran says its nuclear program is a peaceful effort to generate electricity and that it only wants to produce low enriched uranium , which is not refined enough for weapons use .
but it wants to install over 50,000 centrifuges at natanz , an array which could produce enough highly enriched uranium every two or three weeks for one atom bomb . iran had suspended uranium enrichment until talks with an eu negotiating troika , aimed at winning guarantees that the program is peaceful , broke down last month . since august , though , it has been making the feedstock uf6 at a conversion plant in isfahan .
the west has seemed ready to let tehran continue with this work , which technically is part of nuclear fuel activities the eu says should be suspended , as long as the islamic republic did not actually enrich . asked monday in tehran whether iran would wait for the march 6 iaea board of governors ' meeting to resume industrial-scale enrichment , government spokesman gholam hossein elham told reporters " no , no .

in iran nuclear crisis , all eyes turn to russia world powers split over iran nuclear program iran calls un referral " the end of diplomacy " europe -pipe- 13.02.2006 enrichment row escalates as iran crosses the line großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad takes the standoff to a new level iran has started putting uranium feedstock gas into centrifuges , defying the west with actual enrichment work on making what can be nuclear reactor fuel or atom bomb material , diplomats told reporters monday . uranium enrichment is seen as a red line by the united states and european union in the long-running international standoff over iran 's nuclear program , as it is crucial to making atomic weapons . putting uranium hexafluoride -lrb- uf6 -rrb- gas into centrifuges , which distill out enriched uranium , appears a major escalation by iran in its face-off with the west over a nuclear program which the united states claims hides secret atomic weapons development . iran said monday that it would resume uranium enrichment even before the un watchdog international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- meets next month in vienna to decide whether to recommend un security council action against tehran . the diplomats ' comments in vienna appear to show iran is following through with its threat . " iran has put gas into centrifuges at its pilot enrichment plant in natanz , " a diplomat said .
the diplomat , who asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue , said iran had not yet fired up the whole 164-centrifuge cascade but had " over the past two or three days " started work with some centrifuges . a second diplomat said iran was doing " preliminary work " with " stand-alone " centrifuges , almost certainly putting uranium gas into single machines rather than a whole cascade . first step in a potential full scale enrichment program bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has started preparation for widescale enrichment at natanz the diplomat said this was necessary in a step-by-step approach involving first getting centrifuges running , then operating a pilot plant , which iran has dubbed research , and then moving on to industrial-scale enrichment with thousands of centrifuges . iran says its nuclear program is a peaceful effort to generate electricity and that it only wants to produce low enriched uranium , which is not refined enough for weapons use .
but it wants to install over 50,000 centrifuges at natanz , an array which could produce enough highly enriched uranium every two or three weeks for one atom bomb . iran had suspended uranium enrichment until talks with an eu negotiating troika , aimed at winning guarantees that the program is peaceful , broke down last month . since august , though , it has been making the feedstock uf6 at a conversion plant in isfahan .
the west has seemed ready to let tehran continue with this work , which technically is part of nuclear fuel activities the eu says should be suspended , as long as the islamic republic did not actually enrich . asked monday in tehran whether iran would wait for the march 6 iaea board of governors ' meeting to resume industrial-scale enrichment , government spokesman gholam hossein elham told reporters " no , no . " one month diplomacy window slamming shut bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the diplomacy window and russia 's offer have been ignored by iran the iaea had voted february 4 to report iran to the security council , but left a one-month window for diplomacy for iran to return to a full suspension of enrichment-related work and cooperate more with iaea inspectors . the iranian government spokesman also announced that talks between tehran and moscow would not go ahead as planned on thursday . the talks are aimed at negotiating a compromise in the standoff by having iranian uranium enriched on russian soil so that tehran would not master the technology itself . however , russian deputy foreign minister sergei kislyak said moscow still expected the iranian delegation , adding : " our offer for the 16th -lrb- february -rrb- still stands .

the diplomat , who asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue , said iran had not yet fired up the whole 164-centrifuge cascade but had " over the past two or three days " started work with some centrifuges . a second diplomat said iran was doing " preliminary work " with " stand-alone " centrifuges , almost certainly putting uranium gas into single machines rather than a whole cascade . first step in a potential full scale enrichment program bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has started preparation for widescale enrichment at natanz the diplomat said this was necessary in a step-by-step approach involving first getting centrifuges running , then operating a pilot plant , which iran has dubbed research , and then moving on to industrial-scale enrichment with thousands of centrifuges . iran says its nuclear program is a peaceful effort to generate electricity and that it only wants to produce low enriched uranium , which is not refined enough for weapons use .
but it wants to install over 50,000 centrifuges at natanz , an array which could produce enough highly enriched uranium every two or three weeks for one atom bomb . iran had suspended uranium enrichment until talks with an eu negotiating troika , aimed at winning guarantees that the program is peaceful , broke down last month . since august , though , it has been making the feedstock uf6 at a conversion plant in isfahan .
the west has seemed ready to let tehran continue with this work , which technically is part of nuclear fuel activities the eu says should be suspended , as long as the islamic republic did not actually enrich . asked monday in tehran whether iran would wait for the march 6 iaea board of governors ' meeting to resume industrial-scale enrichment , government spokesman gholam hossein elham told reporters " no , no . " one month diplomacy window slamming shut bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the diplomacy window and russia 's offer have been ignored by iran the iaea had voted february 4 to report iran to the security council , but left a one-month window for diplomacy for iran to return to a full suspension of enrichment-related work and cooperate more with iaea inspectors . the iranian government spokesman also announced that talks between tehran and moscow would not go ahead as planned on thursday . the talks are aimed at negotiating a compromise in the standoff by having iranian uranium enriched on russian soil so that tehran would not master the technology itself . however , russian deputy foreign minister sergei kislyak said moscow still expected the iranian delegation , adding : " our offer for the 16th -lrb- february -rrb- still stands . " the iranian spokesman said " new elements " were responsible for the delay , notably the fact that the iranian government " insists that uranium enrichment for peaceful purposes is carried out inside the country .

but critics are n't impressed . there was standing room only in the conference room at the hyatt hotel in downtown berlin on saturday afternoon as the cast of the much-awaited german competition entry " elementary particles " appeared to talk to the international media after the first screening of the film . " it 's often said that the german film scene does n't have any stars , but the podium here shows that is n't true , " said the moderator of the press conference as flash bulbs popped incessantly and the crush of journalists thrust a sea of microphones and tv cameras at the stage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from right , moritz bleibtreu , franka potente and nina hoss indeed , the line-up of " elementary particles " reads like a who 's who of german cinema .
starring moritz bleibtreu and franka potente -lrb- both of " run lola run " fame -rrb- , christian ulmen , martina gedeck and nina hoss -lrb- all household names in germany -rrb- , the movie is based on the eponymous book by french author michel houellebecq .
it 's directed by german director oskar roehler and produced by bernd eichinger -lrb- " the downfall " -rrb- . houellebecq 's book , published in 1998 , polarized opinion with its nihilistic view of the world , soulless sex and savage attacks against individualism , commercialization and the idealism of the 1968 generation . depressing and cynical the work , which caused an uproar in france , became a bestseller in europe and made houellebecq a literary star .
in germany , the book , with its mix of nietzschean philosophy , scientific experiment , pornographic scenes and jaded bitterness , became something of a sensation . over 80,000 hard-cover versions and 150,000 paperbacks were sold in germany as at least a dozen theaters toyed with the idea of turning it into a play . the movie reflects the bleakness of the book in the form of two half brothers bruno -lrb- bleibtreu -rrb- , a sex-obsessed school teacher who is n't so lucky with women in real life , and michel -lrb- ulmen -rrb- , a brilliant and inhibited molecular biologist who 's researching human cloning and has never slept with a woman .
both have gotten to know each other during their teenage years after their hippie mother -lrb- played by nina hoss -rrb- leaves them in the care of their grandmother and heads off to india to revel in sex , drugs and rock ' n ' roll . the film , which deals with bruno and michel 's frustration with life and women , is ultimately a quest by the brothers to find love in their own ways . film more conciliatory unlike the book , the film is much more conciliatory in tone , with both finding the right women at the end .
it also avoids much of the radicalism and repugnance that made the novel such a sensation . michel is reunited with his childhood friend annabelle -lrb- played by potente -rrb- , and bruno finds love , albeit temporarily , in the form of christiane -lrb- gedeck -rrb- , who he gets to know at a nudist spiritual camp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roehler admits he 's toned down the on-screen adaptation of elementary particles director oskar roehler said he could relate to houellebecq 's pessimism . " the question of whether it 's filmable or not , was n't important for me .
it simply fascinated me , " roehler said , adding that he saw himself as something of a pessimist too .
" forced optimism in the face of the current social situation is strange to me , " said the director , who took five years to make the movie . at the same time , roehler admitted that the film deliberately steers clear of the extreme darkness of the book . " i find it interesting to show what people do when they are in deep shit , " said roehler .
" but the completely fatalistic tone of the book could n't be just taken over , " roehler said .
" houellebecq gives us a key to understanding society that i find absolutely brilliant , " roehler said . " but i did n't want to take over houellebecq 's moral .
we did n't want to leave our protagonists in the lurch .
our film does n't deny faith in mankind . " producer bernd eichinger pointed out that the whole point had been to present an overall impression of houellebecq 's work .
" you ca n't film social criticism , only melodramas , " eichinger said . " huge testimony to love " of all the actors present on stage , martina gedeck - who plays bruno 's true love christiane , a sexually-uninhibited woman secretly battling a serious illness - was the most enthusiastic about the film . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martina gedeck and moritz bleibtreu " christiane has no sentimental expectations .
she 's a good loser and how she and bruno find each other is a huge testimony to love , " gedeck said . frank potente , who became known to international audiences as the sprinting redhead in " run lola run " and also starred in " the bourne identity " alongside matt damon , said she was excited about being represented at the competition category of the berlinale for the first time .
potente delivers a somewhat wooden performance in " elementary particles " as annabelle , a 30-plus lonely librarian in berlin . critics slam film despite its overwhelming star appeal , the film has largely received poor reviews in germany . the berlin-based newspaper die welt called the film " really straight , almost drab , " saying the punch was missing .
" the most trenchant scenes have been removed , others rendered harmless , the whole thing generally toned down .
houellebecq has been given some really gentle treatment . " " the most impressive thing about ' elementary particles ' is nina hoss ' face mask , " wrote news magazine der spiegel , referring to hoss ' decay as she lies on her death bed in one scene , her aged face mottled with bulging veins . " houllebecq , the cynic , drove his protagonists into the abyss with glee .

but critics are n't impressed . there was standing room only in the conference room at the hyatt hotel in downtown berlin on saturday afternoon as the cast of the much-awaited german competition entry " elementary particles " appeared to talk to the international media after the first screening of the film . " it 's often said that the german film scene does n't have any stars , but the podium here shows that is n't true , " said the moderator of the press conference as flash bulbs popped incessantly and the crush of journalists thrust a sea of microphones and tv cameras at the stage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from right , moritz bleibtreu , franka potente and nina hoss indeed , the line-up of " elementary particles " reads like a who 's who of german cinema .
starring moritz bleibtreu and franka potente -lrb- both of " run lola run " fame -rrb- , christian ulmen , martina gedeck and nina hoss -lrb- all household names in germany -rrb- , the movie is based on the eponymous book by french author michel houellebecq .
it 's directed by german director oskar roehler and produced by bernd eichinger -lrb- " the downfall " -rrb- . houellebecq 's book , published in 1998 , polarized opinion with its nihilistic view of the world , soulless sex and savage attacks against individualism , commercialization and the idealism of the 1968 generation . depressing and cynical the work , which caused an uproar in france , became a bestseller in europe and made houellebecq a literary star .
in germany , the book , with its mix of nietzschean philosophy , scientific experiment , pornographic scenes and jaded bitterness , became something of a sensation . over 80,000 hard-cover versions and 150,000 paperbacks were sold in germany as at least a dozen theaters toyed with the idea of turning it into a play . the movie reflects the bleakness of the book in the form of two half brothers bruno -lrb- bleibtreu -rrb- , a sex-obsessed school teacher who is n't so lucky with women in real life , and michel -lrb- ulmen -rrb- , a brilliant and inhibited molecular biologist who 's researching human cloning and has never slept with a woman .
both have gotten to know each other during their teenage years after their hippie mother -lrb- played by nina hoss -rrb- leaves them in the care of their grandmother and heads off to india to revel in sex , drugs and rock ' n ' roll . the film , which deals with bruno and michel 's frustration with life and women , is ultimately a quest by the brothers to find love in their own ways . film more conciliatory unlike the book , the film is much more conciliatory in tone , with both finding the right women at the end .
it also avoids much of the radicalism and repugnance that made the novel such a sensation . michel is reunited with his childhood friend annabelle -lrb- played by potente -rrb- , and bruno finds love , albeit temporarily , in the form of christiane -lrb- gedeck -rrb- , who he gets to know at a nudist spiritual camp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roehler admits he 's toned down the on-screen adaptation of elementary particles director oskar roehler said he could relate to houellebecq 's pessimism . " the question of whether it 's filmable or not , was n't important for me .
it simply fascinated me , " roehler said , adding that he saw himself as something of a pessimist too .
" forced optimism in the face of the current social situation is strange to me , " said the director , who took five years to make the movie . at the same time , roehler admitted that the film deliberately steers clear of the extreme darkness of the book . " i find it interesting to show what people do when they are in deep shit , " said roehler .
" but the completely fatalistic tone of the book could n't be just taken over , " roehler said .
" houellebecq gives us a key to understanding society that i find absolutely brilliant , " roehler said . " but i did n't want to take over houellebecq 's moral .
we did n't want to leave our protagonists in the lurch .
our film does n't deny faith in mankind . " producer bernd eichinger pointed out that the whole point had been to present an overall impression of houellebecq 's work .
" you ca n't film social criticism , only melodramas , " eichinger said . " huge testimony to love " of all the actors present on stage , martina gedeck - who plays bruno 's true love christiane , a sexually-uninhibited woman secretly battling a serious illness - was the most enthusiastic about the film . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martina gedeck and moritz bleibtreu " christiane has no sentimental expectations .
she 's a good loser and how she and bruno find each other is a huge testimony to love , " gedeck said . frank potente , who became known to international audiences as the sprinting redhead in " run lola run " and also starred in " the bourne identity " alongside matt damon , said she was excited about being represented at the competition category of the berlinale for the first time .
potente delivers a somewhat wooden performance in " elementary particles " as annabelle , a 30-plus lonely librarian in berlin . critics slam film despite its overwhelming star appeal , the film has largely received poor reviews in germany . the berlin-based newspaper die welt called the film " really straight , almost drab , " saying the punch was missing .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : spotlight on the berlinale berlinale film lineup includes four german entries tracking the golden bear berlinale strikes a serious note " love never goes out of fashion " culture & lifestyle -pipe- 13.02.2006 german favorite at berlinale disappoints großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the film is studded with a who 's who of german cinema this year 's hottest german entry at the berlinale , " elementary particles , " an on-screen adaptation of the eponymous french novel , boasts a star-heavy cast .
but critics are n't impressed . there was standing room only in the conference room at the hyatt hotel in downtown berlin on saturday afternoon as the cast of the much-awaited german competition entry " elementary particles " appeared to talk to the international media after the first screening of the film . " it 's often said that the german film scene does n't have any stars , but the podium here shows that is n't true , " said the moderator of the press conference as flash bulbs popped incessantly and the crush of journalists thrust a sea of microphones and tv cameras at the stage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from right , moritz bleibtreu , franka potente and nina hoss indeed , the line-up of " elementary particles " reads like a who 's who of german cinema .
starring moritz bleibtreu and franka potente -lrb- both of " run lola run " fame -rrb- , christian ulmen , martina gedeck and nina hoss -lrb- all household names in germany -rrb- , the movie is based on the eponymous book by french author michel houellebecq .
it 's directed by german director oskar roehler and produced by bernd eichinger -lrb- " the downfall " -rrb- . houellebecq 's book , published in 1998 , polarized opinion with its nihilistic view of the world , soulless sex and savage attacks against individualism , commercialization and the idealism of the 1968 generation . depressing and cynical the work , which caused an uproar in france , became a bestseller in europe and made houellebecq a literary star .
in germany , the book , with its mix of nietzschean philosophy , scientific experiment , pornographic scenes and jaded bitterness , became something of a sensation . over 80,000 hard-cover versions and 150,000 paperbacks were sold in germany as at least a dozen theaters toyed with the idea of turning it into a play . the movie reflects the bleakness of the book in the form of two half brothers bruno -lrb- bleibtreu -rrb- , a sex-obsessed school teacher who is n't so lucky with women in real life , and michel -lrb- ulmen -rrb- , a brilliant and inhibited molecular biologist who 's researching human cloning and has never slept with a woman .
both have gotten to know each other during their teenage years after their hippie mother -lrb- played by nina hoss -rrb- leaves them in the care of their grandmother and heads off to india to revel in sex , drugs and rock ' n ' roll . the film , which deals with bruno and michel 's frustration with life and women , is ultimately a quest by the brothers to find love in their own ways . film more conciliatory unlike the book , the film is much more conciliatory in tone , with both finding the right women at the end .
it also avoids much of the radicalism and repugnance that made the novel such a sensation . michel is reunited with his childhood friend annabelle -lrb- played by potente -rrb- , and bruno finds love , albeit temporarily , in the form of christiane -lrb- gedeck -rrb- , who he gets to know at a nudist spiritual camp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roehler admits he 's toned down the on-screen adaptation of elementary particles director oskar roehler said he could relate to houellebecq 's pessimism . " the question of whether it 's filmable or not , was n't important for me .
it simply fascinated me , " roehler said , adding that he saw himself as something of a pessimist too .
" forced optimism in the face of the current social situation is strange to me , " said the director , who took five years to make the movie . at the same time , roehler admitted that the film deliberately steers clear of the extreme darkness of the book . " i find it interesting to show what people do when they are in deep shit , " said roehler .
" but the completely fatalistic tone of the book could n't be just taken over , " roehler said .
" houellebecq gives us a key to understanding society that i find absolutely brilliant , " roehler said . " but i did n't want to take over houellebecq 's moral .
we did n't want to leave our protagonists in the lurch .
our film does n't deny faith in mankind . " producer bernd eichinger pointed out that the whole point had been to present an overall impression of houellebecq 's work .
" you ca n't film social criticism , only melodramas , " eichinger said . " huge testimony to love " of all the actors present on stage , martina gedeck - who plays bruno 's true love christiane , a sexually-uninhibited woman secretly battling a serious illness - was the most enthusiastic about the film . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martina gedeck and moritz bleibtreu " christiane has no sentimental expectations .
she 's a good loser and how she and bruno find each other is a huge testimony to love , " gedeck said . frank potente , who became known to international audiences as the sprinting redhead in " run lola run " and also starred in " the bourne identity " alongside matt damon , said she was excited about being represented at the competition category of the berlinale for the first time .
potente delivers a somewhat wooden performance in " elementary particles " as annabelle , a 30-plus lonely librarian in berlin . critics slam film despite its overwhelming star appeal , the film has largely received poor reviews in germany . the berlin-based newspaper die welt called the film " really straight , almost drab , " saying the punch was missing .
" the most trenchant scenes have been removed , others rendered harmless , the whole thing generally toned down .
houellebecq has been given some really gentle treatment . " " the most impressive thing about ' elementary particles ' is nina hoss ' face mask , " wrote news magazine der spiegel , referring to hoss ' decay as she lies on her death bed in one scene , her aged face mottled with bulging veins . " houllebecq , the cynic , drove his protagonists into the abyss with glee .
roehler , the director , on the other hand has sympathy with his characters , " it wrote . " all that the spectator is left with is the recognition that you ca n't film ' elementary particles ' .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.02.2006 politicians want migrants to be put to the test großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians will discuss whether us-style citizenship courses will aid integration the german government will again debate the possibility of nationwide citizenship tests for migrants in a special bundestag session monday . the hope is that politicians can agree on a program that will avoid the controversy that a migrant exam prototype in the state of baden-württemberg caused when it was proposed earlier this year . maria böhmer , the christian democratic union minister who was recently installed as the government 's point person for integration policy , is hopeful that some consensus can be found in discussions this week .
there is already a general agreement that children from migrant families should be given extra help in schools to develop their german language schools but the citizenship test question is another matter . böhmer 's draft test , which will be presented and debated in government , is designed along the lines of citizenship courses in the united states to " help those who want to become naturalized germans " by teaching and testing migrants on the german constitution , the history of the country but while " remaining sympathetic to their own values . " " the united states gives courses in the constitution , the history , culture and the values of the country , " she said .
" since those who come here do n't only want to live and work in germany but to become german , we should give them as much help as possible . " ehrhart körting , from berlin 's interior ministry , is one of those who , in theory , is in favor of the tests although he sees very little point in asking those immigrants who have lived in germany for ten to 15 years to take the test .
" the main focus should be on integration courses for new immigrants coming into the country for the first time , " he told reporters recently . critics want viable alternatives to citizenship tests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some politicians feel that an alternative to courses should be found rhineland-palatinate 's minister of the interior karl peter bruch is one who will oppose the tests .
" we will not have such a test , " the social democrat minister assured .
bruch is not against reasonable alternatives , he stressed , where a person is interviewed on whether they " respect the constitution and the democratic processes of germany " and fully supports the improvement of language courses . there is certainly a deficit in the language tuition of migrant children , something maria böhmer wants to address .
she believes that every euro invested in improving language courses will be paid back several times by well-equipped and integrated members of society contributing to the economy . böhmer sees the future of integration in germany also taking the form of more educational opportunities and employment chances for youngsters from migrant families .
she admits to casting envious glances over the border to france where there is a charter designed to give young migrant workers the chance to find work . " i have had conversations with trade associations , and i am now involved in bringing the subject of migration into the sphere of the large companies in germany , " böhmer said .
" in france , large enterprises are obliged to give youngsters with a migrant background the chance to learn a profession .
this is a good model . " language and cultural lessons to preven parallel societies christoph böhr from the cdu wants german language tuition to begin at preschool level and for migrant children to have tests before they move on into the school system .
böher also wants parents whose children do not take part to face a penalty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education is seen as an important bridge between cultures christian social union secretary general markus söder has also called for islamic religious lesson to be included in the general syllabus .
everything must be done , he said , to develop the understanding between faiths and to do everything to prevent parallel societies . böhmer agrees that cultural and religious understanding is an integral part of the integration question : " we in our very secularized world should consider what religion actually means to others , what honor is reserved for religious symbols and what level of sensitivity we must adopt when dealing with people with very strong religious beliefs .

starring moritz bleibtreu and franka potente -lrb- both of " run lola run " fame -rrb- , christian ulmen , martina gedeck and nina hoss -lrb- all household names in germany -rrb- , the movie is based on the eponymous book by french author michel houellebecq .
it 's directed by german director oskar roehler and produced by bernd eichinger -lrb- " the downfall " -rrb- . houellebecq 's book , published in 1998 , polarized opinion with its nihilistic view of the world , soulless sex and savage attacks against individualism , commercialization and the idealism of the 1968 generation . depressing and cynical the work , which caused an uproar in france , became a bestseller in europe and made houellebecq a literary star .
in germany , the book , with its mix of nietzschean philosophy , scientific experiment , pornographic scenes and jaded bitterness , became something of a sensation . over 80,000 hard-cover versions and 150,000 paperbacks were sold in germany as at least a dozen theaters toyed with the idea of turning it into a play . the movie reflects the bleakness of the book in the form of two half brothers bruno -lrb- bleibtreu -rrb- , a sex-obsessed school teacher who is n't so lucky with women in real life , and michel -lrb- ulmen -rrb- , a brilliant and inhibited molecular biologist who 's researching human cloning and has never slept with a woman .
both have gotten to know each other during their teenage years after their hippie mother -lrb- played by nina hoss -rrb- leaves them in the care of their grandmother and heads off to india to revel in sex , drugs and rock ' n ' roll . the film , which deals with bruno and michel 's frustration with life and women , is ultimately a quest by the brothers to find love in their own ways . film more conciliatory unlike the book , the film is much more conciliatory in tone , with both finding the right women at the end .
it also avoids much of the radicalism and repugnance that made the novel such a sensation . michel is reunited with his childhood friend annabelle -lrb- played by potente -rrb- , and bruno finds love , albeit temporarily , in the form of christiane -lrb- gedeck -rrb- , who he gets to know at a nudist spiritual camp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roehler admits he 's toned down the on-screen adaptation of elementary particles director oskar roehler said he could relate to houellebecq 's pessimism . " the question of whether it 's filmable or not , was n't important for me .
it simply fascinated me , " roehler said , adding that he saw himself as something of a pessimist too .
" forced optimism in the face of the current social situation is strange to me , " said the director , who took five years to make the movie . at the same time , roehler admitted that the film deliberately steers clear of the extreme darkness of the book . " i find it interesting to show what people do when they are in deep shit , " said roehler .
" but the completely fatalistic tone of the book could n't be just taken over , " roehler said .
" houellebecq gives us a key to understanding society that i find absolutely brilliant , " roehler said . " but i did n't want to take over houellebecq 's moral .
we did n't want to leave our protagonists in the lurch .
our film does n't deny faith in mankind . " producer bernd eichinger pointed out that the whole point had been to present an overall impression of houellebecq 's work .
" you ca n't film social criticism , only melodramas , " eichinger said . " huge testimony to love " of all the actors present on stage , martina gedeck - who plays bruno 's true love christiane , a sexually-uninhibited woman secretly battling a serious illness - was the most enthusiastic about the film . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martina gedeck and moritz bleibtreu " christiane has no sentimental expectations .
she 's a good loser and how she and bruno find each other is a huge testimony to love , " gedeck said . frank potente , who became known to international audiences as the sprinting redhead in " run lola run " and also starred in " the bourne identity " alongside matt damon , said she was excited about being represented at the competition category of the berlinale for the first time .
potente delivers a somewhat wooden performance in " elementary particles " as annabelle , a 30-plus lonely librarian in berlin . critics slam film despite its overwhelming star appeal , the film has largely received poor reviews in germany . the berlin-based newspaper die welt called the film " really straight , almost drab , " saying the punch was missing .
" the most trenchant scenes have been removed , others rendered harmless , the whole thing generally toned down .
houellebecq has been given some really gentle treatment . " " the most impressive thing about ' elementary particles ' is nina hoss ' face mask , " wrote news magazine der spiegel , referring to hoss ' decay as she lies on her death bed in one scene , her aged face mottled with bulging veins . " houllebecq , the cynic , drove his protagonists into the abyss with glee .
roehler , the director , on the other hand has sympathy with his characters , " it wrote . " all that the spectator is left with is the recognition that you ca n't film ' elementary particles ' .

the great western railway 0-6-2 tank no 6695 - built in newcastle in 1928 - has been restored by volunteers since its rediscovery in wales in 1979 .
it finally hauled its first passenger service since 1962 on saturday .
nicknamed the " taffy tank " , the locomotive travelled from swanage to norden in dorset .
the locomotive , which was rescued from the barry scrapyard in south wales and brought to the swanage railway in august , 1979 , will now regularly run on the popular tourist route .
it was built in newcastle-on-tyne by armstrong whitworth for the great western railway in 1928 and spent its career working in the midlands and south wales .
the tank locomotive ran more than 620,000 miles before being withdrawn for scrap in the summer of 1964 .
it had hauled its last freight train earlier that year but had hauled its final passenger train two years earlier , in november , 1962 , in the rhonda valley .
nigel clark , of the no. 6695 locomotive volunteer group , who lives in poole , said : " it is great to see the locomotive haul its first passenger train since 1962 - it was quite a moment .
" when we brought her to swanage in 1979 , i never thought she would take this long to restore but everyone has done a brilliant job .
" it has taken a lot of hard work and determination to complete because we had to battle against the problems of working in the outdoors , raising money , restoring parts or having them made from new . "
