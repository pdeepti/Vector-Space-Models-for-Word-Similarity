the incentives are conditional on iran forgoing large-scale uranium enrichment and answering questions about its program . iran has a two-week deadline french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said that iran must reply to the international plan before the july 15-17 g8 summit . " it seems clear to me that iran must say yes .
then there will be negotiations , " douste-blazy said . u.s. secretary of state condoleezza rice earlier said the ministers would talk about iran , about how to deal with the palestinians ' hamas government and about democracy in russia and belarus . " we should also talk about democracy , " rice told the broadcaster cnn , expressing a desire for russia to " enhance its commitment to democratic development " as well as referring to belarus and other " places that have yet to see a democratic future . " russia has played a significant role in the standoff over iran 's nuclear program , being a permanent member of the united nations security council and a close ally of tehran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin : " russia will not join any ultimatum " on iran president vladimir putin on tuesday again underlined his differences with the west on the iran issue , saying russia did not intend " to join any sort of ultimatum , which only pushes the situation into a dead end . " amid reports that moscow wants to limit discussion of its human rights record or commitment to democracy at next month 's summit , a senior kremlin official defended russia 's role in neighboring parts of ex-communist europe . " moscow has done much more for democracy in central europe than washington or london , " said the deputy head of putin 's office , vladislav surkov , at a briefing wednesday .
" it 's moscow which democratized this immense space . " but if russia hopes to avoid discussion of accusations that it is backsliding on democracy and media freedom , the british foreign secretary margaret beckett reiterated that britain had concerns about human rights and the rule of law in russia . beckett , in an interview with russia 's kommersant broadsheet , also said she hoped next month 's summit would give a signal about the importance of competitive and open energy markets . " russia 's actions are inconsistent with g8 democratic norms " four prominent u.s. lawmakers on tuesday urged president george w. bush to rebuke putin over the " deterioration of democracy " in his country . it is important that the other g8 heads of state " make clear that russia 's actions are inconsistent with g8 democratic norms , " read a letter signed by democratic representative tom lantos and republican david dreier , together with senators john mccain , a republican , and democrat joe lieberman . earlier , an analyst close to the kremlin , the head of the moscow-based institute for political research , sergei markov , said he expected thursday 's meeting to be " rather tense .

daimlerchrysler 's midget smart car will take on the us market in 2008 , with executives hoping the nimble microcar can out-manoeuvre rivals in the land of the mammoth sports utility vehicle . the german-us automaker said wednesday it will launch the car through a partner - a company headed by racing legend roger penske - in early 2008 .

" times have changed , and urban us streets are becoming increasingly congested , " zetsche told reporters during the announcement . " gas prices are also increasing , and we may never see cheap gas again , " he added . some smart cars are already sold in the us through unofficial resellers , but wednesday 's announcement designates automotive retailer penske 's unitedauto group as the official distributor for the smart in the united states and puerto rico . smart cars have been on european roads since 1998 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some have likened the smart 's appearance to a baby shoe daimlerchrysler officials hope to promote the urban microcar as offering a fun driving experience , and have been able to place the vehicle in movies like " the da vinci code , " where it was used in a chase scene in paris , and the remake of " the pink panther " starring steve martin as inspector clouseau . " the time has never been better for this - and i am convinced that the smart fortwo as an innovative , ecological and agile city car will soon become just as familiar a sight on the streets of new york , miami or seattle as it is today in rome , berlin or paris , " zetsche said . the smart brand , which was launched in 1998 , has been a laggard for the automotive conglomerate , and the decision over whether to launch the brand in the largest auto market was heavily debated . the additional sales volume could help smart meet its target of achieving profitability . zetsche said there was never any doubt over whether smart would enter the us market , pointing out that the next-generation fortwo was always designed to meet the safety and crash regulations established in the united states . the issue that needed to be finalized before the announcement was the distribution plan , which will be handled exclusively by unitedauto , part of a company headed by penske with dealers in 20 states . the distributor said it would select between 30 and 50 dealers in major urban us markets , along with a few select leisure markets . success in canada while expecting to sell the fortwo at less than 15,000 dollars per unit , penske would not comment on volume targets but noted smart 's recent success in canada , where the brand was expected to achieve 1,500 units in its first year but ended up achieving more than 4,000 sales . the smart car would be among the least fuel-hungry cars on the road .

daimlerchrysler 's midget smart car will take on the us market in 2008 , with executives hoping the nimble microcar can out-manoeuvre rivals in the land of the mammoth sports utility vehicle . the german-us automaker said wednesday it will launch the car through a partner - a company headed by racing legend roger penske - in early 2008 .
high fuel prices and positive responses from consumers drove the decision . at 2.5 meters long -lrb- 8.2 feet -rrb- and weighing in at a mere 990 kilos -lrb- 2,180 pounds -rrb- , the two-seat smart car is about half the size of a hummer , ford expedition or other large suv . but daimlerchrysler chairman dieter zetsche said the smart - which will be offered in three models in the world 's largest automotive market - can hold its own against us muscle cars . " times have changed , and urban us streets are becoming increasingly congested , " zetsche told reporters during the announcement . " gas prices are also increasing , and we may never see cheap gas again , " he added . some smart cars are already sold in the us through unofficial resellers , but wednesday 's announcement designates automotive retailer penske 's unitedauto group as the official distributor for the smart in the united states and puerto rico . smart cars have been on european roads since 1998 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some have likened the smart 's appearance to a baby shoe daimlerchrysler officials hope to promote the urban microcar as offering a fun driving experience , and have been able to place the vehicle in movies like " the da vinci code , " where it was used in a chase scene in paris , and the remake of " the pink panther " starring steve martin as inspector clouseau . " the time has never been better for this - and i am convinced that the smart fortwo as an innovative , ecological and agile city car will soon become just as familiar a sight on the streets of new york , miami or seattle as it is today in rome , berlin or paris , " zetsche said . the smart brand , which was launched in 1998 , has been a laggard for the automotive conglomerate , and the decision over whether to launch the brand in the largest auto market was heavily debated . the additional sales volume could help smart meet its target of achieving profitability . zetsche said there was never any doubt over whether smart would enter the us market , pointing out that the next-generation fortwo was always designed to meet the safety and crash regulations established in the united states . the issue that needed to be finalized before the announcement was the distribution plan , which will be handled exclusively by unitedauto , part of a company headed by penske with dealers in 20 states . the distributor said it would select between 30 and 50 dealers in major urban us markets , along with a few select leisure markets . success in canada while expecting to sell the fortwo at less than 15,000 dollars per unit , penske would not comment on volume targets but noted smart 's recent success in canada , where the brand was expected to achieve 1,500 units in its first year but ended up achieving more than 4,000 sales . the smart car would be among the least fuel-hungry cars on the road .
the company says it goes about 90 kilometers -lrb- 56 miles -rrb- per gallon -lrb- 3.8 liters -rrb- .

earlier this year , details of turkish honor killings and fights over head scarves were making headlines in germany and fuelling a heated debate about turkish culture and raising doubts about its ability to adapt to a western lifestyle .
the world cup , however , appears to be bridging the gap between the two cultures . " of course , it would be better if the turkish team would play here , " one young turkish man said .
" but since they aren ’ t here , i ’ m now supporting the german team because i live here . " everyone needs to have fun bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans - and turks - were elated after germany beat sweden in the final 16 round he added that it ’ s nothing unusual to cheer for germany because this country is his second home . " after all , germany is playing very well in the tournament , " he said . and attitudes are also changing among native germans .
surprised by their own soccer-fuelled , newly-found national identity , many germans are now also taken aback to find their compatriots of turkish descent happily waving german flags right next to them . " it ’ s great because everybody needs to have fun in germany , " said one german .
" it ’ s great being together with them , being multicultural like one world and one city . " sunshine helps following germany 's recent victory over sweden , the streets in kreuzberg were jammed with cars as the rowdy celebrations neared their peak .

work-life balance gets boost in germany the dumbing down of germany gerd 's family policy gets down to business encouraging germans to have more kids germany -pipe- 29.06.2006 study : men in germany are scared to start families großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany faces problems with low birth rates low birth rates and the ageing population in germany have dominated media in discussions about how to pay for health care and social security .
now , a study says it is men who are primarily responsible for fewer births . in its study , the robert bosch foundation found that " men are scared to start families , " said ingrid hamm , managing director of the foundation .
the study says one in four men in germany do not want children , whereas one in seven women prefer to remain childless .
in eastern germany , that rate is lower , with one in 10 women exopressing the wish to remain childless . the study was based on responses from 10,017 people .
researchers say the survey was representative , even of the smallest groups in germany . men and women in germany also differ on the number of children they would like to have .
men want only an average of 1.59 kids ; the average number of children women would like is 1.75 .
both of these numbers , however , are still higher than germany 's actual average birth rate of 1.37 children per woman . under pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both men and women in germany want more babies than the number being born hamm said another reason for fewer children in germany is that people feel too much pressure .
they have long career training periods and then " have to do everything at once between the ages of 30 and 40 : get married , have kids , build a house , pursue their careers and save money for retirement , " she said . " all that pressure makes people put off having children until later or not at all . " women , too , are faced with a loss of economic control over their lives if they choose a baby break .
for a well-to-do country like germany , the economic loss is even greater , hamm said . she added that , in addition , germans lack faith in the future . " in germany , we have lost a sense that everything will turn out all right .
germans are prone to worrying about the future a lot more than other people , " she said . " german " is not just german , however .
the study found that the wish to forgo having children is much stronger in the former west german states .
in the new german states -lrb- formerly east germany -rrb- , fewer women want to remain childless . " children in the former gdr were everywhere , " hamm said . " mothers and fathers both worked , and east german children grew up with the image that being both parent and employee is possible . " " better policies could boost birth rates " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " large families are frowned upon , " hamm said the survey respondents said they would appreciate politicians creating better conditions to help people start families - such as greater financial support , improved childcare and more part-time jobs created for parents . eighty-nine percent of the respondents said they would prefer flexible working hours for employed parents . increased financial support from the government would help large families and less qualified people . on the other hand , better childcare possibilities would encourage those currently without children and aid families with only one child , as well as highly-qualified working parents and women in eastern germany , researchers reported . the study said women desiring a first child wanted the most support , but also that one-fifth of the women who did not want children could still be encouraged through better family policies . the study also found that families with one child or highly-educated people would most likely choose to have a first or an additional child if family-oriented policies were in place that fit their individual needs . hamm said the study showed that having children is just one of many values among germans ; it is not a top priority .
parents with many children are viewed critically , while " it is completely socially acceptable to not have kids here . " " one 's status does not increase by having kids , " she said . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the challenge of demographic change in old , shriveling europe after decades of ignorance , public awareness of demographic change in europe is growing .

work-life balance gets boost in germany the dumbing down of germany gerd 's family policy gets down to business encouraging germans to have more kids germany -pipe- 29.06.2006 study : men in germany are scared to start families großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany faces problems with low birth rates low birth rates and the ageing population in germany have dominated media in discussions about how to pay for health care and social security .
now , a study says it is men who are primarily responsible for fewer births . in its study , the robert bosch foundation found that " men are scared to start families , " said ingrid hamm , managing director of the foundation .
the study says one in four men in germany do not want children , whereas one in seven women prefer to remain childless .
in eastern germany , that rate is lower , with one in 10 women exopressing the wish to remain childless . the study was based on responses from 10,017 people .
researchers say the survey was representative , even of the smallest groups in germany . men and women in germany also differ on the number of children they would like to have .
men want only an average of 1.59 kids ; the average number of children women would like is 1.75 .
both of these numbers , however , are still higher than germany 's actual average birth rate of 1.37 children per woman . under pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both men and women in germany want more babies than the number being born hamm said another reason for fewer children in germany is that people feel too much pressure .
they have long career training periods and then " have to do everything at once between the ages of 30 and 40 : get married , have kids , build a house , pursue their careers and save money for retirement , " she said . " all that pressure makes people put off having children until later or not at all . " women , too , are faced with a loss of economic control over their lives if they choose a baby break .
for a well-to-do country like germany , the economic loss is even greater , hamm said . she added that , in addition , germans lack faith in the future . " in germany , we have lost a sense that everything will turn out all right .
germans are prone to worrying about the future a lot more than other people , " she said . " german " is not just german , however .
the study found that the wish to forgo having children is much stronger in the former west german states .
in the new german states -lrb- formerly east germany -rrb- , fewer women want to remain childless . " children in the former gdr were everywhere , " hamm said .

now , a study says it is men who are primarily responsible for fewer births . in its study , the robert bosch foundation found that " men are scared to start families , " said ingrid hamm , managing director of the foundation .
the study says one in four men in germany do not want children , whereas one in seven women prefer to remain childless .
in eastern germany , that rate is lower , with one in 10 women exopressing the wish to remain childless . the study was based on responses from 10,017 people .
researchers say the survey was representative , even of the smallest groups in germany . men and women in germany also differ on the number of children they would like to have .
men want only an average of 1.59 kids ; the average number of children women would like is 1.75 .
both of these numbers , however , are still higher than germany 's actual average birth rate of 1.37 children per woman . under pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both men and women in germany want more babies than the number being born hamm said another reason for fewer children in germany is that people feel too much pressure .
they have long career training periods and then " have to do everything at once between the ages of 30 and 40 : get married , have kids , build a house , pursue their careers and save money for retirement , " she said . " all that pressure makes people put off having children until later or not at all . " women , too , are faced with a loss of economic control over their lives if they choose a baby break .
for a well-to-do country like germany , the economic loss is even greater , hamm said . she added that , in addition , germans lack faith in the future . " in germany , we have lost a sense that everything will turn out all right .
germans are prone to worrying about the future a lot more than other people , " she said . " german " is not just german , however .
the study found that the wish to forgo having children is much stronger in the former west german states .
in the new german states -lrb- formerly east germany -rrb- , fewer women want to remain childless . " children in the former gdr were everywhere , " hamm said . " mothers and fathers both worked , and east german children grew up with the image that being both parent and employee is possible . " " better policies could boost birth rates " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " large families are frowned upon , " hamm said the survey respondents said they would appreciate politicians creating better conditions to help people start families - such as greater financial support , improved childcare and more part-time jobs created for parents . eighty-nine percent of the respondents said they would prefer flexible working hours for employed parents . increased financial support from the government would help large families and less qualified people . on the other hand , better childcare possibilities would encourage those currently without children and aid families with only one child , as well as highly-qualified working parents and women in eastern germany , researchers reported . the study said women desiring a first child wanted the most support , but also that one-fifth of the women who did not want children could still be encouraged through better family policies . the study also found that families with one child or highly-educated people would most likely choose to have a first or an additional child if family-oriented policies were in place that fit their individual needs . hamm said the study showed that having children is just one of many values among germans ; it is not a top priority .
parents with many children are viewed critically , while " it is completely socially acceptable to not have kids here . " " one 's status does not increase by having kids , " she said . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the challenge of demographic change in old , shriveling europe after decades of ignorance , public awareness of demographic change in europe is growing .

it 's all sadly familiar .
england are at a world cup and certain fans are causing chaos .
yet these rowdies sport designer pumps and are blinged to the max . the germans ca n't be blamed for not being ready .
everything that could be done was done .
police forces from both sides of the channel had been liaising for months on the best strategies to employ to minimize the damage . however , while british and german security forces were preparing for the possible influx of english soccer hooligans , no one was prepared for the havoc that the wives and girlfriends -lrb- wags -rrb- of the england players would wreak . imagine , if you dare , a typical night out in a large english city .
even for those who have never experienced one , it 's not hard to visualize the scene .
stories of boozy evenings in england are as much tabloid fodder in the international press as they are in the red tops back home . the binge drinking normally ends with sweaty lads in designer shirts bawling or brawling as the girls battle to keep their dignity covered by micro-minis while simultaneously knocking back alcopops and trying to stay upright . now substitute manchester on a friday night with baden-baden on every night of the week since the england team took up residence there .
also , substitute micro-minis for this year 's must-have hotpants and alcopops for moet & chandon .
welcome to the sideshow which is the wags on tour . wags turn spa town into a never-ending hen night bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baden-baden in more sedate times more used to retired german millionaires shuffling into the spas that it is famous for , the population of baden-baden has been knocked sideways by the arrival of the women and their designer handbags and fake tans . they are staying at the 1450 euro -lrb- $ 1821 -rrb- a night brenner 's park hotel and the paparazzi with their long lenses have followed them . leading the pack is victoria " posh spice " beckham .
at 32 , victoria is the doyen of footballers ' wives having been there and done that . while her appearance in skimpy shorts and massive sunglasses sparked debate about whether she is too thin , she has otherwise maintained a low profile , looking after her three children and cheering on husband david . the other wags have been more conspicuous , competing in the fashion stakes while seeing who can drink and spend the most . normally quiet bars turned into wild west saloons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steve gerrard 's partner alex curran : likes to party , allegedly " they swilled drink , smashed glasses , roared raucous chants and belted out bawdy sing-songs , " yelled the british tabloid daily mirror after some were spotted in one of the few late-night bars here where most of the other customers were reporters . it said they rang up a bill of thousands of pounds after downing bottles of moet champagne followed by glasses of vodka and red bull and shots of sambucca . after drunkenly singing songs in honor of england , things then turned partisan when the wags of the liverpool contingent started singing offensive songs about chelsea and manchester united . while the downtime is becoming notorious , the shopping sprees , meanwhile , have become legendary . mass market german daily bild said six of the wags , including posh and coach sven-goran eriksson 's girlfriend nancy dellolio , spent 80,000 euros in one hour in the town 's luxury boutiques . it said the women blew 4,395 euros in 10 minutes alone on shoes and t-shirts , with the rest going on creations by dolce and gabbana , prada and versace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what 's good for uma is good for the wags " i hope england stays in the competition for a while , " delighted boutique owner monika scholz was quoted as saying .
however , that opinion is not shared by many of the locals who have become increasingly annoyed with the drunken antics of the wags .
many have said they ca n't wait for england to get knocked out so they can all go home . divisions over behavior and as the weeks have passed - during which baden-baden has become known as boring-boring - tensions have grown and splits in the ranks have reportedly occurred within the group , with some tiring of the others ' antics and attitudes . ashley cole 's pop star fiancée cheryl tweedy has become close to posh and dellolio , and wayne rooney 's girlfriend coleen mcloughlin , who brought her own tanning consultant with her , has also sided with them . " victoria 's been in this game for years .
she 's got decorum whereas some of the others could n't even spell the word , " the mirror quoted an " insider " as saying . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i think we lost ' em , babes such has been the sideshow that britain 's " high-brow " media has also waded in , with the sunday times citing a survey by carma , an international media analysis company , on which wag has got the most press coverage .
the winner so far is tweedy , a singer with the group girls aloud . next comes posh , followed by carly zucker , the fitness instructor girlfriend of joe cole .
following her is melanie slade , the student girlfriend of theo walcott , england 's teenage striker who has yet to get a game .
she beat off mcloughlin , and abigail clancy , the squeeze of peter crouch . next up was elen rives , the partner of frank lampard who was prevented from boarding her flight to germany after throwing a tantrum when told she could not take six items of hand luggage with her . and then there are the mads , or mums and dads of the players , who are also here in force . while their behavior has been far more restrained , neville neville -lrb- no , really -rrb- , the father of defender gary , left his mark when he was pictured dancing on a couch at a club with the wags holding a replica world cup . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de soccer wives and the beautiful game their husbands may make a living from playing a game but for the wives of international soccer stars , life is more serious than that .

three protestors made a statement to that effect by getting naked during a game .
as if to emphasize their point , none of the crowd noticed . when one thinks of brazilians and the world cup , the usual image which springs to mind is the co-ordinated shaking of yellow and green-clad booties , gyrating in a celebration of the samba style and beautiful game for which the selecao is famous for .
such is the nation 's affinity with soccer ; one would not imagine any brazilians protesting against the sport .
and especially not while naked .
but this is what allegedly happened in a brazilian city during the last 16 clash between the selecao and ghana .
while the world cup is enthralling most of germany , and much of europe , the three men walked around a brazilian city in the buff while locals watched the match .
the three streakers-with-a-social-conscience staged the protest because they disagreed with how " the whole country stops to watch the football matches during the world cup , while enormous problems in brazil - like a lack of education among many people and a poor health system - keep getting worse . "
unfortunately for the exhibitionist crusaders , being in the tiny majority of brazilians who had time to think about the country 's problems while ronaldo and co. went about their business meant that no-one actually took a blind bit of notice .
three naked campaigners shaking their bits in protest could never compete with a rapturous crowd watching their heroes .
even the local cops let them get on with it .
" someone called to tell us to check the protest out , but since it was not a violent crime and we were watching the match at the time , we decided not to do anything about it , " a local police spokesperson reported .
" they only wanted to get attention , but they could n't even get this as everyone was watching the match , " the spokesperson added . dw staff -lrb- als / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de offsides from the fringe a selection of the best in wacky and offbeat stories from around germany .

the three streakers-with-a-social-conscience staged the protest because they disagreed with how " the whole country stops to watch the football matches during the world cup , while enormous problems in brazil - like a lack of education among many people and a poor health system - keep getting worse . "
unfortunately for the exhibitionist crusaders , being in the tiny majority of brazilians who had time to think about the country 's problems while ronaldo and co. went about their business meant that no-one actually took a blind bit of notice .
three naked campaigners shaking their bits in protest could never compete with a rapturous crowd watching their heroes .
even the local cops let them get on with it .
" someone called to tell us to check the protest out , but since it was not a violent crime and we were watching the match at the time , we decided not to do anything about it , " a local police spokesperson reported .
" they only wanted to get attention , but they could n't even get this as everyone was watching the match , " the spokesperson added . dw staff -lrb- als / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de offsides from the fringe a selection of the best in wacky and offbeat stories from around germany .

if you ca n't score , go for a foul seems to be the motto of the world cup great stadiums , euphoric fans , a relaxed host country and benevolent weather gods have turned the world cup into a feast .
but the action on the pitch is n't exactly worth cheering about . from a german perspective , it 's easy to forget that the world cup 1990 was considered an absolute low point in world cup history . never before had so few goals -lrb- 2.21 per game -rrb- been scored and so many fouls -lrb- 16 players were sent off during the tournament -rrb- been committed during the world cup as they were in italy . thank god fifa had ordered players in advance to wear shin guards . the secret star of the tournament was guido buchwald , of all people - a defensive player with limited talent from swabia .
the finals fittingly ended in 1-0 .
the winning goal was scored after a controversial penalty kick and two players were shown red cards . heading towards a new negative record with just eight games left to go in the 2006 world cup , the verdict - from a sports point of view - will be pretty sobering . the passionately celebrated soccer fest could end up with a new negative record .
just about 2.36 goals per game were scored in the 56 games that have been played so far and 19 players have already been sent off . it was all meant to be different .
the entire world was hoping to see some strong , attacking soccer .
coaching guru guus hiddink , currently coaching australia , was counting on a virtual goal feast . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cup began with a goal feast with germany 4-2 win over costa rica admittedly , the tournament did get off to a fantastic start .
in a first for the world cup , six goals were scored in the opening game alone .
the same was repeated when argentina systematically dismantled serbia & montenegro 's defense - ironically the same defense that is considered one of the strongest and which allowed just a single goal in the qualification rounds . the orange disappointment but otherwise , it 's been slim pickings at this world cup .
trinidad and tobago did n't manage a single goal in three games , angola and togo just one each .
maybe that 's all that could be expected from these world cup debutants . but even highly-regarded teams failed to deliver when it came to finding the net : the czechs departed with just three goals and the dutch , too , were equally shy about scoring .
they turned out to be the biggest disappointments of the cup . after all , its the dutch who have been the standard-bearers of the beautiful , attacking style of play since the 1974 world cup .
considering that dutch coach marco van basten - considered the best striker of his time - had promised great offensive play from his side , what followed instead was a swan song for all dutch virtues . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dutch were n't at their best against the ivory coast the netherlands may have had their three traditional strikers on the pitch , but too often it looked like the worst of lumbering german soccer in the pre-klinsmann era .
against the ivory coast and argentina , the oranje even committed the ultimate sacrilege possible in the netherlands by blocking and sticking to their half of the field . the dutch 's disgraceful exit in their 1-0 loss to portugal in a game marked by some nasty fouls completed the sad picture .
the four players who were sent off in that notorious game set a new world cup record under the motto " if you do n't find the net , you can at least foul . "
that was the case in 1990 too . special taste in soccer you have to have a special taste in soccer in order to really enjoy what 's on offer in the quarter-finals . england ?
terrible .
it 's almost fitting that captain david beckham threw up on the pitch .
brazil ?
smug to the point of apathy .
ukraine ?
in the world cup because of a lucky draw . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : totti 's last-gasp penalty kick against australia saved the italians ' day portugal ?
made an impact only because of their assaults .
italy ?
wily enough to wiggle their way through even after being shown red , albeit only with a pounding penalty kick in extra time .
france ?
has some of the best strikers in the world with henry and trezeguet - but only allows one to play . there 's no doubt that the 2006 world cup is all about security , efficiency and blocking techniques .
maybe the defensive fest is a poisoned legacy of the 2004 european championships .
several teams played some fantastic offensive soccer there , but greece did n't - and went on to win the tournament thanks to a mysterious quirk of the soccer gods . germany , of all teams and germany , of all teams , seems to have drawn lessons from that .
klinsmann 's attacking tactics really seem to be paying off . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german strikers klose and podolski have been wowing fans in germany and abroad , people are rubbing their eyes in disbelief .
the jubilant chants of the fans after their amazing win over sweden have a ring of truth to them : germany is really the most attractive team of the tournament when it comes to play .
it 's something that has n't been seen in a long time . there 's just one team that 's scored as many goals as germany - argentina .
it 's a pity that one of the two strongest teams in attacking soccer will have to leave after friday 's match , and that both wo n't make it to the finals - an event that marked the 1990 soccer year . the finals ended in 1-0 through an unfair penalty kick - for germany . oliver samson -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de last eight line-up exposes 2002 world cup as a false dawn the 2002 world cup was hailed as a move away from the traditional power bases of international soccer and a new dawn for asian and african teams .

if you ca n't score , go for a foul seems to be the motto of the world cup great stadiums , euphoric fans , a relaxed host country and benevolent weather gods have turned the world cup into a feast .
but the action on the pitch is n't exactly worth cheering about . from a german perspective , it 's easy to forget that the world cup 1990 was considered an absolute low point in world cup history . never before had so few goals -lrb- 2.21 per game -rrb- been scored and so many fouls -lrb- 16 players were sent off during the tournament -rrb- been committed during the world cup as they were in italy . thank god fifa had ordered players in advance to wear shin guards . the secret star of the tournament was guido buchwald , of all people - a defensive player with limited talent from swabia .
the finals fittingly ended in 1-0 .
the winning goal was scored after a controversial penalty kick and two players were shown red cards . heading towards a new negative record with just eight games left to go in the 2006 world cup , the verdict - from a sports point of view - will be pretty sobering . the passionately celebrated soccer fest could end up with a new negative record .
just about 2.36 goals per game were scored in the 56 games that have been played so far and 19 players have already been sent off . it was all meant to be different .
the entire world was hoping to see some strong , attacking soccer .
coaching guru guus hiddink , currently coaching australia , was counting on a virtual goal feast . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cup began with a goal feast with germany 4-2 win over costa rica admittedly , the tournament did get off to a fantastic start .
in a first for the world cup , six goals were scored in the opening game alone .
the same was repeated when argentina systematically dismantled serbia & montenegro 's defense - ironically the same defense that is considered one of the strongest and which allowed just a single goal in the qualification rounds . the orange disappointment but otherwise , it 's been slim pickings at this world cup .
trinidad and tobago did n't manage a single goal in three games , angola and togo just one each .
maybe that 's all that could be expected from these world cup debutants . but even highly-regarded teams failed to deliver when it came to finding the net : the czechs departed with just three goals and the dutch , too , were equally shy about scoring .
they turned out to be the biggest disappointments of the cup . after all , its the dutch who have been the standard-bearers of the beautiful , attacking style of play since the 1974 world cup .
considering that dutch coach marco van basten - considered the best striker of his time - had promised great offensive play from his side , what followed instead was a swan song for all dutch virtues . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dutch were n't at their best against the ivory coast the netherlands may have had their three traditional strikers on the pitch , but too often it looked like the worst of lumbering german soccer in the pre-klinsmann era .
against the ivory coast and argentina , the oranje even committed the ultimate sacrilege possible in the netherlands by blocking and sticking to their half of the field . the dutch 's disgraceful exit in their 1-0 loss to portugal in a game marked by some nasty fouls completed the sad picture .
the four players who were sent off in that notorious game set a new world cup record under the motto " if you do n't find the net , you can at least foul . "
that was the case in 1990 too . special taste in soccer you have to have a special taste in soccer in order to really enjoy what 's on offer in the quarter-finals . england ?

several teams played some fantastic offensive soccer there , but greece did n't - and went on to win the tournament thanks to a mysterious quirk of the soccer gods . germany , of all teams and germany , of all teams , seems to have drawn lessons from that .
klinsmann 's attacking tactics really seem to be paying off . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german strikers klose and podolski have been wowing fans in germany and abroad , people are rubbing their eyes in disbelief .

it 's something that has n't been seen in a long time . there 's just one team that 's scored as many goals as germany - argentina .
it 's a pity that one of the two strongest teams in attacking soccer will have to leave after friday 's match , and that both wo n't make it to the finals - an event that marked the 1990 soccer year . the finals ended in 1-0 through an unfair penalty kick - for germany . oliver samson -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de last eight line-up exposes 2002 world cup as a false dawn the 2002 world cup was hailed as a move away from the traditional power bases of international soccer and a new dawn for asian and african teams .

" nothing unites quite like football , " said vassyl androsenko , a 52-year-old engineer in kiev . the country 's soccer stars have taken up the slack as ignoring which part of the country they come from or language they speak , they room together irrespective of political differences and converse in both dialects . ukraine national team doing its part for unity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's players come from rival areas - not that you 'd know " i think these guys have done more tonight to reunite the country than all politicians put together , " commented petro poroshenko , tipped to be the next parliament speaker after the penalty shootout win over the swiss in the second round . franz beckenbauer , german soccer legend and the man responsible for winning the right for germany to host the extravaganza , is convinced that the sport has more far reaching effects than simply firing up brief bouts of nationalism . the 60-year-old should know because he has traveled the world in his role as chief organizer of the finals but also was born into a divided country himself and won his two world cup titles with west germany , though the 1990 team did have a couple of players from the east in it . " football occupies an incredibly important position , especially in africa a continent that has all sorts of problems , " he told the german magazine , bundesliga earlier this year . africans have team spirit while factions at home wage war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivory coast fans ignored the civil unrest to follow their team " in ivory coast and togo the people are embroiled in terrible civil wars , while angola has emerged from decades of internal conflict and is still riddled with land mines . " " football can help to build bridges .
it brings opposing chiefs together to sit beside each other and watch matches and it is almost as if it helps them to understand each other . " the ' kaiser 's ' opinion may seem naive given the amount of discord and war on the african continent , but it certainly echoes the efforts of the ivory coast players to ensure their success on the pitch helps with bringing the rebel-held north of the country together with the government maintained south . their players , similar to the ukrainians , place great worth in team harmony despite coming from different sides of the political equation . " we think that every time we get together is a chance to show ivorians that they can get on , " said striker bonaventure kalou . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de africa stands united behind its teams for africa , the world cup is more than simply an entertaining sports event .

the concession would gut efforts to combat climate change , they warn . german members of greenpeace staged a protest outside chancellor angela merkel 's office , condemning a scheme to grant greater carbon-pollution rights to german industry as a multi-billion-euro gift " that will lead to a climate catastrophe . " the national allocation plan ii , which received cabinet approval wednesday and covers policy from 2008 to 2012 , allows industry and electricity companies to emit 482 million tons of carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- per year under the kyoto protocol 's cap-and-trade system . the scheme marks an increase over last year 's level of 474 million tons , which the government had argued was unusually low and unfairly penalized german industry . the allocation is worth more than 7 billion euros on the basis of a current market price of about 15 euros -lrb- $ 18.75 -rrb- per ton of co2 under the eu 's emissions trading scheme . pollution at a steep price the plans have been criticized by ecologists , germany 's regional states and even industry groups . " the federal government must not allow such amounts to be given away for nothing , " baden-württemberg state environment minister ernst pfister told the financial times deutschland . environmentalists want pollution to come at a steep price and are calling for the certificates to be auctioned off , which the european commission - the eu 's executive - allows for up to 10 percent of the rights under the ets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german officials say that german industry is unfairly penalized the ets , one of the core mechanisms of the kyoto protocol on greenhouse gases , aims at reducing pollution by big industry . participants are set a quota of emissions and must pay a stiff financial penalty for every ton of co2 that breaches this threshold . companies that are below their quota can sell surplus emissions rights to firms that are above their quota , thus providing a carrot to everyone to clean up their act . but green groups say the market , which has been operating only since jan .
1 , 2005 , could be wrecked if the quotas are not tight enough . green groups angry the price for co2 was badly hit in april when several countries reported that their actual emissions in the first phase of the ets operations had been way below their estimated emissions , thus leaving a lot of surplus co2 on the market . recovery of the market has been based on expectations that countries will impose more stringent quotas for the period after 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace continues to work for the kyoto protocol around the world this explains the dismay among environmental groups at the decision made by the cabinet in berlin this week . under the plan , energy companies and industry must cut their co2 emissions by 15 million tons per year , marking a cut of about 3 percent compared to the average in 2000-2002 , but green groups are angry that , compared with the 2005 level , it represents an increase . under the kyoto protocol , germany pledged to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 21 percent from 1990 levels by the period 2008-2012 . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de carbon emissions traders carefully optimistic in cologne it 's been a year since the eu launched its first carbon trading market and things are looking up in spite of a recent plunge in prices , experts say .

the incentives are conditional on iran forgoing large-scale uranium enrichment and answering questions about its program . iran has a two-week deadline french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said that iran must reply to the international plan before the july 15-17 g8 summit .

the incentives are conditional on iran forgoing large-scale uranium enrichment and answering questions about its program . iran has a two-week deadline french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said that iran must reply to the international plan before the july 15-17 g8 summit . " it seems clear to me that iran must say yes .
then there will be negotiations , " douste-blazy said . u.s. secretary of state condoleezza rice earlier said the ministers would talk about iran , about how to deal with the palestinians ' hamas government and about democracy in russia and belarus . " we should also talk about democracy , " rice told the broadcaster cnn , expressing a desire for russia to " enhance its commitment to democratic development " as well as referring to belarus and other " places that have yet to see a democratic future . " russia has played a significant role in the standoff over iran 's nuclear program , being a permanent member of the united nations security council and a close ally of tehran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin : " russia will not join any ultimatum " on iran president vladimir putin on tuesday again underlined his differences with the west on the iran issue , saying russia did not intend " to join any sort of ultimatum , which only pushes the situation into a dead end . " amid reports that moscow wants to limit discussion of its human rights record or commitment to democracy at next month 's summit , a senior kremlin official defended russia 's role in neighboring parts of ex-communist europe . " moscow has done much more for democracy in central europe than washington or london , " said the deputy head of putin 's office , vladislav surkov , at a briefing wednesday .
" it 's moscow which democratized this immense space . " but if russia hopes to avoid discussion of accusations that it is backsliding on democracy and media freedom , the british foreign secretary margaret beckett reiterated that britain had concerns about human rights and the rule of law in russia . beckett , in an interview with russia 's kommersant broadsheet , also said she hoped next month 's summit would give a signal about the importance of competitive and open energy markets . " russia 's actions are inconsistent with g8 democratic norms " four prominent u.s. lawmakers on tuesday urged president george w. bush to rebuke putin over the " deterioration of democracy " in his country . it is important that the other g8 heads of state " make clear that russia 's actions are inconsistent with g8 democratic norms , " read a letter signed by democratic representative tom lantos and republican david dreier , together with senators john mccain , a republican , and democrat joe lieberman . earlier , an analyst close to the kremlin , the head of the moscow-based institute for political research , sergei markov , said he expected thursday 's meeting to be " rather tense .

daimlerchrysler 's midget smart car will take on the us market in 2008 , with executives hoping the nimble microcar can out-manoeuvre rivals in the land of the mammoth sports utility vehicle . the german-us automaker said wednesday it will launch the car through a partner - a company headed by racing legend roger penske - in early 2008 .
high fuel prices and positive responses from consumers drove the decision . at 2.5 meters long -lrb- 8.2 feet -rrb- and weighing in at a mere 990 kilos -lrb- 2,180 pounds -rrb- , the two-seat smart car is about half the size of a hummer , ford expedition or other large suv . but daimlerchrysler chairman dieter zetsche said the smart - which will be offered in three models in the world 's largest automotive market - can hold its own against us muscle cars . " times have changed , and urban us streets are becoming increasingly congested , " zetsche told reporters during the announcement . " gas prices are also increasing , and we may never see cheap gas again , " he added . some smart cars are already sold in the us through unofficial resellers , but wednesday 's announcement designates automotive retailer penske 's unitedauto group as the official distributor for the smart in the united states and puerto rico . smart cars have been on european roads since 1998 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some have likened the smart 's appearance to a baby shoe daimlerchrysler officials hope to promote the urban microcar as offering a fun driving experience , and have been able to place the vehicle in movies like " the da vinci code , " where it was used in a chase scene in paris , and the remake of " the pink panther " starring steve martin as inspector clouseau . " the time has never been better for this - and i am convinced that the smart fortwo as an innovative , ecological and agile city car will soon become just as familiar a sight on the streets of new york , miami or seattle as it is today in rome , berlin or paris , " zetsche said . the smart brand , which was launched in 1998 , has been a laggard for the automotive conglomerate , and the decision over whether to launch the brand in the largest auto market was heavily debated . the additional sales volume could help smart meet its target of achieving profitability . zetsche said there was never any doubt over whether smart would enter the us market , pointing out that the next-generation fortwo was always designed to meet the safety and crash regulations established in the united states . the issue that needed to be finalized before the announcement was the distribution plan , which will be handled exclusively by unitedauto , part of a company headed by penske with dealers in 20 states . the distributor said it would select between 30 and 50 dealers in major urban us markets , along with a few select leisure markets . success in canada while expecting to sell the fortwo at less than 15,000 dollars per unit , penske would not comment on volume targets but noted smart 's recent success in canada , where the brand was expected to achieve 1,500 units in its first year but ended up achieving more than 4,000 sales . the smart car would be among the least fuel-hungry cars on the road .

daimlerchrysler 's midget smart car will take on the us market in 2008 , with executives hoping the nimble microcar can out-manoeuvre rivals in the land of the mammoth sports utility vehicle . the german-us automaker said wednesday it will launch the car through a partner - a company headed by racing legend roger penske - in early 2008 .
high fuel prices and positive responses from consumers drove the decision . at 2.5 meters long -lrb- 8.2 feet -rrb- and weighing in at a mere 990 kilos -lrb- 2,180 pounds -rrb- , the two-seat smart car is about half the size of a hummer , ford expedition or other large suv . but daimlerchrysler chairman dieter zetsche said the smart - which will be offered in three models in the world 's largest automotive market - can hold its own against us muscle cars . " times have changed , and urban us streets are becoming increasingly congested , " zetsche told reporters during the announcement . " gas prices are also increasing , and we may never see cheap gas again , " he added . some smart cars are already sold in the us through unofficial resellers , but wednesday 's announcement designates automotive retailer penske 's unitedauto group as the official distributor for the smart in the united states and puerto rico . smart cars have been on european roads since 1998 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some have likened the smart 's appearance to a baby shoe daimlerchrysler officials hope to promote the urban microcar as offering a fun driving experience , and have been able to place the vehicle in movies like " the da vinci code , " where it was used in a chase scene in paris , and the remake of " the pink panther " starring steve martin as inspector clouseau . " the time has never been better for this - and i am convinced that the smart fortwo as an innovative , ecological and agile city car will soon become just as familiar a sight on the streets of new york , miami or seattle as it is today in rome , berlin or paris , " zetsche said . the smart brand , which was launched in 1998 , has been a laggard for the automotive conglomerate , and the decision over whether to launch the brand in the largest auto market was heavily debated . the additional sales volume could help smart meet its target of achieving profitability . zetsche said there was never any doubt over whether smart would enter the us market , pointing out that the next-generation fortwo was always designed to meet the safety and crash regulations established in the united states . the issue that needed to be finalized before the announcement was the distribution plan , which will be handled exclusively by unitedauto , part of a company headed by penske with dealers in 20 states . the distributor said it would select between 30 and 50 dealers in major urban us markets , along with a few select leisure markets . success in canada while expecting to sell the fortwo at less than 15,000 dollars per unit , penske would not comment on volume targets but noted smart 's recent success in canada , where the brand was expected to achieve 1,500 units in its first year but ended up achieving more than 4,000 sales . the smart car would be among the least fuel-hungry cars on the road .

it 's all sadly familiar .
england are at a world cup and certain fans are causing chaos .
yet these rowdies sport designer pumps and are blinged to the max . the germans ca n't be blamed for not being ready .
everything that could be done was done .
police forces from both sides of the channel had been liaising for months on the best strategies to employ to minimize the damage . however , while british and german security forces were preparing for the possible influx of english soccer hooligans , no one was prepared for the havoc that the wives and girlfriends -lrb- wags -rrb- of the england players would wreak . imagine , if you dare , a typical night out in a large english city .
even for those who have never experienced one , it 's not hard to visualize the scene .
stories of boozy evenings in england are as much tabloid fodder in the international press as they are in the red tops back home . the binge drinking normally ends with sweaty lads in designer shirts bawling or brawling as the girls battle to keep their dignity covered by micro-minis while simultaneously knocking back alcopops and trying to stay upright . now substitute manchester on a friday night with baden-baden on every night of the week since the england team took up residence there .
also , substitute micro-minis for this year 's must-have hotpants and alcopops for moet & chandon .
welcome to the sideshow which is the wags on tour . wags turn spa town into a never-ending hen night bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baden-baden in more sedate times more used to retired german millionaires shuffling into the spas that it is famous for , the population of baden-baden has been knocked sideways by the arrival of the women and their designer handbags and fake tans . they are staying at the 1450 euro -lrb- $ 1821 -rrb- a night brenner 's park hotel and the paparazzi with their long lenses have followed them . leading the pack is victoria " posh spice " beckham .
at 32 , victoria is the doyen of footballers ' wives having been there and done that . while her appearance in skimpy shorts and massive sunglasses sparked debate about whether she is too thin , she has otherwise maintained a low profile , looking after her three children and cheering on husband david . the other wags have been more conspicuous , competing in the fashion stakes while seeing who can drink and spend the most . normally quiet bars turned into wild west saloons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steve gerrard 's partner alex curran : likes to party , allegedly " they swilled drink , smashed glasses , roared raucous chants and belted out bawdy sing-songs , " yelled the british tabloid daily mirror after some were spotted in one of the few late-night bars here where most of the other customers were reporters . it said they rang up a bill of thousands of pounds after downing bottles of moet champagne followed by glasses of vodka and red bull and shots of sambucca . after drunkenly singing songs in honor of england , things then turned partisan when the wags of the liverpool contingent started singing offensive songs about chelsea and manchester united . while the downtime is becoming notorious , the shopping sprees , meanwhile , have become legendary . mass market german daily bild said six of the wags , including posh and coach sven-goran eriksson 's girlfriend nancy dellolio , spent 80,000 euros in one hour in the town 's luxury boutiques . it said the women blew 4,395 euros in 10 minutes alone on shoes and t-shirts , with the rest going on creations by dolce and gabbana , prada and versace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what 's good for uma is good for the wags " i hope england stays in the competition for a while , " delighted boutique owner monika scholz was quoted as saying .
however , that opinion is not shared by many of the locals who have become increasingly annoyed with the drunken antics of the wags .
many have said they ca n't wait for england to get knocked out so they can all go home . divisions over behavior and as the weeks have passed - during which baden-baden has become known as boring-boring - tensions have grown and splits in the ranks have reportedly occurred within the group , with some tiring of the others ' antics and attitudes . ashley cole 's pop star fiancée cheryl tweedy has become close to posh and dellolio , and wayne rooney 's girlfriend coleen mcloughlin , who brought her own tanning consultant with her , has also sided with them . " victoria 's been in this game for years .
she 's got decorum whereas some of the others could n't even spell the word , " the mirror quoted an " insider " as saying . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i think we lost ' em , babes such has been the sideshow that britain 's " high-brow " media has also waded in , with the sunday times citing a survey by carma , an international media analysis company , on which wag has got the most press coverage .
the winner so far is tweedy , a singer with the group girls aloud . next comes posh , followed by carly zucker , the fitness instructor girlfriend of joe cole .
following her is melanie slade , the student girlfriend of theo walcott , england 's teenage striker who has yet to get a game .
she beat off mcloughlin , and abigail clancy , the squeeze of peter crouch . next up was elen rives , the partner of frank lampard who was prevented from boarding her flight to germany after throwing a tantrum when told she could not take six items of hand luggage with her . and then there are the mads , or mums and dads of the players , who are also here in force . while their behavior has been far more restrained , neville neville -lrb- no , really -rrb- , the father of defender gary , left his mark when he was pictured dancing on a couch at a club with the wags holding a replica world cup . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de soccer wives and the beautiful game their husbands may make a living from playing a game but for the wives of international soccer stars , life is more serious than that .

the incentives are conditional on iran forgoing large-scale uranium enrichment and answering questions about its program . iran has a two-week deadline french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said that iran must reply to the international plan before the july 15-17 g8 summit . " it seems clear to me that iran must say yes .
then there will be negotiations , " douste-blazy said . u.s. secretary of state condoleezza rice earlier said the ministers would talk about iran , about how to deal with the palestinians ' hamas government and about democracy in russia and belarus . " we should also talk about democracy , " rice told the broadcaster cnn , expressing a desire for russia to " enhance its commitment to democratic development " as well as referring to belarus and other " places that have yet to see a democratic future . " russia has played a significant role in the standoff over iran 's nuclear program , being a permanent member of the united nations security council and a close ally of tehran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin : " russia will not join any ultimatum " on iran president vladimir putin on tuesday again underlined his differences with the west on the iran issue , saying russia did not intend " to join any sort of ultimatum , which only pushes the situation into a dead end . " amid reports that moscow wants to limit discussion of its human rights record or commitment to democracy at next month 's summit , a senior kremlin official defended russia 's role in neighboring parts of ex-communist europe . " moscow has done much more for democracy in central europe than washington or london , " said the deputy head of putin 's office , vladislav surkov , at a briefing wednesday .
" it 's moscow which democratized this immense space . " but if russia hopes to avoid discussion of accusations that it is backsliding on democracy and media freedom , the british foreign secretary margaret beckett reiterated that britain had concerns about human rights and the rule of law in russia . beckett , in an interview with russia 's kommersant broadsheet , also said she hoped next month 's summit would give a signal about the importance of competitive and open energy markets . " russia 's actions are inconsistent with g8 democratic norms " four prominent u.s. lawmakers on tuesday urged president george w. bush to rebuke putin over the " deterioration of democracy " in his country . it is important that the other g8 heads of state " make clear that russia 's actions are inconsistent with g8 democratic norms , " read a letter signed by democratic representative tom lantos and republican david dreier , together with senators john mccain , a republican , and democrat joe lieberman . earlier , an analyst close to the kremlin , the head of the moscow-based institute for political research , sergei markov , said he expected thursday 's meeting to be " rather tense .

the concession would gut efforts to combat climate change , they warn . german members of greenpeace staged a protest outside chancellor angela merkel 's office , condemning a scheme to grant greater carbon-pollution rights to german industry as a multi-billion-euro gift " that will lead to a climate catastrophe .

" i get the feeling that the french public do not feel truly represented by them which , without doubt , explains why there is not the same depth of support as there was eight years ago " when france won the world cup at home . le pen also indulged in an old charge that the french players did not properly sing the national anthem when it was played just prior to kickoff , citing the case of zinedine zidane " who mumbles it a bit . " replying to the comments at the french training base in germany , domenech said that it was wrong to single out the french players for such criticism .
" he should take a look at the other teams .
we are probably one of the teams which have the most players that sing the national anthem . " eccentric , divisive coach finally fights for his players bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : domenech has come out to support his team 100 percent " he should stop saying things like this , the spanish do n't sing , the argentineans do n't sing .
the players are proud to wear the french colors . " lilian thuram , france 's most capped player , also took issue with le pen , saying : " vive la france , but not the france that monsieur le pen wants .
he wants to be president but he does n't know his history of france . " " maybe mr. le pen has n't been told that some french people are black and others have got blond or brown hair .

" some sing the anthem and some do n't but whether you sing it or not has nothing to do with whether you feel french or not , " the defender said . " maybe we should invite monsieur le pen to celebrate our next victory with us , " thuram said .

the concession would gut efforts to combat climate change , they warn . german members of greenpeace staged a protest outside chancellor angela merkel 's office , condemning a scheme to grant greater carbon-pollution rights to german industry as a multi-billion-euro gift " that will lead to a climate catastrophe . " the national allocation plan ii , which received cabinet approval wednesday and covers policy from 2008 to 2012 , allows industry and electricity companies to emit 482 million tons of carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- per year under the kyoto protocol 's cap-and-trade system . the scheme marks an increase over last year 's level of 474 million tons , which the government had argued was unusually low and unfairly penalized german industry . the allocation is worth more than 7 billion euros on the basis of a current market price of about 15 euros -lrb- $ 18.75 -rrb- per ton of co2 under the eu 's emissions trading scheme . pollution at a steep price the plans have been criticized by ecologists , germany 's regional states and even industry groups . " the federal government must not allow such amounts to be given away for nothing , " baden-württemberg state environment minister ernst pfister told the financial times deutschland . environmentalists want pollution to come at a steep price and are calling for the certificates to be auctioned off , which the european commission - the eu 's executive - allows for up to 10 percent of the rights under the ets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german officials say that german industry is unfairly penalized the ets , one of the core mechanisms of the kyoto protocol on greenhouse gases , aims at reducing pollution by big industry . participants are set a quota of emissions and must pay a stiff financial penalty for every ton of co2 that breaches this threshold . companies that are below their quota can sell surplus emissions rights to firms that are above their quota , thus providing a carrot to everyone to clean up their act . but green groups say the market , which has been operating only since jan .
1 , 2005 , could be wrecked if the quotas are not tight enough . green groups angry the price for co2 was badly hit in april when several countries reported that their actual emissions in the first phase of the ets operations had been way below their estimated emissions , thus leaving a lot of surplus co2 on the market . recovery of the market has been based on expectations that countries will impose more stringent quotas for the period after 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace continues to work for the kyoto protocol around the world this explains the dismay among environmental groups at the decision made by the cabinet in berlin this week . under the plan , energy companies and industry must cut their co2 emissions by 15 million tons per year , marking a cut of about 3 percent compared to the average in 2000-2002 , but green groups are angry that , compared with the 2005 level , it represents an increase . under the kyoto protocol , germany pledged to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 21 percent from 1990 levels by the period 2008-2012 . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de carbon emissions traders carefully optimistic in cologne it 's been a year since the eu launched its first carbon trading market and things are looking up in spite of a recent plunge in prices , experts say .

friday 's game could be a case of the best not being saved for last . germany 's soccer reputation lay in shreds for a decade but has been restored virtually overnight under the sunny disposition of jürgen klinsmann , a man whose ubiquitous smile grew to previously-unseen proportions saturday after beating sweden in the round of 16 . now he and the german team are looking forward to their quarter-final match against south american juggernaut argentina .
the sides have met under their current coaches twice already and reached 2-2 splits each time .

three protestors made a statement to that effect by getting naked during a game .
as if to emphasize their point , none of the crowd noticed . when one thinks of brazilians and the world cup , the usual image which springs to mind is the co-ordinated shaking of yellow and green-clad booties , gyrating in a celebration of the samba style and beautiful game for which the selecao is famous for .
such is the nation 's affinity with soccer ; one would not imagine any brazilians protesting against the sport .
and especially not while naked .
but this is what allegedly happened in a brazilian city during the last 16 clash between the selecao and ghana .
while the world cup is enthralling most of germany , and much of europe , the three men walked around a brazilian city in the buff while locals watched the match .
the three streakers-with-a-social-conscience staged the protest because they disagreed with how " the whole country stops to watch the football matches during the world cup , while enormous problems in brazil - like a lack of education among many people and a poor health system - keep getting worse . "
unfortunately for the exhibitionist crusaders , being in the tiny majority of brazilians who had time to think about the country 's problems while ronaldo and co. went about their business meant that no-one actually took a blind bit of notice .

if you ca n't score , go for a foul seems to be the motto of the world cup great stadiums , euphoric fans , a relaxed host country and benevolent weather gods have turned the world cup into a feast .
but the action on the pitch is n't exactly worth cheering about . from a german perspective , it 's easy to forget that the world cup 1990 was considered an absolute low point in world cup history . never before had so few goals -lrb- 2.21 per game -rrb- been scored and so many fouls -lrb- 16 players were sent off during the tournament -rrb- been committed during the world cup as they were in italy . thank god fifa had ordered players in advance to wear shin guards . the secret star of the tournament was guido buchwald , of all people - a defensive player with limited talent from swabia .
the finals fittingly ended in 1-0 .
the winning goal was scored after a controversial penalty kick and two players were shown red cards . heading towards a new negative record with just eight games left to go in the 2006 world cup , the verdict - from a sports point of view - will be pretty sobering . the passionately celebrated soccer fest could end up with a new negative record .
just about 2.36 goals per game were scored in the 56 games that have been played so far and 19 players have already been sent off . it was all meant to be different .
the entire world was hoping to see some strong , attacking soccer .
coaching guru guus hiddink , currently coaching australia , was counting on a virtual goal feast . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cup began with a goal feast with germany 4-2 win over costa rica admittedly , the tournament did get off to a fantastic start .
in a first for the world cup , six goals were scored in the opening game alone .
the same was repeated when argentina systematically dismantled serbia & montenegro 's defense - ironically the same defense that is considered one of the strongest and which allowed just a single goal in the qualification rounds . the orange disappointment but otherwise , it 's been slim pickings at this world cup .
trinidad and tobago did n't manage a single goal in three games , angola and togo just one each .
maybe that 's all that could be expected from these world cup debutants . but even highly-regarded teams failed to deliver when it came to finding the net : the czechs departed with just three goals and the dutch , too , were equally shy about scoring .
they turned out to be the biggest disappointments of the cup . after all , its the dutch who have been the standard-bearers of the beautiful , attacking style of play since the 1974 world cup .
considering that dutch coach marco van basten - considered the best striker of his time - had promised great offensive play from his side , what followed instead was a swan song for all dutch virtues . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dutch were n't at their best against the ivory coast the netherlands may have had their three traditional strikers on the pitch , but too often it looked like the worst of lumbering german soccer in the pre-klinsmann era .

work-life balance gets boost in germany the dumbing down of germany gerd 's family policy gets down to business encouraging germans to have more kids germany -pipe- 29.06.2006 study : men in germany are scared to start families großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany faces problems with low birth rates low birth rates and the ageing population in germany have dominated media in discussions about how to pay for health care and social security .
now , a study says it is men who are primarily responsible for fewer births . in its study , the robert bosch foundation found that " men are scared to start families , " said ingrid hamm , managing director of the foundation .
the study says one in four men in germany do not want children , whereas one in seven women prefer to remain childless .
in eastern germany , that rate is lower , with one in 10 women exopressing the wish to remain childless . the study was based on responses from 10,017 people .
researchers say the survey was representative , even of the smallest groups in germany . men and women in germany also differ on the number of children they would like to have .
men want only an average of 1.59 kids ; the average number of children women would like is 1.75 .
both of these numbers , however , are still higher than germany 's actual average birth rate of 1.37 children per woman . under pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both men and women in germany want more babies than the number being born hamm said another reason for fewer children in germany is that people feel too much pressure .
they have long career training periods and then " have to do everything at once between the ages of 30 and 40 : get married , have kids , build a house , pursue their careers and save money for retirement , " she said . " all that pressure makes people put off having children until later or not at all . " women , too , are faced with a loss of economic control over their lives if they choose a baby break .
for a well-to-do country like germany , the economic loss is even greater , hamm said . she added that , in addition , germans lack faith in the future . " in germany , we have lost a sense that everything will turn out all right .
germans are prone to worrying about the future a lot more than other people , " she said . " german " is not just german , however .
the study found that the wish to forgo having children is much stronger in the former west german states .
in the new german states -lrb- formerly east germany -rrb- , fewer women want to remain childless . " children in the former gdr were everywhere , " hamm said . " mothers and fathers both worked , and east german children grew up with the image that being both parent and employee is possible . " " better policies could boost birth rates " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " large families are frowned upon , " hamm said the survey respondents said they would appreciate politicians creating better conditions to help people start families - such as greater financial support , improved childcare and more part-time jobs created for parents . eighty-nine percent of the respondents said they would prefer flexible working hours for employed parents . increased financial support from the government would help large families and less qualified people . on the other hand , better childcare possibilities would encourage those currently without children and aid families with only one child , as well as highly-qualified working parents and women in eastern germany , researchers reported . the study said women desiring a first child wanted the most support , but also that one-fifth of the women who did not want children could still be encouraged through better family policies . the study also found that families with one child or highly-educated people would most likely choose to have a first or an additional child if family-oriented policies were in place that fit their individual needs . hamm said the study showed that having children is just one of many values among germans ; it is not a top priority .

work-life balance gets boost in germany the dumbing down of germany gerd 's family policy gets down to business encouraging germans to have more kids germany -pipe- 29.06.2006 study : men in germany are scared to start families großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany faces problems with low birth rates low birth rates and the ageing population in germany have dominated media in discussions about how to pay for health care and social security .
now , a study says it is men who are primarily responsible for fewer births . in its study , the robert bosch foundation found that " men are scared to start families , " said ingrid hamm , managing director of the foundation .
the study says one in four men in germany do not want children , whereas one in seven women prefer to remain childless .
in eastern germany , that rate is lower , with one in 10 women exopressing the wish to remain childless . the study was based on responses from 10,017 people .
researchers say the survey was representative , even of the smallest groups in germany . men and women in germany also differ on the number of children they would like to have .
men want only an average of 1.59 kids ; the average number of children women would like is 1.75 .
both of these numbers , however , are still higher than germany 's actual average birth rate of 1.37 children per woman . under pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both men and women in germany want more babies than the number being born hamm said another reason for fewer children in germany is that people feel too much pressure .
they have long career training periods and then " have to do everything at once between the ages of 30 and 40 : get married , have kids , build a house , pursue their careers and save money for retirement , " she said . " all that pressure makes people put off having children until later or not at all . " women , too , are faced with a loss of economic control over their lives if they choose a baby break .
for a well-to-do country like germany , the economic loss is even greater , hamm said . she added that , in addition , germans lack faith in the future . " in germany , we have lost a sense that everything will turn out all right .
germans are prone to worrying about the future a lot more than other people , " she said . " german " is not just german , however .
the study found that the wish to forgo having children is much stronger in the former west german states .
in the new german states -lrb- formerly east germany -rrb- , fewer women want to remain childless . " children in the former gdr were everywhere , " hamm said . " mothers and fathers both worked , and east german children grew up with the image that being both parent and employee is possible . " " better policies could boost birth rates " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " large families are frowned upon , " hamm said the survey respondents said they would appreciate politicians creating better conditions to help people start families - such as greater financial support , improved childcare and more part-time jobs created for parents . eighty-nine percent of the respondents said they would prefer flexible working hours for employed parents . increased financial support from the government would help large families and less qualified people . on the other hand , better childcare possibilities would encourage those currently without children and aid families with only one child , as well as highly-qualified working parents and women in eastern germany , researchers reported . the study said women desiring a first child wanted the most support , but also that one-fifth of the women who did not want children could still be encouraged through better family policies . the study also found that families with one child or highly-educated people would most likely choose to have a first or an additional child if family-oriented policies were in place that fit their individual needs . hamm said the study showed that having children is just one of many values among germans ; it is not a top priority .

" i get the feeling that the french public do not feel truly represented by them which , without doubt , explains why there is not the same depth of support as there was eight years ago " when france won the world cup at home . le pen also indulged in an old charge that the french players did not properly sing the national anthem when it was played just prior to kickoff , citing the case of zinedine zidane " who mumbles it a bit . " replying to the comments at the french training base in germany , domenech said that it was wrong to single out the french players for such criticism .
" he should take a look at the other teams .
we are probably one of the teams which have the most players that sing the national anthem . " eccentric , divisive coach finally fights for his players bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : domenech has come out to support his team 100 percent " he should stop saying things like this , the spanish do n't sing , the argentineans do n't sing .
the players are proud to wear the french colors . " lilian thuram , france 's most capped player , also took issue with le pen , saying : " vive la france , but not the france that monsieur le pen wants .
he wants to be president but he does n't know his history of france . " " maybe mr. le pen has n't been told that some french people are black and others have got blond or brown hair . " " the public support the france team , they do n't ask what color the players are , regardless of whether they 're black or brown or white the team represents france .
if you see him tell him we 're proud to be french . " le pen 's racist remarks falling on deaf ears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the france team is too black for racist le pen le pen has regularly been at loggerheads with the french national side which draws its players from a mixed background of european and african descent . " he says there are too many black players on the team , well i do n't know how to respond to that as i 'm not black , " thuram , born in guadeloupe , teased . the defender 's comments sparked a spontaneous round of applause from the 100 or so journalists and photographers present . thuram also addressed le pen 's comments that some players should be kicked out of the team for not singing the la marseillaise .
" some sing the anthem and some do n't but whether you sing it or not has nothing to do with whether you feel french or not , " the defender said . " maybe we should invite monsieur le pen to celebrate our next victory with us , " thuram said .

if you ca n't score , go for a foul seems to be the motto of the world cup great stadiums , euphoric fans , a relaxed host country and benevolent weather gods have turned the world cup into a feast .
but the action on the pitch is n't exactly worth cheering about . from a german perspective , it 's easy to forget that the world cup 1990 was considered an absolute low point in world cup history . never before had so few goals -lrb- 2.21 per game -rrb- been scored and so many fouls -lrb- 16 players were sent off during the tournament -rrb- been committed during the world cup as they were in italy . thank god fifa had ordered players in advance to wear shin guards . the secret star of the tournament was guido buchwald , of all people - a defensive player with limited talent from swabia .
the finals fittingly ended in 1-0 .
the winning goal was scored after a controversial penalty kick and two players were shown red cards . heading towards a new negative record with just eight games left to go in the 2006 world cup , the verdict - from a sports point of view - will be pretty sobering . the passionately celebrated soccer fest could end up with a new negative record .
just about 2.36 goals per game were scored in the 56 games that have been played so far and 19 players have already been sent off . it was all meant to be different .
the entire world was hoping to see some strong , attacking soccer .
coaching guru guus hiddink , currently coaching australia , was counting on a virtual goal feast . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cup began with a goal feast with germany 4-2 win over costa rica admittedly , the tournament did get off to a fantastic start .
in a first for the world cup , six goals were scored in the opening game alone .
the same was repeated when argentina systematically dismantled serbia & montenegro 's defense - ironically the same defense that is considered one of the strongest and which allowed just a single goal in the qualification rounds . the orange disappointment but otherwise , it 's been slim pickings at this world cup .
trinidad and tobago did n't manage a single goal in three games , angola and togo just one each .
maybe that 's all that could be expected from these world cup debutants . but even highly-regarded teams failed to deliver when it came to finding the net : the czechs departed with just three goals and the dutch , too , were equally shy about scoring .
they turned out to be the biggest disappointments of the cup . after all , its the dutch who have been the standard-bearers of the beautiful , attacking style of play since the 1974 world cup .
considering that dutch coach marco van basten - considered the best striker of his time - had promised great offensive play from his side , what followed instead was a swan song for all dutch virtues . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dutch were n't at their best against the ivory coast the netherlands may have had their three traditional strikers on the pitch , but too often it looked like the worst of lumbering german soccer in the pre-klinsmann era .
against the ivory coast and argentina , the oranje even committed the ultimate sacrilege possible in the netherlands by blocking and sticking to their half of the field . the dutch 's disgraceful exit in their 1-0 loss to portugal in a game marked by some nasty fouls completed the sad picture .
the four players who were sent off in that notorious game set a new world cup record under the motto " if you do n't find the net , you can at least foul . "
that was the case in 1990 too . special taste in soccer you have to have a special taste in soccer in order to really enjoy what 's on offer in the quarter-finals . england ?
terrible .
it 's almost fitting that captain david beckham threw up on the pitch .
brazil ?
smug to the point of apathy .
ukraine ?
in the world cup because of a lucky draw . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : totti 's last-gasp penalty kick against australia saved the italians ' day portugal ?
made an impact only because of their assaults .
italy ?
wily enough to wiggle their way through even after being shown red , albeit only with a pounding penalty kick in extra time .
france ?
has some of the best strikers in the world with henry and trezeguet - but only allows one to play . there 's no doubt that the 2006 world cup is all about security , efficiency and blocking techniques .
maybe the defensive fest is a poisoned legacy of the 2004 european championships .
several teams played some fantastic offensive soccer there , but greece did n't - and went on to win the tournament thanks to a mysterious quirk of the soccer gods . germany , of all teams and germany , of all teams , seems to have drawn lessons from that .
klinsmann 's attacking tactics really seem to be paying off . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german strikers klose and podolski have been wowing fans in germany and abroad , people are rubbing their eyes in disbelief .
the jubilant chants of the fans after their amazing win over sweden have a ring of truth to them : germany is really the most attractive team of the tournament when it comes to play .
it 's something that has n't been seen in a long time . there 's just one team that 's scored as many goals as germany - argentina .
it 's a pity that one of the two strongest teams in attacking soccer will have to leave after friday 's match , and that both wo n't make it to the finals - an event that marked the 1990 soccer year . the finals ended in 1-0 through an unfair penalty kick - for germany . oliver samson -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de last eight line-up exposes 2002 world cup as a false dawn the 2002 world cup was hailed as a move away from the traditional power bases of international soccer and a new dawn for asian and african teams .
the latter stages of the 2006 tournament , however , suggests differently .

a german publisher , wbg , dropped their case asking for a preliminary injunction against the google books library project in the regional court of hamburg wednesday after the judge told them they were unlikely to get it .
the court ruled that there was no copyright violation stemming from the project .
digitizing 15 million books wbg started their action against the american company 's " book search engine " which began in 2004 .
it was the first time a german publisher had brought a case against google , although the action was backed by the german publishers association .
in the case , wbg wanted to stop google from scanning into its search engine any work published in germany and displaying snippets on its search pages .
the world 's largest internet search engine had announced that it wants to digitize about 15 million volumes from american and british libraries including those at harvard and stanford universities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google says its book snippets do not violate copyright laws it would work this way : google lets users type in a search term then scans its digitized library for the word or expression and produces a list of books where the term is mentioned .
users can then click on the results and a few pages of the text appear allowing users to read up online .
the idea is to supplement internet users with another source of material .
the publisher , through their legal action , wanted to stop google from scanning in copyrighted books without permission .
and the german publishers rejected the so-called opt-out option which allows them to request that certain books not be included by notifying google , saying it was non-binding on google .

" some sing the anthem and some do n't but whether you sing it or not has nothing to do with whether you feel french or not , " the defender said . " maybe we should invite monsieur le pen to celebrate our next victory with us , " thuram said .

a german publisher , wbg , dropped their case asking for a preliminary injunction against the google books library project in the regional court of hamburg wednesday after the judge told them they were unlikely to get it .
the court ruled that there was no copyright violation stemming from the project .
digitizing 15 million books wbg started their action against the american company 's " book search engine " which began in 2004 .
it was the first time a german publisher had brought a case against google , although the action was backed by the german publishers association .
in the case , wbg wanted to stop google from scanning into its search engine any work published in germany and displaying snippets on its search pages .
the world 's largest internet search engine had announced that it wants to digitize about 15 million volumes from american and british libraries including those at harvard and stanford universities .

three protestors made a statement to that effect by getting naked during a game .
as if to emphasize their point , none of the crowd noticed . when one thinks of brazilians and the world cup , the usual image which springs to mind is the co-ordinated shaking of yellow and green-clad booties , gyrating in a celebration of the samba style and beautiful game for which the selecao is famous for .
such is the nation 's affinity with soccer ; one would not imagine any brazilians protesting against the sport .
and especially not while naked .
but this is what allegedly happened in a brazilian city during the last 16 clash between the selecao and ghana .
while the world cup is enthralling most of germany , and much of europe , the three men walked around a brazilian city in the buff while locals watched the match .
the three streakers-with-a-social-conscience staged the protest because they disagreed with how " the whole country stops to watch the football matches during the world cup , while enormous problems in brazil - like a lack of education among many people and a poor health system - keep getting worse . "
unfortunately for the exhibitionist crusaders , being in the tiny majority of brazilians who had time to think about the country 's problems while ronaldo and co. went about their business meant that no-one actually took a blind bit of notice .
three naked campaigners shaking their bits in protest could never compete with a rapturous crowd watching their heroes .
even the local cops let them get on with it .
" someone called to tell us to check the protest out , but since it was not a violent crime and we were watching the match at the time , we decided not to do anything about it , " a local police spokesperson reported .
" they only wanted to get attention , but they could n't even get this as everyone was watching the match , " the spokesperson added . dw staff -lrb- als / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de offsides from the fringe a selection of the best in wacky and offbeat stories from around germany .

" players are simulating and doing whatever they can to make it difficult for the referee , " beckenbauer told a press conference at the world cup .
" this is something we need to look at after the world cup . " beckenbauer , who led west germany to world cup glory in 1974 and guided his nation to the 1990 title as coach , also criticized russian referee valentin ivanov 's handling of portugal 's stormy last 16 game against the netherlands . ivanov handed out 16 yellow cards and four reds , a world cup record , as portugal won 1-0 but both teams ended the match in nuremberg with just nine players on the pitch . " clearly he was too quick to blow his whistle and too quick to give yellow cards , " beckenbauer said .
" that meant that for the next little incident another yellow had to be shown .
but the players make mistakes so let us allow the referees to make mistakes as well .

earlier this year , details of turkish honor killings and fights over head scarves were making headlines in germany and fuelling a heated debate about turkish culture and raising doubts about its ability to adapt to a western lifestyle .
the world cup , however , appears to be bridging the gap between the two cultures . " of course , it would be better if the turkish team would play here , " one young turkish man said .
" but since they aren ’ t here , i ’ m now supporting the german team because i live here . " everyone needs to have fun bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans - and turks - were elated after germany beat sweden in the final 16 round he added that it ’ s nothing unusual to cheer for germany because this country is his second home . " after all , germany is playing very well in the tournament , " he said . and attitudes are also changing among native germans .
surprised by their own soccer-fuelled , newly-found national identity , many germans are now also taken aback to find their compatriots of turkish descent happily waving german flags right next to them . " it ’ s great because everybody needs to have fun in germany , " said one german .
" it ’ s great being together with them , being multicultural like one world and one city . " sunshine helps following germany 's recent victory over sweden , the streets in kreuzberg were jammed with cars as the rowdy celebrations neared their peak .
some turks say that germans , who are often described as humorless and disciplined , now have the chance to learn how to celebrate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turks in kreuzberg and other berlin districts are following the german team 's performance " i ’ ve experienced such huge celebrations only in turkey , " said one fan adding that the whole country is usually up and dancing after a football victory .
" it seems we can contribute something to this country now . " he said he believed the mentality in countries where the weather is always good is definitely more relaxed than in germany and also partly attributed the current mood of elation to the splendid sunshine over the last few days . many turks hope that once the world cup is over , germans might keep some of their new found enthusiasm and friendliness towards their own country and the ethnic minorities living here . uwe hessler -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de public viewing takes on new dimension at world cup do n't have a ticket ?

" i get the feeling that the french public do not feel truly represented by them which , without doubt , explains why there is not the same depth of support as there was eight years ago " when france won the world cup at home . le pen also indulged in an old charge that the french players did not properly sing the national anthem when it was played just prior to kickoff , citing the case of zinedine zidane " who mumbles it a bit . " replying to the comments at the french training base in germany , domenech said that it was wrong to single out the french players for such criticism .
" he should take a look at the other teams .
we are probably one of the teams which have the most players that sing the national anthem . " eccentric , divisive coach finally fights for his players bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : domenech has come out to support his team 100 percent " he should stop saying things like this , the spanish do n't sing , the argentineans do n't sing .
the players are proud to wear the french colors . " lilian thuram , france 's most capped player , also took issue with le pen , saying : " vive la france , but not the france that monsieur le pen wants .
he wants to be president but he does n't know his history of france . " " maybe mr. le pen has n't been told that some french people are black and others have got blond or brown hair . " " the public support the france team , they do n't ask what color the players are , regardless of whether they 're black or brown or white the team represents france .
if you see him tell him we 're proud to be french . " le pen 's racist remarks falling on deaf ears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the france team is too black for racist le pen le pen has regularly been at loggerheads with the french national side which draws its players from a mixed background of european and african descent . " he says there are too many black players on the team , well i do n't know how to respond to that as i 'm not black , " thuram , born in guadeloupe , teased . the defender 's comments sparked a spontaneous round of applause from the 100 or so journalists and photographers present . thuram also addressed le pen 's comments that some players should be kicked out of the team for not singing the la marseillaise .
" some sing the anthem and some do n't but whether you sing it or not has nothing to do with whether you feel french or not , " the defender said . " maybe we should invite monsieur le pen to celebrate our next victory with us , " thuram said .

" players are simulating and doing whatever they can to make it difficult for the referee , " beckenbauer told a press conference at the world cup .
" this is something we need to look at after the world cup . " beckenbauer , who led west germany to world cup glory in 1974 and guided his nation to the 1990 title as coach , also criticized russian referee valentin ivanov 's handling of portugal 's stormy last 16 game against the netherlands . ivanov handed out 16 yellow cards and four reds , a world cup record , as portugal won 1-0 but both teams ended the match in nuremberg with just nine players on the pitch . " clearly he was too quick to blow his whistle and too quick to give yellow cards , " beckenbauer said .
" that meant that for the next little incident another yellow had to be shown .

" nothing unites quite like football , " said vassyl androsenko , a 52-year-old engineer in kiev . the country 's soccer stars have taken up the slack as ignoring which part of the country they come from or language they speak , they room together irrespective of political differences and converse in both dialects . ukraine national team doing its part for unity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's players come from rival areas - not that you 'd know " i think these guys have done more tonight to reunite the country than all politicians put together , " commented petro poroshenko , tipped to be the next parliament speaker after the penalty shootout win over the swiss in the second round . franz beckenbauer , german soccer legend and the man responsible for winning the right for germany to host the extravaganza , is convinced that the sport has more far reaching effects than simply firing up brief bouts of nationalism . the 60-year-old should know because he has traveled the world in his role as chief organizer of the finals but also was born into a divided country himself and won his two world cup titles with west germany , though the 1990 team did have a couple of players from the east in it . " football occupies an incredibly important position , especially in africa a continent that has all sorts of problems , " he told the german magazine , bundesliga earlier this year . africans have team spirit while factions at home wage war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivory coast fans ignored the civil unrest to follow their team " in ivory coast and togo the people are embroiled in terrible civil wars , while angola has emerged from decades of internal conflict and is still riddled with land mines . " " football can help to build bridges .
it brings opposing chiefs together to sit beside each other and watch matches and it is almost as if it helps them to understand each other . " the ' kaiser 's ' opinion may seem naive given the amount of discord and war on the african continent , but it certainly echoes the efforts of the ivory coast players to ensure their success on the pitch helps with bringing the rebel-held north of the country together with the government maintained south . their players , similar to the ukrainians , place great worth in team harmony despite coming from different sides of the political equation . " we think that every time we get together is a chance to show ivorians that they can get on , " said striker bonaventure kalou . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de africa stands united behind its teams for africa , the world cup is more than simply an entertaining sports event .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 29.06.2006 soccer 's gain is the entertainment and travel industry 's loss großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : watching soccer outdoors on the fan mile beats the movies inside the world cup has made homebodies of film buffs and theatergoers , who stay glued to the tube instead of going out .
result : a temporary dip in the german entertainment sector . normally the performances staged at berlin 's trendy , experimental grips theater play to a full house , but on june 9 , the day of the world cup 's opening match between germany and costa rica , only 30 spectators showed up in a theater with a seating capacity for 360 adults .
" we even delayed the play by a half-hour to 8:00 p.m. , but that did n't help " , joked volker ludwig , a playwright and founder of grips , who stayed home to watch soccer . " if our audience consisted of the conservative opera crowd , the world cup would have had no impact , but our plays and musicals appeal to younger folks , who happen to be football enthusiasts " , added ludwig , who has now cancelled die linke geschichte , an enormously popular cult piece , which conflicts with the quarter-finals on friday , when the two former world cup champions , germany and argentina , face off . dramatic drop in theatergoing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : impact of the world cup on theater attendance grips is not the only theater to experience a dramatic drop in attendance due to world cup fever .
the 450-seat maxim gorki theater in berlin , which features more mainstream classic productions , such as harold pinter 's one for the road , and bertolt brecht 's threepenny opera , reached only two-thirds capacity on an average evening this june . " we should have been 85 % full .
in june , before the big summer holidays , we normally sell well .
but this year we had freezing winter weather until may .

the concession would gut efforts to combat climate change , they warn . german members of greenpeace staged a protest outside chancellor angela merkel 's office , condemning a scheme to grant greater carbon-pollution rights to german industry as a multi-billion-euro gift " that will lead to a climate catastrophe . " the national allocation plan ii , which received cabinet approval wednesday and covers policy from 2008 to 2012 , allows industry and electricity companies to emit 482 million tons of carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- per year under the kyoto protocol 's cap-and-trade system . the scheme marks an increase over last year 's level of 474 million tons , which the government had argued was unusually low and unfairly penalized german industry . the allocation is worth more than 7 billion euros on the basis of a current market price of about 15 euros -lrb- $ 18.75 -rrb- per ton of co2 under the eu 's emissions trading scheme . pollution at a steep price the plans have been criticized by ecologists , germany 's regional states and even industry groups . " the federal government must not allow such amounts to be given away for nothing , " baden-württemberg state environment minister ernst pfister told the financial times deutschland . environmentalists want pollution to come at a steep price and are calling for the certificates to be auctioned off , which the european commission - the eu 's executive - allows for up to 10 percent of the rights under the ets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german officials say that german industry is unfairly penalized the ets , one of the core mechanisms of the kyoto protocol on greenhouse gases , aims at reducing pollution by big industry . participants are set a quota of emissions and must pay a stiff financial penalty for every ton of co2 that breaches this threshold . companies that are below their quota can sell surplus emissions rights to firms that are above their quota , thus providing a carrot to everyone to clean up their act . but green groups say the market , which has been operating only since jan .
1 , 2005 , could be wrecked if the quotas are not tight enough . green groups angry the price for co2 was badly hit in april when several countries reported that their actual emissions in the first phase of the ets operations had been way below their estimated emissions , thus leaving a lot of surplus co2 on the market . recovery of the market has been based on expectations that countries will impose more stringent quotas for the period after 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace continues to work for the kyoto protocol around the world this explains the dismay among environmental groups at the decision made by the cabinet in berlin this week . under the plan , energy companies and industry must cut their co2 emissions by 15 million tons per year , marking a cut of about 3 percent compared to the average in 2000-2002 , but green groups are angry that , compared with the 2005 level , it represents an increase . under the kyoto protocol , germany pledged to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 21 percent from 1990 levels by the period 2008-2012 . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de carbon emissions traders carefully optimistic in cologne it 's been a year since the eu launched its first carbon trading market and things are looking up in spite of a recent plunge in prices , experts say .

three protestors made a statement to that effect by getting naked during a game .
as if to emphasize their point , none of the crowd noticed . when one thinks of brazilians and the world cup , the usual image which springs to mind is the co-ordinated shaking of yellow and green-clad booties , gyrating in a celebration of the samba style and beautiful game for which the selecao is famous for .
such is the nation 's affinity with soccer ; one would not imagine any brazilians protesting against the sport .
and especially not while naked .
but this is what allegedly happened in a brazilian city during the last 16 clash between the selecao and ghana .
while the world cup is enthralling most of germany , and much of europe , the three men walked around a brazilian city in the buff while locals watched the match .
the three streakers-with-a-social-conscience staged the protest because they disagreed with how " the whole country stops to watch the football matches during the world cup , while enormous problems in brazil - like a lack of education among many people and a poor health system - keep getting worse . "
unfortunately for the exhibitionist crusaders , being in the tiny majority of brazilians who had time to think about the country 's problems while ronaldo and co. went about their business meant that no-one actually took a blind bit of notice .
three naked campaigners shaking their bits in protest could never compete with a rapturous crowd watching their heroes .
even the local cops let them get on with it .
" someone called to tell us to check the protest out , but since it was not a violent crime and we were watching the match at the time , we decided not to do anything about it , " a local police spokesperson reported .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de features -pipe- 29.06.2006 opinion : great world cup except for the soccer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ouch !
if you ca n't score , go for a foul seems to be the motto of the world cup great stadiums , euphoric fans , a relaxed host country and benevolent weather gods have turned the world cup into a feast .
but the action on the pitch is n't exactly worth cheering about . from a german perspective , it 's easy to forget that the world cup 1990 was considered an absolute low point in world cup history . never before had so few goals -lrb- 2.21 per game -rrb- been scored and so many fouls -lrb- 16 players were sent off during the tournament -rrb- been committed during the world cup as they were in italy . thank god fifa had ordered players in advance to wear shin guards . the secret star of the tournament was guido buchwald , of all people - a defensive player with limited talent from swabia .
the finals fittingly ended in 1-0 .
the winning goal was scored after a controversial penalty kick and two players were shown red cards . heading towards a new negative record with just eight games left to go in the 2006 world cup , the verdict - from a sports point of view - will be pretty sobering . the passionately celebrated soccer fest could end up with a new negative record .
just about 2.36 goals per game were scored in the 56 games that have been played so far and 19 players have already been sent off . it was all meant to be different .
the entire world was hoping to see some strong , attacking soccer .
coaching guru guus hiddink , currently coaching australia , was counting on a virtual goal feast . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cup began with a goal feast with germany 4-2 win over costa rica admittedly , the tournament did get off to a fantastic start .
in a first for the world cup , six goals were scored in the opening game alone .
the same was repeated when argentina systematically dismantled serbia & montenegro 's defense - ironically the same defense that is considered one of the strongest and which allowed just a single goal in the qualification rounds . the orange disappointment but otherwise , it 's been slim pickings at this world cup .
trinidad and tobago did n't manage a single goal in three games , angola and togo just one each .
maybe that 's all that could be expected from these world cup debutants . but even highly-regarded teams failed to deliver when it came to finding the net : the czechs departed with just three goals and the dutch , too , were equally shy about scoring .
they turned out to be the biggest disappointments of the cup . after all , its the dutch who have been the standard-bearers of the beautiful , attacking style of play since the 1974 world cup .
considering that dutch coach marco van basten - considered the best striker of his time - had promised great offensive play from his side , what followed instead was a swan song for all dutch virtues . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dutch were n't at their best against the ivory coast the netherlands may have had their three traditional strikers on the pitch , but too often it looked like the worst of lumbering german soccer in the pre-klinsmann era .
against the ivory coast and argentina , the oranje even committed the ultimate sacrilege possible in the netherlands by blocking and sticking to their half of the field . the dutch 's disgraceful exit in their 1-0 loss to portugal in a game marked by some nasty fouls completed the sad picture .
the four players who were sent off in that notorious game set a new world cup record under the motto " if you do n't find the net , you can at least foul . "
that was the case in 1990 too . special taste in soccer you have to have a special taste in soccer in order to really enjoy what 's on offer in the quarter-finals . england ?
terrible .
it 's almost fitting that captain david beckham threw up on the pitch .
brazil ?
smug to the point of apathy .
ukraine ?
in the world cup because of a lucky draw . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : totti 's last-gasp penalty kick against australia saved the italians ' day portugal ?
made an impact only because of their assaults .
italy ?
wily enough to wiggle their way through even after being shown red , albeit only with a pounding penalty kick in extra time .
france ?
has some of the best strikers in the world with henry and trezeguet - but only allows one to play . there 's no doubt that the 2006 world cup is all about security , efficiency and blocking techniques .
maybe the defensive fest is a poisoned legacy of the 2004 european championships .
several teams played some fantastic offensive soccer there , but greece did n't - and went on to win the tournament thanks to a mysterious quirk of the soccer gods . germany , of all teams and germany , of all teams , seems to have drawn lessons from that .
klinsmann 's attacking tactics really seem to be paying off . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german strikers klose and podolski have been wowing fans in germany and abroad , people are rubbing their eyes in disbelief .
the jubilant chants of the fans after their amazing win over sweden have a ring of truth to them : germany is really the most attractive team of the tournament when it comes to play .
it 's something that has n't been seen in a long time . there 's just one team that 's scored as many goals as germany - argentina .
it 's a pity that one of the two strongest teams in attacking soccer will have to leave after friday 's match , and that both wo n't make it to the finals - an event that marked the 1990 soccer year . the finals ended in 1-0 through an unfair penalty kick - for germany . oliver samson -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de last eight line-up exposes 2002 world cup as a false dawn the 2002 world cup was hailed as a move away from the traditional power bases of international soccer and a new dawn for asian and african teams .
the latter stages of the 2006 tournament , however , suggests differently .
-lrb- june 28 , 2006 -rrb- world cup card record tells story of portugal 's brutal victory there was a soccer match somewhere amongst the cards in nuremberg on sunday .
along the way , portugal beat holland 1-0 .
but the story of four players off and eight others booked will make all the headlines .
-lrb- june 26 , 2006 -rrb- world cup refereeing mixes the good , the bad and the ugly the bad performances of some referees at the world cup have helped whittle down the shortlist for who will take charge of the final .

" that meant that for the next little incident another yellow had to be shown .
but the players make mistakes so let us allow the referees to make mistakes as well .

a german publisher , wbg , dropped their case asking for a preliminary injunction against the google books library project in the regional court of hamburg wednesday after the judge told them they were unlikely to get it .
the court ruled that there was no copyright violation stemming from the project .
digitizing 15 million books wbg started their action against the american company 's " book search engine " which began in 2004 .
it was the first time a german publisher had brought a case against google , although the action was backed by the german publishers association .
in the case , wbg wanted to stop google from scanning into its search engine any work published in germany and displaying snippets on its search pages .
the world 's largest internet search engine had announced that it wants to digitize about 15 million volumes from american and british libraries including those at harvard and stanford universities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google says its book snippets do not violate copyright laws it would work this way : google lets users type in a search term then scans its digitized library for the word or expression and produces a list of books where the term is mentioned .
users can then click on the results and a few pages of the text appear allowing users to read up online .
the idea is to supplement internet users with another source of material .
the publisher , through their legal action , wanted to stop google from scanning in copyrighted books without permission .
and the german publishers rejected the so-called opt-out option which allows them to request that certain books not be included by notifying google , saying it was non-binding on google .
opposition in the us google is also coming up against opposition to its project in the us where writers and publishers have filed lawsuits to force google to get their permission before scanning in books .

" nothing unites quite like football , " said vassyl androsenko , a 52-year-old engineer in kiev . the country 's soccer stars have taken up the slack as ignoring which part of the country they come from or language they speak , they room together irrespective of political differences and converse in both dialects . ukraine national team doing its part for unity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's players come from rival areas - not that you 'd know " i think these guys have done more tonight to reunite the country than all politicians put together , " commented petro poroshenko , tipped to be the next parliament speaker after the penalty shootout win over the swiss in the second round . franz beckenbauer , german soccer legend and the man responsible for winning the right for germany to host the extravaganza , is convinced that the sport has more far reaching effects than simply firing up brief bouts of nationalism . the 60-year-old should know because he has traveled the world in his role as chief organizer of the finals but also was born into a divided country himself and won his two world cup titles with west germany , though the 1990 team did have a couple of players from the east in it . " football occupies an incredibly important position , especially in africa a continent that has all sorts of problems , " he told the german magazine , bundesliga earlier this year . africans have team spirit while factions at home wage war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivory coast fans ignored the civil unrest to follow their team " in ivory coast and togo the people are embroiled in terrible civil wars , while angola has emerged from decades of internal conflict and is still riddled with land mines . " " football can help to build bridges .
it brings opposing chiefs together to sit beside each other and watch matches and it is almost as if it helps them to understand each other . " the ' kaiser 's ' opinion may seem naive given the amount of discord and war on the african continent , but it certainly echoes the efforts of the ivory coast players to ensure their success on the pitch helps with bringing the rebel-held north of the country together with the government maintained south . their players , similar to the ukrainians , place great worth in team harmony despite coming from different sides of the political equation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : media in the news breaking codes but not the box office germans divided over prize for pro-serb author handke cartoon row escalates ; germany defends press freedom british and american publishers reopen european turf wars germany -pipe- 29.06.2006 partial success for google in a german courtroom großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : digitizing books helps preserve them and make them more accessible , google says a german publisher who brought a case against internet company google over digitized books suddenly and surprisingly dropped their case this week . in the fight over digitizing books , the internet search engine operator google can chalk up another victory - this time in germany .
a german publisher , wbg , dropped their case asking for a preliminary injunction against the google books library project in the regional court of hamburg wednesday after the judge told them they were unlikely to get it .
the court ruled that there was no copyright violation stemming from the project .
digitizing 15 million books wbg started their action against the american company 's " book search engine " which began in 2004 .
it was the first time a german publisher had brought a case against google , although the action was backed by the german publishers association .
in the case , wbg wanted to stop google from scanning into its search engine any work published in germany and displaying snippets on its search pages .
the world 's largest internet search engine had announced that it wants to digitize about 15 million volumes from american and british libraries including those at harvard and stanford universities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google says its book snippets do not violate copyright laws it would work this way : google lets users type in a search term then scans its digitized library for the word or expression and produces a list of books where the term is mentioned .
users can then click on the results and a few pages of the text appear allowing users to read up online .
the idea is to supplement internet users with another source of material .
the publisher , through their legal action , wanted to stop google from scanning in copyrighted books without permission .
and the german publishers rejected the so-called opt-out option which allows them to request that certain books not be included by notifying google , saying it was non-binding on google .
opposition in the us google is also coming up against opposition to its project in the us where writers and publishers have filed lawsuits to force google to get their permission before scanning in books .
so far , the association of american publishers and the authors guild have filed suit .
the german court decision has no influence on american lawsuits .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : electronic books are coming in the near future at issue is the right of authors and their publishers to their own work versus the " fair use " of their work by the public .
google argues that their search engine will only offer users a " card catalog " function , with a few pages of text .
no one will be able to read the entire book online .
after the court decision , google reaffirmed its commitment to the project .
" google is passionate about the digitization of books , which we believe benefits everyone by making the world 's knowledge more accessible , " wrote david drummond , senior vice president and general counsel in a company blog . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german experts criticize google 's power google is the first place some 70 percent of germans go when looking for information on the internet - and that 's got some media experts worried the company could abuse its position by manipulating search results .

the incentives are conditional on iran forgoing large-scale uranium enrichment and answering questions about its program . iran has a two-week deadline french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said that iran must reply to the international plan before the july 15-17 g8 summit . " it seems clear to me that iran must say yes .
then there will be negotiations , " douste-blazy said . u.s. secretary of state condoleezza rice earlier said the ministers would talk about iran , about how to deal with the palestinians ' hamas government and about democracy in russia and belarus . " we should also talk about democracy , " rice told the broadcaster cnn , expressing a desire for russia to " enhance its commitment to democratic development " as well as referring to belarus and other " places that have yet to see a democratic future . " russia has played a significant role in the standoff over iran 's nuclear program , being a permanent member of the united nations security council and a close ally of tehran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin : " russia will not join any ultimatum " on iran president vladimir putin on tuesday again underlined his differences with the west on the iran issue , saying russia did not intend " to join any sort of ultimatum , which only pushes the situation into a dead end . " amid reports that moscow wants to limit discussion of its human rights record or commitment to democracy at next month 's summit , a senior kremlin official defended russia 's role in neighboring parts of ex-communist europe . " moscow has done much more for democracy in central europe than washington or london , " said the deputy head of putin 's office , vladislav surkov , at a briefing wednesday .
" it 's moscow which democratized this immense space . " but if russia hopes to avoid discussion of accusations that it is backsliding on democracy and media freedom , the british foreign secretary margaret beckett reiterated that britain had concerns about human rights and the rule of law in russia . beckett , in an interview with russia 's kommersant broadsheet , also said she hoped next month 's summit would give a signal about the importance of competitive and open energy markets .

earlier this year , details of turkish honor killings and fights over head scarves were making headlines in germany and fuelling a heated debate about turkish culture and raising doubts about its ability to adapt to a western lifestyle .
the world cup , however , appears to be bridging the gap between the two cultures . " of course , it would be better if the turkish team would play here , " one young turkish man said .

surprised by their own soccer-fuelled , newly-found national identity , many germans are now also taken aback to find their compatriots of turkish descent happily waving german flags right next to them . " it ’ s great because everybody needs to have fun in germany , " said one german .
" it ’ s great being together with them , being multicultural like one world and one city . " sunshine helps following germany 's recent victory over sweden , the streets in kreuzberg were jammed with cars as the rowdy celebrations neared their peak .
some turks say that germans , who are often described as humorless and disciplined , now have the chance to learn how to celebrate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turks in kreuzberg and other berlin districts are following the german team 's performance " i ’ ve experienced such huge celebrations only in turkey , " said one fan adding that the whole country is usually up and dancing after a football victory .
" it seems we can contribute something to this country now . " he said he believed the mentality in countries where the weather is always good is definitely more relaxed than in germany and also partly attributed the current mood of elation to the splendid sunshine over the last few days . many turks hope that once the world cup is over , germans might keep some of their new found enthusiasm and friendliness towards their own country and the ethnic minorities living here . uwe hessler -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de public viewing takes on new dimension at world cup do n't have a ticket ?

daimlerchrysler 's midget smart car will take on the us market in 2008 , with executives hoping the nimble microcar can out-manoeuvre rivals in the land of the mammoth sports utility vehicle . the german-us automaker said wednesday it will launch the car through a partner - a company headed by racing legend roger penske - in early 2008 .
high fuel prices and positive responses from consumers drove the decision . at 2.5 meters long -lrb- 8.2 feet -rrb- and weighing in at a mere 990 kilos -lrb- 2,180 pounds -rrb- , the two-seat smart car is about half the size of a hummer , ford expedition or other large suv . but daimlerchrysler chairman dieter zetsche said the smart - which will be offered in three models in the world 's largest automotive market - can hold its own against us muscle cars . " times have changed , and urban us streets are becoming increasingly congested , " zetsche told reporters during the announcement . " gas prices are also increasing , and we may never see cheap gas again , " he added . some smart cars are already sold in the us through unofficial resellers , but wednesday 's announcement designates automotive retailer penske 's unitedauto group as the official distributor for the smart in the united states and puerto rico . smart cars have been on european roads since 1998 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some have likened the smart 's appearance to a baby shoe daimlerchrysler officials hope to promote the urban microcar as offering a fun driving experience , and have been able to place the vehicle in movies like " the da vinci code , " where it was used in a chase scene in paris , and the remake of " the pink panther " starring steve martin as inspector clouseau . " the time has never been better for this - and i am convinced that the smart fortwo as an innovative , ecological and agile city car will soon become just as familiar a sight on the streets of new york , miami or seattle as it is today in rome , berlin or paris , " zetsche said . the smart brand , which was launched in 1998 , has been a laggard for the automotive conglomerate , and the decision over whether to launch the brand in the largest auto market was heavily debated . the additional sales volume could help smart meet its target of achieving profitability . zetsche said there was never any doubt over whether smart would enter the us market , pointing out that the next-generation fortwo was always designed to meet the safety and crash regulations established in the united states . the issue that needed to be finalized before the announcement was the distribution plan , which will be handled exclusively by unitedauto , part of a company headed by penske with dealers in 20 states . the distributor said it would select between 30 and 50 dealers in major urban us markets , along with a few select leisure markets . success in canada while expecting to sell the fortwo at less than 15,000 dollars per unit , penske would not comment on volume targets but noted smart 's recent success in canada , where the brand was expected to achieve 1,500 units in its first year but ended up achieving more than 4,000 sales . the smart car would be among the least fuel-hungry cars on the road .

" i get the feeling that the french public do not feel truly represented by them which , without doubt , explains why there is not the same depth of support as there was eight years ago " when france won the world cup at home . le pen also indulged in an old charge that the french players did not properly sing the national anthem when it was played just prior to kickoff , citing the case of zinedine zidane " who mumbles it a bit . " replying to the comments at the french training base in germany , domenech said that it was wrong to single out the french players for such criticism .
" he should take a look at the other teams .
we are probably one of the teams which have the most players that sing the national anthem . " eccentric , divisive coach finally fights for his players bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : domenech has come out to support his team 100 percent " he should stop saying things like this , the spanish do n't sing , the argentineans do n't sing .
the players are proud to wear the french colors . " lilian thuram , france 's most capped player , also took issue with le pen , saying : " vive la france , but not the france that monsieur le pen wants .
he wants to be president but he does n't know his history of france . " " maybe mr. le pen has n't been told that some french people are black and others have got blond or brown hair . " " the public support the france team , they do n't ask what color the players are , regardless of whether they 're black or brown or white the team represents france .
if you see him tell him we 're proud to be french . " le pen 's racist remarks falling on deaf ears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the france team is too black for racist le pen le pen has regularly been at loggerheads with the french national side which draws its players from a mixed background of european and african descent . " he says there are too many black players on the team , well i do n't know how to respond to that as i 'm not black , " thuram , born in guadeloupe , teased . the defender 's comments sparked a spontaneous round of applause from the 100 or so journalists and photographers present . thuram also addressed le pen 's comments that some players should be kicked out of the team for not singing the la marseillaise .
" some sing the anthem and some do n't but whether you sing it or not has nothing to do with whether you feel french or not , " the defender said . " maybe we should invite monsieur le pen to celebrate our next victory with us , " thuram said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : media in the news breaking codes but not the box office germans divided over prize for pro-serb author handke cartoon row escalates ; germany defends press freedom british and american publishers reopen european turf wars germany -pipe- 29.06.2006 partial success for google in a german courtroom großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : digitizing books helps preserve them and make them more accessible , google says a german publisher who brought a case against internet company google over digitized books suddenly and surprisingly dropped their case this week . in the fight over digitizing books , the internet search engine operator google can chalk up another victory - this time in germany .
a german publisher , wbg , dropped their case asking for a preliminary injunction against the google books library project in the regional court of hamburg wednesday after the judge told them they were unlikely to get it .
the court ruled that there was no copyright violation stemming from the project .
digitizing 15 million books wbg started their action against the american company 's " book search engine " which began in 2004 .
it was the first time a german publisher had brought a case against google , although the action was backed by the german publishers association .
in the case , wbg wanted to stop google from scanning into its search engine any work published in germany and displaying snippets on its search pages .
the world 's largest internet search engine had announced that it wants to digitize about 15 million volumes from american and british libraries including those at harvard and stanford universities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google says its book snippets do not violate copyright laws it would work this way : google lets users type in a search term then scans its digitized library for the word or expression and produces a list of books where the term is mentioned .
users can then click on the results and a few pages of the text appear allowing users to read up online .
the idea is to supplement internet users with another source of material .
the publisher , through their legal action , wanted to stop google from scanning in copyrighted books without permission .
and the german publishers rejected the so-called opt-out option which allows them to request that certain books not be included by notifying google , saying it was non-binding on google .
opposition in the us google is also coming up against opposition to its project in the us where writers and publishers have filed lawsuits to force google to get their permission before scanning in books .
so far , the association of american publishers and the authors guild have filed suit .
the german court decision has no influence on american lawsuits .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : electronic books are coming in the near future at issue is the right of authors and their publishers to their own work versus the " fair use " of their work by the public .
google argues that their search engine will only offer users a " card catalog " function , with a few pages of text .
no one will be able to read the entire book online .
after the court decision , google reaffirmed its commitment to the project .
" google is passionate about the digitization of books , which we believe benefits everyone by making the world 's knowledge more accessible , " wrote david drummond , senior vice president and general counsel in a company blog . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german experts criticize google 's power google is the first place some 70 percent of germans go when looking for information on the internet - and that 's got some media experts worried the company could abuse its position by manipulating search results .

the idea is to supplement internet users with another source of material .
the publisher , through their legal action , wanted to stop google from scanning in copyrighted books without permission .
and the german publishers rejected the so-called opt-out option which allows them to request that certain books not be included by notifying google , saying it was non-binding on google .
opposition in the us google is also coming up against opposition to its project in the us where writers and publishers have filed lawsuits to force google to get their permission before scanning in books .
so far , the association of american publishers and the authors guild have filed suit .

google argues that their search engine will only offer users a " card catalog " function , with a few pages of text .
no one will be able to read the entire book online .
after the court decision , google reaffirmed its commitment to the project .

friday 's game could be a case of the best not being saved for last . germany 's soccer reputation lay in shreds for a decade but has been restored virtually overnight under the sunny disposition of jürgen klinsmann , a man whose ubiquitous smile grew to previously-unseen proportions saturday after beating sweden in the round of 16 . now he and the german team are looking forward to their quarter-final match against south american juggernaut argentina .
the sides have met under their current coaches twice already and reached 2-2 splits each time .

he was on the field in rome for the 1990 final and watched tears well in argentine eyes as they were awarded silver medals before he lifted the cup in a match that saw two south american players sent off . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : argentina 's maradona remembers the win , and the tears that followed four years later players confident of reaching semi-finals the countries also met in group action in 1956 and 1966 and in 2006 both teams are positive going into saturday 's match in the german capital . " this is a match pitting two of the greats together , " pekerman said after beating mexico in the round of 16 .
" we have enormous respect for each other . " germany hope they will be able to put an end to their six-year curse of defeat against big-name teams . " we will do everything to beat them and i think we can do it , " german midfielder torsten frings said .
" i think friday is finally the time to defeat a top nation . " meanwhile , argentina want to live up to their reputation as one of the favorites to lift the trophy on july 9 . " germany are going to have to show more than they have done so far to beat us , " argentina striker carlos tevez said , adding that he is n't worried about germany 's size advantage .
" i 'm not afraid of them if they come -lrb- at me -rrb- .

if you ca n't score , go for a foul seems to be the motto of the world cup great stadiums , euphoric fans , a relaxed host country and benevolent weather gods have turned the world cup into a feast .
but the action on the pitch is n't exactly worth cheering about . from a german perspective , it 's easy to forget that the world cup 1990 was considered an absolute low point in world cup history . never before had so few goals -lrb- 2.21 per game -rrb- been scored and so many fouls -lrb- 16 players were sent off during the tournament -rrb- been committed during the world cup as they were in italy . thank god fifa had ordered players in advance to wear shin guards . the secret star of the tournament was guido buchwald , of all people - a defensive player with limited talent from swabia .
the finals fittingly ended in 1-0 .
the winning goal was scored after a controversial penalty kick and two players were shown red cards . heading towards a new negative record with just eight games left to go in the 2006 world cup , the verdict - from a sports point of view - will be pretty sobering . the passionately celebrated soccer fest could end up with a new negative record .
just about 2.36 goals per game were scored in the 56 games that have been played so far and 19 players have already been sent off . it was all meant to be different .
the entire world was hoping to see some strong , attacking soccer .

they turned out to be the biggest disappointments of the cup . after all , its the dutch who have been the standard-bearers of the beautiful , attacking style of play since the 1974 world cup .
considering that dutch coach marco van basten - considered the best striker of his time - had promised great offensive play from his side , what followed instead was a swan song for all dutch virtues . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dutch were n't at their best against the ivory coast the netherlands may have had their three traditional strikers on the pitch , but too often it looked like the worst of lumbering german soccer in the pre-klinsmann era .

three protestors made a statement to that effect by getting naked during a game .
as if to emphasize their point , none of the crowd noticed . when one thinks of brazilians and the world cup , the usual image which springs to mind is the co-ordinated shaking of yellow and green-clad booties , gyrating in a celebration of the samba style and beautiful game for which the selecao is famous for .
such is the nation 's affinity with soccer ; one would not imagine any brazilians protesting against the sport .
and especially not while naked .
but this is what allegedly happened in a brazilian city during the last 16 clash between the selecao and ghana .
while the world cup is enthralling most of germany , and much of europe , the three men walked around a brazilian city in the buff while locals watched the match .
the three streakers-with-a-social-conscience staged the protest because they disagreed with how " the whole country stops to watch the football matches during the world cup , while enormous problems in brazil - like a lack of education among many people and a poor health system - keep getting worse . "
unfortunately for the exhibitionist crusaders , being in the tiny majority of brazilians who had time to think about the country 's problems while ronaldo and co. went about their business meant that no-one actually took a blind bit of notice .
three naked campaigners shaking their bits in protest could never compete with a rapturous crowd watching their heroes .
even the local cops let them get on with it .
" someone called to tell us to check the protest out , but since it was not a violent crime and we were watching the match at the time , we decided not to do anything about it , " a local police spokesperson reported .
" they only wanted to get attention , but they could n't even get this as everyone was watching the match , " the spokesperson added . dw staff -lrb- als / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de offsides from the fringe a selection of the best in wacky and offbeat stories from around germany .

the incentives are conditional on iran forgoing large-scale uranium enrichment and answering questions about its program . iran has a two-week deadline french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said that iran must reply to the international plan before the july 15-17 g8 summit . " it seems clear to me that iran must say yes .
then there will be negotiations , " douste-blazy said . u.s. secretary of state condoleezza rice earlier said the ministers would talk about iran , about how to deal with the palestinians ' hamas government and about democracy in russia and belarus . " we should also talk about democracy , " rice told the broadcaster cnn , expressing a desire for russia to " enhance its commitment to democratic development " as well as referring to belarus and other " places that have yet to see a democratic future . " russia has played a significant role in the standoff over iran 's nuclear program , being a permanent member of the united nations security council and a close ally of tehran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin : " russia will not join any ultimatum " on iran president vladimir putin on tuesday again underlined his differences with the west on the iran issue , saying russia did not intend " to join any sort of ultimatum , which only pushes the situation into a dead end . " amid reports that moscow wants to limit discussion of its human rights record or commitment to democracy at next month 's summit , a senior kremlin official defended russia 's role in neighboring parts of ex-communist europe . " moscow has done much more for democracy in central europe than washington or london , " said the deputy head of putin 's office , vladislav surkov , at a briefing wednesday .
" it 's moscow which democratized this immense space . " but if russia hopes to avoid discussion of accusations that it is backsliding on democracy and media freedom , the british foreign secretary margaret beckett reiterated that britain had concerns about human rights and the rule of law in russia . beckett , in an interview with russia 's kommersant broadsheet , also said she hoped next month 's summit would give a signal about the importance of competitive and open energy markets . " russia 's actions are inconsistent with g8 democratic norms " four prominent u.s. lawmakers on tuesday urged president george w. bush to rebuke putin over the " deterioration of democracy " in his country . it is important that the other g8 heads of state " make clear that russia 's actions are inconsistent with g8 democratic norms , " read a letter signed by democratic representative tom lantos and republican david dreier , together with senators john mccain , a republican , and democrat joe lieberman . earlier , an analyst close to the kremlin , the head of the moscow-based institute for political research , sergei markov , said he expected thursday 's meeting to be " rather tense .

daimlerchrysler 's midget smart car will take on the us market in 2008 , with executives hoping the nimble microcar can out-manoeuvre rivals in the land of the mammoth sports utility vehicle . the german-us automaker said wednesday it will launch the car through a partner - a company headed by racing legend roger penske - in early 2008 .
high fuel prices and positive responses from consumers drove the decision . at 2.5 meters long -lrb- 8.2 feet -rrb- and weighing in at a mere 990 kilos -lrb- 2,180 pounds -rrb- , the two-seat smart car is about half the size of a hummer , ford expedition or other large suv . but daimlerchrysler chairman dieter zetsche said the smart - which will be offered in three models in the world 's largest automotive market - can hold its own against us muscle cars .

the concession would gut efforts to combat climate change , they warn . german members of greenpeace staged a protest outside chancellor angela merkel 's office , condemning a scheme to grant greater carbon-pollution rights to german industry as a multi-billion-euro gift " that will lead to a climate catastrophe . " the national allocation plan ii , which received cabinet approval wednesday and covers policy from 2008 to 2012 , allows industry and electricity companies to emit 482 million tons of carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- per year under the kyoto protocol 's cap-and-trade system . the scheme marks an increase over last year 's level of 474 million tons , which the government had argued was unusually low and unfairly penalized german industry . the allocation is worth more than 7 billion euros on the basis of a current market price of about 15 euros -lrb- $ 18.75 -rrb- per ton of co2 under the eu 's emissions trading scheme . pollution at a steep price the plans have been criticized by ecologists , germany 's regional states and even industry groups . " the federal government must not allow such amounts to be given away for nothing , " baden-württemberg state environment minister ernst pfister told the financial times deutschland . environmentalists want pollution to come at a steep price and are calling for the certificates to be auctioned off , which the european commission - the eu 's executive - allows for up to 10 percent of the rights under the ets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german officials say that german industry is unfairly penalized the ets , one of the core mechanisms of the kyoto protocol on greenhouse gases , aims at reducing pollution by big industry . participants are set a quota of emissions and must pay a stiff financial penalty for every ton of co2 that breaches this threshold . companies that are below their quota can sell surplus emissions rights to firms that are above their quota , thus providing a carrot to everyone to clean up their act . but green groups say the market , which has been operating only since jan .
1 , 2005 , could be wrecked if the quotas are not tight enough . green groups angry the price for co2 was badly hit in april when several countries reported that their actual emissions in the first phase of the ets operations had been way below their estimated emissions , thus leaving a lot of surplus co2 on the market . recovery of the market has been based on expectations that countries will impose more stringent quotas for the period after 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace continues to work for the kyoto protocol around the world this explains the dismay among environmental groups at the decision made by the cabinet in berlin this week . under the plan , energy companies and industry must cut their co2 emissions by 15 million tons per year , marking a cut of about 3 percent compared to the average in 2000-2002 , but green groups are angry that , compared with the 2005 level , it represents an increase . under the kyoto protocol , germany pledged to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 21 percent from 1990 levels by the period 2008-2012 . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de carbon emissions traders carefully optimistic in cologne it 's been a year since the eu launched its first carbon trading market and things are looking up in spite of a recent plunge in prices , experts say .

" nothing unites quite like football , " said vassyl androsenko , a 52-year-old engineer in kiev . the country 's soccer stars have taken up the slack as ignoring which part of the country they come from or language they speak , they room together irrespective of political differences and converse in both dialects . ukraine national team doing its part for unity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's players come from rival areas - not that you 'd know " i think these guys have done more tonight to reunite the country than all politicians put together , " commented petro poroshenko , tipped to be the next parliament speaker after the penalty shootout win over the swiss in the second round . franz beckenbauer , german soccer legend and the man responsible for winning the right for germany to host the extravaganza , is convinced that the sport has more far reaching effects than simply firing up brief bouts of nationalism . the 60-year-old should know because he has traveled the world in his role as chief organizer of the finals but also was born into a divided country himself and won his two world cup titles with west germany , though the 1990 team did have a couple of players from the east in it . " football occupies an incredibly important position , especially in africa a continent that has all sorts of problems , " he told the german magazine , bundesliga earlier this year . africans have team spirit while factions at home wage war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivory coast fans ignored the civil unrest to follow their team " in ivory coast and togo the people are embroiled in terrible civil wars , while angola has emerged from decades of internal conflict and is still riddled with land mines . " " football can help to build bridges .
it brings opposing chiefs together to sit beside each other and watch matches and it is almost as if it helps them to understand each other . " the ' kaiser 's ' opinion may seem naive given the amount of discord and war on the african continent , but it certainly echoes the efforts of the ivory coast players to ensure their success on the pitch helps with bringing the rebel-held north of the country together with the government maintained south . their players , similar to the ukrainians , place great worth in team harmony despite coming from different sides of the political equation .

work-life balance gets boost in germany the dumbing down of germany gerd 's family policy gets down to business encouraging germans to have more kids germany -pipe- 29.06.2006 study : men in germany are scared to start families großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany faces problems with low birth rates low birth rates and the ageing population in germany have dominated media in discussions about how to pay for health care and social security .
now , a study says it is men who are primarily responsible for fewer births . in its study , the robert bosch foundation found that " men are scared to start families , " said ingrid hamm , managing director of the foundation .
the study says one in four men in germany do not want children , whereas one in seven women prefer to remain childless .
in eastern germany , that rate is lower , with one in 10 women exopressing the wish to remain childless . the study was based on responses from 10,017 people .
researchers say the survey was representative , even of the smallest groups in germany . men and women in germany also differ on the number of children they would like to have .
men want only an average of 1.59 kids ; the average number of children women would like is 1.75 .
both of these numbers , however , are still higher than germany 's actual average birth rate of 1.37 children per woman . under pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both men and women in germany want more babies than the number being born hamm said another reason for fewer children in germany is that people feel too much pressure .
they have long career training periods and then " have to do everything at once between the ages of 30 and 40 : get married , have kids , build a house , pursue their careers and save money for retirement , " she said . " all that pressure makes people put off having children until later or not at all . " women , too , are faced with a loss of economic control over their lives if they choose a baby break .
for a well-to-do country like germany , the economic loss is even greater , hamm said . she added that , in addition , germans lack faith in the future . " in germany , we have lost a sense that everything will turn out all right .
germans are prone to worrying about the future a lot more than other people , " she said . " german " is not just german , however .
the study found that the wish to forgo having children is much stronger in the former west german states .
in the new german states -lrb- formerly east germany -rrb- , fewer women want to remain childless . " children in the former gdr were everywhere , " hamm said . " mothers and fathers both worked , and east german children grew up with the image that being both parent and employee is possible . " " better policies could boost birth rates " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " large families are frowned upon , " hamm said the survey respondents said they would appreciate politicians creating better conditions to help people start families - such as greater financial support , improved childcare and more part-time jobs created for parents . eighty-nine percent of the respondents said they would prefer flexible working hours for employed parents . increased financial support from the government would help large families and less qualified people . on the other hand , better childcare possibilities would encourage those currently without children and aid families with only one child , as well as highly-qualified working parents and women in eastern germany , researchers reported . the study said women desiring a first child wanted the most support , but also that one-fifth of the women who did not want children could still be encouraged through better family policies . the study also found that families with one child or highly-educated people would most likely choose to have a first or an additional child if family-oriented policies were in place that fit their individual needs . hamm said the study showed that having children is just one of many values among germans ; it is not a top priority .
parents with many children are viewed critically , while " it is completely socially acceptable to not have kids here . " " one 's status does not increase by having kids , " she said . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the challenge of demographic change in old , shriveling europe after decades of ignorance , public awareness of demographic change in europe is growing .

work-life balance gets boost in germany the dumbing down of germany gerd 's family policy gets down to business encouraging germans to have more kids germany -pipe- 29.06.2006 study : men in germany are scared to start families großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany faces problems with low birth rates low birth rates and the ageing population in germany have dominated media in discussions about how to pay for health care and social security .
now , a study says it is men who are primarily responsible for fewer births . in its study , the robert bosch foundation found that " men are scared to start families , " said ingrid hamm , managing director of the foundation .
the study says one in four men in germany do not want children , whereas one in seven women prefer to remain childless .
in eastern germany , that rate is lower , with one in 10 women exopressing the wish to remain childless . the study was based on responses from 10,017 people .
researchers say the survey was representative , even of the smallest groups in germany . men and women in germany also differ on the number of children they would like to have .
men want only an average of 1.59 kids ; the average number of children women would like is 1.75 .
both of these numbers , however , are still higher than germany 's actual average birth rate of 1.37 children per woman . under pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both men and women in germany want more babies than the number being born hamm said another reason for fewer children in germany is that people feel too much pressure .
they have long career training periods and then " have to do everything at once between the ages of 30 and 40 : get married , have kids , build a house , pursue their careers and save money for retirement , " she said . " all that pressure makes people put off having children until later or not at all . " women , too , are faced with a loss of economic control over their lives if they choose a baby break .
for a well-to-do country like germany , the economic loss is even greater , hamm said . she added that , in addition , germans lack faith in the future . " in germany , we have lost a sense that everything will turn out all right .
germans are prone to worrying about the future a lot more than other people , " she said . " german " is not just german , however .
the study found that the wish to forgo having children is much stronger in the former west german states .
in the new german states -lrb- formerly east germany -rrb- , fewer women want to remain childless . " children in the former gdr were everywhere , " hamm said . " mothers and fathers both worked , and east german children grew up with the image that being both parent and employee is possible . " " better policies could boost birth rates " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " large families are frowned upon , " hamm said the survey respondents said they would appreciate politicians creating better conditions to help people start families - such as greater financial support , improved childcare and more part-time jobs created for parents . eighty-nine percent of the respondents said they would prefer flexible working hours for employed parents . increased financial support from the government would help large families and less qualified people . on the other hand , better childcare possibilities would encourage those currently without children and aid families with only one child , as well as highly-qualified working parents and women in eastern germany , researchers reported . the study said women desiring a first child wanted the most support , but also that one-fifth of the women who did not want children could still be encouraged through better family policies . the study also found that families with one child or highly-educated people would most likely choose to have a first or an additional child if family-oriented policies were in place that fit their individual needs . hamm said the study showed that having children is just one of many values among germans ; it is not a top priority .
parents with many children are viewed critically , while " it is completely socially acceptable to not have kids here . " " one 's status does not increase by having kids , " she said . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the challenge of demographic change in old , shriveling europe after decades of ignorance , public awareness of demographic change in europe is growing .

three protestors made a statement to that effect by getting naked during a game .
as if to emphasize their point , none of the crowd noticed . when one thinks of brazilians and the world cup , the usual image which springs to mind is the co-ordinated shaking of yellow and green-clad booties , gyrating in a celebration of the samba style and beautiful game for which the selecao is famous for .
such is the nation 's affinity with soccer ; one would not imagine any brazilians protesting against the sport .
and especially not while naked .
but this is what allegedly happened in a brazilian city during the last 16 clash between the selecao and ghana .
while the world cup is enthralling most of germany , and much of europe , the three men walked around a brazilian city in the buff while locals watched the match .
the three streakers-with-a-social-conscience staged the protest because they disagreed with how " the whole country stops to watch the football matches during the world cup , while enormous problems in brazil - like a lack of education among many people and a poor health system - keep getting worse . "
unfortunately for the exhibitionist crusaders , being in the tiny majority of brazilians who had time to think about the country 's problems while ronaldo and co. went about their business meant that no-one actually took a blind bit of notice .
three naked campaigners shaking their bits in protest could never compete with a rapturous crowd watching their heroes .
even the local cops let them get on with it .
" someone called to tell us to check the protest out , but since it was not a violent crime and we were watching the match at the time , we decided not to do anything about it , " a local police spokesperson reported .
" they only wanted to get attention , but they could n't even get this as everyone was watching the match , " the spokesperson added . dw staff -lrb- als / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de offsides from the fringe a selection of the best in wacky and offbeat stories from around germany .

result : a temporary dip in the german entertainment sector . normally the performances staged at berlin 's trendy , experimental grips theater play to a full house , but on june 9 , the day of the world cup 's opening match between germany and costa rica , only 30 spectators showed up in a theater with a seating capacity for 360 adults .
" we even delayed the play by a half-hour to 8:00 p.m. , but that did n't help " , joked volker ludwig , a playwright and founder of grips , who stayed home to watch soccer . " if our audience consisted of the conservative opera crowd , the world cup would have had no impact , but our plays and musicals appeal to younger folks , who happen to be football enthusiasts " , added ludwig , who has now cancelled die linke geschichte , an enormously popular cult piece , which conflicts with the quarter-finals on friday , when the two former world cup champions , germany and argentina , face off . dramatic drop in theatergoing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : impact of the world cup on theater attendance grips is not the only theater to experience a dramatic drop in attendance due to world cup fever .
the 450-seat maxim gorki theater in berlin , which features more mainstream classic productions , such as harold pinter 's one for the road , and bertolt brecht 's threepenny opera , reached only two-thirds capacity on an average evening this june . " we should have been 85 % full .
in june , before the big summer holidays , we normally sell well .
but this year we had freezing winter weather until may .
then suddenly , summer arrived in june , so everyone wants to be outdoors , but the world cup is also a huge factor in the drop " , according to spokeswoman claudia nola . dip in movie attendance too bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebrating outdoors in a beer garden beats staying inside balmy weather makes june a poor month for a night out at the movies anyway , but the world cup has made attendance rates even worse , according to jan oesterlin , head of zukunft kino marketing , an association of nationwide cinema distributors and exhibitors . " the distributors were prepared for the downturn due to soccer , and timed the release dates of both blockbusters and smaller productions around it to optimize turnout , " said oesterlin . thanks to two huge cash cows , da vinci code and ice age 2 , which were released in spring , movie attendance has actually increased by about 10 % for the first half of this year compared to the same time period in 2005 , he added . other summer fare , which have already played to huge audiences in north america , such as the computer-animated adventure film cars and german director wolfgang petersen 's thriller poseidon have been staggered for wide release in germany after the final on july 9 . during the world cup , many cinema complexes and chains have decided to join the crowd , by featuring matches on the big screen free of charge , and offering moviegoers a summer festival of oscar winning draws , such as walk the line or brokeback mountain .
the expectation , of course , being that consumption of drinks and popcorn will make up for the loss in ticket sales . germans prefer staying homebound for the world cup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tour operators offered discounted packages to lure germans away from home even the travel industry has braced itself for couch potatoes , who prefer staying home this summer .
" many major tour operators have offered deeply discounted packages before the world cup began , in traditional mass market destinations , such as majorca , and have assured fans that they can always watch the games on television anywhere in the world anyway " , said markus kurscheidt , a sports economist at ruhr-university bochum .
still , 44 % of travel agencies reported dismal bookings this month , according to fvw , a publication of the tourist trade . volker ludwig of grips theater has also tried to sell out tickets in advance .
" one of our most beloved musicals , line one , which runs from july 5-8 , the last week of matches , is sold out . " however , one semi-final is scheduled for july 5 , and on july 8 , the match for third place , for which germany could be a contender , takes place .

three protestors made a statement to that effect by getting naked during a game .
as if to emphasize their point , none of the crowd noticed . when one thinks of brazilians and the world cup , the usual image which springs to mind is the co-ordinated shaking of yellow and green-clad booties , gyrating in a celebration of the samba style and beautiful game for which the selecao is famous for .
such is the nation 's affinity with soccer ; one would not imagine any brazilians protesting against the sport .
and especially not while naked .
but this is what allegedly happened in a brazilian city during the last 16 clash between the selecao and ghana .
while the world cup is enthralling most of germany , and much of europe , the three men walked around a brazilian city in the buff while locals watched the match .
the three streakers-with-a-social-conscience staged the protest because they disagreed with how " the whole country stops to watch the football matches during the world cup , while enormous problems in brazil - like a lack of education among many people and a poor health system - keep getting worse . "
unfortunately for the exhibitionist crusaders , being in the tiny majority of brazilians who had time to think about the country 's problems while ronaldo and co. went about their business meant that no-one actually took a blind bit of notice .
three naked campaigners shaking their bits in protest could never compete with a rapturous crowd watching their heroes .
even the local cops let them get on with it .
" someone called to tell us to check the protest out , but since it was not a violent crime and we were watching the match at the time , we decided not to do anything about it , " a local police spokesperson reported .
" they only wanted to get attention , but they could n't even get this as everyone was watching the match , " the spokesperson added . dw staff -lrb- als / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de offsides from the fringe a selection of the best in wacky and offbeat stories from around germany .

the concession would gut efforts to combat climate change , they warn . german members of greenpeace staged a protest outside chancellor angela merkel 's office , condemning a scheme to grant greater carbon-pollution rights to german industry as a multi-billion-euro gift " that will lead to a climate catastrophe . " the national allocation plan ii , which received cabinet approval wednesday and covers policy from 2008 to 2012 , allows industry and electricity companies to emit 482 million tons of carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- per year under the kyoto protocol 's cap-and-trade system . the scheme marks an increase over last year 's level of 474 million tons , which the government had argued was unusually low and unfairly penalized german industry . the allocation is worth more than 7 billion euros on the basis of a current market price of about 15 euros -lrb- $ 18.75 -rrb- per ton of co2 under the eu 's emissions trading scheme . pollution at a steep price the plans have been criticized by ecologists , germany 's regional states and even industry groups . " the federal government must not allow such amounts to be given away for nothing , " baden-württemberg state environment minister ernst pfister told the financial times deutschland . environmentalists want pollution to come at a steep price and are calling for the certificates to be auctioned off , which the european commission - the eu 's executive - allows for up to 10 percent of the rights under the ets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german officials say that german industry is unfairly penalized the ets , one of the core mechanisms of the kyoto protocol on greenhouse gases , aims at reducing pollution by big industry . participants are set a quota of emissions and must pay a stiff financial penalty for every ton of co2 that breaches this threshold . companies that are below their quota can sell surplus emissions rights to firms that are above their quota , thus providing a carrot to everyone to clean up their act . but green groups say the market , which has been operating only since jan .
1 , 2005 , could be wrecked if the quotas are not tight enough . green groups angry the price for co2 was badly hit in april when several countries reported that their actual emissions in the first phase of the ets operations had been way below their estimated emissions , thus leaving a lot of surplus co2 on the market . recovery of the market has been based on expectations that countries will impose more stringent quotas for the period after 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace continues to work for the kyoto protocol around the world this explains the dismay among environmental groups at the decision made by the cabinet in berlin this week . under the plan , energy companies and industry must cut their co2 emissions by 15 million tons per year , marking a cut of about 3 percent compared to the average in 2000-2002 , but green groups are angry that , compared with the 2005 level , it represents an increase . under the kyoto protocol , germany pledged to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 21 percent from 1990 levels by the period 2008-2012 . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de carbon emissions traders carefully optimistic in cologne it 's been a year since the eu launched its first carbon trading market and things are looking up in spite of a recent plunge in prices , experts say .

the incentives are conditional on iran forgoing large-scale uranium enrichment and answering questions about its program . iran has a two-week deadline french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said that iran must reply to the international plan before the july 15-17 g8 summit . " it seems clear to me that iran must say yes .
then there will be negotiations , " douste-blazy said . u.s. secretary of state condoleezza rice earlier said the ministers would talk about iran , about how to deal with the palestinians ' hamas government and about democracy in russia and belarus . " we should also talk about democracy , " rice told the broadcaster cnn , expressing a desire for russia to " enhance its commitment to democratic development " as well as referring to belarus and other " places that have yet to see a democratic future . " russia has played a significant role in the standoff over iran 's nuclear program , being a permanent member of the united nations security council and a close ally of tehran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin : " russia will not join any ultimatum " on iran president vladimir putin on tuesday again underlined his differences with the west on the iran issue , saying russia did not intend " to join any sort of ultimatum , which only pushes the situation into a dead end . " amid reports that moscow wants to limit discussion of its human rights record or commitment to democracy at next month 's summit , a senior kremlin official defended russia 's role in neighboring parts of ex-communist europe . " moscow has done much more for democracy in central europe than washington or london , " said the deputy head of putin 's office , vladislav surkov , at a briefing wednesday .
" it 's moscow which democratized this immense space . " but if russia hopes to avoid discussion of accusations that it is backsliding on democracy and media freedom , the british foreign secretary margaret beckett reiterated that britain had concerns about human rights and the rule of law in russia . beckett , in an interview with russia 's kommersant broadsheet , also said she hoped next month 's summit would give a signal about the importance of competitive and open energy markets . " russia 's actions are inconsistent with g8 democratic norms " four prominent u.s. lawmakers on tuesday urged president george w. bush to rebuke putin over the " deterioration of democracy " in his country . it is important that the other g8 heads of state " make clear that russia 's actions are inconsistent with g8 democratic norms , " read a letter signed by democratic representative tom lantos and republican david dreier , together with senators john mccain , a republican , and democrat joe lieberman . earlier , an analyst close to the kremlin , the head of the moscow-based institute for political research , sergei markov , said he expected thursday 's meeting to be " rather tense .

unfortunately for the exhibitionist crusaders , being in the tiny majority of brazilians who had time to think about the country 's problems while ronaldo and co. went about their business meant that no-one actually took a blind bit of notice .

a german publisher , wbg , dropped their case asking for a preliminary injunction against the google books library project in the regional court of hamburg wednesday after the judge told them they were unlikely to get it .
the court ruled that there was no copyright violation stemming from the project .
digitizing 15 million books wbg started their action against the american company 's " book search engine " which began in 2004 .
it was the first time a german publisher had brought a case against google , although the action was backed by the german publishers association .
in the case , wbg wanted to stop google from scanning into its search engine any work published in germany and displaying snippets on its search pages .
the world 's largest internet search engine had announced that it wants to digitize about 15 million volumes from american and british libraries including those at harvard and stanford universities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google says its book snippets do not violate copyright laws it would work this way : google lets users type in a search term then scans its digitized library for the word or expression and produces a list of books where the term is mentioned .
users can then click on the results and a few pages of the text appear allowing users to read up online .
the idea is to supplement internet users with another source of material .
the publisher , through their legal action , wanted to stop google from scanning in copyrighted books without permission .
and the german publishers rejected the so-called opt-out option which allows them to request that certain books not be included by notifying google , saying it was non-binding on google .
opposition in the us google is also coming up against opposition to its project in the us where writers and publishers have filed lawsuits to force google to get their permission before scanning in books .
so far , the association of american publishers and the authors guild have filed suit .
the german court decision has no influence on american lawsuits .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : electronic books are coming in the near future at issue is the right of authors and their publishers to their own work versus the " fair use " of their work by the public .
google argues that their search engine will only offer users a " card catalog " function , with a few pages of text .
no one will be able to read the entire book online .
after the court decision , google reaffirmed its commitment to the project .
" google is passionate about the digitization of books , which we believe benefits everyone by making the world 's knowledge more accessible , " wrote david drummond , senior vice president and general counsel in a company blog . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german experts criticize google 's power google is the first place some 70 percent of germans go when looking for information on the internet - and that 's got some media experts worried the company could abuse its position by manipulating search results .

the concession would gut efforts to combat climate change , they warn . german members of greenpeace staged a protest outside chancellor angela merkel 's office , condemning a scheme to grant greater carbon-pollution rights to german industry as a multi-billion-euro gift " that will lead to a climate catastrophe . " the national allocation plan ii , which received cabinet approval wednesday and covers policy from 2008 to 2012 , allows industry and electricity companies to emit 482 million tons of carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- per year under the kyoto protocol 's cap-and-trade system . the scheme marks an increase over last year 's level of 474 million tons , which the government had argued was unusually low and unfairly penalized german industry . the allocation is worth more than 7 billion euros on the basis of a current market price of about 15 euros -lrb- $ 18.75 -rrb- per ton of co2 under the eu 's emissions trading scheme . pollution at a steep price the plans have been criticized by ecologists , germany 's regional states and even industry groups . " the federal government must not allow such amounts to be given away for nothing , " baden-württemberg state environment minister ernst pfister told the financial times deutschland . environmentalists want pollution to come at a steep price and are calling for the certificates to be auctioned off , which the european commission - the eu 's executive - allows for up to 10 percent of the rights under the ets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german officials say that german industry is unfairly penalized the ets , one of the core mechanisms of the kyoto protocol on greenhouse gases , aims at reducing pollution by big industry . participants are set a quota of emissions and must pay a stiff financial penalty for every ton of co2 that breaches this threshold . companies that are below their quota can sell surplus emissions rights to firms that are above their quota , thus providing a carrot to everyone to clean up their act . but green groups say the market , which has been operating only since jan .
1 , 2005 , could be wrecked if the quotas are not tight enough . green groups angry the price for co2 was badly hit in april when several countries reported that their actual emissions in the first phase of the ets operations had been way below their estimated emissions , thus leaving a lot of surplus co2 on the market . recovery of the market has been based on expectations that countries will impose more stringent quotas for the period after 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace continues to work for the kyoto protocol around the world this explains the dismay among environmental groups at the decision made by the cabinet in berlin this week . under the plan , energy companies and industry must cut their co2 emissions by 15 million tons per year , marking a cut of about 3 percent compared to the average in 2000-2002 , but green groups are angry that , compared with the 2005 level , it represents an increase . under the kyoto protocol , germany pledged to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 21 percent from 1990 levels by the period 2008-2012 . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de carbon emissions traders carefully optimistic in cologne it 's been a year since the eu launched its first carbon trading market and things are looking up in spite of a recent plunge in prices , experts say .

" i get the feeling that the french public do not feel truly represented by them which , without doubt , explains why there is not the same depth of support as there was eight years ago " when france won the world cup at home . le pen also indulged in an old charge that the french players did not properly sing the national anthem when it was played just prior to kickoff , citing the case of zinedine zidane " who mumbles it a bit . " replying to the comments at the french training base in germany , domenech said that it was wrong to single out the french players for such criticism .
" he should take a look at the other teams .
we are probably one of the teams which have the most players that sing the national anthem . " eccentric , divisive coach finally fights for his players bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : domenech has come out to support his team 100 percent " he should stop saying things like this , the spanish do n't sing , the argentineans do n't sing .
the players are proud to wear the french colors . " lilian thuram , france 's most capped player , also took issue with le pen , saying : " vive la france , but not the france that monsieur le pen wants .
he wants to be president but he does n't know his history of france . " " maybe mr. le pen has n't been told that some french people are black and others have got blond or brown hair . " " the public support the france team , they do n't ask what color the players are , regardless of whether they 're black or brown or white the team represents france .
if you see him tell him we 're proud to be french . " le pen 's racist remarks falling on deaf ears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the france team is too black for racist le pen le pen has regularly been at loggerheads with the french national side which draws its players from a mixed background of european and african descent . " he says there are too many black players on the team , well i do n't know how to respond to that as i 'm not black , " thuram , born in guadeloupe , teased . the defender 's comments sparked a spontaneous round of applause from the 100 or so journalists and photographers present . thuram also addressed le pen 's comments that some players should be kicked out of the team for not singing the la marseillaise .
" some sing the anthem and some do n't but whether you sing it or not has nothing to do with whether you feel french or not , " the defender said . " maybe we should invite monsieur le pen to celebrate our next victory with us , " thuram said .
" maybe it would help him realize that we are all french .

" players are simulating and doing whatever they can to make it difficult for the referee , " beckenbauer told a press conference at the world cup .
" this is something we need to look at after the world cup . " beckenbauer , who led west germany to world cup glory in 1974 and guided his nation to the 1990 title as coach , also criticized russian referee valentin ivanov 's handling of portugal 's stormy last 16 game against the netherlands . ivanov handed out 16 yellow cards and four reds , a world cup record , as portugal won 1-0 but both teams ended the match in nuremberg with just nine players on the pitch . " clearly he was too quick to blow his whistle and too quick to give yellow cards , " beckenbauer said .
" that meant that for the next little incident another yellow had to be shown .
but the players make mistakes so let us allow the referees to make mistakes as well . " ivanov was not among the 12 referees selected by fifa on thursday to take charge of the matches from the quarter-final stage . more briefs 29.06.2006 -pipe- fifa boss blatter blasts boring england 29.06.2006 -pipe- fool poll 's coming home 27.06.2006 -pipe- 20 cards issued in " hardest match " of ref 's career 27.06.2006 -pipe- germans optimistic about facing argentina 27.06.2006 -pipe- ronaldo becomes all-time world cup top scorer 26.06.2006 -pipe- owen heads to usa to see knee specialist 26.06.2006 -pipe- germany makes early goals part of their plan 26.06.2006 -pipe- kahn frustration understandable says klinsmann dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

earlier this year , details of turkish honor killings and fights over head scarves were making headlines in germany and fuelling a heated debate about turkish culture and raising doubts about its ability to adapt to a western lifestyle .
the world cup , however , appears to be bridging the gap between the two cultures . " of course , it would be better if the turkish team would play here , " one young turkish man said .
" but since they aren ’ t here , i ’ m now supporting the german team because i live here . " everyone needs to have fun bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans - and turks - were elated after germany beat sweden in the final 16 round he added that it ’ s nothing unusual to cheer for germany because this country is his second home . " after all , germany is playing very well in the tournament , " he said . and attitudes are also changing among native germans .
surprised by their own soccer-fuelled , newly-found national identity , many germans are now also taken aback to find their compatriots of turkish descent happily waving german flags right next to them . " it ’ s great because everybody needs to have fun in germany , " said one german .
" it ’ s great being together with them , being multicultural like one world and one city . " sunshine helps following germany 's recent victory over sweden , the streets in kreuzberg were jammed with cars as the rowdy celebrations neared their peak .
some turks say that germans , who are often described as humorless and disciplined , now have the chance to learn how to celebrate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turks in kreuzberg and other berlin districts are following the german team 's performance " i ’ ve experienced such huge celebrations only in turkey , " said one fan adding that the whole country is usually up and dancing after a football victory .
" it seems we can contribute something to this country now . " he said he believed the mentality in countries where the weather is always good is definitely more relaxed than in germany and also partly attributed the current mood of elation to the splendid sunshine over the last few days . many turks hope that once the world cup is over , germans might keep some of their new found enthusiasm and friendliness towards their own country and the ethnic minorities living here . uwe hessler -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de public viewing takes on new dimension at world cup do n't have a ticket ?

earlier this year , details of turkish honor killings and fights over head scarves were making headlines in germany and fuelling a heated debate about turkish culture and raising doubts about its ability to adapt to a western lifestyle .
the world cup , however , appears to be bridging the gap between the two cultures . " of course , it would be better if the turkish team would play here , " one young turkish man said .
" but since they aren ’ t here , i ’ m now supporting the german team because i live here . " everyone needs to have fun bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans - and turks - were elated after germany beat sweden in the final 16 round he added that it ’ s nothing unusual to cheer for germany because this country is his second home . " after all , germany is playing very well in the tournament , " he said . and attitudes are also changing among native germans .
surprised by their own soccer-fuelled , newly-found national identity , many germans are now also taken aback to find their compatriots of turkish descent happily waving german flags right next to them . " it ’ s great because everybody needs to have fun in germany , " said one german .
" it ’ s great being together with them , being multicultural like one world and one city . " sunshine helps following germany 's recent victory over sweden , the streets in kreuzberg were jammed with cars as the rowdy celebrations neared their peak .
some turks say that germans , who are often described as humorless and disciplined , now have the chance to learn how to celebrate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turks in kreuzberg and other berlin districts are following the german team 's performance " i ’ ve experienced such huge celebrations only in turkey , " said one fan adding that the whole country is usually up and dancing after a football victory .
" it seems we can contribute something to this country now . " he said he believed the mentality in countries where the weather is always good is definitely more relaxed than in germany and also partly attributed the current mood of elation to the splendid sunshine over the last few days . many turks hope that once the world cup is over , germans might keep some of their new found enthusiasm and friendliness towards their own country and the ethnic minorities living here . uwe hessler -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de public viewing takes on new dimension at world cup do n't have a ticket ?

result : a temporary dip in the german entertainment sector . normally the performances staged at berlin 's trendy , experimental grips theater play to a full house , but on june 9 , the day of the world cup 's opening match between germany and costa rica , only 30 spectators showed up in a theater with a seating capacity for 360 adults .
" we even delayed the play by a half-hour to 8:00 p.m. , but that did n't help " , joked volker ludwig , a playwright and founder of grips , who stayed home to watch soccer . " if our audience consisted of the conservative opera crowd , the world cup would have had no impact , but our plays and musicals appeal to younger folks , who happen to be football enthusiasts " , added ludwig , who has now cancelled die linke geschichte , an enormously popular cult piece , which conflicts with the quarter-finals on friday , when the two former world cup champions , germany and argentina , face off . dramatic drop in theatergoing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : impact of the world cup on theater attendance grips is not the only theater to experience a dramatic drop in attendance due to world cup fever .
the 450-seat maxim gorki theater in berlin , which features more mainstream classic productions , such as harold pinter 's one for the road , and bertolt brecht 's threepenny opera , reached only two-thirds capacity on an average evening this june . " we should have been 85 % full .
in june , before the big summer holidays , we normally sell well .
but this year we had freezing winter weather until may .
then suddenly , summer arrived in june , so everyone wants to be outdoors , but the world cup is also a huge factor in the drop " , according to spokeswoman claudia nola . dip in movie attendance too bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebrating outdoors in a beer garden beats staying inside balmy weather makes june a poor month for a night out at the movies anyway , but the world cup has made attendance rates even worse , according to jan oesterlin , head of zukunft kino marketing , an association of nationwide cinema distributors and exhibitors . " the distributors were prepared for the downturn due to soccer , and timed the release dates of both blockbusters and smaller productions around it to optimize turnout , " said oesterlin . thanks to two huge cash cows , da vinci code and ice age 2 , which were released in spring , movie attendance has actually increased by about 10 % for the first half of this year compared to the same time period in 2005 , he added . other summer fare , which have already played to huge audiences in north america , such as the computer-animated adventure film cars and german director wolfgang petersen 's thriller poseidon have been staggered for wide release in germany after the final on july 9 . during the world cup , many cinema complexes and chains have decided to join the crowd , by featuring matches on the big screen free of charge , and offering moviegoers a summer festival of oscar winning draws , such as walk the line or brokeback mountain .
the expectation , of course , being that consumption of drinks and popcorn will make up for the loss in ticket sales . germans prefer staying homebound for the world cup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tour operators offered discounted packages to lure germans away from home even the travel industry has braced itself for couch potatoes , who prefer staying home this summer .
" many major tour operators have offered deeply discounted packages before the world cup began , in traditional mass market destinations , such as majorca , and have assured fans that they can always watch the games on television anywhere in the world anyway " , said markus kurscheidt , a sports economist at ruhr-university bochum .
still , 44 % of travel agencies reported dismal bookings this month , according to fvw , a publication of the tourist trade . volker ludwig of grips theater has also tried to sell out tickets in advance .
" one of our most beloved musicals , line one , which runs from july 5-8 , the last week of matches , is sold out . " however , one semi-final is scheduled for july 5 , and on july 8 , the match for third place , for which germany could be a contender , takes place .
in which case , theatregoers could wind up cheering at the nearby fan mile instead . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de researchers find world cup triggers stock market response like many a soccer ball in germany right now , the german stock market has been bouncing up and down and round this week .

the concession would gut efforts to combat climate change , they warn . german members of greenpeace staged a protest outside chancellor angela merkel 's office , condemning a scheme to grant greater carbon-pollution rights to german industry as a multi-billion-euro gift " that will lead to a climate catastrophe . " the national allocation plan ii , which received cabinet approval wednesday and covers policy from 2008 to 2012 , allows industry and electricity companies to emit 482 million tons of carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- per year under the kyoto protocol 's cap-and-trade system . the scheme marks an increase over last year 's level of 474 million tons , which the government had argued was unusually low and unfairly penalized german industry . the allocation is worth more than 7 billion euros on the basis of a current market price of about 15 euros -lrb- $ 18.75 -rrb- per ton of co2 under the eu 's emissions trading scheme . pollution at a steep price the plans have been criticized by ecologists , germany 's regional states and even industry groups . " the federal government must not allow such amounts to be given away for nothing , " baden-württemberg state environment minister ernst pfister told the financial times deutschland . environmentalists want pollution to come at a steep price and are calling for the certificates to be auctioned off , which the european commission - the eu 's executive - allows for up to 10 percent of the rights under the ets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german officials say that german industry is unfairly penalized the ets , one of the core mechanisms of the kyoto protocol on greenhouse gases , aims at reducing pollution by big industry . participants are set a quota of emissions and must pay a stiff financial penalty for every ton of co2 that breaches this threshold . companies that are below their quota can sell surplus emissions rights to firms that are above their quota , thus providing a carrot to everyone to clean up their act . but green groups say the market , which has been operating only since jan .
1 , 2005 , could be wrecked if the quotas are not tight enough . green groups angry the price for co2 was badly hit in april when several countries reported that their actual emissions in the first phase of the ets operations had been way below their estimated emissions , thus leaving a lot of surplus co2 on the market . recovery of the market has been based on expectations that countries will impose more stringent quotas for the period after 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace continues to work for the kyoto protocol around the world this explains the dismay among environmental groups at the decision made by the cabinet in berlin this week . under the plan , energy companies and industry must cut their co2 emissions by 15 million tons per year , marking a cut of about 3 percent compared to the average in 2000-2002 , but green groups are angry that , compared with the 2005 level , it represents an increase . under the kyoto protocol , germany pledged to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 21 percent from 1990 levels by the period 2008-2012 . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de carbon emissions traders carefully optimistic in cologne it 's been a year since the eu launched its first carbon trading market and things are looking up in spite of a recent plunge in prices , experts say .

the incentives are conditional on iran forgoing large-scale uranium enrichment and answering questions about its program . iran has a two-week deadline french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said that iran must reply to the international plan before the july 15-17 g8 summit .

" moscow has done much more for democracy in central europe than washington or london , " said the deputy head of putin 's office , vladislav surkov , at a briefing wednesday .
" it 's moscow which democratized this immense space . " but if russia hopes to avoid discussion of accusations that it is backsliding on democracy and media freedom , the british foreign secretary margaret beckett reiterated that britain had concerns about human rights and the rule of law in russia . beckett , in an interview with russia 's kommersant broadsheet , also said she hoped next month 's summit would give a signal about the importance of competitive and open energy markets .

the incentives are conditional on iran forgoing large-scale uranium enrichment and answering questions about its program . iran has a two-week deadline french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said that iran must reply to the international plan before the july 15-17 g8 summit . " it seems clear to me that iran must say yes .
then there will be negotiations , " douste-blazy said . u.s. secretary of state condoleezza rice earlier said the ministers would talk about iran , about how to deal with the palestinians ' hamas government and about democracy in russia and belarus . " we should also talk about democracy , " rice told the broadcaster cnn , expressing a desire for russia to " enhance its commitment to democratic development " as well as referring to belarus and other " places that have yet to see a democratic future . " russia has played a significant role in the standoff over iran 's nuclear program , being a permanent member of the united nations security council and a close ally of tehran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin : " russia will not join any ultimatum " on iran president vladimir putin on tuesday again underlined his differences with the west on the iran issue , saying russia did not intend " to join any sort of ultimatum , which only pushes the situation into a dead end . " amid reports that moscow wants to limit discussion of its human rights record or commitment to democracy at next month 's summit , a senior kremlin official defended russia 's role in neighboring parts of ex-communist europe . " moscow has done much more for democracy in central europe than washington or london , " said the deputy head of putin 's office , vladislav surkov , at a briefing wednesday .
" it 's moscow which democratized this immense space . " but if russia hopes to avoid discussion of accusations that it is backsliding on democracy and media freedom , the british foreign secretary margaret beckett reiterated that britain had concerns about human rights and the rule of law in russia . beckett , in an interview with russia 's kommersant broadsheet , also said she hoped next month 's summit would give a signal about the importance of competitive and open energy markets . " russia 's actions are inconsistent with g8 democratic norms " four prominent u.s. lawmakers on tuesday urged president george w. bush to rebuke putin over the " deterioration of democracy " in his country . it is important that the other g8 heads of state " make clear that russia 's actions are inconsistent with g8 democratic norms , " read a letter signed by democratic representative tom lantos and republican david dreier , together with senators john mccain , a republican , and democrat joe lieberman . earlier , an analyst close to the kremlin , the head of the moscow-based institute for political research , sergei markov , said he expected thursday 's meeting to be " rather tense .

daimlerchrysler 's midget smart car will take on the us market in 2008 , with executives hoping the nimble microcar can out-manoeuvre rivals in the land of the mammoth sports utility vehicle . the german-us automaker said wednesday it will launch the car through a partner - a company headed by racing legend roger penske - in early 2008 .
high fuel prices and positive responses from consumers drove the decision . at 2.5 meters long -lrb- 8.2 feet -rrb- and weighing in at a mere 990 kilos -lrb- 2,180 pounds -rrb- , the two-seat smart car is about half the size of a hummer , ford expedition or other large suv . but daimlerchrysler chairman dieter zetsche said the smart - which will be offered in three models in the world 's largest automotive market - can hold its own against us muscle cars . " times have changed , and urban us streets are becoming increasingly congested , " zetsche told reporters during the announcement . " gas prices are also increasing , and we may never see cheap gas again , " he added . some smart cars are already sold in the us through unofficial resellers , but wednesday 's announcement designates automotive retailer penske 's unitedauto group as the official distributor for the smart in the united states and puerto rico . smart cars have been on european roads since 1998 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some have likened the smart 's appearance to a baby shoe daimlerchrysler officials hope to promote the urban microcar as offering a fun driving experience , and have been able to place the vehicle in movies like " the da vinci code , " where it was used in a chase scene in paris , and the remake of " the pink panther " starring steve martin as inspector clouseau . " the time has never been better for this - and i am convinced that the smart fortwo as an innovative , ecological and agile city car will soon become just as familiar a sight on the streets of new york , miami or seattle as it is today in rome , berlin or paris , " zetsche said . the smart brand , which was launched in 1998 , has been a laggard for the automotive conglomerate , and the decision over whether to launch the brand in the largest auto market was heavily debated . the additional sales volume could help smart meet its target of achieving profitability . zetsche said there was never any doubt over whether smart would enter the us market , pointing out that the next-generation fortwo was always designed to meet the safety and crash regulations established in the united states . the issue that needed to be finalized before the announcement was the distribution plan , which will be handled exclusively by unitedauto , part of a company headed by penske with dealers in 20 states . the distributor said it would select between 30 and 50 dealers in major urban us markets , along with a few select leisure markets . success in canada while expecting to sell the fortwo at less than 15,000 dollars per unit , penske would not comment on volume targets but noted smart 's recent success in canada , where the brand was expected to achieve 1,500 units in its first year but ended up achieving more than 4,000 sales . the smart car would be among the least fuel-hungry cars on the road .

daimlerchrysler 's midget smart car will take on the us market in 2008 , with executives hoping the nimble microcar can out-manoeuvre rivals in the land of the mammoth sports utility vehicle . the german-us automaker said wednesday it will launch the car through a partner - a company headed by racing legend roger penske - in early 2008 .
high fuel prices and positive responses from consumers drove the decision . at 2.5 meters long -lrb- 8.2 feet -rrb- and weighing in at a mere 990 kilos -lrb- 2,180 pounds -rrb- , the two-seat smart car is about half the size of a hummer , ford expedition or other large suv . but daimlerchrysler chairman dieter zetsche said the smart - which will be offered in three models in the world 's largest automotive market - can hold its own against us muscle cars . " times have changed , and urban us streets are becoming increasingly congested , " zetsche told reporters during the announcement . " gas prices are also increasing , and we may never see cheap gas again , " he added . some smart cars are already sold in the us through unofficial resellers , but wednesday 's announcement designates automotive retailer penske 's unitedauto group as the official distributor for the smart in the united states and puerto rico . smart cars have been on european roads since 1998 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some have likened the smart 's appearance to a baby shoe daimlerchrysler officials hope to promote the urban microcar as offering a fun driving experience , and have been able to place the vehicle in movies like " the da vinci code , " where it was used in a chase scene in paris , and the remake of " the pink panther " starring steve martin as inspector clouseau . " the time has never been better for this - and i am convinced that the smart fortwo as an innovative , ecological and agile city car will soon become just as familiar a sight on the streets of new york , miami or seattle as it is today in rome , berlin or paris , " zetsche said . the smart brand , which was launched in 1998 , has been a laggard for the automotive conglomerate , and the decision over whether to launch the brand in the largest auto market was heavily debated . the additional sales volume could help smart meet its target of achieving profitability . zetsche said there was never any doubt over whether smart would enter the us market , pointing out that the next-generation fortwo was always designed to meet the safety and crash regulations established in the united states . the issue that needed to be finalized before the announcement was the distribution plan , which will be handled exclusively by unitedauto , part of a company headed by penske with dealers in 20 states . the distributor said it would select between 30 and 50 dealers in major urban us markets , along with a few select leisure markets . success in canada while expecting to sell the fortwo at less than 15,000 dollars per unit , penske would not comment on volume targets but noted smart 's recent success in canada , where the brand was expected to achieve 1,500 units in its first year but ended up achieving more than 4,000 sales . the smart car would be among the least fuel-hungry cars on the road .
the company says it goes about 90 kilometers -lrb- 56 miles -rrb- per gallon -lrb- 3.8 liters -rrb- .
that translates to consumption of 4.2 liters per 100 kilometers . dw staff / afp -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de daimlerchrysler ceo inclined to launch smart car in us automaker daimlerchrysler is considering whether to introduce its mini " smart " cars onto the american market .

friday 's game could be a case of the best not being saved for last . germany 's soccer reputation lay in shreds for a decade but has been restored virtually overnight under the sunny disposition of jürgen klinsmann , a man whose ubiquitous smile grew to previously-unseen proportions saturday after beating sweden in the round of 16 . now he and the german team are looking forward to their quarter-final match against south american juggernaut argentina .
the sides have met under their current coaches twice already and reached 2-2 splits each time .
on friday , one of them will win the statistical advantage and a place in the semi-finals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann , left , and pekerman took different paths to their coaching spots long , competitive finals history but even before klinsmann took over die mannschaft as the german soccer association 's third choice just one month before jose pekerman succeeded marcelo bielsa , who surprisingly left a solid argentine side , the two nations shared a history of close world cup matches - especially when it came down to the final game . in 1986 , the brilliance of diego maradona , bolstered by his slalom run and goal to finish off an england side bamboozled by the now infamous " hand of god " goal , gave the south americans the one goal they needed to edge past germany 3-2 in the trophy match . klinsmann is sure to remember the last time the two powerhouses met in the cup .
he was on the field in rome for the 1990 final and watched tears well in argentine eyes as they were awarded silver medals before he lifted the cup in a match that saw two south american players sent off . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : argentina 's maradona remembers the win , and the tears that followed four years later players confident of reaching semi-finals the countries also met in group action in 1956 and 1966 and in 2006 both teams are positive going into saturday 's match in the german capital . " this is a match pitting two of the greats together , " pekerman said after beating mexico in the round of 16 .
" we have enormous respect for each other . " germany hope they will be able to put an end to their six-year curse of defeat against big-name teams . " we will do everything to beat them and i think we can do it , " german midfielder torsten frings said .
" i think friday is finally the time to defeat a top nation . " meanwhile , argentina want to live up to their reputation as one of the favorites to lift the trophy on july 9 . " germany are going to have to show more than they have done so far to beat us , " argentina striker carlos tevez said , adding that he is n't worried about germany 's size advantage .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de features -pipe- 29.06.2006 opinion : great world cup except for the soccer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ouch !
if you ca n't score , go for a foul seems to be the motto of the world cup great stadiums , euphoric fans , a relaxed host country and benevolent weather gods have turned the world cup into a feast .
but the action on the pitch is n't exactly worth cheering about . from a german perspective , it 's easy to forget that the world cup 1990 was considered an absolute low point in world cup history . never before had so few goals -lrb- 2.21 per game -rrb- been scored and so many fouls -lrb- 16 players were sent off during the tournament -rrb- been committed during the world cup as they were in italy . thank god fifa had ordered players in advance to wear shin guards . the secret star of the tournament was guido buchwald , of all people - a defensive player with limited talent from swabia .
the finals fittingly ended in 1-0 .
the winning goal was scored after a controversial penalty kick and two players were shown red cards . heading towards a new negative record with just eight games left to go in the 2006 world cup , the verdict - from a sports point of view - will be pretty sobering . the passionately celebrated soccer fest could end up with a new negative record .
just about 2.36 goals per game were scored in the 56 games that have been played so far and 19 players have already been sent off . it was all meant to be different .
the entire world was hoping to see some strong , attacking soccer .
coaching guru guus hiddink , currently coaching australia , was counting on a virtual goal feast . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cup began with a goal feast with germany 4-2 win over costa rica admittedly , the tournament did get off to a fantastic start .
in a first for the world cup , six goals were scored in the opening game alone .
the same was repeated when argentina systematically dismantled serbia & montenegro 's defense - ironically the same defense that is considered one of the strongest and which allowed just a single goal in the qualification rounds . the orange disappointment but otherwise , it 's been slim pickings at this world cup .
trinidad and tobago did n't manage a single goal in three games , angola and togo just one each .
maybe that 's all that could be expected from these world cup debutants . but even highly-regarded teams failed to deliver when it came to finding the net : the czechs departed with just three goals and the dutch , too , were equally shy about scoring .
they turned out to be the biggest disappointments of the cup . after all , its the dutch who have been the standard-bearers of the beautiful , attacking style of play since the 1974 world cup .
considering that dutch coach marco van basten - considered the best striker of his time - had promised great offensive play from his side , what followed instead was a swan song for all dutch virtues . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dutch were n't at their best against the ivory coast the netherlands may have had their three traditional strikers on the pitch , but too often it looked like the worst of lumbering german soccer in the pre-klinsmann era .
against the ivory coast and argentina , the oranje even committed the ultimate sacrilege possible in the netherlands by blocking and sticking to their half of the field . the dutch 's disgraceful exit in their 1-0 loss to portugal in a game marked by some nasty fouls completed the sad picture .
the four players who were sent off in that notorious game set a new world cup record under the motto " if you do n't find the net , you can at least foul . "
that was the case in 1990 too . special taste in soccer you have to have a special taste in soccer in order to really enjoy what 's on offer in the quarter-finals . england ?
terrible .
it 's almost fitting that captain david beckham threw up on the pitch .
brazil ?
smug to the point of apathy .
ukraine ?
in the world cup because of a lucky draw . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : totti 's last-gasp penalty kick against australia saved the italians ' day portugal ?
made an impact only because of their assaults .
italy ?
wily enough to wiggle their way through even after being shown red , albeit only with a pounding penalty kick in extra time .
france ?
has some of the best strikers in the world with henry and trezeguet - but only allows one to play . there 's no doubt that the 2006 world cup is all about security , efficiency and blocking techniques .
maybe the defensive fest is a poisoned legacy of the 2004 european championships .
several teams played some fantastic offensive soccer there , but greece did n't - and went on to win the tournament thanks to a mysterious quirk of the soccer gods . germany , of all teams and germany , of all teams , seems to have drawn lessons from that .
klinsmann 's attacking tactics really seem to be paying off . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german strikers klose and podolski have been wowing fans in germany and abroad , people are rubbing their eyes in disbelief .

the three streakers-with-a-social-conscience staged the protest because they disagreed with how " the whole country stops to watch the football matches during the world cup , while enormous problems in brazil - like a lack of education among many people and a poor health system - keep getting worse .

unfortunately for the exhibitionist crusaders , being in the tiny majority of brazilians who had time to think about the country 's problems while ronaldo and co. went about their business meant that no-one actually took a blind bit of notice .

it 's all sadly familiar .
england are at a world cup and certain fans are causing chaos .
yet these rowdies sport designer pumps and are blinged to the max . the germans ca n't be blamed for not being ready .
everything that could be done was done .
police forces from both sides of the channel had been liaising for months on the best strategies to employ to minimize the damage . however , while british and german security forces were preparing for the possible influx of english soccer hooligans , no one was prepared for the havoc that the wives and girlfriends -lrb- wags -rrb- of the england players would wreak . imagine , if you dare , a typical night out in a large english city .
even for those who have never experienced one , it 's not hard to visualize the scene .
stories of boozy evenings in england are as much tabloid fodder in the international press as they are in the red tops back home . the binge drinking normally ends with sweaty lads in designer shirts bawling or brawling as the girls battle to keep their dignity covered by micro-minis while simultaneously knocking back alcopops and trying to stay upright . now substitute manchester on a friday night with baden-baden on every night of the week since the england team took up residence there .
also , substitute micro-minis for this year 's must-have hotpants and alcopops for moet & chandon .
welcome to the sideshow which is the wags on tour . wags turn spa town into a never-ending hen night bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baden-baden in more sedate times more used to retired german millionaires shuffling into the spas that it is famous for , the population of baden-baden has been knocked sideways by the arrival of the women and their designer handbags and fake tans . they are staying at the 1450 euro -lrb- $ 1821 -rrb- a night brenner 's park hotel and the paparazzi with their long lenses have followed them . leading the pack is victoria " posh spice " beckham .
at 32 , victoria is the doyen of footballers ' wives having been there and done that . while her appearance in skimpy shorts and massive sunglasses sparked debate about whether she is too thin , she has otherwise maintained a low profile , looking after her three children and cheering on husband david . the other wags have been more conspicuous , competing in the fashion stakes while seeing who can drink and spend the most . normally quiet bars turned into wild west saloons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steve gerrard 's partner alex curran : likes to party , allegedly " they swilled drink , smashed glasses , roared raucous chants and belted out bawdy sing-songs , " yelled the british tabloid daily mirror after some were spotted in one of the few late-night bars here where most of the other customers were reporters . it said they rang up a bill of thousands of pounds after downing bottles of moet champagne followed by glasses of vodka and red bull and shots of sambucca . after drunkenly singing songs in honor of england , things then turned partisan when the wags of the liverpool contingent started singing offensive songs about chelsea and manchester united . while the downtime is becoming notorious , the shopping sprees , meanwhile , have become legendary . mass market german daily bild said six of the wags , including posh and coach sven-goran eriksson 's girlfriend nancy dellolio , spent 80,000 euros in one hour in the town 's luxury boutiques . it said the women blew 4,395 euros in 10 minutes alone on shoes and t-shirts , with the rest going on creations by dolce and gabbana , prada and versace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what 's good for uma is good for the wags " i hope england stays in the competition for a while , " delighted boutique owner monika scholz was quoted as saying .
however , that opinion is not shared by many of the locals who have become increasingly annoyed with the drunken antics of the wags .
many have said they ca n't wait for england to get knocked out so they can all go home . divisions over behavior and as the weeks have passed - during which baden-baden has become known as boring-boring - tensions have grown and splits in the ranks have reportedly occurred within the group , with some tiring of the others ' antics and attitudes . ashley cole 's pop star fiancée cheryl tweedy has become close to posh and dellolio , and wayne rooney 's girlfriend coleen mcloughlin , who brought her own tanning consultant with her , has also sided with them . " victoria 's been in this game for years .
she 's got decorum whereas some of the others could n't even spell the word , " the mirror quoted an " insider " as saying . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i think we lost ' em , babes such has been the sideshow that britain 's " high-brow " media has also waded in , with the sunday times citing a survey by carma , an international media analysis company , on which wag has got the most press coverage .
the winner so far is tweedy , a singer with the group girls aloud . next comes posh , followed by carly zucker , the fitness instructor girlfriend of joe cole .
following her is melanie slade , the student girlfriend of theo walcott , england 's teenage striker who has yet to get a game .

earlier this year , details of turkish honor killings and fights over head scarves were making headlines in germany and fuelling a heated debate about turkish culture and raising doubts about its ability to adapt to a western lifestyle .
the world cup , however , appears to be bridging the gap between the two cultures . " of course , it would be better if the turkish team would play here , " one young turkish man said .
" but since they aren ’ t here , i ’ m now supporting the german team because i live here . " everyone needs to have fun bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans - and turks - were elated after germany beat sweden in the final 16 round he added that it ’ s nothing unusual to cheer for germany because this country is his second home . " after all , germany is playing very well in the tournament , " he said . and attitudes are also changing among native germans .
surprised by their own soccer-fuelled , newly-found national identity , many germans are now also taken aback to find their compatriots of turkish descent happily waving german flags right next to them . " it ’ s great because everybody needs to have fun in germany , " said one german .
" it ’ s great being together with them , being multicultural like one world and one city . " sunshine helps following germany 's recent victory over sweden , the streets in kreuzberg were jammed with cars as the rowdy celebrations neared their peak .
some turks say that germans , who are often described as humorless and disciplined , now have the chance to learn how to celebrate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turks in kreuzberg and other berlin districts are following the german team 's performance " i ’ ve experienced such huge celebrations only in turkey , " said one fan adding that the whole country is usually up and dancing after a football victory .
" it seems we can contribute something to this country now . " he said he believed the mentality in countries where the weather is always good is definitely more relaxed than in germany and also partly attributed the current mood of elation to the splendid sunshine over the last few days . many turks hope that once the world cup is over , germans might keep some of their new found enthusiasm and friendliness towards their own country and the ethnic minorities living here . uwe hessler -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de public viewing takes on new dimension at world cup do n't have a ticket ?

" i get the feeling that the french public do not feel truly represented by them which , without doubt , explains why there is not the same depth of support as there was eight years ago " when france won the world cup at home . le pen also indulged in an old charge that the french players did not properly sing the national anthem when it was played just prior to kickoff , citing the case of zinedine zidane " who mumbles it a bit . " replying to the comments at the french training base in germany , domenech said that it was wrong to single out the french players for such criticism .
" he should take a look at the other teams .
we are probably one of the teams which have the most players that sing the national anthem . " eccentric , divisive coach finally fights for his players bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : domenech has come out to support his team 100 percent " he should stop saying things like this , the spanish do n't sing , the argentineans do n't sing .
the players are proud to wear the french colors . " lilian thuram , france 's most capped player , also took issue with le pen , saying : " vive la france , but not the france that monsieur le pen wants .
he wants to be president but he does n't know his history of france . " " maybe mr. le pen has n't been told that some french people are black and others have got blond or brown hair . " " the public support the france team , they do n't ask what color the players are , regardless of whether they 're black or brown or white the team represents france .
if you see him tell him we 're proud to be french . " le pen 's racist remarks falling on deaf ears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the france team is too black for racist le pen le pen has regularly been at loggerheads with the french national side which draws its players from a mixed background of european and african descent . " he says there are too many black players on the team , well i do n't know how to respond to that as i 'm not black , " thuram , born in guadeloupe , teased . the defender 's comments sparked a spontaneous round of applause from the 100 or so journalists and photographers present . thuram also addressed le pen 's comments that some players should be kicked out of the team for not singing the la marseillaise .
" some sing the anthem and some do n't but whether you sing it or not has nothing to do with whether you feel french or not , " the defender said . " maybe we should invite monsieur le pen to celebrate our next victory with us , " thuram said .
" maybe it would help him realize that we are all french .

work-life balance gets boost in germany the dumbing down of germany gerd 's family policy gets down to business encouraging germans to have more kids germany -pipe- 29.06.2006 study : men in germany are scared to start families großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany faces problems with low birth rates low birth rates and the ageing population in germany have dominated media in discussions about how to pay for health care and social security .
now , a study says it is men who are primarily responsible for fewer births . in its study , the robert bosch foundation found that " men are scared to start families , " said ingrid hamm , managing director of the foundation .
the study says one in four men in germany do not want children , whereas one in seven women prefer to remain childless .
in eastern germany , that rate is lower , with one in 10 women exopressing the wish to remain childless . the study was based on responses from 10,017 people .
researchers say the survey was representative , even of the smallest groups in germany . men and women in germany also differ on the number of children they would like to have .
men want only an average of 1.59 kids ; the average number of children women would like is 1.75 .
both of these numbers , however , are still higher than germany 's actual average birth rate of 1.37 children per woman . under pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both men and women in germany want more babies than the number being born hamm said another reason for fewer children in germany is that people feel too much pressure .
they have long career training periods and then " have to do everything at once between the ages of 30 and 40 : get married , have kids , build a house , pursue their careers and save money for retirement , " she said . " all that pressure makes people put off having children until later or not at all . " women , too , are faced with a loss of economic control over their lives if they choose a baby break .
for a well-to-do country like germany , the economic loss is even greater , hamm said . she added that , in addition , germans lack faith in the future . " in germany , we have lost a sense that everything will turn out all right .
germans are prone to worrying about the future a lot more than other people , " she said . " german " is not just german , however .
the study found that the wish to forgo having children is much stronger in the former west german states .
in the new german states -lrb- formerly east germany -rrb- , fewer women want to remain childless . " children in the former gdr were everywhere , " hamm said . " mothers and fathers both worked , and east german children grew up with the image that being both parent and employee is possible . " " better policies could boost birth rates " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " large families are frowned upon , " hamm said the survey respondents said they would appreciate politicians creating better conditions to help people start families - such as greater financial support , improved childcare and more part-time jobs created for parents . eighty-nine percent of the respondents said they would prefer flexible working hours for employed parents . increased financial support from the government would help large families and less qualified people . on the other hand , better childcare possibilities would encourage those currently without children and aid families with only one child , as well as highly-qualified working parents and women in eastern germany , researchers reported . the study said women desiring a first child wanted the most support , but also that one-fifth of the women who did not want children could still be encouraged through better family policies . the study also found that families with one child or highly-educated people would most likely choose to have a first or an additional child if family-oriented policies were in place that fit their individual needs . hamm said the study showed that having children is just one of many values among germans ; it is not a top priority .
parents with many children are viewed critically , while " it is completely socially acceptable to not have kids here .

parents with many children are viewed critically , while " it is completely socially acceptable to not have kids here .

work-life balance gets boost in germany the dumbing down of germany gerd 's family policy gets down to business encouraging germans to have more kids germany -pipe- 29.06.2006 study : men in germany are scared to start families großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany faces problems with low birth rates low birth rates and the ageing population in germany have dominated media in discussions about how to pay for health care and social security .
now , a study says it is men who are primarily responsible for fewer births . in its study , the robert bosch foundation found that " men are scared to start families , " said ingrid hamm , managing director of the foundation .
the study says one in four men in germany do not want children , whereas one in seven women prefer to remain childless .
in eastern germany , that rate is lower , with one in 10 women exopressing the wish to remain childless . the study was based on responses from 10,017 people .
researchers say the survey was representative , even of the smallest groups in germany . men and women in germany also differ on the number of children they would like to have .
men want only an average of 1.59 kids ; the average number of children women would like is 1.75 .
both of these numbers , however , are still higher than germany 's actual average birth rate of 1.37 children per woman . under pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both men and women in germany want more babies than the number being born hamm said another reason for fewer children in germany is that people feel too much pressure .
they have long career training periods and then " have to do everything at once between the ages of 30 and 40 : get married , have kids , build a house , pursue their careers and save money for retirement , " she said . " all that pressure makes people put off having children until later or not at all . " women , too , are faced with a loss of economic control over their lives if they choose a baby break .
for a well-to-do country like germany , the economic loss is even greater , hamm said . she added that , in addition , germans lack faith in the future . " in germany , we have lost a sense that everything will turn out all right .
germans are prone to worrying about the future a lot more than other people , " she said . " german " is not just german , however .
the study found that the wish to forgo having children is much stronger in the former west german states .
in the new german states -lrb- formerly east germany -rrb- , fewer women want to remain childless . " children in the former gdr were everywhere , " hamm said . " mothers and fathers both worked , and east german children grew up with the image that being both parent and employee is possible . " " better policies could boost birth rates " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " large families are frowned upon , " hamm said the survey respondents said they would appreciate politicians creating better conditions to help people start families - such as greater financial support , improved childcare and more part-time jobs created for parents . eighty-nine percent of the respondents said they would prefer flexible working hours for employed parents . increased financial support from the government would help large families and less qualified people . on the other hand , better childcare possibilities would encourage those currently without children and aid families with only one child , as well as highly-qualified working parents and women in eastern germany , researchers reported . the study said women desiring a first child wanted the most support , but also that one-fifth of the women who did not want children could still be encouraged through better family policies . the study also found that families with one child or highly-educated people would most likely choose to have a first or an additional child if family-oriented policies were in place that fit their individual needs . hamm said the study showed that having children is just one of many values among germans ; it is not a top priority .
parents with many children are viewed critically , while " it is completely socially acceptable to not have kids here . " " one 's status does not increase by having kids , " she said . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the challenge of demographic change in old , shriveling europe after decades of ignorance , public awareness of demographic change in europe is growing .

if you ca n't score , go for a foul seems to be the motto of the world cup great stadiums , euphoric fans , a relaxed host country and benevolent weather gods have turned the world cup into a feast .
but the action on the pitch is n't exactly worth cheering about . from a german perspective , it 's easy to forget that the world cup 1990 was considered an absolute low point in world cup history . never before had so few goals -lrb- 2.21 per game -rrb- been scored and so many fouls -lrb- 16 players were sent off during the tournament -rrb- been committed during the world cup as they were in italy . thank god fifa had ordered players in advance to wear shin guards . the secret star of the tournament was guido buchwald , of all people - a defensive player with limited talent from swabia .
the finals fittingly ended in 1-0 .
the winning goal was scored after a controversial penalty kick and two players were shown red cards . heading towards a new negative record with just eight games left to go in the 2006 world cup , the verdict - from a sports point of view - will be pretty sobering . the passionately celebrated soccer fest could end up with a new negative record .
just about 2.36 goals per game were scored in the 56 games that have been played so far and 19 players have already been sent off . it was all meant to be different .
the entire world was hoping to see some strong , attacking soccer .
coaching guru guus hiddink , currently coaching australia , was counting on a virtual goal feast . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cup began with a goal feast with germany 4-2 win over costa rica admittedly , the tournament did get off to a fantastic start .
in a first for the world cup , six goals were scored in the opening game alone .
the same was repeated when argentina systematically dismantled serbia & montenegro 's defense - ironically the same defense that is considered one of the strongest and which allowed just a single goal in the qualification rounds . the orange disappointment but otherwise , it 's been slim pickings at this world cup .
trinidad and tobago did n't manage a single goal in three games , angola and togo just one each .
maybe that 's all that could be expected from these world cup debutants . but even highly-regarded teams failed to deliver when it came to finding the net : the czechs departed with just three goals and the dutch , too , were equally shy about scoring .
they turned out to be the biggest disappointments of the cup . after all , its the dutch who have been the standard-bearers of the beautiful , attacking style of play since the 1974 world cup .
considering that dutch coach marco van basten - considered the best striker of his time - had promised great offensive play from his side , what followed instead was a swan song for all dutch virtues . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dutch were n't at their best against the ivory coast the netherlands may have had their three traditional strikers on the pitch , but too often it looked like the worst of lumbering german soccer in the pre-klinsmann era .
against the ivory coast and argentina , the oranje even committed the ultimate sacrilege possible in the netherlands by blocking and sticking to their half of the field . the dutch 's disgraceful exit in their 1-0 loss to portugal in a game marked by some nasty fouls completed the sad picture .
the four players who were sent off in that notorious game set a new world cup record under the motto " if you do n't find the net , you can at least foul . "
that was the case in 1990 too . special taste in soccer you have to have a special taste in soccer in order to really enjoy what 's on offer in the quarter-finals . england ?
terrible .
it 's almost fitting that captain david beckham threw up on the pitch .
brazil ?
smug to the point of apathy .
ukraine ?
in the world cup because of a lucky draw . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : totti 's last-gasp penalty kick against australia saved the italians ' day portugal ?
made an impact only because of their assaults .
italy ?
wily enough to wiggle their way through even after being shown red , albeit only with a pounding penalty kick in extra time .
france ?
has some of the best strikers in the world with henry and trezeguet - but only allows one to play . there 's no doubt that the 2006 world cup is all about security , efficiency and blocking techniques .
maybe the defensive fest is a poisoned legacy of the 2004 european championships .
several teams played some fantastic offensive soccer there , but greece did n't - and went on to win the tournament thanks to a mysterious quirk of the soccer gods . germany , of all teams and germany , of all teams , seems to have drawn lessons from that .
klinsmann 's attacking tactics really seem to be paying off . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german strikers klose and podolski have been wowing fans in germany and abroad , people are rubbing their eyes in disbelief .
the jubilant chants of the fans after their amazing win over sweden have a ring of truth to them : germany is really the most attractive team of the tournament when it comes to play .
it 's something that has n't been seen in a long time . there 's just one team that 's scored as many goals as germany - argentina .
it 's a pity that one of the two strongest teams in attacking soccer will have to leave after friday 's match , and that both wo n't make it to the finals - an event that marked the 1990 soccer year . the finals ended in 1-0 through an unfair penalty kick - for germany . oliver samson -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de last eight line-up exposes 2002 world cup as a false dawn the 2002 world cup was hailed as a move away from the traditional power bases of international soccer and a new dawn for asian and african teams .

work-life balance gets boost in germany the dumbing down of germany gerd 's family policy gets down to business encouraging germans to have more kids germany -pipe- 29.06.2006 study : men in germany are scared to start families großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany faces problems with low birth rates low birth rates and the ageing population in germany have dominated media in discussions about how to pay for health care and social security .
now , a study says it is men who are primarily responsible for fewer births . in its study , the robert bosch foundation found that " men are scared to start families , " said ingrid hamm , managing director of the foundation .
the study says one in four men in germany do not want children , whereas one in seven women prefer to remain childless .
in eastern germany , that rate is lower , with one in 10 women exopressing the wish to remain childless . the study was based on responses from 10,017 people .
researchers say the survey was representative , even of the smallest groups in germany . men and women in germany also differ on the number of children they would like to have .
men want only an average of 1.59 kids ; the average number of children women would like is 1.75 .
both of these numbers , however , are still higher than germany 's actual average birth rate of 1.37 children per woman . under pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both men and women in germany want more babies than the number being born hamm said another reason for fewer children in germany is that people feel too much pressure .
they have long career training periods and then " have to do everything at once between the ages of 30 and 40 : get married , have kids , build a house , pursue their careers and save money for retirement , " she said . " all that pressure makes people put off having children until later or not at all . " women , too , are faced with a loss of economic control over their lives if they choose a baby break .
for a well-to-do country like germany , the economic loss is even greater , hamm said . she added that , in addition , germans lack faith in the future . " in germany , we have lost a sense that everything will turn out all right .
germans are prone to worrying about the future a lot more than other people , " she said . " german " is not just german , however .
the study found that the wish to forgo having children is much stronger in the former west german states .
in the new german states -lrb- formerly east germany -rrb- , fewer women want to remain childless . " children in the former gdr were everywhere , " hamm said . " mothers and fathers both worked , and east german children grew up with the image that being both parent and employee is possible . " " better policies could boost birth rates " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " large families are frowned upon , " hamm said the survey respondents said they would appreciate politicians creating better conditions to help people start families - such as greater financial support , improved childcare and more part-time jobs created for parents . eighty-nine percent of the respondents said they would prefer flexible working hours for employed parents . increased financial support from the government would help large families and less qualified people . on the other hand , better childcare possibilities would encourage those currently without children and aid families with only one child , as well as highly-qualified working parents and women in eastern germany , researchers reported . the study said women desiring a first child wanted the most support , but also that one-fifth of the women who did not want children could still be encouraged through better family policies . the study also found that families with one child or highly-educated people would most likely choose to have a first or an additional child if family-oriented policies were in place that fit their individual needs . hamm said the study showed that having children is just one of many values among germans ; it is not a top priority .
parents with many children are viewed critically , while " it is completely socially acceptable to not have kids here .

work-life balance gets boost in germany the dumbing down of germany gerd 's family policy gets down to business encouraging germans to have more kids germany -pipe- 29.06.2006 study : men in germany are scared to start families großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany faces problems with low birth rates low birth rates and the ageing population in germany have dominated media in discussions about how to pay for health care and social security .
now , a study says it is men who are primarily responsible for fewer births . in its study , the robert bosch foundation found that " men are scared to start families , " said ingrid hamm , managing director of the foundation .
the study says one in four men in germany do not want children , whereas one in seven women prefer to remain childless .
in eastern germany , that rate is lower , with one in 10 women exopressing the wish to remain childless . the study was based on responses from 10,017 people .
researchers say the survey was representative , even of the smallest groups in germany . men and women in germany also differ on the number of children they would like to have .
men want only an average of 1.59 kids ; the average number of children women would like is 1.75 .
both of these numbers , however , are still higher than germany 's actual average birth rate of 1.37 children per woman . under pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both men and women in germany want more babies than the number being born hamm said another reason for fewer children in germany is that people feel too much pressure .
they have long career training periods and then " have to do everything at once between the ages of 30 and 40 : get married , have kids , build a house , pursue their careers and save money for retirement , " she said . " all that pressure makes people put off having children until later or not at all . " women , too , are faced with a loss of economic control over their lives if they choose a baby break .
for a well-to-do country like germany , the economic loss is even greater , hamm said . she added that , in addition , germans lack faith in the future . " in germany , we have lost a sense that everything will turn out all right .
germans are prone to worrying about the future a lot more than other people , " she said . " german " is not just german , however .
the study found that the wish to forgo having children is much stronger in the former west german states .
in the new german states -lrb- formerly east germany -rrb- , fewer women want to remain childless . " children in the former gdr were everywhere , " hamm said . " mothers and fathers both worked , and east german children grew up with the image that being both parent and employee is possible . " " better policies could boost birth rates " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " large families are frowned upon , " hamm said the survey respondents said they would appreciate politicians creating better conditions to help people start families - such as greater financial support , improved childcare and more part-time jobs created for parents . eighty-nine percent of the respondents said they would prefer flexible working hours for employed parents . increased financial support from the government would help large families and less qualified people . on the other hand , better childcare possibilities would encourage those currently without children and aid families with only one child , as well as highly-qualified working parents and women in eastern germany , researchers reported . the study said women desiring a first child wanted the most support , but also that one-fifth of the women who did not want children could still be encouraged through better family policies . the study also found that families with one child or highly-educated people would most likely choose to have a first or an additional child if family-oriented policies were in place that fit their individual needs . hamm said the study showed that having children is just one of many values among germans ; it is not a top priority .
parents with many children are viewed critically , while " it is completely socially acceptable to not have kids here .

friday 's game could be a case of the best not being saved for last . germany 's soccer reputation lay in shreds for a decade but has been restored virtually overnight under the sunny disposition of jürgen klinsmann , a man whose ubiquitous smile grew to previously-unseen proportions saturday after beating sweden in the round of 16 . now he and the german team are looking forward to their quarter-final match against south american juggernaut argentina .
the sides have met under their current coaches twice already and reached 2-2 splits each time .
on friday , one of them will win the statistical advantage and a place in the semi-finals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann , left , and pekerman took different paths to their coaching spots long , competitive finals history but even before klinsmann took over die mannschaft as the german soccer association 's third choice just one month before jose pekerman succeeded marcelo bielsa , who surprisingly left a solid argentine side , the two nations shared a history of close world cup matches - especially when it came down to the final game . in 1986 , the brilliance of diego maradona , bolstered by his slalom run and goal to finish off an england side bamboozled by the now infamous " hand of god " goal , gave the south americans the one goal they needed to edge past germany 3-2 in the trophy match . klinsmann is sure to remember the last time the two powerhouses met in the cup .
he was on the field in rome for the 1990 final and watched tears well in argentine eyes as they were awarded silver medals before he lifted the cup in a match that saw two south american players sent off . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : argentina 's maradona remembers the win , and the tears that followed four years later players confident of reaching semi-finals the countries also met in group action in 1956 and 1966 and in 2006 both teams are positive going into saturday 's match in the german capital .

daimlerchrysler 's midget smart car will take on the us market in 2008 , with executives hoping the nimble microcar can out-manoeuvre rivals in the land of the mammoth sports utility vehicle . the german-us automaker said wednesday it will launch the car through a partner - a company headed by racing legend roger penske - in early 2008 .
high fuel prices and positive responses from consumers drove the decision . at 2.5 meters long -lrb- 8.2 feet -rrb- and weighing in at a mere 990 kilos -lrb- 2,180 pounds -rrb- , the two-seat smart car is about half the size of a hummer , ford expedition or other large suv . but daimlerchrysler chairman dieter zetsche said the smart - which will be offered in three models in the world 's largest automotive market - can hold its own against us muscle cars .

high fuel prices and positive responses from consumers drove the decision . at 2.5 meters long -lrb- 8.2 feet -rrb- and weighing in at a mere 990 kilos -lrb- 2,180 pounds -rrb- , the two-seat smart car is about half the size of a hummer , ford expedition or other large suv . but daimlerchrysler chairman dieter zetsche said the smart - which will be offered in three models in the world 's largest automotive market - can hold its own against us muscle cars . " times have changed , and urban us streets are becoming increasingly congested , " zetsche told reporters during the announcement . " gas prices are also increasing , and we may never see cheap gas again , " he added . some smart cars are already sold in the us through unofficial resellers , but wednesday 's announcement designates automotive retailer penske 's unitedauto group as the official distributor for the smart in the united states and puerto rico . smart cars have been on european roads since 1998 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some have likened the smart 's appearance to a baby shoe daimlerchrysler officials hope to promote the urban microcar as offering a fun driving experience , and have been able to place the vehicle in movies like " the da vinci code , " where it was used in a chase scene in paris , and the remake of " the pink panther " starring steve martin as inspector clouseau . " the time has never been better for this - and i am convinced that the smart fortwo as an innovative , ecological and agile city car will soon become just as familiar a sight on the streets of new york , miami or seattle as it is today in rome , berlin or paris , " zetsche said . the smart brand , which was launched in 1998 , has been a laggard for the automotive conglomerate , and the decision over whether to launch the brand in the largest auto market was heavily debated . the additional sales volume could help smart meet its target of achieving profitability . zetsche said there was never any doubt over whether smart would enter the us market , pointing out that the next-generation fortwo was always designed to meet the safety and crash regulations established in the united states . the issue that needed to be finalized before the announcement was the distribution plan , which will be handled exclusively by unitedauto , part of a company headed by penske with dealers in 20 states . the distributor said it would select between 30 and 50 dealers in major urban us markets , along with a few select leisure markets . success in canada while expecting to sell the fortwo at less than 15,000 dollars per unit , penske would not comment on volume targets but noted smart 's recent success in canada , where the brand was expected to achieve 1,500 units in its first year but ended up achieving more than 4,000 sales . the smart car would be among the least fuel-hungry cars on the road .
the company says it goes about 90 kilometers -lrb- 56 miles -rrb- per gallon -lrb- 3.8 liters -rrb- .
that translates to consumption of 4.2 liters per 100 kilometers . dw staff / afp -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de daimlerchrysler ceo inclined to launch smart car in us automaker daimlerchrysler is considering whether to introduce its mini " smart " cars onto the american market .

if you ca n't score , go for a foul seems to be the motto of the world cup great stadiums , euphoric fans , a relaxed host country and benevolent weather gods have turned the world cup into a feast .
but the action on the pitch is n't exactly worth cheering about . from a german perspective , it 's easy to forget that the world cup 1990 was considered an absolute low point in world cup history . never before had so few goals -lrb- 2.21 per game -rrb- been scored and so many fouls -lrb- 16 players were sent off during the tournament -rrb- been committed during the world cup as they were in italy . thank god fifa had ordered players in advance to wear shin guards . the secret star of the tournament was guido buchwald , of all people - a defensive player with limited talent from swabia .
the finals fittingly ended in 1-0 .
the winning goal was scored after a controversial penalty kick and two players were shown red cards . heading towards a new negative record with just eight games left to go in the 2006 world cup , the verdict - from a sports point of view - will be pretty sobering . the passionately celebrated soccer fest could end up with a new negative record .
just about 2.36 goals per game were scored in the 56 games that have been played so far and 19 players have already been sent off . it was all meant to be different .
the entire world was hoping to see some strong , attacking soccer .
coaching guru guus hiddink , currently coaching australia , was counting on a virtual goal feast . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cup began with a goal feast with germany 4-2 win over costa rica admittedly , the tournament did get off to a fantastic start .
in a first for the world cup , six goals were scored in the opening game alone .
the same was repeated when argentina systematically dismantled serbia & montenegro 's defense - ironically the same defense that is considered one of the strongest and which allowed just a single goal in the qualification rounds . the orange disappointment but otherwise , it 's been slim pickings at this world cup .
trinidad and tobago did n't manage a single goal in three games , angola and togo just one each .
maybe that 's all that could be expected from these world cup debutants . but even highly-regarded teams failed to deliver when it came to finding the net : the czechs departed with just three goals and the dutch , too , were equally shy about scoring .
they turned out to be the biggest disappointments of the cup . after all , its the dutch who have been the standard-bearers of the beautiful , attacking style of play since the 1974 world cup .
considering that dutch coach marco van basten - considered the best striker of his time - had promised great offensive play from his side , what followed instead was a swan song for all dutch virtues . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dutch were n't at their best against the ivory coast the netherlands may have had their three traditional strikers on the pitch , but too often it looked like the worst of lumbering german soccer in the pre-klinsmann era .
against the ivory coast and argentina , the oranje even committed the ultimate sacrilege possible in the netherlands by blocking and sticking to their half of the field . the dutch 's disgraceful exit in their 1-0 loss to portugal in a game marked by some nasty fouls completed the sad picture .
the four players who were sent off in that notorious game set a new world cup record under the motto " if you do n't find the net , you can at least foul . "
that was the case in 1990 too . special taste in soccer you have to have a special taste in soccer in order to really enjoy what 's on offer in the quarter-finals . england ?

italy ?
wily enough to wiggle their way through even after being shown red , albeit only with a pounding penalty kick in extra time .
france ?
has some of the best strikers in the world with henry and trezeguet - but only allows one to play . there 's no doubt that the 2006 world cup is all about security , efficiency and blocking techniques .
maybe the defensive fest is a poisoned legacy of the 2004 european championships .
several teams played some fantastic offensive soccer there , but greece did n't - and went on to win the tournament thanks to a mysterious quirk of the soccer gods . germany , of all teams and germany , of all teams , seems to have drawn lessons from that .
klinsmann 's attacking tactics really seem to be paying off . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german strikers klose and podolski have been wowing fans in germany and abroad , people are rubbing their eyes in disbelief .
the jubilant chants of the fans after their amazing win over sweden have a ring of truth to them : germany is really the most attractive team of the tournament when it comes to play .
it 's something that has n't been seen in a long time . there 's just one team that 's scored as many goals as germany - argentina .
it 's a pity that one of the two strongest teams in attacking soccer will have to leave after friday 's match , and that both wo n't make it to the finals - an event that marked the 1990 soccer year . the finals ended in 1-0 through an unfair penalty kick - for germany . oliver samson -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de last eight line-up exposes 2002 world cup as a false dawn the 2002 world cup was hailed as a move away from the traditional power bases of international soccer and a new dawn for asian and african teams .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de features -pipe- 29.06.2006 germany vs. argentina continues classic soccer rivalry großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany and argentina have a history of close matches fixed teutonic organization meets heady latin flair : it 's the kind of clash world cup organizers try to fend off for as long as possible .
friday 's game could be a case of the best not being saved for last . germany 's soccer reputation lay in shreds for a decade but has been restored virtually overnight under the sunny disposition of jürgen klinsmann , a man whose ubiquitous smile grew to previously-unseen proportions saturday after beating sweden in the round of 16 . now he and the german team are looking forward to their quarter-final match against south american juggernaut argentina .

work-life balance gets boost in germany the dumbing down of germany gerd 's family policy gets down to business encouraging germans to have more kids germany -pipe- 29.06.2006 study : men in germany are scared to start families großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany faces problems with low birth rates low birth rates and the ageing population in germany have dominated media in discussions about how to pay for health care and social security .
now , a study says it is men who are primarily responsible for fewer births . in its study , the robert bosch foundation found that " men are scared to start families , " said ingrid hamm , managing director of the foundation .
the study says one in four men in germany do not want children , whereas one in seven women prefer to remain childless .
in eastern germany , that rate is lower , with one in 10 women exopressing the wish to remain childless . the study was based on responses from 10,017 people .
researchers say the survey was representative , even of the smallest groups in germany . men and women in germany also differ on the number of children they would like to have .
men want only an average of 1.59 kids ; the average number of children women would like is 1.75 .
both of these numbers , however , are still higher than germany 's actual average birth rate of 1.37 children per woman . under pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both men and women in germany want more babies than the number being born hamm said another reason for fewer children in germany is that people feel too much pressure .
they have long career training periods and then " have to do everything at once between the ages of 30 and 40 : get married , have kids , build a house , pursue their careers and save money for retirement , " she said . " all that pressure makes people put off having children until later or not at all . " women , too , are faced with a loss of economic control over their lives if they choose a baby break .
for a well-to-do country like germany , the economic loss is even greater , hamm said . she added that , in addition , germans lack faith in the future . " in germany , we have lost a sense that everything will turn out all right .
germans are prone to worrying about the future a lot more than other people , " she said . " german " is not just german , however .
the study found that the wish to forgo having children is much stronger in the former west german states .
in the new german states -lrb- formerly east germany -rrb- , fewer women want to remain childless . " children in the former gdr were everywhere , " hamm said . " mothers and fathers both worked , and east german children grew up with the image that being both parent and employee is possible . " " better policies could boost birth rates " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " large families are frowned upon , " hamm said the survey respondents said they would appreciate politicians creating better conditions to help people start families - such as greater financial support , improved childcare and more part-time jobs created for parents . eighty-nine percent of the respondents said they would prefer flexible working hours for employed parents . increased financial support from the government would help large families and less qualified people . on the other hand , better childcare possibilities would encourage those currently without children and aid families with only one child , as well as highly-qualified working parents and women in eastern germany , researchers reported . the study said women desiring a first child wanted the most support , but also that one-fifth of the women who did not want children could still be encouraged through better family policies . the study also found that families with one child or highly-educated people would most likely choose to have a first or an additional child if family-oriented policies were in place that fit their individual needs . hamm said the study showed that having children is just one of many values among germans ; it is not a top priority .
parents with many children are viewed critically , while " it is completely socially acceptable to not have kids here .

work-life balance gets boost in germany the dumbing down of germany gerd 's family policy gets down to business encouraging germans to have more kids germany -pipe- 29.06.2006 study : men in germany are scared to start families großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany faces problems with low birth rates low birth rates and the ageing population in germany have dominated media in discussions about how to pay for health care and social security .
now , a study says it is men who are primarily responsible for fewer births . in its study , the robert bosch foundation found that " men are scared to start families , " said ingrid hamm , managing director of the foundation .
the study says one in four men in germany do not want children , whereas one in seven women prefer to remain childless .
in eastern germany , that rate is lower , with one in 10 women exopressing the wish to remain childless . the study was based on responses from 10,017 people .
researchers say the survey was representative , even of the smallest groups in germany . men and women in germany also differ on the number of children they would like to have .
men want only an average of 1.59 kids ; the average number of children women would like is 1.75 .
both of these numbers , however , are still higher than germany 's actual average birth rate of 1.37 children per woman . under pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both men and women in germany want more babies than the number being born hamm said another reason for fewer children in germany is that people feel too much pressure .
they have long career training periods and then " have to do everything at once between the ages of 30 and 40 : get married , have kids , build a house , pursue their careers and save money for retirement , " she said . " all that pressure makes people put off having children until later or not at all . " women , too , are faced with a loss of economic control over their lives if they choose a baby break .
for a well-to-do country like germany , the economic loss is even greater , hamm said . she added that , in addition , germans lack faith in the future . " in germany , we have lost a sense that everything will turn out all right .
germans are prone to worrying about the future a lot more than other people , " she said . " german " is not just german , however .
the study found that the wish to forgo having children is much stronger in the former west german states .

work-life balance gets boost in germany the dumbing down of germany gerd 's family policy gets down to business encouraging germans to have more kids germany -pipe- 29.06.2006 study : men in germany are scared to start families großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany faces problems with low birth rates low birth rates and the ageing population in germany have dominated media in discussions about how to pay for health care and social security .
now , a study says it is men who are primarily responsible for fewer births . in its study , the robert bosch foundation found that " men are scared to start families , " said ingrid hamm , managing director of the foundation .
the study says one in four men in germany do not want children , whereas one in seven women prefer to remain childless .
in eastern germany , that rate is lower , with one in 10 women exopressing the wish to remain childless . the study was based on responses from 10,017 people .
researchers say the survey was representative , even of the smallest groups in germany . men and women in germany also differ on the number of children they would like to have .
men want only an average of 1.59 kids ; the average number of children women would like is 1.75 .
both of these numbers , however , are still higher than germany 's actual average birth rate of 1.37 children per woman . under pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both men and women in germany want more babies than the number being born hamm said another reason for fewer children in germany is that people feel too much pressure .
they have long career training periods and then " have to do everything at once between the ages of 30 and 40 : get married , have kids , build a house , pursue their careers and save money for retirement , " she said . " all that pressure makes people put off having children until later or not at all . " women , too , are faced with a loss of economic control over their lives if they choose a baby break .
for a well-to-do country like germany , the economic loss is even greater , hamm said . she added that , in addition , germans lack faith in the future . " in germany , we have lost a sense that everything will turn out all right .
germans are prone to worrying about the future a lot more than other people , " she said . " german " is not just german , however .
the study found that the wish to forgo having children is much stronger in the former west german states .
in the new german states -lrb- formerly east germany -rrb- , fewer women want to remain childless . " children in the former gdr were everywhere , " hamm said . " mothers and fathers both worked , and east german children grew up with the image that being both parent and employee is possible . " " better policies could boost birth rates " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " large families are frowned upon , " hamm said the survey respondents said they would appreciate politicians creating better conditions to help people start families - such as greater financial support , improved childcare and more part-time jobs created for parents . eighty-nine percent of the respondents said they would prefer flexible working hours for employed parents . increased financial support from the government would help large families and less qualified people . on the other hand , better childcare possibilities would encourage those currently without children and aid families with only one child , as well as highly-qualified working parents and women in eastern germany , researchers reported . the study said women desiring a first child wanted the most support , but also that one-fifth of the women who did not want children could still be encouraged through better family policies . the study also found that families with one child or highly-educated people would most likely choose to have a first or an additional child if family-oriented policies were in place that fit their individual needs . hamm said the study showed that having children is just one of many values among germans ; it is not a top priority .

even for those who have never experienced one , it 's not hard to visualize the scene .
stories of boozy evenings in england are as much tabloid fodder in the international press as they are in the red tops back home . the binge drinking normally ends with sweaty lads in designer shirts bawling or brawling as the girls battle to keep their dignity covered by micro-minis while simultaneously knocking back alcopops and trying to stay upright . now substitute manchester on a friday night with baden-baden on every night of the week since the england team took up residence there .

many have said they ca n't wait for england to get knocked out so they can all go home . divisions over behavior and as the weeks have passed - during which baden-baden has become known as boring-boring - tensions have grown and splits in the ranks have reportedly occurred within the group , with some tiring of the others ' antics and attitudes . ashley cole 's pop star fiancée cheryl tweedy has become close to posh and dellolio , and wayne rooney 's girlfriend coleen mcloughlin , who brought her own tanning consultant with her , has also sided with them .

friday 's game could be a case of the best not being saved for last . germany 's soccer reputation lay in shreds for a decade but has been restored virtually overnight under the sunny disposition of jürgen klinsmann , a man whose ubiquitous smile grew to previously-unseen proportions saturday after beating sweden in the round of 16 . now he and the german team are looking forward to their quarter-final match against south american juggernaut argentina .
the sides have met under their current coaches twice already and reached 2-2 splits each time .
on friday , one of them will win the statistical advantage and a place in the semi-finals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann , left , and pekerman took different paths to their coaching spots long , competitive finals history but even before klinsmann took over die mannschaft as the german soccer association 's third choice just one month before jose pekerman succeeded marcelo bielsa , who surprisingly left a solid argentine side , the two nations shared a history of close world cup matches - especially when it came down to the final game . in 1986 , the brilliance of diego maradona , bolstered by his slalom run and goal to finish off an england side bamboozled by the now infamous " hand of god " goal , gave the south americans the one goal they needed to edge past germany 3-2 in the trophy match . klinsmann is sure to remember the last time the two powerhouses met in the cup .
he was on the field in rome for the 1990 final and watched tears well in argentine eyes as they were awarded silver medals before he lifted the cup in a match that saw two south american players sent off . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : argentina 's maradona remembers the win , and the tears that followed four years later players confident of reaching semi-finals the countries also met in group action in 1956 and 1966 and in 2006 both teams are positive going into saturday 's match in the german capital .

dw-world : work-life balance gets boost in germany dw-world : the dumbing down of germany dw-world : gerd 's family policy gets down to business dw-world : encouraging germans to have more kids germany -pipe- 29.06.2006 study : men in germany are scared to start families großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany faces problems with low birth rates low birth rates and the ageing population in germany have dominated media in discussions about how to pay for health care and social security .
now , a study says it is men who are primarily responsible for fewer births . in its study , the robert bosch foundation found that " men are scared to start families , " said ingrid hamm , managing director of the foundation .
the study says one in four men in germany do not want children , whereas one in seven women prefer to remain childless .
in eastern germany , that rate is lower , with one in 10 women exopressing the wish to remain childless . the study was based on responses from 10,017 people .
researchers say the survey was representative , even of the smallest groups in germany . men and women in germany also differ on the number of children they would like to have .
men want only an average of 1.59 kids ; the average number of children women would like is 1.75 .
both of these numbers , however , are still higher than germany 's actual average birth rate of 1.37 children per woman . under pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both men and women in germany want more babies than the number being born hamm said another reason for fewer children in germany is that people feel too much pressure .
they have long career training periods and then " have to do everything at once between the ages of 30 and 40 : get married , have kids , build a house , pursue their careers and save money for retirement , " she said . " all that pressure makes people put off having children until later or not at all . " women , too , are faced with a loss of economic control over their lives if they choose a baby break .
for a well-to-do country like germany , the economic loss is even greater , hamm said . she added that , in addition , germans lack faith in the future . " in germany , we have lost a sense that everything will turn out all right .
germans are prone to worrying about the future a lot more than other people , " she said . " german " is not just german , however .
the study found that the wish to forgo having children is much stronger in the former west german states .

dw-world : work-life balance gets boost in germany dw-world : the dumbing down of germany dw-world : gerd 's family policy gets down to business dw-world : encouraging germans to have more kids germany -pipe- 29.06.2006 study : men in germany are scared to start families großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany faces problems with low birth rates low birth rates and the ageing population in germany have dominated media in discussions about how to pay for health care and social security .
now , a study says it is men who are primarily responsible for fewer births . in its study , the robert bosch foundation found that " men are scared to start families , " said ingrid hamm , managing director of the foundation .
the study says one in four men in germany do not want children , whereas one in seven women prefer to remain childless .
in eastern germany , that rate is lower , with one in 10 women exopressing the wish to remain childless . the study was based on responses from 10,017 people .
researchers say the survey was representative , even of the smallest groups in germany . men and women in germany also differ on the number of children they would like to have .
men want only an average of 1.59 kids ; the average number of children women would like is 1.75 .
both of these numbers , however , are still higher than germany 's actual average birth rate of 1.37 children per woman . under pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both men and women in germany want more babies than the number being born hamm said another reason for fewer children in germany is that people feel too much pressure .
they have long career training periods and then " have to do everything at once between the ages of 30 and 40 : get married , have kids , build a house , pursue their careers and save money for retirement , " she said . " all that pressure makes people put off having children until later or not at all . " women , too , are faced with a loss of economic control over their lives if they choose a baby break .
for a well-to-do country like germany , the economic loss is even greater , hamm said . she added that , in addition , germans lack faith in the future . " in germany , we have lost a sense that everything will turn out all right .
germans are prone to worrying about the future a lot more than other people , " she said . " german " is not just german , however .
the study found that the wish to forgo having children is much stronger in the former west german states .
in the new german states -lrb- formerly east germany -rrb- , fewer women want to remain childless . " children in the former gdr were everywhere , " hamm said . " mothers and fathers both worked , and east german children grew up with the image that being both parent and employee is possible . " " better policies could boost birth rates " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " large families are frowned upon , " hamm said the survey respondents said they would appreciate politicians creating better conditions to help people start families - such as greater financial support , improved childcare and more part-time jobs created for parents . eighty-nine percent of the respondents said they would prefer flexible working hours for employed parents . increased financial support from the government would help large families and less qualified people . on the other hand , better childcare possibilities would encourage those currently without children and aid families with only one child , as well as highly-qualified working parents and women in eastern germany , researchers reported . the study said women desiring a first child wanted the most support , but also that one-fifth of the women who did not want children could still be encouraged through better family policies . the study also found that families with one child or highly-educated people would most likely choose to have a first or an additional child if family-oriented policies were in place that fit their individual needs . hamm said the study showed that having children is just one of many values among germans ; it is not a top priority .

it 's all sadly familiar .
england are at a world cup and certain fans are causing chaos .
yet these rowdies sport designer pumps and are blinged to the max . the germans ca n't be blamed for not being ready .
everything that could be done was done .
police forces from both sides of the channel had been liaising for months on the best strategies to employ to minimize the damage . however , while british and german security forces were preparing for the possible influx of english soccer hooligans , no one was prepared for the havoc that the wives and girlfriends -lrb- wags -rrb- of the england players would wreak . imagine , if you dare , a typical night out in a large english city .
even for those who have never experienced one , it 's not hard to visualize the scene .
stories of boozy evenings in england are as much tabloid fodder in the international press as they are in the red tops back home . the binge drinking normally ends with sweaty lads in designer shirts bawling or brawling as the girls battle to keep their dignity covered by micro-minis while simultaneously knocking back alcopops and trying to stay upright . now substitute manchester on a friday night with baden-baden on every night of the week since the england team took up residence there .
also , substitute micro-minis for this year 's must-have hotpants and alcopops for moet & chandon .
welcome to the sideshow which is the wags on tour . wags turn spa town into a never-ending hen night bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baden-baden in more sedate times more used to retired german millionaires shuffling into the spas that it is famous for , the population of baden-baden has been knocked sideways by the arrival of the women and their designer handbags and fake tans . they are staying at the 1450 euro -lrb- $ 1821 -rrb- a night brenner 's park hotel and the paparazzi with their long lenses have followed them . leading the pack is victoria " posh spice " beckham .
at 32 , victoria is the doyen of footballers ' wives having been there and done that . while her appearance in skimpy shorts and massive sunglasses sparked debate about whether she is too thin , she has otherwise maintained a low profile , looking after her three children and cheering on husband david . the other wags have been more conspicuous , competing in the fashion stakes while seeing who can drink and spend the most . normally quiet bars turned into wild west saloons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steve gerrard 's partner alex curran : likes to party , allegedly " they swilled drink , smashed glasses , roared raucous chants and belted out bawdy sing-songs , " yelled the british tabloid daily mirror after some were spotted in one of the few late-night bars here where most of the other customers were reporters . it said they rang up a bill of thousands of pounds after downing bottles of moet champagne followed by glasses of vodka and red bull and shots of sambucca . after drunkenly singing songs in honor of england , things then turned partisan when the wags of the liverpool contingent started singing offensive songs about chelsea and manchester united . while the downtime is becoming notorious , the shopping sprees , meanwhile , have become legendary . mass market german daily bild said six of the wags , including posh and coach sven-goran eriksson 's girlfriend nancy dellolio , spent 80,000 euros in one hour in the town 's luxury boutiques . it said the women blew 4,395 euros in 10 minutes alone on shoes and t-shirts , with the rest going on creations by dolce and gabbana , prada and versace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what 's good for uma is good for the wags " i hope england stays in the competition for a while , " delighted boutique owner monika scholz was quoted as saying .
however , that opinion is not shared by many of the locals who have become increasingly annoyed with the drunken antics of the wags .
many have said they ca n't wait for england to get knocked out so they can all go home . divisions over behavior and as the weeks have passed - during which baden-baden has become known as boring-boring - tensions have grown and splits in the ranks have reportedly occurred within the group , with some tiring of the others ' antics and attitudes . ashley cole 's pop star fiancée cheryl tweedy has become close to posh and dellolio , and wayne rooney 's girlfriend coleen mcloughlin , who brought her own tanning consultant with her , has also sided with them . " victoria 's been in this game for years .
she 's got decorum whereas some of the others could n't even spell the word , " the mirror quoted an " insider " as saying . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i think we lost ' em , babes such has been the sideshow that britain 's " high-brow " media has also waded in , with the sunday times citing a survey by carma , an international media analysis company , on which wag has got the most press coverage .
the winner so far is tweedy , a singer with the group girls aloud . next comes posh , followed by carly zucker , the fitness instructor girlfriend of joe cole .
following her is melanie slade , the student girlfriend of theo walcott , england 's teenage striker who has yet to get a game .
she beat off mcloughlin , and abigail clancy , the squeeze of peter crouch . next up was elen rives , the partner of frank lampard who was prevented from boarding her flight to germany after throwing a tantrum when told she could not take six items of hand luggage with her . and then there are the mads , or mums and dads of the players , who are also here in force . while their behavior has been far more restrained , neville neville -lrb- no , really -rrb- , the father of defender gary , left his mark when he was pictured dancing on a couch at a club with the wags holding a replica world cup . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : soccer wives and the beautiful game their husbands may make a living from playing a game but for the wives of international soccer stars , life is more serious than that .

regulators allege its bp products north america subsidy artificially forced up prices by buying up huge propane stocks only to withhold them from the market .
bp has denied the civil charges and said it intended to defend itself , and added that staff had been dismissed .
on wednesday , a former bp trader , dennis abbott , pleaded guilty to manipulating the propane market .
market practices the charges against bp come as us consumers face increased petrol and heating oil costs caused by a surge in global commodity prices .
the commodity futures trading commission -lrb- cftc -rrb- , which regulates the market , said the propane had been needed to fuel homes in rural areas .
particularly in the north-eastern and mid-western regions of the us , propane is by far the main source of domestic heating - and constitutes a growing slice of household budgets . "
market manipulation did not occur .
we are prepared to make and to prove that case in the courts " bp investigators allege that during february 2004 propane prices jumped more than 40 % to about 90 cents a gallon , a price that " would not otherwise have been reached under normal pressures of supply and demand " .
they claim that bp managed to ramp up the price by buying stocks of propane until it controlled almost 90 % of the domestic market .
" cornering a commodity market is more than a threat to market integrity , " said gregory mocek , the cftc 's enforcement director .
" it is an illegal activity that could have repercussions for commercial market participants as well as retail consumers around this country , " he added .
the cftc estimated that about seven million people were using propane for heating and cooking in 2003 .
bp denial ronnie chappell , a bp spokesman , said " market manipulation did not occur " .
but he added that following an internal investigation , the firm found that several employees failed " to adhere to bp policies governing trading activities " and had been dismissed .
" we have also taken steps to strengthen the supervision of our trading activities , " he added .
the cftc alleges that the market manipulation was carried out " with the knowledge , advice and consent of senior management " at bp products north america .
mr abbott pleaded guilty to charges that he tried to " manipulate and corner the propane market " .
the 34-year-old from houston has agreed to cooperate with authorities in their investigation and faces up to five years in jail and a fine of up to $ 250,000 .

regulators allege its bp products north america subsidy artificially forced up prices by buying up huge propane stocks only to withhold them from the market .
bp has denied the civil charges and said it intended to defend itself , and added that staff had been dismissed .
on wednesday , a former bp trader , dennis abbott , pleaded guilty to manipulating the propane market .
market practices the charges against bp come as us consumers face increased petrol and heating oil costs caused by a surge in global commodity prices .
the commodity futures trading commission -lrb- cftc -rrb- , which regulates the market , said the propane had been needed to fuel homes in rural areas .
particularly in the north-eastern and mid-western regions of the us , propane is by far the main source of domestic heating - and constitutes a growing slice of household budgets .
market manipulation did not occur .
we are prepared to make and to prove that case in the courts bp check bp 's share price investigators allege that during february 2004 propane prices jumped more than 40 % to about 90 cents a gallon , a price that " would not otherwise have been reached under normal pressures of supply and demand " .
they claim that bp managed to ramp up the price by buying stocks of propane until it controlled almost 90 % of the domestic market .
" cornering a commodity market is more than a threat to market integrity , " said gregory mocek , the cftc 's enforcement director .
" it is an illegal activity that could have repercussions for commercial market participants as well as retail consumers around this country , " he added .
the cftc estimated that about seven million people were using propane for heating and cooking in 2003 .
bp denial ronnie chappell , a bp spokesman , said " market manipulation did not occur " .
but he added that following an internal investigation , the firm found that several employees failed " to adhere to bp policies governing trading activities " and had been dismissed .
" we have also taken steps to strengthen the supervision of our trading activities , " he added .
the cftc alleges that the market manipulation was carried out " with the knowledge , advice and consent of senior management " at bp products north america .

exmouth 's trent class lifeboat is currently restricted at low water .
the exmouth station is devon 's busiest rnli station .
last year crews launched 132 times , rescuing 110 people .
the all-weather lifeboat and an inshore boat are both kept at exmouth , but at separate locations .
under the plan a new joint boathouse would be built .
the proposed site is at maer rocks and architects say the building would be of contemporary design and the whole project would cost around £ 1.5m.
plans are due to be submitted later this year and a public appeal launched to help fund the building .

as some of the nigerian community in london prepare to host an international day of prayer in support of lesbian and gay people living in nigeria , do you have a right to be gay ?
the prayer day on 2 july is being held to voice opposition to a government bill introduced earlier this year .
the proposed law bans same-sex marriage , forbids gay people forming associations and criminalises any organisation that works on homosexual issues .
homosexuality is criminalised in the majority of african countries however in south africa , homosexuals are protected under the constitution .
should people have a right to be gay and live their lives in peace ?
or should homosexuality be illegal ?
are you gay ?
what is it like to be a gay african ?
this debate is now closed .
thank you for your comments .
your comments : does everyone know the nightmare it is being homosexual ?
do you really think anyone would choose this preference ?
does anyone know how many times a homosexual has asked him / her self " why did god make me this way ? " - before you say it is un-natural think about the very day you chose to be heterosexual .
mike , new orleans homosexuality is a sign against the holy spirit which can never be forgiven in this life and in the life to come .
it is a direct affront on god .
didacus , dundee , scotland a person that is gay should not have any rights at all !
abdikarin , somalia what should be criminal is corruption , bad governance , red tape and african dictators .
you can be whatever you want to be as long as you do n't harm others .
mesfin , eritrean in oakland a person 's sexual preference is a private matter .
if someone is gay or heterosexual society has no control over the issue .
societies should strive to offer all their citizens equal opportunities independent of sexual preferences , religious believes , political affiliations and ethnic grouping ..
concerned african , washington / us " judge not , so that you will not be judged " homosexuality is a moral crime against god and man .
however , we ca n't hate them , we have to love them , and forbid any violence against them .
nevertheless , we ca n't legalize their marriage , because it does not agree with the institution of marriage .
i ask you , how would you feel if men start giving birth to babies ?
if it sounds right , then gay / lesbian marriage sounds okay .
henry , texas / usa / nigeria yes and yes ! you have a right to be gay but no right to demand respect and acceptance from the non gay community .
think about it- do the gay community ever think about the pain felt by those who love them but hate their adopted lifestyle ? .
richard , kampala / uganda my friend committed suicide last year simply because he was feed up of being attracted to men .
he was born in africa and had never been overseas .
he was a good person , a christian as well .
he got married but the likeness towards men never left him .
can someone explain this ?
i hope africans will grow up someday ; we have to stop being the backward continent .
david lagos , lagos more prominence is being given to pro-gay comments and i guess majority of the anti-gay comments are being censored .
the perverted western world is once again trying to push a perverted agenda in africa .
homosexuality is against the order of nature .
it is not only a sign of mental disorder -lrb- for which the perpetrator should be consigned to a mental home , -rrb- it should be treated as a crime .
ade , lagos times change , we all change in so many ways - justifying prejudice with reference to tradition is ridiculous pantaleo kubirabe , kasese / uganda it 's crazy that so many people are arguing that it 's not ' african ' , or traditional , to be gay .
these are people who are arguing in english , and who frequently refer to the bible .
times change , we all change in so many ways - justifying prejudice with reference to tradition is ridiculous. sky , perth , australia man was created for woman and there is no way we can avoid that without breaking law of nature pantaleo kubirabe , kasese / uganda we are male or female for a purpose of procreation which is the intention of the creator .
it is also a human right which should not be violated .
man was created for woman and there is no way we can avoid that without breaking law of nature .
pantaleo kubirabe , kasese / uganda being gay is something you 're born with and the sooner people in africa and around world realise this the better !
bob hall , guildford , uk i think some of the comments on this subject are unbelievable and sad .
being gay is not a life style choice because who would seriously choose it over being straight ? ? ..
being gay is something you 're born with and the sooner people in africa and around world realise this the better ! ..
a decent education system without religious interference would certainly help this narrow-minded view of gays .
bob hall , guildford , uk it is astonishing how ignorant many people are , especially leaders in africa who are too busy focusing on discrimination rather than solving the many , many problems on their continent that we in the us can hardly imagine .
of course people have a right to be gay , and i do n't care what your culture , community , or religion says .
tom , nj , usa the ratio of women to men in africa is 200 to 90 , then why legalize homosexual relationships since they are more than enough women around for every man ?
henry baba , uyo , nigeria being gay is against nature .
what people decide to do in the privacy of their homes is there business but i do n't think we should set aside special laws for gays .
rita , usa i was born in namibia and found it hard to adjust being a white gay african .
i regard myself as being african .
the homophobia is not just a black african issue and is also very rife amongst the conservative and liberal whites .
i live in uk now with my partner of four years in a happy stable relationship .
the only problem with this is that our partnership would most certainly not be recognised in namibia and my partner would not be allowed to work there .
francois , namibia people -lrb- whether heterosexual , homosexual or asexual -rrb- should exhibit their sexuality -lrb- or lack of it -rrb- within their bedrooms .
by the same token , governments have no business peering into people 's bedrooms .
however , there should be zero tolerance for discrimination when a person 's sexuality becomes public knowledge , for whatever reason .
governments , particularly those in africa , have more pressing problems , eg healthcare and poverty reduction .
akpan , kent , uk / nigeria people have a right to chose whatever they wanted be , but in africa we have a culture .
family name is so important that you strive so much not to tarnish this .
i will say for anybody that wants to be a gay , they have the right , but they should think about their culture and their faith .
babatude adewole , nigeria of course people have a right to be gay .
it is a basic matter of respect for the individual .
those who would stop homosexuality or punish gays , anywhere in the world , are simply evil .
we must not compromise , or allow for cultural relativity .
that would be as bad as compromising with al-qaeda .
richard , london , uk i am an african lesbian .
my sexual orientation is me , how can there be any debate about whether i have a right to be what i am ?
heterosexual africans should wake up to the truth .
chris smith i do n't think people should debate about an issue like homosexuality .
it 's not african at all .
god said that a man will leave his parents and cleave unto his wife , not to another man .
victor owo , eket nigeria we do n't choose to be gay and we should n't have to suffer discrimination and injustice because we are gay .
no matter where in the world we live .
africa should spend more effort -lrb- along with our help -rrb- on feeding and housing its people rather than making laws that vilify some of them .
brendan taggart , bristol , uk why do people have to interfere in the lives of others when they are not harming anyone else ?
it 's not as if you legalise it the whole country will turn gay and stop reproducing if that 's what you 're worried about .
and on the basis of religion , did n't god give us free will , and what right do we have to impose our religious views on others ?
john , leeds being a gay in nigeria is a taboo .
one may lose his or her life if found to be one .
i believe we all have equal rights and ought to have the same treatment .
i am one but i do n't know how it came about .
i think is natural .
there should be laws that back homosexuality in nigeria .
stan , owerri , nigeria of course anyone has a right to be gay .
in my opinion , this right is not any different from the right to live and breath .
as a heterosexual african , i have been dismayed by the attitudes of many africans toward gay people .
we tend to be more hostile toward gays than many western societies .
this is even more shocking in the context of our history of suffering discrimination at the hands of those who considered us " an abomination " .
one would expect us to be more sympathetic and accepting of gay people .
henry , lusaka , zambia the culture of africa forbids same sex marriage .
the fact that it is practised in other continents does not make it right .
africans , let 's respect and defend our culture .
daniel bassah , accra , ghana nature versus nurture arguments aside , there is no earthly reason why anyone should meddle in the issue .
there are no questions of " rights " here ; of course we have the right to be gay .
it is a fact of life and always will be .
tom , chicago , il , usa no such right exists for any person man or woman to be gay / lesbian .
if so , how do mankind reproduce ?
it is clear that a man and man or a woman and woman relationships can not reproduce another human being , why do we belabour the issue ?
clearly , such relationships are against the laws of creation and therefore should be discouraged .
chuka , enugu , nigeria anyone has a right to be gay , lesbian or even bisexual .
it 's based on individual preference .
what bothers me about the whole ordeal is the gay and lesbian community 's eagerness at shoving their adopted lifestyles down our throats .
homosexuality and lesbianism should n't be gathering as much momentum as the media has accorded them .
lara ladejobi , usa the bible says that it is an abomination .
it is a dirty game .
it is dangerous to humankind .
the first time i saw a man kissing another man on tv , i vomited the whole day .
rickie , usa of course i have the right to be gay .
just like i have a right to pick up a sword and kill someone or breathe if i want to .
it is the consequences that follow that i must decide whether or not i want to deal with .
in accra it is difficult for me to justify being gay since our whole society seems to go against it .
kwadwo , accra ghana homosexuality is un-african and should not be encouraged .
serwaa , switzerland i do n't believe sexuality can be chosen by most people .
i think it is mostly innate and set well before puberty .
therefore if people can not " choose " to be straight or gay -lrb- apart from the bisexual anomaly -rrb- , it is wrong to deny people their inbuilt desires .
to deny homosexuality is like to deny immigrants a right to acknowledge their own ethnicity .
justin baidoo-hackman , hatfield , uk it 's incredulous that this question is even asked in this day and age .
despite what many bigots might still feel , asking the question only fuels their ignorant and misdirected ire .
people who discriminate and otherwise marginalize anyone should be given as few opportunities as possible .
ron , nyc homosexuality should not be seen as crime but governments have the right to protect the families at all cost. we do n't want any unfruitful relationship in africa .
uno , london we all have the right to become what we wish to be , provided they conform to the norms of a community .
bad relationship all over the world is the cause of same-sex relationships. it all happens when a united family breaks apart because of lust by a father or mother in a home. when children witness situations like that , they are tempted to believe that relationship with a female or a male is bad .
noah nash , cape coast , ghana e-mail this to a friend printable version current debates can schooling improve ?

as some of the nigerian community in london prepare to host an international day of prayer in support of lesbian and gay people living in nigeria , do you have a right to be gay ?
the prayer day on 2 july is being held to voice opposition to a government bill introduced earlier this year .
the proposed law bans same-sex marriage , forbids gay people forming associations and criminalises any organisation that works on homosexual issues .
homosexuality is criminalised in the majority of african countries however in south africa , homosexuals are protected under the constitution .
should people have a right to be gay and live their lives in peace ?
or should homosexuality be illegal ?
are you gay ?
what is it like to be a gay african ?
this debate is now closed .
thank you for your comments .
your comments : does everyone know the nightmare it is being homosexual ?
do you really think anyone would choose this preference ?
does anyone know how many times a homosexual has asked him / her self " why did god make me this way ? " - before you say it is un-natural think about the very day you chose to be heterosexual .
mike , new orleans homosexuality is a sign against the holy spirit which can never be forgiven in this life and in the life to come .
it is a direct affront on god .
didacus , dundee , scotland a person that is gay should not have any rights at all !
abdikarin , somalia what should be criminal is corruption , bad governance , red tape and african dictators .
you can be whatever you want to be as long as you do n't harm others .
mesfin , eritrean in oakland a person 's sexual preference is a private matter .
if someone is gay or heterosexual society has no control over the issue .
societies should strive to offer all their citizens equal opportunities independent of sexual preferences , religious believes , political affiliations and ethnic grouping ..
concerned african , washington / us " judge not , so that you will not be judged " homosexuality is a moral crime against god and man .
however , we ca n't hate them , we have to love them , and forbid any violence against them .
nevertheless , we ca n't legalize their marriage , because it does not agree with the institution of marriage .
i ask you , how would you feel if men start giving birth to babies ?
if it sounds right , then gay / lesbian marriage sounds okay .
henry , texas / usa / nigeria yes and yes ! you have a right to be gay but no right to demand respect and acceptance from the non gay community .
think about it- do the gay community ever think about the pain felt by those who love them but hate their adopted lifestyle ? .
richard , kampala / uganda my friend committed suicide last year simply because he was feed up of being attracted to men .
he was born in africa and had never been overseas .
he was a good person , a christian as well .
he got married but the likeness towards men never left him .
can someone explain this ?
i hope africans will grow up someday ; we have to stop being the backward continent .
david lagos , lagos more prominence is being given to pro-gay comments and i guess majority of the anti-gay comments are being censored .
the perverted western world is once again trying to push a perverted agenda in africa .
homosexuality is against the order of nature .
it is not only a sign of mental disorder -lrb- for which the perpetrator should be consigned to a mental home , -rrb- it should be treated as a crime .
ade , lagos times change , we all change in so many ways - justifying prejudice with reference to tradition is ridiculous pantaleo kubirabe , kasese / uganda it 's crazy that so many people are arguing that it 's not ' african ' , or traditional , to be gay .
these are people who are arguing in english , and who frequently refer to the bible .
times change , we all change in so many ways - justifying prejudice with reference to tradition is ridiculous. sky , perth , australia man was created for woman and there is no way we can avoid that without breaking law of nature pantaleo kubirabe , kasese / uganda we are male or female for a purpose of procreation which is the intention of the creator .
it is also a human right which should not be violated .
man was created for woman and there is no way we can avoid that without breaking law of nature .
pantaleo kubirabe , kasese / uganda being gay is something you 're born with and the sooner people in africa and around world realise this the better !
bob hall , guildford , uk i think some of the comments on this subject are unbelievable and sad .
being gay is not a life style choice because who would seriously choose it over being straight ? ? ..
being gay is something you 're born with and the sooner people in africa and around world realise this the better ! ..
a decent education system without religious interference would certainly help this narrow-minded view of gays .
bob hall , guildford , uk it is astonishing how ignorant many people are , especially leaders in africa who are too busy focusing on discrimination rather than solving the many , many problems on their continent that we in the us can hardly imagine .
of course people have a right to be gay , and i do n't care what your culture , community , or religion says .
tom , nj , usa the ratio of women to men in africa is 200 to 90 , then why legalize homosexual relationships since they are more than enough women around for every man ?
henry baba , uyo , nigeria being gay is against nature .
what people decide to do in the privacy of their homes is there business but i do n't think we should set aside special laws for gays .
rita , usa i was born in namibia and found it hard to adjust being a white gay african .
i regard myself as being african .
the homophobia is not just a black african issue and is also very rife amongst the conservative and liberal whites .
i live in uk now with my partner of four years in a happy stable relationship .
the only problem with this is that our partnership would most certainly not be recognised in namibia and my partner would not be allowed to work there .
francois , namibia people -lrb- whether heterosexual , homosexual or asexual -rrb- should exhibit their sexuality -lrb- or lack of it -rrb- within their bedrooms .
by the same token , governments have no business peering into people 's bedrooms .
however , there should be zero tolerance for discrimination when a person 's sexuality becomes public knowledge , for whatever reason .
governments , particularly those in africa , have more pressing problems , eg healthcare and poverty reduction .
akpan , kent , uk / nigeria people have a right to chose whatever they wanted be , but in africa we have a culture .
family name is so important that you strive so much not to tarnish this .
i will say for anybody that wants to be a gay , they have the right , but they should think about their culture and their faith .
babatude adewole , nigeria of course people have a right to be gay .
it is a basic matter of respect for the individual .
those who would stop homosexuality or punish gays , anywhere in the world , are simply evil .
we must not compromise , or allow for cultural relativity .
that would be as bad as compromising with al-qaeda .
richard , london , uk i am an african lesbian .
my sexual orientation is me , how can there be any debate about whether i have a right to be what i am ?
heterosexual africans should wake up to the truth .
chris smith i do n't think people should debate about an issue like homosexuality .
it 's not african at all .
god said that a man will leave his parents and cleave unto his wife , not to another man .
victor owo , eket nigeria we do n't choose to be gay and we should n't have to suffer discrimination and injustice because we are gay .
no matter where in the world we live .
africa should spend more effort -lrb- along with our help -rrb- on feeding and housing its people rather than making laws that vilify some of them .
brendan taggart , bristol , uk why do people have to interfere in the lives of others when they are not harming anyone else ?
it 's not as if you legalise it the whole country will turn gay and stop reproducing if that 's what you 're worried about .
and on the basis of religion , did n't god give us free will , and what right do we have to impose our religious views on others ?
john , leeds being a gay in nigeria is a taboo .
one may lose his or her life if found to be one .
i believe we all have equal rights and ought to have the same treatment .
i am one but i do n't know how it came about .
i think is natural .
there should be laws that back homosexuality in nigeria .
stan , owerri , nigeria of course anyone has a right to be gay .
in my opinion , this right is not any different from the right to live and breath .
as a heterosexual african , i have been dismayed by the attitudes of many africans toward gay people .
we tend to be more hostile toward gays than many western societies .
this is even more shocking in the context of our history of suffering discrimination at the hands of those who considered us " an abomination " .
one would expect us to be more sympathetic and accepting of gay people .
henry , lusaka , zambia the culture of africa forbids same sex marriage .
the fact that it is practised in other continents does not make it right .
africans , let 's respect and defend our culture .
daniel bassah , accra , ghana nature versus nurture arguments aside , there is no earthly reason why anyone should meddle in the issue .
there are no questions of " rights " here ; of course we have the right to be gay .
it is a fact of life and always will be .
tom , chicago , il , usa no such right exists for any person man or woman to be gay / lesbian .
if so , how do mankind reproduce ?
it is clear that a man and man or a woman and woman relationships can not reproduce another human being , why do we belabour the issue ?
clearly , such relationships are against the laws of creation and therefore should be discouraged .
chuka , enugu , nigeria anyone has a right to be gay , lesbian or even bisexual .
it 's based on individual preference .
what bothers me about the whole ordeal is the gay and lesbian community 's eagerness at shoving their adopted lifestyles down our throats .
homosexuality and lesbianism should n't be gathering as much momentum as the media has accorded them .
lara ladejobi , usa the bible says that it is an abomination .
it is a dirty game .
it is dangerous to humankind .
the first time i saw a man kissing another man on tv , i vomited the whole day .
rickie , usa of course i have the right to be gay .
just like i have a right to pick up a sword and kill someone or breathe if i want to .
it is the consequences that follow that i must decide whether or not i want to deal with .
in accra it is difficult for me to justify being gay since our whole society seems to go against it .
kwadwo , accra ghana homosexuality is un-african and should not be encouraged .
serwaa , switzerland i do n't believe sexuality can be chosen by most people .
i think it is mostly innate and set well before puberty .
therefore if people can not " choose " to be straight or gay -lrb- apart from the bisexual anomaly -rrb- , it is wrong to deny people their inbuilt desires .
to deny homosexuality is like to deny immigrants a right to acknowledge their own ethnicity .
justin baidoo-hackman , hatfield , uk it 's incredulous that this question is even asked in this day and age .
despite what many bigots might still feel , asking the question only fuels their ignorant and misdirected ire .
people who discriminate and otherwise marginalize anyone should be given as few opportunities as possible .
ron , nyc homosexuality should not be seen as crime but governments have the right to protect the families at all cost. we do n't want any unfruitful relationship in africa .
uno , london we all have the right to become what we wish to be , provided they conform to the norms of a community .
bad relationship all over the world is the cause of same-sex relationships. it all happens when a united family breaks apart because of lust by a father or mother in a home. when children witness situations like that , they are tempted to believe that relationship with a female or a male is bad .
noah nash , cape coast , ghana e-mail this to a friend printable version current debates can schooling improve ?
how can the level be raised ?
do children get decent schooling ?
previous debates are you ever too old for school ?
do international tribunals work ?
your perspective nigerian : ' i will stay at home ' in pictures : a child 's view of war in pictures : taylor trial views listen to the programme tuesday -lrb- real -rrb- wednesday -lrb- real -rrb- thursday -lrb- real -rrb- need help listening ?

times change , we all change in so many ways - justifying prejudice with reference to tradition is ridiculous. sky , perth , australia man was created for woman and there is no way we can avoid that without breaking law of nature pantaleo kubirabe , kasese / uganda we are male or female for a purpose of procreation which is the intention of the creator .
it is also a human right which should not be violated .
man was created for woman and there is no way we can avoid that without breaking law of nature .
pantaleo kubirabe , kasese / uganda being gay is something you 're born with and the sooner people in africa and around world realise this the better !
bob hall , guildford , uk i think some of the comments on this subject are unbelievable and sad .
being gay is not a life style choice because who would seriously choose it over being straight ? ? ..
being gay is something you 're born with and the sooner people in africa and around world realise this the better ! ..
a decent education system without religious interference would certainly help this narrow-minded view of gays .
bob hall , guildford , uk it is astonishing how ignorant many people are , especially leaders in africa who are too busy focusing on discrimination rather than solving the many , many problems on their continent that we in the us can hardly imagine .
of course people have a right to be gay , and i do n't care what your culture , community , or religion says .
tom , nj , usa the ratio of women to men in africa is 200 to 90 , then why legalize homosexual relationships since they are more than enough women around for every man ?
henry baba , uyo , nigeria being gay is against nature .
what people decide to do in the privacy of their homes is there business but i do n't think we should set aside special laws for gays .
rita , usa i was born in namibia and found it hard to adjust being a white gay african .
i regard myself as being african .
the homophobia is not just a black african issue and is also very rife amongst the conservative and liberal whites .
i live in uk now with my partner of four years in a happy stable relationship .
the only problem with this is that our partnership would most certainly not be recognised in namibia and my partner would not be allowed to work there .
francois , namibia people -lrb- whether heterosexual , homosexual or asexual -rrb- should exhibit their sexuality -lrb- or lack of it -rrb- within their bedrooms .
by the same token , governments have no business peering into people 's bedrooms .
however , there should be zero tolerance for discrimination when a person 's sexuality becomes public knowledge , for whatever reason .
governments , particularly those in africa , have more pressing problems , eg healthcare and poverty reduction .
akpan , kent , uk / nigeria people have a right to chose whatever they wanted be , but in africa we have a culture .
family name is so important that you strive so much not to tarnish this .
i will say for anybody that wants to be a gay , they have the right , but they should think about their culture and their faith .
babatude adewole , nigeria of course people have a right to be gay .
it is a basic matter of respect for the individual .
those who would stop homosexuality or punish gays , anywhere in the world , are simply evil .
we must not compromise , or allow for cultural relativity .
that would be as bad as compromising with al-qaeda .
richard , london , uk i am an african lesbian .
my sexual orientation is me , how can there be any debate about whether i have a right to be what i am ?
heterosexual africans should wake up to the truth .
chris smith i do n't think people should debate about an issue like homosexuality .
it 's not african at all .
god said that a man will leave his parents and cleave unto his wife , not to another man .
victor owo , eket nigeria we do n't choose to be gay and we should n't have to suffer discrimination and injustice because we are gay .
no matter where in the world we live .
africa should spend more effort -lrb- along with our help -rrb- on feeding and housing its people rather than making laws that vilify some of them .
brendan taggart , bristol , uk why do people have to interfere in the lives of others when they are not harming anyone else ?
it 's not as if you legalise it the whole country will turn gay and stop reproducing if that 's what you 're worried about .
and on the basis of religion , did n't god give us free will , and what right do we have to impose our religious views on others ?
john , leeds being a gay in nigeria is a taboo .
one may lose his or her life if found to be one .
i believe we all have equal rights and ought to have the same treatment .
i am one but i do n't know how it came about .
i think is natural .
there should be laws that back homosexuality in nigeria .
stan , owerri , nigeria of course anyone has a right to be gay .
in my opinion , this right is not any different from the right to live and breath .
as a heterosexual african , i have been dismayed by the attitudes of many africans toward gay people .
we tend to be more hostile toward gays than many western societies .
this is even more shocking in the context of our history of suffering discrimination at the hands of those who considered us " an abomination " .
one would expect us to be more sympathetic and accepting of gay people .
henry , lusaka , zambia the culture of africa forbids same sex marriage .
the fact that it is practised in other continents does not make it right .
africans , let 's respect and defend our culture .
daniel bassah , accra , ghana nature versus nurture arguments aside , there is no earthly reason why anyone should meddle in the issue .
there are no questions of " rights " here ; of course we have the right to be gay .
it is a fact of life and always will be .
tom , chicago , il , usa no such right exists for any person man or woman to be gay / lesbian .
if so , how do mankind reproduce ?
it is clear that a man and man or a woman and woman relationships can not reproduce another human being , why do we belabour the issue ?
clearly , such relationships are against the laws of creation and therefore should be discouraged .
chuka , enugu , nigeria anyone has a right to be gay , lesbian or even bisexual .
it 's based on individual preference .
what bothers me about the whole ordeal is the gay and lesbian community 's eagerness at shoving their adopted lifestyles down our throats .
homosexuality and lesbianism should n't be gathering as much momentum as the media has accorded them .
lara ladejobi , usa the bible says that it is an abomination .
it is a dirty game .
it is dangerous to humankind .
the first time i saw a man kissing another man on tv , i vomited the whole day .
rickie , usa of course i have the right to be gay .
just like i have a right to pick up a sword and kill someone or breathe if i want to .
it is the consequences that follow that i must decide whether or not i want to deal with .
in accra it is difficult for me to justify being gay since our whole society seems to go against it .
kwadwo , accra ghana homosexuality is un-african and should not be encouraged .
serwaa , switzerland i do n't believe sexuality can be chosen by most people .
i think it is mostly innate and set well before puberty .
therefore if people can not " choose " to be straight or gay -lrb- apart from the bisexual anomaly -rrb- , it is wrong to deny people their inbuilt desires .
to deny homosexuality is like to deny immigrants a right to acknowledge their own ethnicity .
justin baidoo-hackman , hatfield , uk it 's incredulous that this question is even asked in this day and age .
despite what many bigots might still feel , asking the question only fuels their ignorant and misdirected ire .
people who discriminate and otherwise marginalize anyone should be given as few opportunities as possible .
ron , nyc homosexuality should not be seen as crime but governments have the right to protect the families at all cost. we do n't want any unfruitful relationship in africa .
uno , london we all have the right to become what we wish to be , provided they conform to the norms of a community .
bad relationship all over the world is the cause of same-sex relationships. it all happens when a united family breaks apart because of lust by a father or mother in a home. when children witness situations like that , they are tempted to believe that relationship with a female or a male is bad .
noah nash , cape coast , ghana e-mail this to a friend printable version current debates can schooling improve ?
how can the level be raised ?
do children get decent schooling ?
previous debates are you ever too old for school ?
do international tribunals work ?
your perspective nigerian : ' i will stay at home ' in pictures : a child 's view of war in pictures : taylor trial views listen to the programme tuesday -lrb- real -rrb- wednesday -lrb- real -rrb- thursday -lrb- real -rrb- need help listening ?

some are paying up to £ 600 for fake documents which they use in visa applications to extend their stay in the uk , the ten o 'clock news reported .
it filmed people selling documents to immigrants who had indicated they had no intention of studying in the uk .
the home office plans a more rigorous system of registering colleges .
it believes more than half of 83 registered language colleges it inspected recently should be shut down .
the home office will grant a student visa only if the applicant is studying at a registered school .
investigation pledged officials said a register of education providers was introduced last january .
and in the future it will be made mandatory for colleges to make it compulsory to report students who do not attend classes regularly .
but the association of colleges - which represents the mainstream further education sector - said it had repeatedly warned the home office throughout last year that its failure to tighten the rules for inclusion on its official register of language schools would allow many such colleges to abuse the system .
the bbc investigation found cases of people paying £ 300 to £ 600 for documents , such as false attendance records , suggesting they were studying at certain colleges .
it is estimated that up to 50,000 students could be using such scams to stay in the uk illegally .
one of the language schools involved in the bbc investigation said it would investigate the allegations and discipline anyone found to be in contravention of its rules .
in one highlighted case , £ 350 was paid for papers saying an applicant had completed an eight-week course despite her making it clear she had no intention of studying .
a man connected with a different centre offered to arrange a visa for £ 300 without the need to attend the school .
scratching the surface ?
in another example , a man came to the uk on a student visa and extended it twice without going to any classes and is now working in the building trade .
" when my visa expired , i found out from some friends of mine that you could get it extended , " he told the bbc .
" so i paid £ 600 for a one-year college course . "
industry body english uk believes around 10 % of registered centres may be breaking the rules .
immigration officials have told the bbc they are determined to crack down on rogue elements connected to language schools .
the conservatives have called for urgent action to be taken .
they said the findings highlighted the crisis within the immigration service and suggested they could merely have scratched the surface of the problem .

some are paying up to £ 600 for fake documents which they use in visa applications to extend their stay in the uk , the ten o 'clock news reported .
it filmed people selling documents to immigrants who had indicated they had no intention of studying in the uk .
the home office plans a more rigorous system of registering colleges .
it believes more than half of 83 registered language colleges it inspected recently should be shut down .
the home office will grant a student visa only if the applicant is studying at a registered school .
investigation pledged officials said a register of education providers was introduced last january .
and in the future it will be made mandatory for colleges to make it compulsory to report students who do not attend classes regularly .
but the association of colleges - which represents the mainstream further education sector - said it had repeatedly warned the home office throughout last year that its failure to tighten the rules for inclusion on its official register of language schools would allow many such colleges to abuse the system .
the bbc investigation found cases of people paying £ 300 to £ 600 for documents , such as false attendance records , suggesting they were studying at certain colleges .
it is estimated that up to 50,000 students could be using such scams to stay in the uk illegally .
one of the language schools involved in the bbc investigation said it would investigate the allegations and discipline anyone found to be in contravention of its rules .
in one highlighted case , £ 350 was paid for papers saying an applicant had completed an eight-week course despite her making it clear she had no intention of studying .
a man connected with a different centre offered to arrange a visa for £ 300 without the need to attend the school .
scratching the surface ?
in another example , a man came to the uk on a student visa and extended it twice without going to any classes and is now working in the building trade .
" when my visa expired , i found out from some friends of mine that you could get it extended , " he told the bbc .
" so i paid £ 600 for a one-year college course . "
industry body english uk believes around 10 % of registered centres may be breaking the rules .
immigration officials have told the bbc they are determined to crack down on rogue elements connected to language schools .
the conservatives have called for urgent action to be taken .
they said the findings highlighted the crisis within the immigration service and suggested they could merely have scratched the surface of the problem .
