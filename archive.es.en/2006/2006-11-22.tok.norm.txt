the case was later dropped .
weimer said government officials were simply trying to find out who had passed on the information .
he added that this represented a threat to journalists , who could no longer guarantee the anonymity of their sources . government officials on wednesday meanwhile argued that such protection was not possible . " a journalist can commit a crime if he publishes state secrets that have been divulged by a civil servant , " said lutz diwell , a deputy minister in germany 's department of justice . judges , on the other hand , questioned whether journalists could still be held accountable as accomplices once the secrets had been revealed by government officials . a ruling in the case is not expected until 2007 . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press council celebrates 50 years monday is the 50th anniversary of the german press council , an independent and self-regulating organization which was based on the british press council model .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 22.11.2006 " we ca n't afford to leave kids by the wayside " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " strengthening children 's rights helps in taking action against neglect " the german parliament 's commission for children 's concerns this week discussed including children 's rights in the constitution .
in light of recent cases of deaths due to neglect , it 's becoming a pressing issue . dw-world.de spoke with rudi tarneden , a spokesman for unicef deutschland , the german branch of the united nations children 's fund , about what would change in germany if children 's rights were part of the constitution .
dw-world.de : let 's assume that children 's rights will become part of the constitution at some point .
how would those rights be guaranteed ?
rudi tarneden : this past august , during an event hosted by unicef germany and the deutscher kinderschutzbund -lrb- a german lobby organization for the protection of children -rrb- , chancellor angela merkel said for the first time that she could envision including children 's rights in the constitution .
this fall , family minister ursula von der leyen stressed the need again following the cases of child neglect and killing that have recently come to light .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a growing awareness of children 's rights in germany putting children 's rights in the constitution would strengthen young people 's position in society , especially in terms of new policies being drafted - policies that concern children , but also those that affect immigrants and even issues like urban design to make cities more child-friendly .
it would also mean that youth offices could take legal action more quickly and easily in cases of child neglect .
currently , youth office agents are very reluctant to get involved in a family 's private sphere .
parental rights are more respected than children 's rights .
also , there be would a change of attitude from " raising children is a private , family matter and we 'll get involved only in an emergency " to " children and the raising of them are a social concern whereby both the state and parents bear responsibility . "
yet , in the recent cases of child deaths due to neglect , youth offices knew that at least some of the families were high-risk , but they did n't get involved .
were n't those emergencies ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts warn that child neglect and abuse occur in all levels of society that 's the problem .
those are the cases in which everyone is aware of what 's going on , but no one does anything .
if the state were to get more involved , people in society would take a closer look and take action , and vice versa .
unicef recently published a report that focuses on child abuse in industrialized countries .
for germany , the report shows that on the average , two children die per week as the result of abuse or neglect .
but that 's just the tip of the iceberg - there are plenty of children who manage to live , but who suffer physical and psychological violence as they grow up .
they , of course , are not included in those numbers .
i should make clear that laws will not stop child neglect and abuse , but that new laws could give agencies more possibilities for taking action .
things have improved in the past few decades , but child mortality rates due to neglect are still too high .
if laws ca n't do it all , how can people 's attitudes become more attuned to the needs of children ?
in 2000 , a ban on physical punishment to reprimand children was drafted .
there were major discussions on the issue and whether or not parents should be forbidden to spank or slap their children .
but the fact is that this new law helped to readjust people 's attitudes toward children - namely , that the social norms of respect and grace that adults expect in their dealings with one another should also be expected in behavior towards children .
such laws herald long-term processes in which attitudes toward children gradually change for the better .
one should n't underestimate their psychological effects .
you said adding children 's rights to the constitution will not prevent child abuse .
is n't money also an issue - as budgets for kindergarten care have been drastically cut and employment is high ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all kids need good schools , tarneden said the gap between the rich and the poor is widening dramatically in germany .
more and more children are being socially excluded and are growing up in poverty and in families in which long-term unemployment reigns .
these children do n't have the role models they need because their parents have resigned themselves to dreadful circumstances , or because they ca n't get the training they need , or ca n't attend decent schools .
it 's precisely in the " bad " city districts where good schools should be located .
a crisis is brewing here , and we believe that tackling these problems now should be a priority .
why do you believe the push for improving children 's rights is coming now ?
the ratification of the unicef convention on the rights of the child a decade and a half ago has had effects over time .
also , people in germany are now discussing the social exclusion of children and how children are growing up in poverty .
we 're realizing that we just ca n't afford to leave kids by the wayside .
we see that in all the talks about poor education in this country .
the third reason , of course , is that all the media attention on these horrible cases of child abuse has prompted politicians to say that action needs to be taken to make germany a more hospitable place for children .
what do you mean exactly by " we 're realizing we ca n't afford to leave children by the wayside . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one in 10 german students leave school without a degree right now , 10 percent of each class of school kids quits before receiving a degree .
that translates into tens of thousands of young people each year .
what are they going to do later ?
how are they going to live ?
we 're living on borrowed time .
not only does that mean major problems for the kids themselves in finding a job , but it presents a huge problem for society as a whole .
would there be a list of requirements to ensure that children are being protected ?
who would keep track of upholding the law should children 's rights be enshrined in the constitution by 2009 , as some expect ?
that 's the big question right now and the major issue that must be discussed .
should there be some sort of agency in each german state to oversee whether children 's rights are being upheld ?
who will report back on the issue ?
how will proposed laws be reviewed as to whether they would help or harm children ?
those are the really exciting questions , but we have n't reached that point yet . louisa schaefer interviewed rudi tarneden send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts shed light on germany 's poverty and welfare woes new studies in germany shed light on the twin problems of growing poverty and a deficit in the child-welfare system that could be related .
experts have spoken out on both issues .
-lrb- 20.10.2006 -rrb- germany plans early warning system to protect children germany 's family minister said an early warning system would go into effect this year to prevent children from being neglected days after the body of two-year-old kevin was found in his father 's freezer in bremen .

22 as she took the reins of an unwieldy " grand coalition " government after an inconclusive general election . the result , a marriage of merkel 's conservative christian union and its chief political rival , the social democrats of her predecessor gerhard schröder , has tested her leadership abilities to the limit . lacking schröder 's natural charisma , the trained physicist has instead relied on meticulous preparation , gentle humor and a modest style to lead europe 's most populous country and biggest economic power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : known for her sober approach to government , merkel will still celebrate her one year anniversary merkel , 52 , even dispensed with the champagne traditionally served when the coalition agreement is signed , pouring mineral water instead in a sign of a new sobriety in german politics after the often flamboyant schröder . she will nevertheless throw a small cocktail party on wednesday evening to thank the cabinet " for the good cooperation and good atmosphere " of the last year , her spokesman ulrich wilhelm said . foreign policy sucesses merkel has racked up her biggest triumphs in foreign policy , kicking off the year with a hard-fought compromise on the european union budget that won her fans across the bloc . she also improved germany 's relationship with the bush administration , which was strained after germany 's refusal to join the us-led coalition in iraq . merkel also altered what was seen as schröder 's too-cozy relations with russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has patched up the relationship with us president george w. bush merkel has made a point of wooing president george w. bush and vladimir putin while taking each to task for human rights violations in guantanamo bay and chechnya - stances that have won cheers at home . military missions to monitor the first elections in four decades in the democratic republic of congo and an unprecedented postwar foray into the middle east to halt the flow of arms to hezbollah in lebanon have boosted germany 's stature . and with germany set to take over the presidencies of the group of eight most industrialized nations and the european union on jan .
1 , merkel will find herself under the most intense scrutiny of her career . merkel less popular at home yet at home , surveys show only a third of the country supports merkel 's conservatives , their lowest score since 2000 and the first time that a sitting chancellor has failed to score popularity points from an economic upturn . after initial euphoria , the public has expressed frustration with merkel 's slowly-but-surely " policy of small steps " in which she turns her microscope on each reform issue - health care , pensions , taxes - with hair-splitting intensity . " there is disappointment everywhere that this coalition has not used its large majorities in the lower and upper houses of parliament to perform great deeds , " the conservative daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung said this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sales tax increase from 16 to 19 percent is unpopular in germany beyond this tentative approach , germans are also wary about the resilience of the nascent economic recovery after four years of double-digit unemployment rates . a planned hike in value-added tax in january will make consumer goods more expensive across the board and potentially snuff out the economic upswing . and a growing gap between rich and poor has soured the mood and damaged the credibility of the major parties . dw staff / afp -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel emerges tested but unbowed after first year in office german chancellor angela merkel has had a trying first year in charge , holding together a fractious coalition government , presiding over a fall in unemployment and thawing relations with washington .

22 as she took the reins of an unwieldy " grand coalition " government after an inconclusive general election . the result , a marriage of merkel 's conservative christian union and its chief political rival , the social democrats of her predecessor gerhard schröder , has tested her leadership abilities to the limit . lacking schröder 's natural charisma , the trained physicist has instead relied on meticulous preparation , gentle humor and a modest style to lead europe 's most populous country and biggest economic power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : known for her sober approach to government , merkel will still celebrate her one year anniversary merkel , 52 , even dispensed with the champagne traditionally served when the coalition agreement is signed , pouring mineral water instead in a sign of a new sobriety in german politics after the often flamboyant schröder . she will nevertheless throw a small cocktail party on wednesday evening to thank the cabinet " for the good cooperation and good atmosphere " of the last year , her spokesman ulrich wilhelm said . foreign policy sucesses merkel has racked up her biggest triumphs in foreign policy , kicking off the year with a hard-fought compromise on the european union budget that won her fans across the bloc . she also improved germany 's relationship with the bush administration , which was strained after germany 's refusal to join the us-led coalition in iraq . merkel also altered what was seen as schröder 's too-cozy relations with russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has patched up the relationship with us president george w. bush merkel has made a point of wooing president george w. bush and vladimir putin while taking each to task for human rights violations in guantanamo bay and chechnya - stances that have won cheers at home . military missions to monitor the first elections in four decades in the democratic republic of congo and an unprecedented postwar foray into the middle east to halt the flow of arms to hezbollah in lebanon have boosted germany 's stature . and with germany set to take over the presidencies of the group of eight most industrialized nations and the european union on jan .
1 , merkel will find herself under the most intense scrutiny of her career . merkel less popular at home yet at home , surveys show only a third of the country supports merkel 's conservatives , their lowest score since 2000 and the first time that a sitting chancellor has failed to score popularity points from an economic upturn . after initial euphoria , the public has expressed frustration with merkel 's slowly-but-surely " policy of small steps " in which she turns her microscope on each reform issue - health care , pensions , taxes - with hair-splitting intensity . " there is disappointment everywhere that this coalition has not used its large majorities in the lower and upper houses of parliament to perform great deeds , " the conservative daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung said this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sales tax increase from 16 to 19 percent is unpopular in germany beyond this tentative approach , germans are also wary about the resilience of the nascent economic recovery after four years of double-digit unemployment rates . a planned hike in value-added tax in january will make consumer goods more expensive across the board and potentially snuff out the economic upswing . and a growing gap between rich and poor has soured the mood and damaged the credibility of the major parties . dw staff / afp -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel emerges tested but unbowed after first year in office german chancellor angela merkel has had a trying first year in charge , holding together a fractious coalition government , presiding over a fall in unemployment and thawing relations with washington .

" perceptional spectrum " is one of steinmeier 's favorite phrases and it says a lot about him .
the foreign minister has used his first year in office , first and foremost , to expand his own perceptional spectrum .
while the 50-year-old lawyer previously spent years sitting inside germany 's chancellery as former chancellor gerhard schröder 's chief-of-staff , he took off on a world trip in stages immediately after switching jobs . he visited south america , the arabian peninsula , southeast asia , central asia and north africa - and realized that a purely euro-atlantic approach to foreign policy is no longer sufficient in the 21st century .
the attention steinmeier pays to emerging regions on all five continents expands germany 's world - even if it 's not always clear right away where a common path may lead .
for now , steinmeier is making connections that might come in handy later . his impartiality and his interest in people and topics that he 's unfamiliar with are characteristics that help him in this regard .
his friendly , relaxed way has made him friends abroad and quickly turned him into the most popular politician of the grand coalition at home .
this happened despite his dry and often awkward way of expressing himself .
take " perceptional spectrum " as an example . his first year in office was also an educational year for steinmeier .
three kidnappings - two in iraq and one in yemen - put the top diplomat and his colleagues to the test .
all three had happy endings , largely due to his level-headed crisis management . the troubled german-american relationship was another construction site for the new government of social and christian democrats .
the chancellor took on this issue herself and steinmeier flanked her .
in general , merkel , a christian democrat , and steinmeier , a social democrat , work surprisingly well together . steinmeier heads to the middle east or holds talks about the iranian nuclear program , providing for continuity in german foreign policy by doing so .
merkel on the other hand deals with her mighty counterparts in washington and moscow and makes adjustments to the foreign policy standpoints of her predecessor .
schröder 's confidante steinmeier no longer has to bear responsibility for this . but he will not be able to evade testimony in front of the parliamentary inquiry in the el masri case in which a lebanese-born german claims to have been kidnapped by cia agents and tortured , as he played a crucial role in his capacity as head of the german chancellery . but what 's steinmeier 's strategy ?
he 's more concerned about energy policy than his predecessor as he thinks that long-term security of energy supplies is a central foreign policy issue .
foreign trade policy is naturally also part of his job and he wants to expand contacts with " key regions of the future " that he 's already visited . beyond that , however , it 's hard to see a holistic strategic concept .
questions of the day dominate steinmeier 's agenda too often and he remains vague and lacks differentiation with his politeness .
still , his foreign policy is solid , reliable and good overall . nina werkhäuser is dw-radio 's foreign affairs correspondent in berlin -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's new face abroad frank-walter steinmeier , a close ally of outgoing chancellor schröder , is set to be germany 's new foreign minister .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 22.11.2006 " we ca n't afford to leave kids by the wayside " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " strengthening children 's rights helps in taking action against neglect " the german parliament 's commission for children 's concerns this week discussed including children 's rights in the constitution .
in light of recent cases of deaths due to neglect , it 's becoming a pressing issue . dw-world.de spoke with rudi tarneden , a spokesman for unicef deutschland , the german branch of the united nations children 's fund , about what would change in germany if children 's rights were part of the constitution .
dw-world.de : let 's assume that children 's rights will become part of the constitution at some point .
how would those rights be guaranteed ?
rudi tarneden : this past august , during an event hosted by unicef germany and the deutscher kinderschutzbund -lrb- a german lobby organization for the protection of children -rrb- , chancellor angela merkel said for the first time that she could envision including children 's rights in the constitution .
this fall , family minister ursula von der leyen stressed the need again following the cases of child neglect and killing that have recently come to light .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a growing awareness of children 's rights in germany putting children 's rights in the constitution would strengthen young people 's position in society , especially in terms of new policies being drafted - policies that concern children , but also those that affect immigrants and even issues like urban design to make cities more child-friendly .
it would also mean that youth offices could take legal action more quickly and easily in cases of child neglect .
currently , youth office agents are very reluctant to get involved in a family 's private sphere .
parental rights are more respected than children 's rights .
also , there be would a change of attitude from " raising children is a private , family matter and we 'll get involved only in an emergency " to " children and the raising of them are a social concern whereby both the state and parents bear responsibility . "
yet , in the recent cases of child deaths due to neglect , youth offices knew that at least some of the families were high-risk , but they did n't get involved .
were n't those emergencies ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts warn that child neglect and abuse occur in all levels of society that 's the problem .
those are the cases in which everyone is aware of what 's going on , but no one does anything .
if the state were to get more involved , people in society would take a closer look and take action , and vice versa .
unicef recently published a report that focuses on child abuse in industrialized countries .
for germany , the report shows that on the average , two children die per week as the result of abuse or neglect .
but that 's just the tip of the iceberg - there are plenty of children who manage to live , but who suffer physical and psychological violence as they grow up .
they , of course , are not included in those numbers .
i should make clear that laws will not stop child neglect and abuse , but that new laws could give agencies more possibilities for taking action .
things have improved in the past few decades , but child mortality rates due to neglect are still too high .
if laws ca n't do it all , how can people 's attitudes become more attuned to the needs of children ?
in 2000 , a ban on physical punishment to reprimand children was drafted .
there were major discussions on the issue and whether or not parents should be forbidden to spank or slap their children .
but the fact is that this new law helped to readjust people 's attitudes toward children - namely , that the social norms of respect and grace that adults expect in their dealings with one another should also be expected in behavior towards children .
such laws herald long-term processes in which attitudes toward children gradually change for the better .
one should n't underestimate their psychological effects .
you said adding children 's rights to the constitution will not prevent child abuse .
is n't money also an issue - as budgets for kindergarten care have been drastically cut and employment is high ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all kids need good schools , tarneden said the gap between the rich and the poor is widening dramatically in germany .
more and more children are being socially excluded and are growing up in poverty and in families in which long-term unemployment reigns .
these children do n't have the role models they need because their parents have resigned themselves to dreadful circumstances , or because they ca n't get the training they need , or ca n't attend decent schools .
it 's precisely in the " bad " city districts where good schools should be located .
a crisis is brewing here , and we believe that tackling these problems now should be a priority .
why do you believe the push for improving children 's rights is coming now ?
the ratification of the unicef convention on the rights of the child a decade and a half ago has had effects over time .
also , people in germany are now discussing the social exclusion of children and how children are growing up in poverty .
we 're realizing that we just ca n't afford to leave kids by the wayside .
we see that in all the talks about poor education in this country .
the third reason , of course , is that all the media attention on these horrible cases of child abuse has prompted politicians to say that action needs to be taken to make germany a more hospitable place for children .
what do you mean exactly by " we 're realizing we ca n't afford to leave children by the wayside . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one in 10 german students leave school without a degree right now , 10 percent of each class of school kids quits before receiving a degree .
that translates into tens of thousands of young people each year .
what are they going to do later ?
how are they going to live ?
we 're living on borrowed time .
not only does that mean major problems for the kids themselves in finding a job , but it presents a huge problem for society as a whole .
would there be a list of requirements to ensure that children are being protected ?
who would keep track of upholding the law should children 's rights be enshrined in the constitution by 2009 , as some expect ?
that 's the big question right now and the major issue that must be discussed .
should there be some sort of agency in each german state to oversee whether children 's rights are being upheld ?
who will report back on the issue ?
how will proposed laws be reviewed as to whether they would help or harm children ?
those are the really exciting questions , but we have n't reached that point yet . louisa schaefer interviewed rudi tarneden send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts shed light on germany 's poverty and welfare woes new studies in germany shed light on the twin problems of growing poverty and a deficit in the child-welfare system that could be related .

but the fact is that this new law helped to readjust people 's attitudes toward children - namely , that the social norms of respect and grace that adults expect in their dealings with one another should also be expected in behavior towards children .
such laws herald long-term processes in which attitudes toward children gradually change for the better .
one should n't underestimate their psychological effects .
you said adding children 's rights to the constitution will not prevent child abuse .
is n't money also an issue - as budgets for kindergarten care have been drastically cut and employment is high ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all kids need good schools , tarneden said the gap between the rich and the poor is widening dramatically in germany .
more and more children are being socially excluded and are growing up in poverty and in families in which long-term unemployment reigns .
these children do n't have the role models they need because their parents have resigned themselves to dreadful circumstances , or because they ca n't get the training they need , or ca n't attend decent schools .
it 's precisely in the " bad " city districts where good schools should be located .
a crisis is brewing here , and we believe that tackling these problems now should be a priority .
why do you believe the push for improving children 's rights is coming now ?
the ratification of the unicef convention on the rights of the child a decade and a half ago has had effects over time .
also , people in germany are now discussing the social exclusion of children and how children are growing up in poverty .
we 're realizing that we just ca n't afford to leave kids by the wayside .
we see that in all the talks about poor education in this country .
the third reason , of course , is that all the media attention on these horrible cases of child abuse has prompted politicians to say that action needs to be taken to make germany a more hospitable place for children .
what do you mean exactly by " we 're realizing we ca n't afford to leave children by the wayside . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one in 10 german students leave school without a degree right now , 10 percent of each class of school kids quits before receiving a degree .
that translates into tens of thousands of young people each year .
what are they going to do later ?
how are they going to live ?
we 're living on borrowed time .
not only does that mean major problems for the kids themselves in finding a job , but it presents a huge problem for society as a whole .
would there be a list of requirements to ensure that children are being protected ?
who would keep track of upholding the law should children 's rights be enshrined in the constitution by 2009 , as some expect ?
that 's the big question right now and the major issue that must be discussed .
should there be some sort of agency in each german state to oversee whether children 's rights are being upheld ?
who will report back on the issue ?
how will proposed laws be reviewed as to whether they would help or harm children ?
those are the really exciting questions , but we have n't reached that point yet . louisa schaefer interviewed rudi tarneden send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts shed light on germany 's poverty and welfare woes new studies in germany shed light on the twin problems of growing poverty and a deficit in the child-welfare system that could be related .

in light of recent cases of deaths due to neglect , it 's becoming a pressing issue . dw-world.de spoke with rudi tarneden , a spokesman for unicef deutschland , the german branch of the united nations children 's fund , about what would change in germany if children 's rights were part of the constitution .
dw-world.de : let 's assume that children 's rights will become part of the constitution at some point .
how would those rights be guaranteed ?
rudi tarneden : this past august , during an event hosted by unicef germany and the deutscher kinderschutzbund -lrb- a german lobby organization for the protection of children -rrb- , chancellor angela merkel said for the first time that she could envision including children 's rights in the constitution .
this fall , family minister ursula von der leyen stressed the need again following the cases of child neglect and killing that have recently come to light .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a growing awareness of children 's rights in germany putting children 's rights in the constitution would strengthen young people 's position in society , especially in terms of new policies being drafted - policies that concern children , but also those that affect immigrants and even issues like urban design to make cities more child-friendly .
it would also mean that youth offices could take legal action more quickly and easily in cases of child neglect .
currently , youth office agents are very reluctant to get involved in a family 's private sphere .
parental rights are more respected than children 's rights .
also , there be would a change of attitude from " raising children is a private , family matter and we 'll get involved only in an emergency " to " children and the raising of them are a social concern whereby both the state and parents bear responsibility . "
yet , in the recent cases of child deaths due to neglect , youth offices knew that at least some of the families were high-risk , but they did n't get involved .
were n't those emergencies ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts warn that child neglect and abuse occur in all levels of society that 's the problem .
those are the cases in which everyone is aware of what 's going on , but no one does anything .
if the state were to get more involved , people in society would take a closer look and take action , and vice versa .
unicef recently published a report that focuses on child abuse in industrialized countries .
for germany , the report shows that on the average , two children die per week as the result of abuse or neglect .
but that 's just the tip of the iceberg - there are plenty of children who manage to live , but who suffer physical and psychological violence as they grow up .
they , of course , are not included in those numbers .
i should make clear that laws will not stop child neglect and abuse , but that new laws could give agencies more possibilities for taking action .
things have improved in the past few decades , but child mortality rates due to neglect are still too high .
if laws ca n't do it all , how can people 's attitudes become more attuned to the needs of children ?
in 2000 , a ban on physical punishment to reprimand children was drafted .
there were major discussions on the issue and whether or not parents should be forbidden to spank or slap their children .
but the fact is that this new law helped to readjust people 's attitudes toward children - namely , that the social norms of respect and grace that adults expect in their dealings with one another should also be expected in behavior towards children .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 22.11.2006 " we ca n't afford to leave kids by the wayside " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " strengthening children 's rights helps in taking action against neglect " the german parliament 's commission for children 's concerns this week discussed including children 's rights in the constitution .
in light of recent cases of deaths due to neglect , it 's becoming a pressing issue . dw-world.de spoke with rudi tarneden , a spokesman for unicef deutschland , the german branch of the united nations children 's fund , about what would change in germany if children 's rights were part of the constitution .
dw-world.de : let 's assume that children 's rights will become part of the constitution at some point .
how would those rights be guaranteed ?
rudi tarneden : this past august , during an event hosted by unicef germany and the deutscher kinderschutzbund -lrb- a german lobby organization for the protection of children -rrb- , chancellor angela merkel said for the first time that she could envision including children 's rights in the constitution .
this fall , family minister ursula von der leyen stressed the need again following the cases of child neglect and killing that have recently come to light .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a growing awareness of children 's rights in germany putting children 's rights in the constitution would strengthen young people 's position in society , especially in terms of new policies being drafted - policies that concern children , but also those that affect immigrants and even issues like urban design to make cities more child-friendly .
it would also mean that youth offices could take legal action more quickly and easily in cases of child neglect .
currently , youth office agents are very reluctant to get involved in a family 's private sphere .
parental rights are more respected than children 's rights .
also , there be would a change of attitude from " raising children is a private , family matter and we 'll get involved only in an emergency " to " children and the raising of them are a social concern whereby both the state and parents bear responsibility . "
yet , in the recent cases of child deaths due to neglect , youth offices knew that at least some of the families were high-risk , but they did n't get involved .
were n't those emergencies ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts warn that child neglect and abuse occur in all levels of society that 's the problem .
those are the cases in which everyone is aware of what 's going on , but no one does anything .
if the state were to get more involved , people in society would take a closer look and take action , and vice versa .
unicef recently published a report that focuses on child abuse in industrialized countries .
for germany , the report shows that on the average , two children die per week as the result of abuse or neglect .
but that 's just the tip of the iceberg - there are plenty of children who manage to live , but who suffer physical and psychological violence as they grow up .
they , of course , are not included in those numbers .
i should make clear that laws will not stop child neglect and abuse , but that new laws could give agencies more possibilities for taking action .
things have improved in the past few decades , but child mortality rates due to neglect are still too high .
if laws ca n't do it all , how can people 's attitudes become more attuned to the needs of children ?
in 2000 , a ban on physical punishment to reprimand children was drafted .
there were major discussions on the issue and whether or not parents should be forbidden to spank or slap their children .
but the fact is that this new law helped to readjust people 's attitudes toward children - namely , that the social norms of respect and grace that adults expect in their dealings with one another should also be expected in behavior towards children .
such laws herald long-term processes in which attitudes toward children gradually change for the better .
one should n't underestimate their psychological effects .
you said adding children 's rights to the constitution will not prevent child abuse .
is n't money also an issue - as budgets for kindergarten care have been drastically cut and employment is high ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all kids need good schools , tarneden said the gap between the rich and the poor is widening dramatically in germany .
more and more children are being socially excluded and are growing up in poverty and in families in which long-term unemployment reigns .
these children do n't have the role models they need because their parents have resigned themselves to dreadful circumstances , or because they ca n't get the training they need , or ca n't attend decent schools .
it 's precisely in the " bad " city districts where good schools should be located .
a crisis is brewing here , and we believe that tackling these problems now should be a priority .
why do you believe the push for improving children 's rights is coming now ?
the ratification of the unicef convention on the rights of the child a decade and a half ago has had effects over time .
also , people in germany are now discussing the social exclusion of children and how children are growing up in poverty .
we 're realizing that we just ca n't afford to leave kids by the wayside .
we see that in all the talks about poor education in this country .
the third reason , of course , is that all the media attention on these horrible cases of child abuse has prompted politicians to say that action needs to be taken to make germany a more hospitable place for children .
what do you mean exactly by " we 're realizing we ca n't afford to leave children by the wayside . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one in 10 german students leave school without a degree right now , 10 percent of each class of school kids quits before receiving a degree .
that translates into tens of thousands of young people each year .
what are they going to do later ?
how are they going to live ?
we 're living on borrowed time .
not only does that mean major problems for the kids themselves in finding a job , but it presents a huge problem for society as a whole .
would there be a list of requirements to ensure that children are being protected ?
who would keep track of upholding the law should children 's rights be enshrined in the constitution by 2009 , as some expect ?
that 's the big question right now and the major issue that must be discussed .
should there be some sort of agency in each german state to oversee whether children 's rights are being upheld ?
who will report back on the issue ?
how will proposed laws be reviewed as to whether they would help or harm children ?
those are the really exciting questions , but we have n't reached that point yet . louisa schaefer interviewed rudi tarneden send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts shed light on germany 's poverty and welfare woes new studies in germany shed light on the twin problems of growing poverty and a deficit in the child-welfare system that could be related .

he was handed over to us authorities who took him to guantanamo in january 2002 , saying he was suspected of supporting afghanistan 's former taliban rulers . kurnaz told meps that he went to pakistan to " deepen his -lrb- muslim -rrb- faith " but that he had never done anything illegal .

other guantanamo inmates with turkish citizenship , however , were taken back to turkey , kurnaz claimed . mistreated by germans ? kurnaz also said that german soldiers in afghanistan mistreated him before he was transferred to guantanamo bay .

but there 's at least one thing that 's remained unchanged . let 's face it : even before nov .
22 , 2005 , angela merkel 's life did n't exactly look like that of your average gretel .
as leader of germany 's main opposition party , she had tons of meetings with the more or less mighty .
she just did n't have to pay quite as much attention to hairdos and make-up .
she had to worry less about protocol while walking past soldiers on red carpets .
and , yes , she did n't have to lead a country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sauer -lrb- left -rrb- will join his wife on vacation , but he rarely comes along otherwise that 's all changed a bit over the past 365 days .
she 's now constantly in the limelight .
she 's had her apartment in central berlin retrofitted to comply with security standards worthy of a world leader .
she has even less time for her husband , a chemistry professor named joachim sauer who has decided that he 'd rather focus on his own work than accompany his wife at every occasion . sauer has also decided not to talk about his wife .
the chancellor , on the other hand , apparently feels an obligation to share the odd private insight now and then .
on wednesday , the anniversary of her ascension to the chancellery , merkel did decide to respond to reporters from germany 's bild tabloid , who had asked whether her husband had noted any changes in her . " well , the breakfast that i 'm preparing for us is still the same , " merkel said . munching on pretzels the chancellor still has time to prepare breakfast .
surely there are millions of people with far less responsibility who barely manage to gulp down some coffee before they rush out the door . how does she do it ?
or , what 's even more interesting : what does she serve ?
a traditional german breakfast with meats , cheese , jam and soft-boiled eggs ?
one can only hope that her table looks a little more cheerful than the tupperware-laden arrangement that awaits a certain elizabeth ii in the morning . there 's quite a bit of information on merkel 's favorite dishes .
apparently she enjoys potato soup , roulades , stews and schnitzel , and she makes goose for christmas .
merkel clearly was n't willing to go into the details of her breakfast offerings though . maybe the subject 's a little too touchy for her .
after all , she did concede the conservative candidacy for chancellorship to bavarian premier edmund stoiber over breakfast -lrb- with pretzels -rrb- in 2002 .
a pretty smart move , one could say in hindsight , as stoiber lost the election , making merkel 's bid for the chancellorship possible in the 2005 elections . bildunterschrift : it 's not known whether merkel and stoiber -lrb- right -rrb- also had beer with breakfast in 2002 " i really like breakfast , " she recently told a women 's magazine . no wonder . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de angie admits to bad driving german chancellor angela merkel has been criticized for slamming the brakes on government reform and steering the government in the wrong direction after one year in office .

"
he was released last august . neither the german nor the turkish authorities tried to release him from guantanamo and instead shifted responsibility on to the us government , kurnaz told a special european parliament committee investigating charges of illegal us secret service activities in europe . kurnaz was arrested in pakistan two months after the sept.11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states .
he was handed over to us authorities who took him to guantanamo in january 2002 , saying he was suspected of supporting afghanistan 's former taliban rulers . kurnaz told meps that he went to pakistan to " deepen his -lrb- muslim -rrb- faith " but that he had never done anything illegal . " there is no excuse " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurnaz and docke -lrb- right -rrb- during the hearing but germany rejected a us offer to release kurnaz from guantanamo in october 2002 , with washington saying that there was no case against him , his lawyer said . " there is no excuse for this , " bernhard docke told dw-radio .
" i hope that the european parliament will shed light on this . " back in germany , however , authorities " tried to paint me as a liar , though they had decided to leave me in guantanamo , " kurnaz told parliamentarians . the turkish government also " did n't bother at all about me while i was imprisoned , " he said .
" they thought i was a spy for germany . " turkish officials interrogating him in the camp had told him that it was up to the us to release him , kurnaz said .
other guantanamo inmates with turkish citizenship , however , were taken back to turkey , kurnaz claimed . mistreated by germans ? kurnaz also said that german soldiers in afghanistan mistreated him before he was transferred to guantanamo bay .
us forces had handed him over to two members of the german special forces command , ksk , who had pulled his head back , banged his head on the floor and one stamped on him , kurnaz said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ksk members during a training session in germany " they asked me if i knew who they were and then they said , ' we are the ksk , " ' he said , adding that the men had german flags on their uniforms and spoke german with him .

22 , 2005 , angela merkel 's life did n't exactly look like that of your average gretel .
as leader of germany 's main opposition party , she had tons of meetings with the more or less mighty .
she just did n't have to pay quite as much attention to hairdos and make-up .
she had to worry less about protocol while walking past soldiers on red carpets .

she 's now constantly in the limelight .
she 's had her apartment in central berlin retrofitted to comply with security standards worthy of a world leader .
she has even less time for her husband , a chemistry professor named joachim sauer who has decided that he 'd rather focus on his own work than accompany his wife at every occasion . sauer has also decided not to talk about his wife .
the chancellor , on the other hand , apparently feels an obligation to share the odd private insight now and then .
on wednesday , the anniversary of her ascension to the chancellery , merkel did decide to respond to reporters from germany 's bild tabloid , who had asked whether her husband had noted any changes in her . " well , the breakfast that i 'm preparing for us is still the same , " merkel said . munching on pretzels the chancellor still has time to prepare breakfast .

one can only hope that her table looks a little more cheerful than the tupperware-laden arrangement that awaits a certain elizabeth ii in the morning . there 's quite a bit of information on merkel 's favorite dishes .
apparently she enjoys potato soup , roulades , stews and schnitzel , and she makes goose for christmas .
merkel clearly was n't willing to go into the details of her breakfast offerings though . maybe the subject 's a little too touchy for her .
after all , she did concede the conservative candidacy for chancellorship to bavarian premier edmund stoiber over breakfast -lrb- with pretzels -rrb- in 2002 .

but there 's at least one thing that 's remained unchanged . let 's face it : even before nov .
22 , 2005 , angela merkel 's life did n't exactly look like that of your average gretel .
as leader of germany 's main opposition party , she had tons of meetings with the more or less mighty .
she just did n't have to pay quite as much attention to hairdos and make-up .
she had to worry less about protocol while walking past soldiers on red carpets .
and , yes , she did n't have to lead a country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sauer -lrb- left -rrb- will join his wife on vacation , but he rarely comes along otherwise that 's all changed a bit over the past 365 days .
she 's now constantly in the limelight .
she 's had her apartment in central berlin retrofitted to comply with security standards worthy of a world leader .
she has even less time for her husband , a chemistry professor named joachim sauer who has decided that he 'd rather focus on his own work than accompany his wife at every occasion . sauer has also decided not to talk about his wife .
the chancellor , on the other hand , apparently feels an obligation to share the odd private insight now and then .
on wednesday , the anniversary of her ascension to the chancellery , merkel did decide to respond to reporters from germany 's bild tabloid , who had asked whether her husband had noted any changes in her . " well , the breakfast that i 'm preparing for us is still the same , " merkel said . munching on pretzels the chancellor still has time to prepare breakfast .
surely there are millions of people with far less responsibility who barely manage to gulp down some coffee before they rush out the door . how does she do it ?
or , what 's even more interesting : what does she serve ?
a traditional german breakfast with meats , cheese , jam and soft-boiled eggs ?
one can only hope that her table looks a little more cheerful than the tupperware-laden arrangement that awaits a certain elizabeth ii in the morning . there 's quite a bit of information on merkel 's favorite dishes .
apparently she enjoys potato soup , roulades , stews and schnitzel , and she makes goose for christmas .
merkel clearly was n't willing to go into the details of her breakfast offerings though . maybe the subject 's a little too touchy for her .
after all , she did concede the conservative candidacy for chancellorship to bavarian premier edmund stoiber over breakfast -lrb- with pretzels -rrb- in 2002 .
a pretty smart move , one could say in hindsight , as stoiber lost the election , making merkel 's bid for the chancellorship possible in the 2005 elections . bildunterschrift : it 's not known whether merkel and stoiber -lrb- right -rrb- also had beer with breakfast in 2002 " i really like breakfast , " she recently told a women 's magazine . no wonder . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de angie admits to bad driving german chancellor angela merkel has been criticized for slamming the brakes on government reform and steering the government in the wrong direction after one year in office .

" perceptional spectrum " is one of steinmeier 's favorite phrases and it says a lot about him .
the foreign minister has used his first year in office , first and foremost , to expand his own perceptional spectrum .
while the 50-year-old lawyer previously spent years sitting inside germany 's chancellery as former chancellor gerhard schröder 's chief-of-staff , he took off on a world trip in stages immediately after switching jobs . he visited south america , the arabian peninsula , southeast asia , central asia and north africa - and realized that a purely euro-atlantic approach to foreign policy is no longer sufficient in the 21st century .
the attention steinmeier pays to emerging regions on all five continents expands germany 's world - even if it 's not always clear right away where a common path may lead .
for now , steinmeier is making connections that might come in handy later . his impartiality and his interest in people and topics that he 's unfamiliar with are characteristics that help him in this regard .
his friendly , relaxed way has made him friends abroad and quickly turned him into the most popular politician of the grand coalition at home .
this happened despite his dry and often awkward way of expressing himself .
take " perceptional spectrum " as an example . his first year in office was also an educational year for steinmeier .
three kidnappings - two in iraq and one in yemen - put the top diplomat and his colleagues to the test .
all three had happy endings , largely due to his level-headed crisis management . the troubled german-american relationship was another construction site for the new government of social and christian democrats .
the chancellor took on this issue herself and steinmeier flanked her .
in general , merkel , a christian democrat , and steinmeier , a social democrat , work surprisingly well together . steinmeier heads to the middle east or holds talks about the iranian nuclear program , providing for continuity in german foreign policy by doing so .
merkel on the other hand deals with her mighty counterparts in washington and moscow and makes adjustments to the foreign policy standpoints of her predecessor .
schröder 's confidante steinmeier no longer has to bear responsibility for this . but he will not be able to evade testimony in front of the parliamentary inquiry in the el masri case in which a lebanese-born german claims to have been kidnapped by cia agents and tortured , as he played a crucial role in his capacity as head of the german chancellery . but what 's steinmeier 's strategy ?
he 's more concerned about energy policy than his predecessor as he thinks that long-term security of energy supplies is a central foreign policy issue .
foreign trade policy is naturally also part of his job and he wants to expand contacts with " key regions of the future " that he 's already visited . beyond that , however , it 's hard to see a holistic strategic concept .

the attention steinmeier pays to emerging regions on all five continents expands germany 's world - even if it 's not always clear right away where a common path may lead .
for now , steinmeier is making connections that might come in handy later . his impartiality and his interest in people and topics that he 's unfamiliar with are characteristics that help him in this regard .

the chancellor took on this issue herself and steinmeier flanked her .
in general , merkel , a christian democrat , and steinmeier , a social democrat , work surprisingly well together . steinmeier heads to the middle east or holds talks about the iranian nuclear program , providing for continuity in german foreign policy by doing so .
merkel on the other hand deals with her mighty counterparts in washington and moscow and makes adjustments to the foreign policy standpoints of her predecessor .
schröder 's confidante steinmeier no longer has to bear responsibility for this . but he will not be able to evade testimony in front of the parliamentary inquiry in the el masri case in which a lebanese-born german claims to have been kidnapped by cia agents and tortured , as he played a crucial role in his capacity as head of the german chancellery . but what 's steinmeier 's strategy ?

" perceptional spectrum " is one of steinmeier 's favorite phrases and it says a lot about him .
the foreign minister has used his first year in office , first and foremost , to expand his own perceptional spectrum .
while the 50-year-old lawyer previously spent years sitting inside germany 's chancellery as former chancellor gerhard schröder 's chief-of-staff , he took off on a world trip in stages immediately after switching jobs . he visited south america , the arabian peninsula , southeast asia , central asia and north africa - and realized that a purely euro-atlantic approach to foreign policy is no longer sufficient in the 21st century .
the attention steinmeier pays to emerging regions on all five continents expands germany 's world - even if it 's not always clear right away where a common path may lead .
for now , steinmeier is making connections that might come in handy later . his impartiality and his interest in people and topics that he 's unfamiliar with are characteristics that help him in this regard .
his friendly , relaxed way has made him friends abroad and quickly turned him into the most popular politician of the grand coalition at home .
this happened despite his dry and often awkward way of expressing himself .
take " perceptional spectrum " as an example . his first year in office was also an educational year for steinmeier .
three kidnappings - two in iraq and one in yemen - put the top diplomat and his colleagues to the test .
all three had happy endings , largely due to his level-headed crisis management . the troubled german-american relationship was another construction site for the new government of social and christian democrats .
the chancellor took on this issue herself and steinmeier flanked her .
in general , merkel , a christian democrat , and steinmeier , a social democrat , work surprisingly well together . steinmeier heads to the middle east or holds talks about the iranian nuclear program , providing for continuity in german foreign policy by doing so .
merkel on the other hand deals with her mighty counterparts in washington and moscow and makes adjustments to the foreign policy standpoints of her predecessor .
schröder 's confidante steinmeier no longer has to bear responsibility for this . but he will not be able to evade testimony in front of the parliamentary inquiry in the el masri case in which a lebanese-born german claims to have been kidnapped by cia agents and tortured , as he played a crucial role in his capacity as head of the german chancellery . but what 's steinmeier 's strategy ?
he 's more concerned about energy policy than his predecessor as he thinks that long-term security of energy supplies is a central foreign policy issue .
foreign trade policy is naturally also part of his job and he wants to expand contacts with " key regions of the future " that he 's already visited . beyond that , however , it 's hard to see a holistic strategic concept .
questions of the day dominate steinmeier 's agenda too often and he remains vague and lacks differentiation with his politeness .
still , his foreign policy is solid , reliable and good overall . nina werkhäuser is dw-radio 's foreign affairs correspondent in berlin -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's new face abroad frank-walter steinmeier , a close ally of outgoing chancellor schröder , is set to be germany 's new foreign minister .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 22.11.2006 " we ca n't afford to leave kids by the wayside " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " strengthening children 's rights helps in taking action against neglect " the german parliament 's commission for children 's concerns this week discussed including children 's rights in the constitution .
in light of recent cases of deaths due to neglect , it 's becoming a pressing issue . dw-world.de spoke with rudi tarneden , a spokesman for unicef deutschland , the german branch of the united nations children 's fund , about what would change in germany if children 's rights were part of the constitution .
dw-world.de : let 's assume that children 's rights will become part of the constitution at some point .
how would those rights be guaranteed ?
rudi tarneden : this past august , during an event hosted by unicef germany and the deutscher kinderschutzbund -lrb- a german lobby organization for the protection of children -rrb- , chancellor angela merkel said for the first time that she could envision including children 's rights in the constitution .
this fall , family minister ursula von der leyen stressed the need again following the cases of child neglect and killing that have recently come to light .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a growing awareness of children 's rights in germany putting children 's rights in the constitution would strengthen young people 's position in society , especially in terms of new policies being drafted - policies that concern children , but also those that affect immigrants and even issues like urban design to make cities more child-friendly .
it would also mean that youth offices could take legal action more quickly and easily in cases of child neglect .
currently , youth office agents are very reluctant to get involved in a family 's private sphere .
parental rights are more respected than children 's rights .
also , there be would a change of attitude from " raising children is a private , family matter and we 'll get involved only in an emergency " to " children and the raising of them are a social concern whereby both the state and parents bear responsibility . "
yet , in the recent cases of child deaths due to neglect , youth offices knew that at least some of the families were high-risk , but they did n't get involved .
were n't those emergencies ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts warn that child neglect and abuse occur in all levels of society that 's the problem .
those are the cases in which everyone is aware of what 's going on , but no one does anything .
if the state were to get more involved , people in society would take a closer look and take action , and vice versa .
unicef recently published a report that focuses on child abuse in industrialized countries .
for germany , the report shows that on the average , two children die per week as the result of abuse or neglect .
but that 's just the tip of the iceberg - there are plenty of children who manage to live , but who suffer physical and psychological violence as they grow up .
they , of course , are not included in those numbers .
i should make clear that laws will not stop child neglect and abuse , but that new laws could give agencies more possibilities for taking action .
things have improved in the past few decades , but child mortality rates due to neglect are still too high .
if laws ca n't do it all , how can people 's attitudes become more attuned to the needs of children ?
in 2000 , a ban on physical punishment to reprimand children was drafted .
there were major discussions on the issue and whether or not parents should be forbidden to spank or slap their children .
but the fact is that this new law helped to readjust people 's attitudes toward children - namely , that the social norms of respect and grace that adults expect in their dealings with one another should also be expected in behavior towards children .
such laws herald long-term processes in which attitudes toward children gradually change for the better .
one should n't underestimate their psychological effects .
you said adding children 's rights to the constitution will not prevent child abuse .
is n't money also an issue - as budgets for kindergarten care have been drastically cut and employment is high ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all kids need good schools , tarneden said the gap between the rich and the poor is widening dramatically in germany .
more and more children are being socially excluded and are growing up in poverty and in families in which long-term unemployment reigns .
these children do n't have the role models they need because their parents have resigned themselves to dreadful circumstances , or because they ca n't get the training they need , or ca n't attend decent schools .
it 's precisely in the " bad " city districts where good schools should be located .
a crisis is brewing here , and we believe that tackling these problems now should be a priority .
why do you believe the push for improving children 's rights is coming now ?
the ratification of the unicef convention on the rights of the child a decade and a half ago has had effects over time .
also , people in germany are now discussing the social exclusion of children and how children are growing up in poverty .
we 're realizing that we just ca n't afford to leave kids by the wayside .
we see that in all the talks about poor education in this country .
the third reason , of course , is that all the media attention on these horrible cases of child abuse has prompted politicians to say that action needs to be taken to make germany a more hospitable place for children .
what do you mean exactly by " we 're realizing we ca n't afford to leave children by the wayside . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one in 10 german students leave school without a degree right now , 10 percent of each class of school kids quits before receiving a degree .
that translates into tens of thousands of young people each year .
what are they going to do later ?
how are they going to live ?
we 're living on borrowed time .
not only does that mean major problems for the kids themselves in finding a job , but it presents a huge problem for society as a whole .
would there be a list of requirements to ensure that children are being protected ?
who would keep track of upholding the law should children 's rights be enshrined in the constitution by 2009 , as some expect ?
that 's the big question right now and the major issue that must be discussed .
should there be some sort of agency in each german state to oversee whether children 's rights are being upheld ?
who will report back on the issue ?
how will proposed laws be reviewed as to whether they would help or harm children ?

in light of recent cases of deaths due to neglect , it 's becoming a pressing issue . dw-world.de spoke with rudi tarneden , a spokesman for unicef deutschland , the german branch of the united nations children 's fund , about what would change in germany if children 's rights were part of the constitution .
dw-world.de : let 's assume that children 's rights will become part of the constitution at some point .
how would those rights be guaranteed ?
rudi tarneden : this past august , during an event hosted by unicef germany and the deutscher kinderschutzbund -lrb- a german lobby organization for the protection of children -rrb- , chancellor angela merkel said for the first time that she could envision including children 's rights in the constitution .
this fall , family minister ursula von der leyen stressed the need again following the cases of child neglect and killing that have recently come to light .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a growing awareness of children 's rights in germany putting children 's rights in the constitution would strengthen young people 's position in society , especially in terms of new policies being drafted - policies that concern children , but also those that affect immigrants and even issues like urban design to make cities more child-friendly .
it would also mean that youth offices could take legal action more quickly and easily in cases of child neglect .
currently , youth office agents are very reluctant to get involved in a family 's private sphere .
parental rights are more respected than children 's rights .
also , there be would a change of attitude from " raising children is a private , family matter and we 'll get involved only in an emergency " to " children and the raising of them are a social concern whereby both the state and parents bear responsibility . "
yet , in the recent cases of child deaths due to neglect , youth offices knew that at least some of the families were high-risk , but they did n't get involved .
were n't those emergencies ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts warn that child neglect and abuse occur in all levels of society that 's the problem .
those are the cases in which everyone is aware of what 's going on , but no one does anything .
if the state were to get more involved , people in society would take a closer look and take action , and vice versa .
unicef recently published a report that focuses on child abuse in industrialized countries .
for germany , the report shows that on the average , two children die per week as the result of abuse or neglect .
but that 's just the tip of the iceberg - there are plenty of children who manage to live , but who suffer physical and psychological violence as they grow up .
they , of course , are not included in those numbers .
i should make clear that laws will not stop child neglect and abuse , but that new laws could give agencies more possibilities for taking action .
things have improved in the past few decades , but child mortality rates due to neglect are still too high .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 22.11.2006 " we ca n't afford to leave kids by the wayside " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " strengthening children 's rights helps in taking action against neglect " the german parliament 's commission for children 's concerns this week discussed including children 's rights in the constitution .
in light of recent cases of deaths due to neglect , it 's becoming a pressing issue . dw-world.de spoke with rudi tarneden , a spokesman for unicef deutschland , the german branch of the united nations children 's fund , about what would change in germany if children 's rights were part of the constitution .
dw-world.de : let 's assume that children 's rights will become part of the constitution at some point .
how would those rights be guaranteed ?
rudi tarneden : this past august , during an event hosted by unicef germany and the deutscher kinderschutzbund -lrb- a german lobby organization for the protection of children -rrb- , chancellor angela merkel said for the first time that she could envision including children 's rights in the constitution .
this fall , family minister ursula von der leyen stressed the need again following the cases of child neglect and killing that have recently come to light .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a growing awareness of children 's rights in germany putting children 's rights in the constitution would strengthen young people 's position in society , especially in terms of new policies being drafted - policies that concern children , but also those that affect immigrants and even issues like urban design to make cities more child-friendly .
it would also mean that youth offices could take legal action more quickly and easily in cases of child neglect .
currently , youth office agents are very reluctant to get involved in a family 's private sphere .
parental rights are more respected than children 's rights .
also , there be would a change of attitude from " raising children is a private , family matter and we 'll get involved only in an emergency " to " children and the raising of them are a social concern whereby both the state and parents bear responsibility . "
yet , in the recent cases of child deaths due to neglect , youth offices knew that at least some of the families were high-risk , but they did n't get involved .
were n't those emergencies ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts warn that child neglect and abuse occur in all levels of society that 's the problem .
those are the cases in which everyone is aware of what 's going on , but no one does anything .
if the state were to get more involved , people in society would take a closer look and take action , and vice versa .
unicef recently published a report that focuses on child abuse in industrialized countries .
for germany , the report shows that on the average , two children die per week as the result of abuse or neglect .
but that 's just the tip of the iceberg - there are plenty of children who manage to live , but who suffer physical and psychological violence as they grow up .
they , of course , are not included in those numbers .
i should make clear that laws will not stop child neglect and abuse , but that new laws could give agencies more possibilities for taking action .
things have improved in the past few decades , but child mortality rates due to neglect are still too high .
if laws ca n't do it all , how can people 's attitudes become more attuned to the needs of children ?
in 2000 , a ban on physical punishment to reprimand children was drafted .
there were major discussions on the issue and whether or not parents should be forbidden to spank or slap their children .
but the fact is that this new law helped to readjust people 's attitudes toward children - namely , that the social norms of respect and grace that adults expect in their dealings with one another should also be expected in behavior towards children .
such laws herald long-term processes in which attitudes toward children gradually change for the better .
one should n't underestimate their psychological effects .
you said adding children 's rights to the constitution will not prevent child abuse .
is n't money also an issue - as budgets for kindergarten care have been drastically cut and employment is high ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all kids need good schools , tarneden said the gap between the rich and the poor is widening dramatically in germany .
more and more children are being socially excluded and are growing up in poverty and in families in which long-term unemployment reigns .
these children do n't have the role models they need because their parents have resigned themselves to dreadful circumstances , or because they ca n't get the training they need , or ca n't attend decent schools .
it 's precisely in the " bad " city districts where good schools should be located .
a crisis is brewing here , and we believe that tackling these problems now should be a priority .
why do you believe the push for improving children 's rights is coming now ?
the ratification of the unicef convention on the rights of the child a decade and a half ago has had effects over time .
also , people in germany are now discussing the social exclusion of children and how children are growing up in poverty .
we 're realizing that we just ca n't afford to leave kids by the wayside .
we see that in all the talks about poor education in this country .
the third reason , of course , is that all the media attention on these horrible cases of child abuse has prompted politicians to say that action needs to be taken to make germany a more hospitable place for children .
what do you mean exactly by " we 're realizing we ca n't afford to leave children by the wayside . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one in 10 german students leave school without a degree right now , 10 percent of each class of school kids quits before receiving a degree .
that translates into tens of thousands of young people each year .
what are they going to do later ?
how are they going to live ?
we 're living on borrowed time .
not only does that mean major problems for the kids themselves in finding a job , but it presents a huge problem for society as a whole .
would there be a list of requirements to ensure that children are being protected ?
who would keep track of upholding the law should children 's rights be enshrined in the constitution by 2009 , as some expect ?
that 's the big question right now and the major issue that must be discussed .
should there be some sort of agency in each german state to oversee whether children 's rights are being upheld ?
who will report back on the issue ?
how will proposed laws be reviewed as to whether they would help or harm children ?
those are the really exciting questions , but we have n't reached that point yet . louisa schaefer interviewed rudi tarneden send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts shed light on germany 's poverty and welfare woes new studies in germany shed light on the twin problems of growing poverty and a deficit in the child-welfare system that could be related .

prosecutors remanded volkert into custody an arrest was made in the ongoing corruption investigation at german carmaker volkswagen .

"
he was released last august . neither the german nor the turkish authorities tried to release him from guantanamo and instead shifted responsibility on to the us government , kurnaz told a special european parliament committee investigating charges of illegal us secret service activities in europe . kurnaz was arrested in pakistan two months after the sept.11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states .
he was handed over to us authorities who took him to guantanamo in january 2002 , saying he was suspected of supporting afghanistan 's former taliban rulers . kurnaz told meps that he went to pakistan to " deepen his -lrb- muslim -rrb- faith " but that he had never done anything illegal .

other guantanamo inmates with turkish citizenship , however , were taken back to turkey , kurnaz claimed . mistreated by germans ? kurnaz also said that german soldiers in afghanistan mistreated him before he was transferred to guantanamo bay .

"
he was released last august . neither the german nor the turkish authorities tried to release him from guantanamo and instead shifted responsibility on to the us government , kurnaz told a special european parliament committee investigating charges of illegal us secret service activities in europe . kurnaz was arrested in pakistan two months after the sept.11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states .
he was handed over to us authorities who took him to guantanamo in january 2002 , saying he was suspected of supporting afghanistan 's former taliban rulers . kurnaz told meps that he went to pakistan to " deepen his -lrb- muslim -rrb- faith " but that he had never done anything illegal .

" i hope that the european parliament will shed light on this .

" they thought i was a spy for germany . " turkish officials interrogating him in the camp had told him that it was up to the us to release him , kurnaz said .
other guantanamo inmates with turkish citizenship , however , were taken back to turkey , kurnaz claimed . mistreated by germans ? kurnaz also said that german soldiers in afghanistan mistreated him before he was transferred to guantanamo bay .
us forces had handed him over to two members of the german special forces command , ksk , who had pulled his head back , banged his head on the floor and one stamped on him , kurnaz said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ksk members during a training session in germany " they asked me if i knew who they were and then they said , ' we are the ksk , " ' he said , adding that the men had german flags on their uniforms and spoke german with him . " i thought they would have some questions and that they could help me , but they told me i had chosen the wrong side , " kurnaz said . the german defense ministry is currently investigating the claims .
after saying that it had no evidence that german soldiers had interrogated kurnaz , the authority last week admitted that ksk forces had been " in contact " with him , according to german media reports . " it does n't take much imagination -lrb- to believe -rrb- that the ksk soldiers were capable of doing that , " kurnaz said .
" they were there to help the americans , and we know from the abu ghraib case what us soldiers were doing there . " kurnaz also told the european committee that officials from denmark and belgium had visited nationals imprisoned in the guantanamo camp . kurnaz mulls further legal steps bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prisoners at guantanamo a german parliamentary committee is currently studying whether german security agencies breached any german rules while assisting post-2001 us anti-terrorism operations . european parliamentarians earlier this year slammed the german government under former chancellor gerhard schröder for failing to " come clean " over its involvement in the kurnaz case . us authorities never issued an arrest warrant and there was no legal procedure against kurnaz , his lawyer has said .

but there 's at least one thing that 's remained unchanged . let 's face it : even before nov .
22 , 2005 , angela merkel 's life did n't exactly look like that of your average gretel .
as leader of germany 's main opposition party , she had tons of meetings with the more or less mighty .
she just did n't have to pay quite as much attention to hairdos and make-up .
she had to worry less about protocol while walking past soldiers on red carpets .
and , yes , she did n't have to lead a country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sauer -lrb- left -rrb- will join his wife on vacation , but he rarely comes along otherwise that 's all changed a bit over the past 365 days .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 22.11.2006 " we ca n't afford to leave kids by the wayside " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " strengthening children 's rights helps in taking action against neglect " the german parliament 's commission for children 's concerns this week discussed including children 's rights in the constitution .
in light of recent cases of deaths due to neglect , it 's becoming a pressing issue . dw-world.de spoke with rudi tarneden , a spokesman for unicef deutschland , the german branch of the united nations children 's fund , about what would change in germany if children 's rights were part of the constitution .
dw-world.de : let 's assume that children 's rights will become part of the constitution at some point .
how would those rights be guaranteed ?
rudi tarneden : this past august , during an event hosted by unicef germany and the deutscher kinderschutzbund -lrb- a german lobby organization for the protection of children -rrb- , chancellor angela merkel said for the first time that she could envision including children 's rights in the constitution .
this fall , family minister ursula von der leyen stressed the need again following the cases of child neglect and killing that have recently come to light .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a growing awareness of children 's rights in germany putting children 's rights in the constitution would strengthen young people 's position in society , especially in terms of new policies being drafted - policies that concern children , but also those that affect immigrants and even issues like urban design to make cities more child-friendly .
it would also mean that youth offices could take legal action more quickly and easily in cases of child neglect .
currently , youth office agents are very reluctant to get involved in a family 's private sphere .
parental rights are more respected than children 's rights .
also , there be would a change of attitude from " raising children is a private , family matter and we 'll get involved only in an emergency " to " children and the raising of them are a social concern whereby both the state and parents bear responsibility . "
yet , in the recent cases of child deaths due to neglect , youth offices knew that at least some of the families were high-risk , but they did n't get involved .
were n't those emergencies ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts warn that child neglect and abuse occur in all levels of society that 's the problem .
those are the cases in which everyone is aware of what 's going on , but no one does anything .
if the state were to get more involved , people in society would take a closer look and take action , and vice versa .
unicef recently published a report that focuses on child abuse in industrialized countries .
for germany , the report shows that on the average , two children die per week as the result of abuse or neglect .
but that 's just the tip of the iceberg - there are plenty of children who manage to live , but who suffer physical and psychological violence as they grow up .
they , of course , are not included in those numbers .
i should make clear that laws will not stop child neglect and abuse , but that new laws could give agencies more possibilities for taking action .
things have improved in the past few decades , but child mortality rates due to neglect are still too high .
if laws ca n't do it all , how can people 's attitudes become more attuned to the needs of children ?
in 2000 , a ban on physical punishment to reprimand children was drafted .
there were major discussions on the issue and whether or not parents should be forbidden to spank or slap their children .
but the fact is that this new law helped to readjust people 's attitudes toward children - namely , that the social norms of respect and grace that adults expect in their dealings with one another should also be expected in behavior towards children .
such laws herald long-term processes in which attitudes toward children gradually change for the better .
one should n't underestimate their psychological effects .
you said adding children 's rights to the constitution will not prevent child abuse .
is n't money also an issue - as budgets for kindergarten care have been drastically cut and employment is high ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all kids need good schools , tarneden said the gap between the rich and the poor is widening dramatically in germany .
more and more children are being socially excluded and are growing up in poverty and in families in which long-term unemployment reigns .
these children do n't have the role models they need because their parents have resigned themselves to dreadful circumstances , or because they ca n't get the training they need , or ca n't attend decent schools .
it 's precisely in the " bad " city districts where good schools should be located .
a crisis is brewing here , and we believe that tackling these problems now should be a priority .
why do you believe the push for improving children 's rights is coming now ?
the ratification of the unicef convention on the rights of the child a decade and a half ago has had effects over time .
also , people in germany are now discussing the social exclusion of children and how children are growing up in poverty .
we 're realizing that we just ca n't afford to leave kids by the wayside .
we see that in all the talks about poor education in this country .
the third reason , of course , is that all the media attention on these horrible cases of child abuse has prompted politicians to say that action needs to be taken to make germany a more hospitable place for children .
what do you mean exactly by " we 're realizing we ca n't afford to leave children by the wayside . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one in 10 german students leave school without a degree right now , 10 percent of each class of school kids quits before receiving a degree .
that translates into tens of thousands of young people each year .
what are they going to do later ?
how are they going to live ?
we 're living on borrowed time .
not only does that mean major problems for the kids themselves in finding a job , but it presents a huge problem for society as a whole .
would there be a list of requirements to ensure that children are being protected ?
who would keep track of upholding the law should children 's rights be enshrined in the constitution by 2009 , as some expect ?
that 's the big question right now and the major issue that must be discussed .
should there be some sort of agency in each german state to oversee whether children 's rights are being upheld ?
who will report back on the issue ?
how will proposed laws be reviewed as to whether they would help or harm children ?
those are the really exciting questions , but we have n't reached that point yet . louisa schaefer interviewed rudi tarneden send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts shed light on germany 's poverty and welfare woes new studies in germany shed light on the twin problems of growing poverty and a deficit in the child-welfare system that could be related .
experts have spoken out on both issues .

" i think they are good results and we can be happy with them . " merkel said that despite the 3 percent increase in sales tax , which is to be introduced on jan .

and the business confidence index , which reflects expectations for the german economy , fell again in november to its lowest point in seven years . year too short looking back at her first year as chancellor , merkel said it was a very short period " to prepare a land for the future . " but she said the coalition had enjoyed many successes in this time , such as a reform of the healthcare system , changes to inheritance tax , the introduction of a payment for new parents , and the participation of german soldiers in peacekeeping missions in lebanon and afghanistan . continuing conflicts with the social democrats the grand coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and merkel 's christian democrats took office in november 2005 more than two months after a general election gave neither of germany 's two biggest parties a clear mandate to form a majority government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter struck has been critical of angela merkel the spd 's parliamentary head , peter struck , admitted that after a year , the working relationship between the two coalition partners was difficult at times , but he emphasized there was a " relationship of trust .

" he said germany 's economic upsurge was not driven by the government but rather by german industry and business .
factors such as increased exports , the world cup and the hot summer had all contributed to the recovery , he added . " the federal government is neither the father nor the mother of the economic upswing , " brüderle said .

" perceptional spectrum " is one of steinmeier 's favorite phrases and it says a lot about him .
the foreign minister has used his first year in office , first and foremost , to expand his own perceptional spectrum .
while the 50-year-old lawyer previously spent years sitting inside germany 's chancellery as former chancellor gerhard schröder 's chief-of-staff , he took off on a world trip in stages immediately after switching jobs . he visited south america , the arabian peninsula , southeast asia , central asia and north africa - and realized that a purely euro-atlantic approach to foreign policy is no longer sufficient in the 21st century .
the attention steinmeier pays to emerging regions on all five continents expands germany 's world - even if it 's not always clear right away where a common path may lead .
for now , steinmeier is making connections that might come in handy later . his impartiality and his interest in people and topics that he 's unfamiliar with are characteristics that help him in this regard .
his friendly , relaxed way has made him friends abroad and quickly turned him into the most popular politician of the grand coalition at home .
this happened despite his dry and often awkward way of expressing himself .

all three had happy endings , largely due to his level-headed crisis management . the troubled german-american relationship was another construction site for the new government of social and christian democrats .
the chancellor took on this issue herself and steinmeier flanked her .
in general , merkel , a christian democrat , and steinmeier , a social democrat , work surprisingly well together . steinmeier heads to the middle east or holds talks about the iranian nuclear program , providing for continuity in german foreign policy by doing so .
merkel on the other hand deals with her mighty counterparts in washington and moscow and makes adjustments to the foreign policy standpoints of her predecessor .
schröder 's confidante steinmeier no longer has to bear responsibility for this . but he will not be able to evade testimony in front of the parliamentary inquiry in the el masri case in which a lebanese-born german claims to have been kidnapped by cia agents and tortured , as he played a crucial role in his capacity as head of the german chancellery . but what 's steinmeier 's strategy ?
he 's more concerned about energy policy than his predecessor as he thinks that long-term security of energy supplies is a central foreign policy issue .
foreign trade policy is naturally also part of his job and he wants to expand contacts with " key regions of the future " that he 's already visited . beyond that , however , it 's hard to see a holistic strategic concept .

" after years of stagnation , the country is on the upswing , " merkel said during a general debate on the budget in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german economy is on a six-year high the chancellor also pointed to increasing tax revenue as a sign of the coalition 's " effective " politics . " i think they are good results and we can be happy with them . " merkel said that despite the 3 percent increase in sales tax , which is to be introduced on jan .
1 , there was no evidence of weaker economic growth . however , many business analysts expect the tax increase to put the brakes on already weak consumer spending .
and the business confidence index , which reflects expectations for the german economy , fell again in november to its lowest point in seven years . year too short looking back at her first year as chancellor , merkel said it was a very short period " to prepare a land for the future . " but she said the coalition had enjoyed many successes in this time , such as a reform of the healthcare system , changes to inheritance tax , the introduction of a payment for new parents , and the participation of german soldiers in peacekeeping missions in lebanon and afghanistan . continuing conflicts with the social democrats the grand coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and merkel 's christian democrats took office in november 2005 more than two months after a general election gave neither of germany 's two biggest parties a clear mandate to form a majority government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter struck has been critical of angela merkel the spd 's parliamentary head , peter struck , admitted that after a year , the working relationship between the two coalition partners was difficult at times , but he emphasized there was a " relationship of trust .

" struck has been attacked by the christian democrats in recent weeks because he has , amongst other things , criticized angela merkel 's working methods . opposition says year wasted the acting chairman of the opposition free democrats , rainer brüderle , said the first year of the coalition " was a squandered year . " he said germany 's economic upsurge was not driven by the government but rather by german industry and business .
factors such as increased exports , the world cup and the hot summer had all contributed to the recovery , he added . " the federal government is neither the father nor the mother of the economic upswing , " brüderle said .

but there 's at least one thing that 's remained unchanged . let 's face it : even before nov .
22 , 2005 , angela merkel 's life did n't exactly look like that of your average gretel .
as leader of germany 's main opposition party , she had tons of meetings with the more or less mighty .
she just did n't have to pay quite as much attention to hairdos and make-up .
she had to worry less about protocol while walking past soldiers on red carpets .
and , yes , she did n't have to lead a country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sauer -lrb- left -rrb- will join his wife on vacation , but he rarely comes along otherwise that 's all changed a bit over the past 365 days .
she 's now constantly in the limelight .
she 's had her apartment in central berlin retrofitted to comply with security standards worthy of a world leader .
she has even less time for her husband , a chemistry professor named joachim sauer who has decided that he 'd rather focus on his own work than accompany his wife at every occasion . sauer has also decided not to talk about his wife .
the chancellor , on the other hand , apparently feels an obligation to share the odd private insight now and then .
on wednesday , the anniversary of her ascension to the chancellery , merkel did decide to respond to reporters from germany 's bild tabloid , who had asked whether her husband had noted any changes in her . " well , the breakfast that i 'm preparing for us is still the same , " merkel said . munching on pretzels the chancellor still has time to prepare breakfast .
surely there are millions of people with far less responsibility who barely manage to gulp down some coffee before they rush out the door . how does she do it ?
or , what 's even more interesting : what does she serve ?
a traditional german breakfast with meats , cheese , jam and soft-boiled eggs ?
one can only hope that her table looks a little more cheerful than the tupperware-laden arrangement that awaits a certain elizabeth ii in the morning . there 's quite a bit of information on merkel 's favorite dishes .
apparently she enjoys potato soup , roulades , stews and schnitzel , and she makes goose for christmas .
merkel clearly was n't willing to go into the details of her breakfast offerings though . maybe the subject 's a little too touchy for her .
after all , she did concede the conservative candidacy for chancellorship to bavarian premier edmund stoiber over breakfast -lrb- with pretzels -rrb- in 2002 .
a pretty smart move , one could say in hindsight , as stoiber lost the election , making merkel 's bid for the chancellorship possible in the 2005 elections . bildunterschrift : it 's not known whether merkel and stoiber -lrb- right -rrb- also had beer with breakfast in 2002 " i really like breakfast , " she recently told a women 's magazine . no wonder . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de angie admits to bad driving german chancellor angela merkel has been criticized for slamming the brakes on government reform and steering the government in the wrong direction after one year in office .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 22.11.2006 " we ca n't afford to leave kids by the wayside " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " strengthening children 's rights helps in taking action against neglect " the german parliament 's commission for children 's concerns this week discussed including children 's rights in the constitution .
in light of recent cases of deaths due to neglect , it 's becoming a pressing issue . dw-world.de spoke with rudi tarneden , a spokesman for unicef deutschland , the german branch of the united nations children 's fund , about what would change in germany if children 's rights were part of the constitution .
dw-world.de : let 's assume that children 's rights will become part of the constitution at some point .
how would those rights be guaranteed ?
rudi tarneden : this past august , during an event hosted by unicef germany and the deutscher kinderschutzbund -lrb- a german lobby organization for the protection of children -rrb- , chancellor angela merkel said for the first time that she could envision including children 's rights in the constitution .
this fall , family minister ursula von der leyen stressed the need again following the cases of child neglect and killing that have recently come to light .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a growing awareness of children 's rights in germany putting children 's rights in the constitution would strengthen young people 's position in society , especially in terms of new policies being drafted - policies that concern children , but also those that affect immigrants and even issues like urban design to make cities more child-friendly .
it would also mean that youth offices could take legal action more quickly and easily in cases of child neglect .
currently , youth office agents are very reluctant to get involved in a family 's private sphere .
parental rights are more respected than children 's rights .
also , there be would a change of attitude from " raising children is a private , family matter and we 'll get involved only in an emergency " to " children and the raising of them are a social concern whereby both the state and parents bear responsibility . "
yet , in the recent cases of child deaths due to neglect , youth offices knew that at least some of the families were high-risk , but they did n't get involved .
were n't those emergencies ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts warn that child neglect and abuse occur in all levels of society that 's the problem .
those are the cases in which everyone is aware of what 's going on , but no one does anything .
if the state were to get more involved , people in society would take a closer look and take action , and vice versa .
unicef recently published a report that focuses on child abuse in industrialized countries .
for germany , the report shows that on the average , two children die per week as the result of abuse or neglect .
but that 's just the tip of the iceberg - there are plenty of children who manage to live , but who suffer physical and psychological violence as they grow up .
they , of course , are not included in those numbers .
i should make clear that laws will not stop child neglect and abuse , but that new laws could give agencies more possibilities for taking action .
things have improved in the past few decades , but child mortality rates due to neglect are still too high .
if laws ca n't do it all , how can people 's attitudes become more attuned to the needs of children ?
in 2000 , a ban on physical punishment to reprimand children was drafted .
there were major discussions on the issue and whether or not parents should be forbidden to spank or slap their children .
but the fact is that this new law helped to readjust people 's attitudes toward children - namely , that the social norms of respect and grace that adults expect in their dealings with one another should also be expected in behavior towards children .
such laws herald long-term processes in which attitudes toward children gradually change for the better .
one should n't underestimate their psychological effects .
you said adding children 's rights to the constitution will not prevent child abuse .
is n't money also an issue - as budgets for kindergarten care have been drastically cut and employment is high ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all kids need good schools , tarneden said the gap between the rich and the poor is widening dramatically in germany .
more and more children are being socially excluded and are growing up in poverty and in families in which long-term unemployment reigns .
these children do n't have the role models they need because their parents have resigned themselves to dreadful circumstances , or because they ca n't get the training they need , or ca n't attend decent schools .
it 's precisely in the " bad " city districts where good schools should be located .
a crisis is brewing here , and we believe that tackling these problems now should be a priority .
why do you believe the push for improving children 's rights is coming now ?
the ratification of the unicef convention on the rights of the child a decade and a half ago has had effects over time .
also , people in germany are now discussing the social exclusion of children and how children are growing up in poverty .
we 're realizing that we just ca n't afford to leave kids by the wayside .
we see that in all the talks about poor education in this country .
the third reason , of course , is that all the media attention on these horrible cases of child abuse has prompted politicians to say that action needs to be taken to make germany a more hospitable place for children .
what do you mean exactly by " we 're realizing we ca n't afford to leave children by the wayside . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one in 10 german students leave school without a degree right now , 10 percent of each class of school kids quits before receiving a degree .
that translates into tens of thousands of young people each year .
what are they going to do later ?
how are they going to live ?
we 're living on borrowed time .
not only does that mean major problems for the kids themselves in finding a job , but it presents a huge problem for society as a whole .
would there be a list of requirements to ensure that children are being protected ?
who would keep track of upholding the law should children 's rights be enshrined in the constitution by 2009 , as some expect ?
that 's the big question right now and the major issue that must be discussed .
should there be some sort of agency in each german state to oversee whether children 's rights are being upheld ?
who will report back on the issue ?
how will proposed laws be reviewed as to whether they would help or harm children ?
those are the really exciting questions , but we have n't reached that point yet . louisa schaefer interviewed rudi tarneden send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts shed light on germany 's poverty and welfare woes new studies in germany shed light on the twin problems of growing poverty and a deficit in the child-welfare system that could be related .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 22.11.2006 " we ca n't afford to leave kids by the wayside " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " strengthening children 's rights helps in taking action against neglect " the german parliament 's commission for children 's concerns this week discussed including children 's rights in the constitution .
in light of recent cases of deaths due to neglect , it 's becoming a pressing issue . dw-world.de spoke with rudi tarneden , a spokesman for unicef deutschland , the german branch of the united nations children 's fund , about what would change in germany if children 's rights were part of the constitution .
dw-world.de : let 's assume that children 's rights will become part of the constitution at some point .
how would those rights be guaranteed ?
rudi tarneden : this past august , during an event hosted by unicef germany and the deutscher kinderschutzbund -lrb- a german lobby organization for the protection of children -rrb- , chancellor angela merkel said for the first time that she could envision including children 's rights in the constitution .
this fall , family minister ursula von der leyen stressed the need again following the cases of child neglect and killing that have recently come to light .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a growing awareness of children 's rights in germany putting children 's rights in the constitution would strengthen young people 's position in society , especially in terms of new policies being drafted - policies that concern children , but also those that affect immigrants and even issues like urban design to make cities more child-friendly .
it would also mean that youth offices could take legal action more quickly and easily in cases of child neglect .
currently , youth office agents are very reluctant to get involved in a family 's private sphere .
parental rights are more respected than children 's rights .
also , there be would a change of attitude from " raising children is a private , family matter and we 'll get involved only in an emergency " to " children and the raising of them are a social concern whereby both the state and parents bear responsibility . "
yet , in the recent cases of child deaths due to neglect , youth offices knew that at least some of the families were high-risk , but they did n't get involved .
were n't those emergencies ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts warn that child neglect and abuse occur in all levels of society that 's the problem .
those are the cases in which everyone is aware of what 's going on , but no one does anything .
if the state were to get more involved , people in society would take a closer look and take action , and vice versa .
unicef recently published a report that focuses on child abuse in industrialized countries .
for germany , the report shows that on the average , two children die per week as the result of abuse or neglect .
but that 's just the tip of the iceberg - there are plenty of children who manage to live , but who suffer physical and psychological violence as they grow up .
they , of course , are not included in those numbers .
i should make clear that laws will not stop child neglect and abuse , but that new laws could give agencies more possibilities for taking action .
things have improved in the past few decades , but child mortality rates due to neglect are still too high .
if laws ca n't do it all , how can people 's attitudes become more attuned to the needs of children ?
in 2000 , a ban on physical punishment to reprimand children was drafted .
there were major discussions on the issue and whether or not parents should be forbidden to spank or slap their children .
but the fact is that this new law helped to readjust people 's attitudes toward children - namely , that the social norms of respect and grace that adults expect in their dealings with one another should also be expected in behavior towards children .
such laws herald long-term processes in which attitudes toward children gradually change for the better .
one should n't underestimate their psychological effects .
you said adding children 's rights to the constitution will not prevent child abuse .
is n't money also an issue - as budgets for kindergarten care have been drastically cut and employment is high ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all kids need good schools , tarneden said the gap between the rich and the poor is widening dramatically in germany .
more and more children are being socially excluded and are growing up in poverty and in families in which long-term unemployment reigns .
these children do n't have the role models they need because their parents have resigned themselves to dreadful circumstances , or because they ca n't get the training they need , or ca n't attend decent schools .
it 's precisely in the " bad " city districts where good schools should be located .
a crisis is brewing here , and we believe that tackling these problems now should be a priority .
why do you believe the push for improving children 's rights is coming now ?
the ratification of the unicef convention on the rights of the child a decade and a half ago has had effects over time .
also , people in germany are now discussing the social exclusion of children and how children are growing up in poverty .
we 're realizing that we just ca n't afford to leave kids by the wayside .
we see that in all the talks about poor education in this country .
the third reason , of course , is that all the media attention on these horrible cases of child abuse has prompted politicians to say that action needs to be taken to make germany a more hospitable place for children .
what do you mean exactly by " we 're realizing we ca n't afford to leave children by the wayside . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one in 10 german students leave school without a degree right now , 10 percent of each class of school kids quits before receiving a degree .
that translates into tens of thousands of young people each year .
what are they going to do later ?
how are they going to live ?
we 're living on borrowed time .
not only does that mean major problems for the kids themselves in finding a job , but it presents a huge problem for society as a whole .
would there be a list of requirements to ensure that children are being protected ?
who would keep track of upholding the law should children 's rights be enshrined in the constitution by 2009 , as some expect ?
that 's the big question right now and the major issue that must be discussed .
should there be some sort of agency in each german state to oversee whether children 's rights are being upheld ?
who will report back on the issue ?
how will proposed laws be reviewed as to whether they would help or harm children ?
those are the really exciting questions , but we have n't reached that point yet . louisa schaefer interviewed rudi tarneden send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts shed light on germany 's poverty and welfare woes new studies in germany shed light on the twin problems of growing poverty and a deficit in the child-welfare system that could be related .

the case was later dropped .
weimer said government officials were simply trying to find out who had passed on the information .
he added that this represented a threat to journalists , who could no longer guarantee the anonymity of their sources . government officials on wednesday meanwhile argued that such protection was not possible . " a journalist can commit a crime if he publishes state secrets that have been divulged by a civil servant , " said lutz diwell , a deputy minister in germany 's department of justice . judges , on the other hand , questioned whether journalists could still be held accountable as accomplices once the secrets had been revealed by government officials . a ruling in the case is not expected until 2007 . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press council celebrates 50 years monday is the 50th anniversary of the german press council , an independent and self-regulating organization which was based on the british press council model .

but there 's at least one thing that 's remained unchanged . let 's face it : even before nov .
22 , 2005 , angela merkel 's life did n't exactly look like that of your average gretel .
as leader of germany 's main opposition party , she had tons of meetings with the more or less mighty .
she just did n't have to pay quite as much attention to hairdos and make-up .
she had to worry less about protocol while walking past soldiers on red carpets .
and , yes , she did n't have to lead a country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sauer -lrb- left -rrb- will join his wife on vacation , but he rarely comes along otherwise that 's all changed a bit over the past 365 days .
she 's now constantly in the limelight .
she 's had her apartment in central berlin retrofitted to comply with security standards worthy of a world leader .
she has even less time for her husband , a chemistry professor named joachim sauer who has decided that he 'd rather focus on his own work than accompany his wife at every occasion . sauer has also decided not to talk about his wife .
the chancellor , on the other hand , apparently feels an obligation to share the odd private insight now and then .
on wednesday , the anniversary of her ascension to the chancellery , merkel did decide to respond to reporters from germany 's bild tabloid , who had asked whether her husband had noted any changes in her . " well , the breakfast that i 'm preparing for us is still the same , " merkel said . munching on pretzels the chancellor still has time to prepare breakfast .
surely there are millions of people with far less responsibility who barely manage to gulp down some coffee before they rush out the door . how does she do it ?
or , what 's even more interesting : what does she serve ?
a traditional german breakfast with meats , cheese , jam and soft-boiled eggs ?
one can only hope that her table looks a little more cheerful than the tupperware-laden arrangement that awaits a certain elizabeth ii in the morning . there 's quite a bit of information on merkel 's favorite dishes .
apparently she enjoys potato soup , roulades , stews and schnitzel , and she makes goose for christmas .
merkel clearly was n't willing to go into the details of her breakfast offerings though . maybe the subject 's a little too touchy for her .
after all , she did concede the conservative candidacy for chancellorship to bavarian premier edmund stoiber over breakfast -lrb- with pretzels -rrb- in 2002 .
a pretty smart move , one could say in hindsight , as stoiber lost the election , making merkel 's bid for the chancellorship possible in the 2005 elections . bildunterschrift : it 's not known whether merkel and stoiber -lrb- right -rrb- also had beer with breakfast in 2002 " i really like breakfast , " she recently told a women 's magazine . no wonder . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de angie admits to bad driving german chancellor angela merkel has been criticized for slamming the brakes on government reform and steering the government in the wrong direction after one year in office .
but now there 's a logical explanation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 22.11.2006 " we ca n't afford to leave kids by the wayside " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " strengthening children 's rights helps in taking action against neglect " the german parliament 's commission for children 's concerns this week discussed including children 's rights in the constitution .
in light of recent cases of deaths due to neglect , it 's becoming a pressing issue . dw-world.de spoke with rudi tarneden , a spokesman for unicef deutschland , the german branch of the united nations children 's fund , about what would change in germany if children 's rights were part of the constitution .
dw-world.de : let 's assume that children 's rights will become part of the constitution at some point .
how would those rights be guaranteed ?
rudi tarneden : this past august , during an event hosted by unicef germany and the deutscher kinderschutzbund -lrb- a german lobby organization for the protection of children -rrb- , chancellor angela merkel said for the first time that she could envision including children 's rights in the constitution .
this fall , family minister ursula von der leyen stressed the need again following the cases of child neglect and killing that have recently come to light .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a growing awareness of children 's rights in germany putting children 's rights in the constitution would strengthen young people 's position in society , especially in terms of new policies being drafted - policies that concern children , but also those that affect immigrants and even issues like urban design to make cities more child-friendly .
it would also mean that youth offices could take legal action more quickly and easily in cases of child neglect .
currently , youth office agents are very reluctant to get involved in a family 's private sphere .
parental rights are more respected than children 's rights .
also , there be would a change of attitude from " raising children is a private , family matter and we 'll get involved only in an emergency " to " children and the raising of them are a social concern whereby both the state and parents bear responsibility . "
yet , in the recent cases of child deaths due to neglect , youth offices knew that at least some of the families were high-risk , but they did n't get involved .
were n't those emergencies ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts warn that child neglect and abuse occur in all levels of society that 's the problem .
those are the cases in which everyone is aware of what 's going on , but no one does anything .
if the state were to get more involved , people in society would take a closer look and take action , and vice versa .
unicef recently published a report that focuses on child abuse in industrialized countries .
for germany , the report shows that on the average , two children die per week as the result of abuse or neglect .
but that 's just the tip of the iceberg - there are plenty of children who manage to live , but who suffer physical and psychological violence as they grow up .
they , of course , are not included in those numbers .
i should make clear that laws will not stop child neglect and abuse , but that new laws could give agencies more possibilities for taking action .
things have improved in the past few decades , but child mortality rates due to neglect are still too high .
if laws ca n't do it all , how can people 's attitudes become more attuned to the needs of children ?
in 2000 , a ban on physical punishment to reprimand children was drafted .
there were major discussions on the issue and whether or not parents should be forbidden to spank or slap their children .
but the fact is that this new law helped to readjust people 's attitudes toward children - namely , that the social norms of respect and grace that adults expect in their dealings with one another should also be expected in behavior towards children .
such laws herald long-term processes in which attitudes toward children gradually change for the better .
one should n't underestimate their psychological effects .
you said adding children 's rights to the constitution will not prevent child abuse .
is n't money also an issue - as budgets for kindergarten care have been drastically cut and employment is high ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all kids need good schools , tarneden said the gap between the rich and the poor is widening dramatically in germany .
more and more children are being socially excluded and are growing up in poverty and in families in which long-term unemployment reigns .
these children do n't have the role models they need because their parents have resigned themselves to dreadful circumstances , or because they ca n't get the training they need , or ca n't attend decent schools .
it 's precisely in the " bad " city districts where good schools should be located .
a crisis is brewing here , and we believe that tackling these problems now should be a priority .
why do you believe the push for improving children 's rights is coming now ?
the ratification of the unicef convention on the rights of the child a decade and a half ago has had effects over time .
also , people in germany are now discussing the social exclusion of children and how children are growing up in poverty .
we 're realizing that we just ca n't afford to leave kids by the wayside .
we see that in all the talks about poor education in this country .
the third reason , of course , is that all the media attention on these horrible cases of child abuse has prompted politicians to say that action needs to be taken to make germany a more hospitable place for children .
what do you mean exactly by " we 're realizing we ca n't afford to leave children by the wayside . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one in 10 german students leave school without a degree right now , 10 percent of each class of school kids quits before receiving a degree .
that translates into tens of thousands of young people each year .
what are they going to do later ?
how are they going to live ?
we 're living on borrowed time .
not only does that mean major problems for the kids themselves in finding a job , but it presents a huge problem for society as a whole .
would there be a list of requirements to ensure that children are being protected ?
who would keep track of upholding the law should children 's rights be enshrined in the constitution by 2009 , as some expect ?
that 's the big question right now and the major issue that must be discussed .
should there be some sort of agency in each german state to oversee whether children 's rights are being upheld ?
who will report back on the issue ?
how will proposed laws be reviewed as to whether they would help or harm children ?
those are the really exciting questions , but we have n't reached that point yet . louisa schaefer interviewed rudi tarneden send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts shed light on germany 's poverty and welfare woes new studies in germany shed light on the twin problems of growing poverty and a deficit in the child-welfare system that could be related .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 22.11.2006 " we ca n't afford to leave kids by the wayside " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " strengthening children 's rights helps in taking action against neglect " the german parliament 's commission for children 's concerns this week discussed including children 's rights in the constitution .
in light of recent cases of deaths due to neglect , it 's becoming a pressing issue . dw-world.de spoke with rudi tarneden , a spokesman for unicef deutschland , the german branch of the united nations children 's fund , about what would change in germany if children 's rights were part of the constitution .
dw-world.de : let 's assume that children 's rights will become part of the constitution at some point .
how would those rights be guaranteed ?
rudi tarneden : this past august , during an event hosted by unicef germany and the deutscher kinderschutzbund -lrb- a german lobby organization for the protection of children -rrb- , chancellor angela merkel said for the first time that she could envision including children 's rights in the constitution .
this fall , family minister ursula von der leyen stressed the need again following the cases of child neglect and killing that have recently come to light .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a growing awareness of children 's rights in germany putting children 's rights in the constitution would strengthen young people 's position in society , especially in terms of new policies being drafted - policies that concern children , but also those that affect immigrants and even issues like urban design to make cities more child-friendly .
it would also mean that youth offices could take legal action more quickly and easily in cases of child neglect .
currently , youth office agents are very reluctant to get involved in a family 's private sphere .
parental rights are more respected than children 's rights .
also , there be would a change of attitude from " raising children is a private , family matter and we 'll get involved only in an emergency " to " children and the raising of them are a social concern whereby both the state and parents bear responsibility . "
yet , in the recent cases of child deaths due to neglect , youth offices knew that at least some of the families were high-risk , but they did n't get involved .
were n't those emergencies ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts warn that child neglect and abuse occur in all levels of society that 's the problem .
those are the cases in which everyone is aware of what 's going on , but no one does anything .
if the state were to get more involved , people in society would take a closer look and take action , and vice versa .
unicef recently published a report that focuses on child abuse in industrialized countries .
for germany , the report shows that on the average , two children die per week as the result of abuse or neglect .
but that 's just the tip of the iceberg - there are plenty of children who manage to live , but who suffer physical and psychological violence as they grow up .
they , of course , are not included in those numbers .
i should make clear that laws will not stop child neglect and abuse , but that new laws could give agencies more possibilities for taking action .
things have improved in the past few decades , but child mortality rates due to neglect are still too high .
if laws ca n't do it all , how can people 's attitudes become more attuned to the needs of children ?
in 2000 , a ban on physical punishment to reprimand children was drafted .
there were major discussions on the issue and whether or not parents should be forbidden to spank or slap their children .
but the fact is that this new law helped to readjust people 's attitudes toward children - namely , that the social norms of respect and grace that adults expect in their dealings with one another should also be expected in behavior towards children .
such laws herald long-term processes in which attitudes toward children gradually change for the better .
one should n't underestimate their psychological effects .
you said adding children 's rights to the constitution will not prevent child abuse .
is n't money also an issue - as budgets for kindergarten care have been drastically cut and employment is high ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all kids need good schools , tarneden said the gap between the rich and the poor is widening dramatically in germany .
more and more children are being socially excluded and are growing up in poverty and in families in which long-term unemployment reigns .
these children do n't have the role models they need because their parents have resigned themselves to dreadful circumstances , or because they ca n't get the training they need , or ca n't attend decent schools .
it 's precisely in the " bad " city districts where good schools should be located .
a crisis is brewing here , and we believe that tackling these problems now should be a priority .
why do you believe the push for improving children 's rights is coming now ?
the ratification of the unicef convention on the rights of the child a decade and a half ago has had effects over time .
also , people in germany are now discussing the social exclusion of children and how children are growing up in poverty .
we 're realizing that we just ca n't afford to leave kids by the wayside .
we see that in all the talks about poor education in this country .
the third reason , of course , is that all the media attention on these horrible cases of child abuse has prompted politicians to say that action needs to be taken to make germany a more hospitable place for children .
what do you mean exactly by " we 're realizing we ca n't afford to leave children by the wayside . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one in 10 german students leave school without a degree right now , 10 percent of each class of school kids quits before receiving a degree .
that translates into tens of thousands of young people each year .
what are they going to do later ?
how are they going to live ?
we 're living on borrowed time .
not only does that mean major problems for the kids themselves in finding a job , but it presents a huge problem for society as a whole .
would there be a list of requirements to ensure that children are being protected ?
who would keep track of upholding the law should children 's rights be enshrined in the constitution by 2009 , as some expect ?
that 's the big question right now and the major issue that must be discussed .
should there be some sort of agency in each german state to oversee whether children 's rights are being upheld ?
who will report back on the issue ?
how will proposed laws be reviewed as to whether they would help or harm children ?
those are the really exciting questions , but we have n't reached that point yet . louisa schaefer interviewed rudi tarneden send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts shed light on germany 's poverty and welfare woes new studies in germany shed light on the twin problems of growing poverty and a deficit in the child-welfare system that could be related .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 22.11.2006 breakfast at angela 's großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surely a cookie is not enough in the morning reviewing her first year as chancellor , angela merkel revealed wednesday that leading a country - surprise , surprise - pretty much turns one 's life upside down .
but there 's at least one thing that 's remained unchanged . let 's face it : even before nov .
22 , 2005 , angela merkel 's life did n't exactly look like that of your average gretel .
as leader of germany 's main opposition party , she had tons of meetings with the more or less mighty .
she just did n't have to pay quite as much attention to hairdos and make-up .
she had to worry less about protocol while walking past soldiers on red carpets .
and , yes , she did n't have to lead a country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sauer -lrb- left -rrb- will join his wife on vacation , but he rarely comes along otherwise that 's all changed a bit over the past 365 days .
she 's now constantly in the limelight .
she 's had her apartment in central berlin retrofitted to comply with security standards worthy of a world leader .
she has even less time for her husband , a chemistry professor named joachim sauer who has decided that he 'd rather focus on his own work than accompany his wife at every occasion . sauer has also decided not to talk about his wife .
the chancellor , on the other hand , apparently feels an obligation to share the odd private insight now and then .
on wednesday , the anniversary of her ascension to the chancellery , merkel did decide to respond to reporters from germany 's bild tabloid , who had asked whether her husband had noted any changes in her . " well , the breakfast that i 'm preparing for us is still the same , " merkel said . munching on pretzels the chancellor still has time to prepare breakfast .
surely there are millions of people with far less responsibility who barely manage to gulp down some coffee before they rush out the door . how does she do it ?
or , what 's even more interesting : what does she serve ?
a traditional german breakfast with meats , cheese , jam and soft-boiled eggs ?
one can only hope that her table looks a little more cheerful than the tupperware-laden arrangement that awaits a certain elizabeth ii in the morning . there 's quite a bit of information on merkel 's favorite dishes .
apparently she enjoys potato soup , roulades , stews and schnitzel , and she makes goose for christmas .
merkel clearly was n't willing to go into the details of her breakfast offerings though . maybe the subject 's a little too touchy for her .
after all , she did concede the conservative candidacy for chancellorship to bavarian premier edmund stoiber over breakfast -lrb- with pretzels -rrb- in 2002 .
a pretty smart move , one could say in hindsight , as stoiber lost the election , making merkel 's bid for the chancellorship possible in the 2005 elections . bildunterschrift : it 's not known whether merkel and stoiber -lrb- right -rrb- also had beer with breakfast in 2002 " i really like breakfast , " she recently told a women 's magazine . no wonder . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de angie admits to bad driving german chancellor angela merkel has been criticized for slamming the brakes on government reform and steering the government in the wrong direction after one year in office .
but now there 's a logical explanation .
-lrb- 14.11.2006 -rrb- soccer rules the chancellery while many germans soccer fans will be struggling to combine the need to work with the need to watch their team , one fairly well-known supporter of jürgen klinsmann 's gang does n't seem to have such problems .
-lrb- 04.06.2006 -rrb- merkel happy with results after first year in office buoyed by a robust economy , falling unemployment , and a decreasing national debt , german chancellor angela merkel has praised her coalition government after one year in office .

but there 's at least one thing that 's remained unchanged . let 's face it : even before nov .
22 , 2005 , angela merkel 's life did n't exactly look like that of your average gretel .
as leader of germany 's main opposition party , she had tons of meetings with the more or less mighty .
she just did n't have to pay quite as much attention to hairdos and make-up .
she had to worry less about protocol while walking past soldiers on red carpets .
and , yes , she did n't have to lead a country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sauer -lrb- left -rrb- will join his wife on vacation , but he rarely comes along otherwise that 's all changed a bit over the past 365 days .
she 's now constantly in the limelight .
she 's had her apartment in central berlin retrofitted to comply with security standards worthy of a world leader .
she has even less time for her husband , a chemistry professor named joachim sauer who has decided that he 'd rather focus on his own work than accompany his wife at every occasion . sauer has also decided not to talk about his wife .
the chancellor , on the other hand , apparently feels an obligation to share the odd private insight now and then .
on wednesday , the anniversary of her ascension to the chancellery , merkel did decide to respond to reporters from germany 's bild tabloid , who had asked whether her husband had noted any changes in her . " well , the breakfast that i 'm preparing for us is still the same , " merkel said . munching on pretzels the chancellor still has time to prepare breakfast .
surely there are millions of people with far less responsibility who barely manage to gulp down some coffee before they rush out the door . how does she do it ?
or , what 's even more interesting : what does she serve ?
a traditional german breakfast with meats , cheese , jam and soft-boiled eggs ?
one can only hope that her table looks a little more cheerful than the tupperware-laden arrangement that awaits a certain elizabeth ii in the morning . there 's quite a bit of information on merkel 's favorite dishes .
apparently she enjoys potato soup , roulades , stews and schnitzel , and she makes goose for christmas .
merkel clearly was n't willing to go into the details of her breakfast offerings though . maybe the subject 's a little too touchy for her .
after all , she did concede the conservative candidacy for chancellorship to bavarian premier edmund stoiber over breakfast -lrb- with pretzels -rrb- in 2002 .
a pretty smart move , one could say in hindsight , as stoiber lost the election , making merkel 's bid for the chancellorship possible in the 2005 elections . bildunterschrift : it 's not known whether merkel and stoiber -lrb- right -rrb- also had beer with breakfast in 2002 " i really like breakfast , " she recently told a women 's magazine . no wonder . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de angie admits to bad driving german chancellor angela merkel has been criticized for slamming the brakes on government reform and steering the government in the wrong direction after one year in office .
but now there 's a logical explanation .

"
he was released last august . neither the german nor the turkish authorities tried to release him from guantanamo and instead shifted responsibility on to the us government , kurnaz told a special european parliament committee investigating charges of illegal us secret service activities in europe . kurnaz was arrested in pakistan two months after the sept.11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states .
he was handed over to us authorities who took him to guantanamo in january 2002 , saying he was suspected of supporting afghanistan 's former taliban rulers . kurnaz told meps that he went to pakistan to " deepen his -lrb- muslim -rrb- faith " but that he had never done anything illegal .

but there 's at least one thing that 's remained unchanged . let 's face it : even before nov .
22 , 2005 , angela merkel 's life did n't exactly look like that of your average gretel .
as leader of germany 's main opposition party , she had tons of meetings with the more or less mighty .
she just did n't have to pay quite as much attention to hairdos and make-up .
she had to worry less about protocol while walking past soldiers on red carpets .
and , yes , she did n't have to lead a country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sauer -lrb- left -rrb- will join his wife on vacation , but he rarely comes along otherwise that 's all changed a bit over the past 365 days .
she 's now constantly in the limelight .
she 's had her apartment in central berlin retrofitted to comply with security standards worthy of a world leader .
she has even less time for her husband , a chemistry professor named joachim sauer who has decided that he 'd rather focus on his own work than accompany his wife at every occasion . sauer has also decided not to talk about his wife .
the chancellor , on the other hand , apparently feels an obligation to share the odd private insight now and then .
on wednesday , the anniversary of her ascension to the chancellery , merkel did decide to respond to reporters from germany 's bild tabloid , who had asked whether her husband had noted any changes in her . " well , the breakfast that i 'm preparing for us is still the same , " merkel said . munching on pretzels the chancellor still has time to prepare breakfast .
surely there are millions of people with far less responsibility who barely manage to gulp down some coffee before they rush out the door . how does she do it ?
or , what 's even more interesting : what does she serve ?
a traditional german breakfast with meats , cheese , jam and soft-boiled eggs ?
one can only hope that her table looks a little more cheerful than the tupperware-laden arrangement that awaits a certain elizabeth ii in the morning . there 's quite a bit of information on merkel 's favorite dishes .
apparently she enjoys potato soup , roulades , stews and schnitzel , and she makes goose for christmas .
merkel clearly was n't willing to go into the details of her breakfast offerings though . maybe the subject 's a little too touchy for her .
after all , she did concede the conservative candidacy for chancellorship to bavarian premier edmund stoiber over breakfast -lrb- with pretzels -rrb- in 2002 .
a pretty smart move , one could say in hindsight , as stoiber lost the election , making merkel 's bid for the chancellorship possible in the 2005 elections . bildunterschrift : it 's not known whether merkel and stoiber -lrb- right -rrb- also had beer with breakfast in 2002 " i really like breakfast , " she recently told a women 's magazine . no wonder . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de angie admits to bad driving german chancellor angela merkel has been criticized for slamming the brakes on government reform and steering the government in the wrong direction after one year in office .

" perceptional spectrum " is one of steinmeier 's favorite phrases and it says a lot about him .
the foreign minister has used his first year in office , first and foremost , to expand his own perceptional spectrum .
while the 50-year-old lawyer previously spent years sitting inside germany 's chancellery as former chancellor gerhard schröder 's chief-of-staff , he took off on a world trip in stages immediately after switching jobs . he visited south america , the arabian peninsula , southeast asia , central asia and north africa - and realized that a purely euro-atlantic approach to foreign policy is no longer sufficient in the 21st century .
the attention steinmeier pays to emerging regions on all five continents expands germany 's world - even if it 's not always clear right away where a common path may lead .
for now , steinmeier is making connections that might come in handy later . his impartiality and his interest in people and topics that he 's unfamiliar with are characteristics that help him in this regard .
his friendly , relaxed way has made him friends abroad and quickly turned him into the most popular politician of the grand coalition at home .
this happened despite his dry and often awkward way of expressing himself .
take " perceptional spectrum " as an example . his first year in office was also an educational year for steinmeier .
three kidnappings - two in iraq and one in yemen - put the top diplomat and his colleagues to the test .
all three had happy endings , largely due to his level-headed crisis management . the troubled german-american relationship was another construction site for the new government of social and christian democrats .
the chancellor took on this issue herself and steinmeier flanked her .
in general , merkel , a christian democrat , and steinmeier , a social democrat , work surprisingly well together . steinmeier heads to the middle east or holds talks about the iranian nuclear program , providing for continuity in german foreign policy by doing so .
merkel on the other hand deals with her mighty counterparts in washington and moscow and makes adjustments to the foreign policy standpoints of her predecessor .
schröder 's confidante steinmeier no longer has to bear responsibility for this . but he will not be able to evade testimony in front of the parliamentary inquiry in the el masri case in which a lebanese-born german claims to have been kidnapped by cia agents and tortured , as he played a crucial role in his capacity as head of the german chancellery . but what 's steinmeier 's strategy ?
he 's more concerned about energy policy than his predecessor as he thinks that long-term security of energy supplies is a central foreign policy issue .
foreign trade policy is naturally also part of his job and he wants to expand contacts with " key regions of the future " that he 's already visited . beyond that , however , it 's hard to see a holistic strategic concept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 22.11.2006 breakfast at angela 's großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surely a cookie is not enough in the morning reviewing her first year as chancellor , angela merkel revealed wednesday that leading a country - surprise , surprise - pretty much turns one 's life upside down .
but there 's at least one thing that 's remained unchanged . let 's face it : even before nov .
22 , 2005 , angela merkel 's life did n't exactly look like that of your average gretel .
as leader of germany 's main opposition party , she had tons of meetings with the more or less mighty .
she just did n't have to pay quite as much attention to hairdos and make-up .
she had to worry less about protocol while walking past soldiers on red carpets .
and , yes , she did n't have to lead a country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sauer -lrb- left -rrb- will join his wife on vacation , but he rarely comes along otherwise that 's all changed a bit over the past 365 days .
she 's now constantly in the limelight .
she 's had her apartment in central berlin retrofitted to comply with security standards worthy of a world leader .
she has even less time for her husband , a chemistry professor named joachim sauer who has decided that he 'd rather focus on his own work than accompany his wife at every occasion . sauer has also decided not to talk about his wife .
the chancellor , on the other hand , apparently feels an obligation to share the odd private insight now and then .
on wednesday , the anniversary of her ascension to the chancellery , merkel did decide to respond to reporters from germany 's bild tabloid , who had asked whether her husband had noted any changes in her . " well , the breakfast that i 'm preparing for us is still the same , " merkel said . munching on pretzels the chancellor still has time to prepare breakfast .
surely there are millions of people with far less responsibility who barely manage to gulp down some coffee before they rush out the door . how does she do it ?
or , what 's even more interesting : what does she serve ?
a traditional german breakfast with meats , cheese , jam and soft-boiled eggs ?
one can only hope that her table looks a little more cheerful than the tupperware-laden arrangement that awaits a certain elizabeth ii in the morning . there 's quite a bit of information on merkel 's favorite dishes .
apparently she enjoys potato soup , roulades , stews and schnitzel , and she makes goose for christmas .
merkel clearly was n't willing to go into the details of her breakfast offerings though . maybe the subject 's a little too touchy for her .
after all , she did concede the conservative candidacy for chancellorship to bavarian premier edmund stoiber over breakfast -lrb- with pretzels -rrb- in 2002 .
a pretty smart move , one could say in hindsight , as stoiber lost the election , making merkel 's bid for the chancellorship possible in the 2005 elections . bildunterschrift : it 's not known whether merkel and stoiber -lrb- right -rrb- also had beer with breakfast in 2002 " i really like breakfast , " she recently told a women 's magazine . no wonder . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de angie admits to bad driving german chancellor angela merkel has been criticized for slamming the brakes on government reform and steering the government in the wrong direction after one year in office .
but now there 's a logical explanation .
-lrb- 14.11.2006 -rrb- soccer rules the chancellery while many germans soccer fans will be struggling to combine the need to work with the need to watch their team , one fairly well-known supporter of jürgen klinsmann 's gang does n't seem to have such problems .
-lrb- 04.06.2006 -rrb- merkel happy with results after first year in office buoyed by a robust economy , falling unemployment , and a decreasing national debt , german chancellor angela merkel has praised her coalition government after one year in office .

" today 's attack is clearly another attempt to sabotage the development of an independent , sovereign and democratic lebanon , " steinmeier said in a statement on tuesday .
" the german government condemns the attack in the strongest terms .
our thoughts are with the family and friends of the victim .

" acts of terrorism undermine lebanon 's stability , are unacceptable and have no place in a democratic and open society , " he said . former colonial power france called this latest attack on anti-damascus officials a " new attempt to destabilize " lebanon . so did syria itself , which said gemayel 's murder was an " an odious crime ... aimed at destabilizing lebanon and disturbing the civil peace .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 22.11.2006 opinion : looking beyond the euro-atlantic horizon großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier 's first year in office was a tough one at times , deutsche welle 's nina werkhäuser thinks that it 's been a good one overall . " perceptional spectrum " is one of steinmeier 's favorite phrases and it says a lot about him .
the foreign minister has used his first year in office , first and foremost , to expand his own perceptional spectrum .
while the 50-year-old lawyer previously spent years sitting inside germany 's chancellery as former chancellor gerhard schröder 's chief-of-staff , he took off on a world trip in stages immediately after switching jobs . he visited south america , the arabian peninsula , southeast asia , central asia and north africa - and realized that a purely euro-atlantic approach to foreign policy is no longer sufficient in the 21st century .
the attention steinmeier pays to emerging regions on all five continents expands germany 's world - even if it 's not always clear right away where a common path may lead .
for now , steinmeier is making connections that might come in handy later . his impartiality and his interest in people and topics that he 's unfamiliar with are characteristics that help him in this regard .
his friendly , relaxed way has made him friends abroad and quickly turned him into the most popular politician of the grand coalition at home .
this happened despite his dry and often awkward way of expressing himself .
take " perceptional spectrum " as an example . his first year in office was also an educational year for steinmeier .
three kidnappings - two in iraq and one in yemen - put the top diplomat and his colleagues to the test .
all three had happy endings , largely due to his level-headed crisis management . the troubled german-american relationship was another construction site for the new government of social and christian democrats .
the chancellor took on this issue herself and steinmeier flanked her .
in general , merkel , a christian democrat , and steinmeier , a social democrat , work surprisingly well together . steinmeier heads to the middle east or holds talks about the iranian nuclear program , providing for continuity in german foreign policy by doing so .
merkel on the other hand deals with her mighty counterparts in washington and moscow and makes adjustments to the foreign policy standpoints of her predecessor .
schröder 's confidante steinmeier no longer has to bear responsibility for this . but he will not be able to evade testimony in front of the parliamentary inquiry in the el masri case in which a lebanese-born german claims to have been kidnapped by cia agents and tortured , as he played a crucial role in his capacity as head of the german chancellery . but what 's steinmeier 's strategy ?
he 's more concerned about energy policy than his predecessor as he thinks that long-term security of energy supplies is a central foreign policy issue .
foreign trade policy is naturally also part of his job and he wants to expand contacts with " key regions of the future " that he 's already visited . beyond that , however , it 's hard to see a holistic strategic concept .
questions of the day dominate steinmeier 's agenda too often and he remains vague and lacks differentiation with his politeness .
still , his foreign policy is solid , reliable and good overall . nina werkhäuser is dw-radio 's foreign affairs correspondent in berlin -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's new face abroad frank-walter steinmeier , a close ally of outgoing chancellor schröder , is set to be germany 's new foreign minister .
not much is known about the " silent star in schröder 's team , " who largely acted behind the scenes .

the case was later dropped .
weimer said government officials were simply trying to find out who had passed on the information .
he added that this represented a threat to journalists , who could no longer guarantee the anonymity of their sources . government officials on wednesday meanwhile argued that such protection was not possible .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 22.11.2006 breakfast at angela 's großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surely a cookie is not enough in the morning reviewing her first year as chancellor , angela merkel revealed wednesday that leading a country - surprise , surprise - pretty much turns one 's life upside down .
but there 's at least one thing that 's remained unchanged . let 's face it : even before nov .
22 , 2005 , angela merkel 's life did n't exactly look like that of your average gretel .
as leader of germany 's main opposition party , she had tons of meetings with the more or less mighty .
she just did n't have to pay quite as much attention to hairdos and make-up .
she had to worry less about protocol while walking past soldiers on red carpets .
and , yes , she did n't have to lead a country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sauer -lrb- left -rrb- will join his wife on vacation , but he rarely comes along otherwise that 's all changed a bit over the past 365 days .
she 's now constantly in the limelight .
she 's had her apartment in central berlin retrofitted to comply with security standards worthy of a world leader .
she has even less time for her husband , a chemistry professor named joachim sauer who has decided that he 'd rather focus on his own work than accompany his wife at every occasion . sauer has also decided not to talk about his wife .
the chancellor , on the other hand , apparently feels an obligation to share the odd private insight now and then .
on wednesday , the anniversary of her ascension to the chancellery , merkel did decide to respond to reporters from germany 's bild tabloid , who had asked whether her husband had noted any changes in her . " well , the breakfast that i 'm preparing for us is still the same , " merkel said . munching on pretzels the chancellor still has time to prepare breakfast .
surely there are millions of people with far less responsibility who barely manage to gulp down some coffee before they rush out the door . how does she do it ?
or , what 's even more interesting : what does she serve ?
a traditional german breakfast with meats , cheese , jam and soft-boiled eggs ?
one can only hope that her table looks a little more cheerful than the tupperware-laden arrangement that awaits a certain elizabeth ii in the morning . there 's quite a bit of information on merkel 's favorite dishes .
apparently she enjoys potato soup , roulades , stews and schnitzel , and she makes goose for christmas .
merkel clearly was n't willing to go into the details of her breakfast offerings though . maybe the subject 's a little too touchy for her .
after all , she did concede the conservative candidacy for chancellorship to bavarian premier edmund stoiber over breakfast -lrb- with pretzels -rrb- in 2002 .
a pretty smart move , one could say in hindsight , as stoiber lost the election , making merkel 's bid for the chancellorship possible in the 2005 elections . bildunterschrift : it 's not known whether merkel and stoiber -lrb- right -rrb- also had beer with breakfast in 2002 " i really like breakfast , " she recently told a women 's magazine . no wonder . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de angie admits to bad driving german chancellor angela merkel has been criticized for slamming the brakes on government reform and steering the government in the wrong direction after one year in office .
but now there 's a logical explanation .
-lrb- 14.11.2006 -rrb- soccer rules the chancellery while many germans soccer fans will be struggling to combine the need to work with the need to watch their team , one fairly well-known supporter of jürgen klinsmann 's gang does n't seem to have such problems .
-lrb- 04.06.2006 -rrb- merkel happy with results after first year in office buoyed by a robust economy , falling unemployment , and a decreasing national debt , german chancellor angela merkel has praised her coalition government after one year in office .

but there 's at least one thing that 's remained unchanged . let 's face it : even before nov .
22 , 2005 , angela merkel 's life did n't exactly look like that of your average gretel .
as leader of germany 's main opposition party , she had tons of meetings with the more or less mighty .
she just did n't have to pay quite as much attention to hairdos and make-up .
she had to worry less about protocol while walking past soldiers on red carpets .
and , yes , she did n't have to lead a country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sauer -lrb- left -rrb- will join his wife on vacation , but he rarely comes along otherwise that 's all changed a bit over the past 365 days .
she 's now constantly in the limelight .
she 's had her apartment in central berlin retrofitted to comply with security standards worthy of a world leader .
she has even less time for her husband , a chemistry professor named joachim sauer who has decided that he 'd rather focus on his own work than accompany his wife at every occasion . sauer has also decided not to talk about his wife .
the chancellor , on the other hand , apparently feels an obligation to share the odd private insight now and then .
on wednesday , the anniversary of her ascension to the chancellery , merkel did decide to respond to reporters from germany 's bild tabloid , who had asked whether her husband had noted any changes in her . " well , the breakfast that i 'm preparing for us is still the same , " merkel said . munching on pretzels the chancellor still has time to prepare breakfast .
surely there are millions of people with far less responsibility who barely manage to gulp down some coffee before they rush out the door . how does she do it ?
or , what 's even more interesting : what does she serve ?
a traditional german breakfast with meats , cheese , jam and soft-boiled eggs ?
one can only hope that her table looks a little more cheerful than the tupperware-laden arrangement that awaits a certain elizabeth ii in the morning . there 's quite a bit of information on merkel 's favorite dishes .
apparently she enjoys potato soup , roulades , stews and schnitzel , and she makes goose for christmas .
merkel clearly was n't willing to go into the details of her breakfast offerings though . maybe the subject 's a little too touchy for her .
after all , she did concede the conservative candidacy for chancellorship to bavarian premier edmund stoiber over breakfast -lrb- with pretzels -rrb- in 2002 .
a pretty smart move , one could say in hindsight , as stoiber lost the election , making merkel 's bid for the chancellorship possible in the 2005 elections . bildunterschrift : it 's not known whether merkel and stoiber -lrb- right -rrb- also had beer with breakfast in 2002 " i really like breakfast , " she recently told a women 's magazine . no wonder . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de angie admits to bad driving german chancellor angela merkel has been criticized for slamming the brakes on government reform and steering the government in the wrong direction after one year in office .

" perceptional spectrum " is one of steinmeier 's favorite phrases and it says a lot about him .
the foreign minister has used his first year in office , first and foremost , to expand his own perceptional spectrum .
while the 50-year-old lawyer previously spent years sitting inside germany 's chancellery as former chancellor gerhard schröder 's chief-of-staff , he took off on a world trip in stages immediately after switching jobs . he visited south america , the arabian peninsula , southeast asia , central asia and north africa - and realized that a purely euro-atlantic approach to foreign policy is no longer sufficient in the 21st century .
the attention steinmeier pays to emerging regions on all five continents expands germany 's world - even if it 's not always clear right away where a common path may lead .
for now , steinmeier is making connections that might come in handy later . his impartiality and his interest in people and topics that he 's unfamiliar with are characteristics that help him in this regard .
his friendly , relaxed way has made him friends abroad and quickly turned him into the most popular politician of the grand coalition at home .
this happened despite his dry and often awkward way of expressing himself .
take " perceptional spectrum " as an example . his first year in office was also an educational year for steinmeier .
three kidnappings - two in iraq and one in yemen - put the top diplomat and his colleagues to the test .
all three had happy endings , largely due to his level-headed crisis management . the troubled german-american relationship was another construction site for the new government of social and christian democrats .
the chancellor took on this issue herself and steinmeier flanked her .
in general , merkel , a christian democrat , and steinmeier , a social democrat , work surprisingly well together . steinmeier heads to the middle east or holds talks about the iranian nuclear program , providing for continuity in german foreign policy by doing so .
merkel on the other hand deals with her mighty counterparts in washington and moscow and makes adjustments to the foreign policy standpoints of her predecessor .
schröder 's confidante steinmeier no longer has to bear responsibility for this . but he will not be able to evade testimony in front of the parliamentary inquiry in the el masri case in which a lebanese-born german claims to have been kidnapped by cia agents and tortured , as he played a crucial role in his capacity as head of the german chancellery . but what 's steinmeier 's strategy ?
he 's more concerned about energy policy than his predecessor as he thinks that long-term security of energy supplies is a central foreign policy issue .
foreign trade policy is naturally also part of his job and he wants to expand contacts with " key regions of the future " that he 's already visited . beyond that , however , it 's hard to see a holistic strategic concept .
questions of the day dominate steinmeier 's agenda too often and he remains vague and lacks differentiation with his politeness .
still , his foreign policy is solid , reliable and good overall . nina werkhäuser is dw-radio 's foreign affairs correspondent in berlin -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's new face abroad frank-walter steinmeier , a close ally of outgoing chancellor schröder , is set to be germany 's new foreign minister .
not much is known about the " silent star in schröder 's team , " who largely acted behind the scenes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 22.11.2006 " we ca n't afford to leave kids by the wayside " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " strengthening children 's rights helps in taking action against neglect " the german parliament 's commission for children 's concerns this week discussed including children 's rights in the constitution .
in light of recent cases of deaths due to neglect , it 's becoming a pressing issue . dw-world.de spoke with rudi tarneden , a spokesman for unicef deutschland , the german branch of the united nations children 's fund , about what would change in germany if children 's rights were part of the constitution .
dw-world.de : let 's assume that children 's rights will become part of the constitution at some point .
how would those rights be guaranteed ?
rudi tarneden : this past august , during an event hosted by unicef germany and the deutscher kinderschutzbund -lrb- a german lobby organization for the protection of children -rrb- , chancellor angela merkel said for the first time that she could envision including children 's rights in the constitution .
this fall , family minister ursula von der leyen stressed the need again following the cases of child neglect and killing that have recently come to light .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a growing awareness of children 's rights in germany putting children 's rights in the constitution would strengthen young people 's position in society , especially in terms of new policies being drafted - policies that concern children , but also those that affect immigrants and even issues like urban design to make cities more child-friendly .
it would also mean that youth offices could take legal action more quickly and easily in cases of child neglect .
currently , youth office agents are very reluctant to get involved in a family 's private sphere .
parental rights are more respected than children 's rights .
also , there be would a change of attitude from " raising children is a private , family matter and we 'll get involved only in an emergency " to " children and the raising of them are a social concern whereby both the state and parents bear responsibility . "
yet , in the recent cases of child deaths due to neglect , youth offices knew that at least some of the families were high-risk , but they did n't get involved .
were n't those emergencies ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts warn that child neglect and abuse occur in all levels of society that 's the problem .
those are the cases in which everyone is aware of what 's going on , but no one does anything .
if the state were to get more involved , people in society would take a closer look and take action , and vice versa .
unicef recently published a report that focuses on child abuse in industrialized countries .
for germany , the report shows that on the average , two children die per week as the result of abuse or neglect .
but that 's just the tip of the iceberg - there are plenty of children who manage to live , but who suffer physical and psychological violence as they grow up .
they , of course , are not included in those numbers .
i should make clear that laws will not stop child neglect and abuse , but that new laws could give agencies more possibilities for taking action .
things have improved in the past few decades , but child mortality rates due to neglect are still too high .
if laws ca n't do it all , how can people 's attitudes become more attuned to the needs of children ?
in 2000 , a ban on physical punishment to reprimand children was drafted .
there were major discussions on the issue and whether or not parents should be forbidden to spank or slap their children .
but the fact is that this new law helped to readjust people 's attitudes toward children - namely , that the social norms of respect and grace that adults expect in their dealings with one another should also be expected in behavior towards children .
such laws herald long-term processes in which attitudes toward children gradually change for the better .
one should n't underestimate their psychological effects .
you said adding children 's rights to the constitution will not prevent child abuse .
is n't money also an issue - as budgets for kindergarten care have been drastically cut and employment is high ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all kids need good schools , tarneden said the gap between the rich and the poor is widening dramatically in germany .
more and more children are being socially excluded and are growing up in poverty and in families in which long-term unemployment reigns .
these children do n't have the role models they need because their parents have resigned themselves to dreadful circumstances , or because they ca n't get the training they need , or ca n't attend decent schools .
it 's precisely in the " bad " city districts where good schools should be located .
a crisis is brewing here , and we believe that tackling these problems now should be a priority .
why do you believe the push for improving children 's rights is coming now ?
the ratification of the unicef convention on the rights of the child a decade and a half ago has had effects over time .
also , people in germany are now discussing the social exclusion of children and how children are growing up in poverty .
we 're realizing that we just ca n't afford to leave kids by the wayside .
we see that in all the talks about poor education in this country .
the third reason , of course , is that all the media attention on these horrible cases of child abuse has prompted politicians to say that action needs to be taken to make germany a more hospitable place for children .
what do you mean exactly by " we 're realizing we ca n't afford to leave children by the wayside . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one in 10 german students leave school without a degree right now , 10 percent of each class of school kids quits before receiving a degree .
that translates into tens of thousands of young people each year .
what are they going to do later ?
how are they going to live ?
we 're living on borrowed time .
not only does that mean major problems for the kids themselves in finding a job , but it presents a huge problem for society as a whole .
would there be a list of requirements to ensure that children are being protected ?
who would keep track of upholding the law should children 's rights be enshrined in the constitution by 2009 , as some expect ?
that 's the big question right now and the major issue that must be discussed .
should there be some sort of agency in each german state to oversee whether children 's rights are being upheld ?
who will report back on the issue ?
how will proposed laws be reviewed as to whether they would help or harm children ?
those are the really exciting questions , but we have n't reached that point yet . louisa schaefer interviewed rudi tarneden send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts shed light on germany 's poverty and welfare woes new studies in germany shed light on the twin problems of growing poverty and a deficit in the child-welfare system that could be related .

in light of recent cases of deaths due to neglect , it 's becoming a pressing issue . dw-world.de spoke with rudi tarneden , a spokesman for unicef deutschland , the german branch of the united nations children 's fund , about what would change in germany if children 's rights were part of the constitution .
dw-world.de : let 's assume that children 's rights will become part of the constitution at some point .
how would those rights be guaranteed ?
rudi tarneden : this past august , during an event hosted by unicef germany and the deutscher kinderschutzbund -lrb- a german lobby organization for the protection of children -rrb- , chancellor angela merkel said for the first time that she could envision including children 's rights in the constitution .
this fall , family minister ursula von der leyen stressed the need again following the cases of child neglect and killing that have recently come to light .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a growing awareness of children 's rights in germany putting children 's rights in the constitution would strengthen young people 's position in society , especially in terms of new policies being drafted - policies that concern children , but also those that affect immigrants and even issues like urban design to make cities more child-friendly .
it would also mean that youth offices could take legal action more quickly and easily in cases of child neglect .
currently , youth office agents are very reluctant to get involved in a family 's private sphere .
parental rights are more respected than children 's rights .
also , there be would a change of attitude from " raising children is a private , family matter and we 'll get involved only in an emergency " to " children and the raising of them are a social concern whereby both the state and parents bear responsibility . "
yet , in the recent cases of child deaths due to neglect , youth offices knew that at least some of the families were high-risk , but they did n't get involved .
were n't those emergencies ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts warn that child neglect and abuse occur in all levels of society that 's the problem .
those are the cases in which everyone is aware of what 's going on , but no one does anything .
if the state were to get more involved , people in society would take a closer look and take action , and vice versa .
unicef recently published a report that focuses on child abuse in industrialized countries .
for germany , the report shows that on the average , two children die per week as the result of abuse or neglect .
but that 's just the tip of the iceberg - there are plenty of children who manage to live , but who suffer physical and psychological violence as they grow up .
they , of course , are not included in those numbers .
i should make clear that laws will not stop child neglect and abuse , but that new laws could give agencies more possibilities for taking action .
things have improved in the past few decades , but child mortality rates due to neglect are still too high .
if laws ca n't do it all , how can people 's attitudes become more attuned to the needs of children ?
in 2000 , a ban on physical punishment to reprimand children was drafted .
there were major discussions on the issue and whether or not parents should be forbidden to spank or slap their children .
but the fact is that this new law helped to readjust people 's attitudes toward children - namely , that the social norms of respect and grace that adults expect in their dealings with one another should also be expected in behavior towards children .
such laws herald long-term processes in which attitudes toward children gradually change for the better .
one should n't underestimate their psychological effects .
you said adding children 's rights to the constitution will not prevent child abuse .
is n't money also an issue - as budgets for kindergarten care have been drastically cut and employment is high ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all kids need good schools , tarneden said the gap between the rich and the poor is widening dramatically in germany .
more and more children are being socially excluded and are growing up in poverty and in families in which long-term unemployment reigns .
these children do n't have the role models they need because their parents have resigned themselves to dreadful circumstances , or because they ca n't get the training they need , or ca n't attend decent schools .
it 's precisely in the " bad " city districts where good schools should be located .
a crisis is brewing here , and we believe that tackling these problems now should be a priority .
why do you believe the push for improving children 's rights is coming now ?
the ratification of the unicef convention on the rights of the child a decade and a half ago has had effects over time .
also , people in germany are now discussing the social exclusion of children and how children are growing up in poverty .
we 're realizing that we just ca n't afford to leave kids by the wayside .
we see that in all the talks about poor education in this country .
the third reason , of course , is that all the media attention on these horrible cases of child abuse has prompted politicians to say that action needs to be taken to make germany a more hospitable place for children .
what do you mean exactly by " we 're realizing we ca n't afford to leave children by the wayside . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one in 10 german students leave school without a degree right now , 10 percent of each class of school kids quits before receiving a degree .
that translates into tens of thousands of young people each year .
what are they going to do later ?
how are they going to live ?
we 're living on borrowed time .
not only does that mean major problems for the kids themselves in finding a job , but it presents a huge problem for society as a whole .
would there be a list of requirements to ensure that children are being protected ?
who would keep track of upholding the law should children 's rights be enshrined in the constitution by 2009 , as some expect ?
that 's the big question right now and the major issue that must be discussed .
should there be some sort of agency in each german state to oversee whether children 's rights are being upheld ?
who will report back on the issue ?
how will proposed laws be reviewed as to whether they would help or harm children ?
those are the really exciting questions , but we have n't reached that point yet . louisa schaefer interviewed rudi tarneden send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts shed light on germany 's poverty and welfare woes new studies in germany shed light on the twin problems of growing poverty and a deficit in the child-welfare system that could be related .

" perceptional spectrum " is one of steinmeier 's favorite phrases and it says a lot about him .
the foreign minister has used his first year in office , first and foremost , to expand his own perceptional spectrum .
while the 50-year-old lawyer previously spent years sitting inside germany 's chancellery as former chancellor gerhard schröder 's chief-of-staff , he took off on a world trip in stages immediately after switching jobs . he visited south america , the arabian peninsula , southeast asia , central asia and north africa - and realized that a purely euro-atlantic approach to foreign policy is no longer sufficient in the 21st century .
the attention steinmeier pays to emerging regions on all five continents expands germany 's world - even if it 's not always clear right away where a common path may lead .
for now , steinmeier is making connections that might come in handy later . his impartiality and his interest in people and topics that he 's unfamiliar with are characteristics that help him in this regard .
his friendly , relaxed way has made him friends abroad and quickly turned him into the most popular politician of the grand coalition at home .
this happened despite his dry and often awkward way of expressing himself .
take " perceptional spectrum " as an example . his first year in office was also an educational year for steinmeier .
three kidnappings - two in iraq and one in yemen - put the top diplomat and his colleagues to the test .
all three had happy endings , largely due to his level-headed crisis management . the troubled german-american relationship was another construction site for the new government of social and christian democrats .
the chancellor took on this issue herself and steinmeier flanked her .
in general , merkel , a christian democrat , and steinmeier , a social democrat , work surprisingly well together . steinmeier heads to the middle east or holds talks about the iranian nuclear program , providing for continuity in german foreign policy by doing so .
merkel on the other hand deals with her mighty counterparts in washington and moscow and makes adjustments to the foreign policy standpoints of her predecessor .
schröder 's confidante steinmeier no longer has to bear responsibility for this . but he will not be able to evade testimony in front of the parliamentary inquiry in the el masri case in which a lebanese-born german claims to have been kidnapped by cia agents and tortured , as he played a crucial role in his capacity as head of the german chancellery . but what 's steinmeier 's strategy ?
he 's more concerned about energy policy than his predecessor as he thinks that long-term security of energy supplies is a central foreign policy issue .
foreign trade policy is naturally also part of his job and he wants to expand contacts with " key regions of the future " that he 's already visited . beyond that , however , it 's hard to see a holistic strategic concept .

" today 's attack is clearly another attempt to sabotage the development of an independent , sovereign and democratic lebanon , " steinmeier said in a statement on tuesday .

the case was later dropped .
weimer said government officials were simply trying to find out who had passed on the information .
he added that this represented a threat to journalists , who could no longer guarantee the anonymity of their sources . government officials on wednesday meanwhile argued that such protection was not possible . " a journalist can commit a crime if he publishes state secrets that have been divulged by a civil servant , " said lutz diwell , a deputy minister in germany 's department of justice . judges , on the other hand , questioned whether journalists could still be held accountable as accomplices once the secrets had been revealed by government officials . a ruling in the case is not expected until 2007 . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press council celebrates 50 years monday is the 50th anniversary of the german press council , an independent and self-regulating organization which was based on the british press council model .

" perceptional spectrum " is one of steinmeier 's favorite phrases and it says a lot about him .
the foreign minister has used his first year in office , first and foremost , to expand his own perceptional spectrum .
while the 50-year-old lawyer previously spent years sitting inside germany 's chancellery as former chancellor gerhard schröder 's chief-of-staff , he took off on a world trip in stages immediately after switching jobs . he visited south america , the arabian peninsula , southeast asia , central asia and north africa - and realized that a purely euro-atlantic approach to foreign policy is no longer sufficient in the 21st century .
the attention steinmeier pays to emerging regions on all five continents expands germany 's world - even if it 's not always clear right away where a common path may lead .
for now , steinmeier is making connections that might come in handy later . his impartiality and his interest in people and topics that he 's unfamiliar with are characteristics that help him in this regard .
his friendly , relaxed way has made him friends abroad and quickly turned him into the most popular politician of the grand coalition at home .
this happened despite his dry and often awkward way of expressing himself .
take " perceptional spectrum " as an example . his first year in office was also an educational year for steinmeier .
three kidnappings - two in iraq and one in yemen - put the top diplomat and his colleagues to the test .
all three had happy endings , largely due to his level-headed crisis management . the troubled german-american relationship was another construction site for the new government of social and christian democrats .
the chancellor took on this issue herself and steinmeier flanked her .
in general , merkel , a christian democrat , and steinmeier , a social democrat , work surprisingly well together . steinmeier heads to the middle east or holds talks about the iranian nuclear program , providing for continuity in german foreign policy by doing so .
merkel on the other hand deals with her mighty counterparts in washington and moscow and makes adjustments to the foreign policy standpoints of her predecessor .
schröder 's confidante steinmeier no longer has to bear responsibility for this . but he will not be able to evade testimony in front of the parliamentary inquiry in the el masri case in which a lebanese-born german claims to have been kidnapped by cia agents and tortured , as he played a crucial role in his capacity as head of the german chancellery . but what 's steinmeier 's strategy ?
he 's more concerned about energy policy than his predecessor as he thinks that long-term security of energy supplies is a central foreign policy issue .
foreign trade policy is naturally also part of his job and he wants to expand contacts with " key regions of the future " that he 's already visited . beyond that , however , it 's hard to see a holistic strategic concept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 22.11.2006 " we ca n't afford to leave kids by the wayside " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " strengthening children 's rights helps in taking action against neglect " the german parliament 's commission for children 's concerns this week discussed including children 's rights in the constitution .
in light of recent cases of deaths due to neglect , it 's becoming a pressing issue . dw-world.de spoke with rudi tarneden , a spokesman for unicef deutschland , the german branch of the united nations children 's fund , about what would change in germany if children 's rights were part of the constitution .
dw-world.de : let 's assume that children 's rights will become part of the constitution at some point .
how would those rights be guaranteed ?
rudi tarneden : this past august , during an event hosted by unicef germany and the deutscher kinderschutzbund -lrb- a german lobby organization for the protection of children -rrb- , chancellor angela merkel said for the first time that she could envision including children 's rights in the constitution .
this fall , family minister ursula von der leyen stressed the need again following the cases of child neglect and killing that have recently come to light .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a growing awareness of children 's rights in germany putting children 's rights in the constitution would strengthen young people 's position in society , especially in terms of new policies being drafted - policies that concern children , but also those that affect immigrants and even issues like urban design to make cities more child-friendly .
it would also mean that youth offices could take legal action more quickly and easily in cases of child neglect .
currently , youth office agents are very reluctant to get involved in a family 's private sphere .
parental rights are more respected than children 's rights .
also , there be would a change of attitude from " raising children is a private , family matter and we 'll get involved only in an emergency " to " children and the raising of them are a social concern whereby both the state and parents bear responsibility . "
yet , in the recent cases of child deaths due to neglect , youth offices knew that at least some of the families were high-risk , but they did n't get involved .
were n't those emergencies ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts warn that child neglect and abuse occur in all levels of society that 's the problem .
those are the cases in which everyone is aware of what 's going on , but no one does anything .
if the state were to get more involved , people in society would take a closer look and take action , and vice versa .
unicef recently published a report that focuses on child abuse in industrialized countries .
for germany , the report shows that on the average , two children die per week as the result of abuse or neglect .
but that 's just the tip of the iceberg - there are plenty of children who manage to live , but who suffer physical and psychological violence as they grow up .
they , of course , are not included in those numbers .
i should make clear that laws will not stop child neglect and abuse , but that new laws could give agencies more possibilities for taking action .
things have improved in the past few decades , but child mortality rates due to neglect are still too high .
if laws ca n't do it all , how can people 's attitudes become more attuned to the needs of children ?
in 2000 , a ban on physical punishment to reprimand children was drafted .
there were major discussions on the issue and whether or not parents should be forbidden to spank or slap their children .
but the fact is that this new law helped to readjust people 's attitudes toward children - namely , that the social norms of respect and grace that adults expect in their dealings with one another should also be expected in behavior towards children .
such laws herald long-term processes in which attitudes toward children gradually change for the better .
one should n't underestimate their psychological effects .
you said adding children 's rights to the constitution will not prevent child abuse .
is n't money also an issue - as budgets for kindergarten care have been drastically cut and employment is high ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all kids need good schools , tarneden said the gap between the rich and the poor is widening dramatically in germany .
more and more children are being socially excluded and are growing up in poverty and in families in which long-term unemployment reigns .
these children do n't have the role models they need because their parents have resigned themselves to dreadful circumstances , or because they ca n't get the training they need , or ca n't attend decent schools .
it 's precisely in the " bad " city districts where good schools should be located .
a crisis is brewing here , and we believe that tackling these problems now should be a priority .
why do you believe the push for improving children 's rights is coming now ?
the ratification of the unicef convention on the rights of the child a decade and a half ago has had effects over time .
also , people in germany are now discussing the social exclusion of children and how children are growing up in poverty .
we 're realizing that we just ca n't afford to leave kids by the wayside .
we see that in all the talks about poor education in this country .
the third reason , of course , is that all the media attention on these horrible cases of child abuse has prompted politicians to say that action needs to be taken to make germany a more hospitable place for children .
what do you mean exactly by " we 're realizing we ca n't afford to leave children by the wayside . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one in 10 german students leave school without a degree right now , 10 percent of each class of school kids quits before receiving a degree .
that translates into tens of thousands of young people each year .
what are they going to do later ?
how are they going to live ?
we 're living on borrowed time .
not only does that mean major problems for the kids themselves in finding a job , but it presents a huge problem for society as a whole .
would there be a list of requirements to ensure that children are being protected ?
who would keep track of upholding the law should children 's rights be enshrined in the constitution by 2009 , as some expect ?
that 's the big question right now and the major issue that must be discussed .
should there be some sort of agency in each german state to oversee whether children 's rights are being upheld ?
who will report back on the issue ?
how will proposed laws be reviewed as to whether they would help or harm children ?
those are the really exciting questions , but we have n't reached that point yet . louisa schaefer interviewed rudi tarneden send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts shed light on germany 's poverty and welfare woes new studies in germany shed light on the twin problems of growing poverty and a deficit in the child-welfare system that could be related .

but there 's at least one thing that 's remained unchanged . let 's face it : even before nov .
22 , 2005 , angela merkel 's life did n't exactly look like that of your average gretel .
as leader of germany 's main opposition party , she had tons of meetings with the more or less mighty .
she just did n't have to pay quite as much attention to hairdos and make-up .
she had to worry less about protocol while walking past soldiers on red carpets .
and , yes , she did n't have to lead a country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sauer -lrb- left -rrb- will join his wife on vacation , but he rarely comes along otherwise that 's all changed a bit over the past 365 days .
she 's now constantly in the limelight .
she 's had her apartment in central berlin retrofitted to comply with security standards worthy of a world leader .
she has even less time for her husband , a chemistry professor named joachim sauer who has decided that he 'd rather focus on his own work than accompany his wife at every occasion . sauer has also decided not to talk about his wife .
the chancellor , on the other hand , apparently feels an obligation to share the odd private insight now and then .
on wednesday , the anniversary of her ascension to the chancellery , merkel did decide to respond to reporters from germany 's bild tabloid , who had asked whether her husband had noted any changes in her . " well , the breakfast that i 'm preparing for us is still the same , " merkel said . munching on pretzels the chancellor still has time to prepare breakfast .
surely there are millions of people with far less responsibility who barely manage to gulp down some coffee before they rush out the door . how does she do it ?
or , what 's even more interesting : what does she serve ?
a traditional german breakfast with meats , cheese , jam and soft-boiled eggs ?
one can only hope that her table looks a little more cheerful than the tupperware-laden arrangement that awaits a certain elizabeth ii in the morning . there 's quite a bit of information on merkel 's favorite dishes .
apparently she enjoys potato soup , roulades , stews and schnitzel , and she makes goose for christmas .
merkel clearly was n't willing to go into the details of her breakfast offerings though . maybe the subject 's a little too touchy for her .
after all , she did concede the conservative candidacy for chancellorship to bavarian premier edmund stoiber over breakfast -lrb- with pretzels -rrb- in 2002 .
a pretty smart move , one could say in hindsight , as stoiber lost the election , making merkel 's bid for the chancellorship possible in the 2005 elections . bildunterschrift : it 's not known whether merkel and stoiber -lrb- right -rrb- also had beer with breakfast in 2002 " i really like breakfast , " she recently told a women 's magazine . no wonder . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de angie admits to bad driving german chancellor angela merkel has been criticized for slamming the brakes on government reform and steering the government in the wrong direction after one year in office .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 22.11.2006 opinion : looking beyond the euro-atlantic horizon großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier 's first year in office was a tough one at times , deutsche welle 's nina werkhäuser thinks that it 's been a good one overall . " perceptional spectrum " is one of steinmeier 's favorite phrases and it says a lot about him .
the foreign minister has used his first year in office , first and foremost , to expand his own perceptional spectrum .
while the 50-year-old lawyer previously spent years sitting inside germany 's chancellery as former chancellor gerhard schröder 's chief-of-staff , he took off on a world trip in stages immediately after switching jobs . he visited south america , the arabian peninsula , southeast asia , central asia and north africa - and realized that a purely euro-atlantic approach to foreign policy is no longer sufficient in the 21st century .
the attention steinmeier pays to emerging regions on all five continents expands germany 's world - even if it 's not always clear right away where a common path may lead .
for now , steinmeier is making connections that might come in handy later . his impartiality and his interest in people and topics that he 's unfamiliar with are characteristics that help him in this regard .
his friendly , relaxed way has made him friends abroad and quickly turned him into the most popular politician of the grand coalition at home .
this happened despite his dry and often awkward way of expressing himself .
take " perceptional spectrum " as an example . his first year in office was also an educational year for steinmeier .
three kidnappings - two in iraq and one in yemen - put the top diplomat and his colleagues to the test .
all three had happy endings , largely due to his level-headed crisis management . the troubled german-american relationship was another construction site for the new government of social and christian democrats .
the chancellor took on this issue herself and steinmeier flanked her .
in general , merkel , a christian democrat , and steinmeier , a social democrat , work surprisingly well together . steinmeier heads to the middle east or holds talks about the iranian nuclear program , providing for continuity in german foreign policy by doing so .
merkel on the other hand deals with her mighty counterparts in washington and moscow and makes adjustments to the foreign policy standpoints of her predecessor .
schröder 's confidante steinmeier no longer has to bear responsibility for this . but he will not be able to evade testimony in front of the parliamentary inquiry in the el masri case in which a lebanese-born german claims to have been kidnapped by cia agents and tortured , as he played a crucial role in his capacity as head of the german chancellery . but what 's steinmeier 's strategy ?
he 's more concerned about energy policy than his predecessor as he thinks that long-term security of energy supplies is a central foreign policy issue .
foreign trade policy is naturally also part of his job and he wants to expand contacts with " key regions of the future " that he 's already visited . beyond that , however , it 's hard to see a holistic strategic concept .
questions of the day dominate steinmeier 's agenda too often and he remains vague and lacks differentiation with his politeness .
still , his foreign policy is solid , reliable and good overall . nina werkhäuser is dw-radio 's foreign affairs correspondent in berlin -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's new face abroad frank-walter steinmeier , a close ally of outgoing chancellor schröder , is set to be germany 's new foreign minister .
not much is known about the " silent star in schröder 's team , " who largely acted behind the scenes .

but there 's at least one thing that 's remained unchanged . let 's face it : even before nov .
22 , 2005 , angela merkel 's life did n't exactly look like that of your average gretel .
as leader of germany 's main opposition party , she had tons of meetings with the more or less mighty .
she just did n't have to pay quite as much attention to hairdos and make-up .
she had to worry less about protocol while walking past soldiers on red carpets .
and , yes , she did n't have to lead a country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sauer -lrb- left -rrb- will join his wife on vacation , but he rarely comes along otherwise that 's all changed a bit over the past 365 days .
she 's now constantly in the limelight .
she 's had her apartment in central berlin retrofitted to comply with security standards worthy of a world leader .
she has even less time for her husband , a chemistry professor named joachim sauer who has decided that he 'd rather focus on his own work than accompany his wife at every occasion . sauer has also decided not to talk about his wife .
the chancellor , on the other hand , apparently feels an obligation to share the odd private insight now and then .
on wednesday , the anniversary of her ascension to the chancellery , merkel did decide to respond to reporters from germany 's bild tabloid , who had asked whether her husband had noted any changes in her . " well , the breakfast that i 'm preparing for us is still the same , " merkel said . munching on pretzels the chancellor still has time to prepare breakfast .
surely there are millions of people with far less responsibility who barely manage to gulp down some coffee before they rush out the door . how does she do it ?
or , what 's even more interesting : what does she serve ?
a traditional german breakfast with meats , cheese , jam and soft-boiled eggs ?
one can only hope that her table looks a little more cheerful than the tupperware-laden arrangement that awaits a certain elizabeth ii in the morning . there 's quite a bit of information on merkel 's favorite dishes .
apparently she enjoys potato soup , roulades , stews and schnitzel , and she makes goose for christmas .
merkel clearly was n't willing to go into the details of her breakfast offerings though . maybe the subject 's a little too touchy for her .
after all , she did concede the conservative candidacy for chancellorship to bavarian premier edmund stoiber over breakfast -lrb- with pretzels -rrb- in 2002 .
a pretty smart move , one could say in hindsight , as stoiber lost the election , making merkel 's bid for the chancellorship possible in the 2005 elections . bildunterschrift : it 's not known whether merkel and stoiber -lrb- right -rrb- also had beer with breakfast in 2002 " i really like breakfast , " she recently told a women 's magazine . no wonder . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de angie admits to bad driving german chancellor angela merkel has been criticized for slamming the brakes on government reform and steering the government in the wrong direction after one year in office .

the german government has been adamant that the 7.5-percent stake being put up for sale should remain in german hands and must not be allowed to fall into french or russian hands . france is already represented in eads via a 30-percent interest shared by the state holding company sogeade and media group lagardere . russia and spain also have stakes in the aerospace consortium - russia via state-owned bank vneshtorgbank , which bought a 5.02-percent stake in september , and spain through the sepi holding group , which owns 5.48 percent . just after midday wednesday on the paris stock exchange , eads shares were showing a gain of 4.38 percent at 23.83 euros -lrb- $ 30.60 -rrb- , while in frankfurt , daimlerchrysler 's stock were showing a loss of 0.38 percent at 46.66 euros . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus decision on a350 looms amid us-eu trade dispute airbus has said it would not launch a new medium-sized jetliner before completing its restructuring plan .

22 as she took the reins of an unwieldy " grand coalition " government after an inconclusive general election . the result , a marriage of merkel 's conservative christian union and its chief political rival , the social democrats of her predecessor gerhard schröder , has tested her leadership abilities to the limit . lacking schröder 's natural charisma , the trained physicist has instead relied on meticulous preparation , gentle humor and a modest style to lead europe 's most populous country and biggest economic power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : known for her sober approach to government , merkel will still celebrate her one year anniversary merkel , 52 , even dispensed with the champagne traditionally served when the coalition agreement is signed , pouring mineral water instead in a sign of a new sobriety in german politics after the often flamboyant schröder . she will nevertheless throw a small cocktail party on wednesday evening to thank the cabinet " for the good cooperation and good atmosphere " of the last year , her spokesman ulrich wilhelm said . foreign policy sucesses merkel has racked up her biggest triumphs in foreign policy , kicking off the year with a hard-fought compromise on the european union budget that won her fans across the bloc . she also improved germany 's relationship with the bush administration , which was strained after germany 's refusal to join the us-led coalition in iraq . merkel also altered what was seen as schröder 's too-cozy relations with russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has patched up the relationship with us president george w. bush merkel has made a point of wooing president george w. bush and vladimir putin while taking each to task for human rights violations in guantanamo bay and chechnya - stances that have won cheers at home . military missions to monitor the first elections in four decades in the democratic republic of congo and an unprecedented postwar foray into the middle east to halt the flow of arms to hezbollah in lebanon have boosted germany 's stature . and with germany set to take over the presidencies of the group of eight most industrialized nations and the european union on jan .
1 , merkel will find herself under the most intense scrutiny of her career . merkel less popular at home yet at home , surveys show only a third of the country supports merkel 's conservatives , their lowest score since 2000 and the first time that a sitting chancellor has failed to score popularity points from an economic upturn . after initial euphoria , the public has expressed frustration with merkel 's slowly-but-surely " policy of small steps " in which she turns her microscope on each reform issue - health care , pensions , taxes - with hair-splitting intensity . " there is disappointment everywhere that this coalition has not used its large majorities in the lower and upper houses of parliament to perform great deeds , " the conservative daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung said this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sales tax increase from 16 to 19 percent is unpopular in germany beyond this tentative approach , germans are also wary about the resilience of the nascent economic recovery after four years of double-digit unemployment rates . a planned hike in value-added tax in january will make consumer goods more expensive across the board and potentially snuff out the economic upswing . and a growing gap between rich and poor has soured the mood and damaged the credibility of the major parties . dw staff / afp -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel emerges tested but unbowed after first year in office german chancellor angela merkel has had a trying first year in charge , holding together a fractious coalition government , presiding over a fall in unemployment and thawing relations with washington .

22 as she took the reins of an unwieldy " grand coalition " government after an inconclusive general election . the result , a marriage of merkel 's conservative christian union and its chief political rival , the social democrats of her predecessor gerhard schröder , has tested her leadership abilities to the limit . lacking schröder 's natural charisma , the trained physicist has instead relied on meticulous preparation , gentle humor and a modest style to lead europe 's most populous country and biggest economic power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : known for her sober approach to government , merkel will still celebrate her one year anniversary merkel , 52 , even dispensed with the champagne traditionally served when the coalition agreement is signed , pouring mineral water instead in a sign of a new sobriety in german politics after the often flamboyant schröder . she will nevertheless throw a small cocktail party on wednesday evening to thank the cabinet " for the good cooperation and good atmosphere " of the last year , her spokesman ulrich wilhelm said . foreign policy sucesses merkel has racked up her biggest triumphs in foreign policy , kicking off the year with a hard-fought compromise on the european union budget that won her fans across the bloc . she also improved germany 's relationship with the bush administration , which was strained after germany 's refusal to join the us-led coalition in iraq . merkel also altered what was seen as schröder 's too-cozy relations with russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has patched up the relationship with us president george w. bush merkel has made a point of wooing president george w. bush and vladimir putin while taking each to task for human rights violations in guantanamo bay and chechnya - stances that have won cheers at home . military missions to monitor the first elections in four decades in the democratic republic of congo and an unprecedented postwar foray into the middle east to halt the flow of arms to hezbollah in lebanon have boosted germany 's stature . and with germany set to take over the presidencies of the group of eight most industrialized nations and the european union on jan .
1 , merkel will find herself under the most intense scrutiny of her career . merkel less popular at home yet at home , surveys show only a third of the country supports merkel 's conservatives , their lowest score since 2000 and the first time that a sitting chancellor has failed to score popularity points from an economic upturn . after initial euphoria , the public has expressed frustration with merkel 's slowly-but-surely " policy of small steps " in which she turns her microscope on each reform issue - health care , pensions , taxes - with hair-splitting intensity . " there is disappointment everywhere that this coalition has not used its large majorities in the lower and upper houses of parliament to perform great deeds , " the conservative daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung said this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sales tax increase from 16 to 19 percent is unpopular in germany beyond this tentative approach , germans are also wary about the resilience of the nascent economic recovery after four years of double-digit unemployment rates . a planned hike in value-added tax in january will make consumer goods more expensive across the board and potentially snuff out the economic upswing . and a growing gap between rich and poor has soured the mood and damaged the credibility of the major parties . dw staff / afp -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel emerges tested but unbowed after first year in office german chancellor angela merkel has had a trying first year in charge , holding together a fractious coalition government , presiding over a fall in unemployment and thawing relations with washington .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 22.11.2006 " we ca n't afford to leave kids by the wayside " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " strengthening children 's rights helps in taking action against neglect " the german parliament 's commission for children 's concerns this week discussed including children 's rights in the constitution .
in light of recent cases of deaths due to neglect , it 's becoming a pressing issue . dw-world.de spoke with rudi tarneden , a spokesman for unicef deutschland , the german branch of the united nations children 's fund , about what would change in germany if children 's rights were part of the constitution .
dw-world.de : let 's assume that children 's rights will become part of the constitution at some point .
how would those rights be guaranteed ?
rudi tarneden : this past august , during an event hosted by unicef germany and the deutscher kinderschutzbund -lrb- a german lobby organization for the protection of children -rrb- , chancellor angela merkel said for the first time that she could envision including children 's rights in the constitution .
this fall , family minister ursula von der leyen stressed the need again following the cases of child neglect and killing that have recently come to light .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a growing awareness of children 's rights in germany putting children 's rights in the constitution would strengthen young people 's position in society , especially in terms of new policies being drafted - policies that concern children , but also those that affect immigrants and even issues like urban design to make cities more child-friendly .
it would also mean that youth offices could take legal action more quickly and easily in cases of child neglect .
currently , youth office agents are very reluctant to get involved in a family 's private sphere .
parental rights are more respected than children 's rights .
also , there be would a change of attitude from " raising children is a private , family matter and we 'll get involved only in an emergency " to " children and the raising of them are a social concern whereby both the state and parents bear responsibility . "
yet , in the recent cases of child deaths due to neglect , youth offices knew that at least some of the families were high-risk , but they did n't get involved .
were n't those emergencies ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts warn that child neglect and abuse occur in all levels of society that 's the problem .
those are the cases in which everyone is aware of what 's going on , but no one does anything .
if the state were to get more involved , people in society would take a closer look and take action , and vice versa .
unicef recently published a report that focuses on child abuse in industrialized countries .
for germany , the report shows that on the average , two children die per week as the result of abuse or neglect .
but that 's just the tip of the iceberg - there are plenty of children who manage to live , but who suffer physical and psychological violence as they grow up .
they , of course , are not included in those numbers .
i should make clear that laws will not stop child neglect and abuse , but that new laws could give agencies more possibilities for taking action .
things have improved in the past few decades , but child mortality rates due to neglect are still too high .
if laws ca n't do it all , how can people 's attitudes become more attuned to the needs of children ?
in 2000 , a ban on physical punishment to reprimand children was drafted .
there were major discussions on the issue and whether or not parents should be forbidden to spank or slap their children .
but the fact is that this new law helped to readjust people 's attitudes toward children - namely , that the social norms of respect and grace that adults expect in their dealings with one another should also be expected in behavior towards children .
such laws herald long-term processes in which attitudes toward children gradually change for the better .
one should n't underestimate their psychological effects .
you said adding children 's rights to the constitution will not prevent child abuse .
is n't money also an issue - as budgets for kindergarten care have been drastically cut and employment is high ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all kids need good schools , tarneden said the gap between the rich and the poor is widening dramatically in germany .
more and more children are being socially excluded and are growing up in poverty and in families in which long-term unemployment reigns .
these children do n't have the role models they need because their parents have resigned themselves to dreadful circumstances , or because they ca n't get the training they need , or ca n't attend decent schools .
it 's precisely in the " bad " city districts where good schools should be located .
a crisis is brewing here , and we believe that tackling these problems now should be a priority .
why do you believe the push for improving children 's rights is coming now ?
the ratification of the unicef convention on the rights of the child a decade and a half ago has had effects over time .
also , people in germany are now discussing the social exclusion of children and how children are growing up in poverty .
we 're realizing that we just ca n't afford to leave kids by the wayside .
we see that in all the talks about poor education in this country .
the third reason , of course , is that all the media attention on these horrible cases of child abuse has prompted politicians to say that action needs to be taken to make germany a more hospitable place for children .
what do you mean exactly by " we 're realizing we ca n't afford to leave children by the wayside . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one in 10 german students leave school without a degree right now , 10 percent of each class of school kids quits before receiving a degree .
that translates into tens of thousands of young people each year .
what are they going to do later ?
how are they going to live ?
we 're living on borrowed time .
not only does that mean major problems for the kids themselves in finding a job , but it presents a huge problem for society as a whole .
would there be a list of requirements to ensure that children are being protected ?
who would keep track of upholding the law should children 's rights be enshrined in the constitution by 2009 , as some expect ?
that 's the big question right now and the major issue that must be discussed .
should there be some sort of agency in each german state to oversee whether children 's rights are being upheld ?
who will report back on the issue ?
how will proposed laws be reviewed as to whether they would help or harm children ?
those are the really exciting questions , but we have n't reached that point yet . louisa schaefer interviewed rudi tarneden send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts shed light on germany 's poverty and welfare woes new studies in germany shed light on the twin problems of growing poverty and a deficit in the child-welfare system that could be related .

but there 's at least one thing that 's remained unchanged . let 's face it : even before nov .
22 , 2005 , angela merkel 's life did n't exactly look like that of your average gretel .
as leader of germany 's main opposition party , she had tons of meetings with the more or less mighty .
she just did n't have to pay quite as much attention to hairdos and make-up .

and , yes , she did n't have to lead a country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sauer -lrb- left -rrb- will join his wife on vacation , but he rarely comes along otherwise that 's all changed a bit over the past 365 days .
she 's now constantly in the limelight .
she 's had her apartment in central berlin retrofitted to comply with security standards worthy of a world leader .
she has even less time for her husband , a chemistry professor named joachim sauer who has decided that he 'd rather focus on his own work than accompany his wife at every occasion . sauer has also decided not to talk about his wife .
the chancellor , on the other hand , apparently feels an obligation to share the odd private insight now and then .
on wednesday , the anniversary of her ascension to the chancellery , merkel did decide to respond to reporters from germany 's bild tabloid , who had asked whether her husband had noted any changes in her . " well , the breakfast that i 'm preparing for us is still the same , " merkel said . munching on pretzels the chancellor still has time to prepare breakfast .
surely there are millions of people with far less responsibility who barely manage to gulp down some coffee before they rush out the door . how does she do it ?
or , what 's even more interesting : what does she serve ?
a traditional german breakfast with meats , cheese , jam and soft-boiled eggs ?
one can only hope that her table looks a little more cheerful than the tupperware-laden arrangement that awaits a certain elizabeth ii in the morning . there 's quite a bit of information on merkel 's favorite dishes .
apparently she enjoys potato soup , roulades , stews and schnitzel , and she makes goose for christmas .
merkel clearly was n't willing to go into the details of her breakfast offerings though . maybe the subject 's a little too touchy for her .
after all , she did concede the conservative candidacy for chancellorship to bavarian premier edmund stoiber over breakfast -lrb- with pretzels -rrb- in 2002 .
a pretty smart move , one could say in hindsight , as stoiber lost the election , making merkel 's bid for the chancellorship possible in the 2005 elections . bildunterschrift : it 's not known whether merkel and stoiber -lrb- right -rrb- also had beer with breakfast in 2002 " i really like breakfast , " she recently told a women 's magazine . no wonder . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de angie admits to bad driving german chancellor angela merkel has been criticized for slamming the brakes on government reform and steering the government in the wrong direction after one year in office .

" after years of stagnation , the country is on the upswing , " merkel said during a general debate on the budget in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german economy is on a six-year high the chancellor also pointed to increasing tax revenue as a sign of the coalition 's " effective " politics . " i think they are good results and we can be happy with them . " merkel said that despite the 3 percent increase in sales tax , which is to be introduced on jan .
1 , there was no evidence of weaker economic growth . however , many business analysts expect the tax increase to put the brakes on already weak consumer spending .
and the business confidence index , which reflects expectations for the german economy , fell again in november to its lowest point in seven years . year too short looking back at her first year as chancellor , merkel said it was a very short period " to prepare a land for the future . " but she said the coalition had enjoyed many successes in this time , such as a reform of the healthcare system , changes to inheritance tax , the introduction of a payment for new parents , and the participation of german soldiers in peacekeeping missions in lebanon and afghanistan . continuing conflicts with the social democrats the grand coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and merkel 's christian democrats took office in november 2005 more than two months after a general election gave neither of germany 's two biggest parties a clear mandate to form a majority government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter struck has been critical of angela merkel the spd 's parliamentary head , peter struck , admitted that after a year , the working relationship between the two coalition partners was difficult at times , but he emphasized there was a " relationship of trust .

factors such as increased exports , the world cup and the hot summer had all contributed to the recovery , he added . " the federal government is neither the father nor the mother of the economic upswing , " brüderle said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 22.11.2006 " we ca n't afford to leave kids by the wayside " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " strengthening children 's rights helps in taking action against neglect " the german parliament 's commission for children 's concerns this week discussed including children 's rights in the constitution .
in light of recent cases of deaths due to neglect , it 's becoming a pressing issue . dw-world.de spoke with rudi tarneden , a spokesman for unicef deutschland , the german branch of the united nations children 's fund , about what would change in germany if children 's rights were part of the constitution .
dw-world.de : let 's assume that children 's rights will become part of the constitution at some point .
how would those rights be guaranteed ?
rudi tarneden : this past august , during an event hosted by unicef germany and the deutscher kinderschutzbund -lrb- a german lobby organization for the protection of children -rrb- , chancellor angela merkel said for the first time that she could envision including children 's rights in the constitution .
this fall , family minister ursula von der leyen stressed the need again following the cases of child neglect and killing that have recently come to light .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a growing awareness of children 's rights in germany putting children 's rights in the constitution would strengthen young people 's position in society , especially in terms of new policies being drafted - policies that concern children , but also those that affect immigrants and even issues like urban design to make cities more child-friendly .
it would also mean that youth offices could take legal action more quickly and easily in cases of child neglect .
currently , youth office agents are very reluctant to get involved in a family 's private sphere .
parental rights are more respected than children 's rights .
also , there be would a change of attitude from " raising children is a private , family matter and we 'll get involved only in an emergency " to " children and the raising of them are a social concern whereby both the state and parents bear responsibility . "
yet , in the recent cases of child deaths due to neglect , youth offices knew that at least some of the families were high-risk , but they did n't get involved .
were n't those emergencies ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts warn that child neglect and abuse occur in all levels of society that 's the problem .
those are the cases in which everyone is aware of what 's going on , but no one does anything .
if the state were to get more involved , people in society would take a closer look and take action , and vice versa .
unicef recently published a report that focuses on child abuse in industrialized countries .
for germany , the report shows that on the average , two children die per week as the result of abuse or neglect .
but that 's just the tip of the iceberg - there are plenty of children who manage to live , but who suffer physical and psychological violence as they grow up .
they , of course , are not included in those numbers .
i should make clear that laws will not stop child neglect and abuse , but that new laws could give agencies more possibilities for taking action .
things have improved in the past few decades , but child mortality rates due to neglect are still too high .
if laws ca n't do it all , how can people 's attitudes become more attuned to the needs of children ?
in 2000 , a ban on physical punishment to reprimand children was drafted .
there were major discussions on the issue and whether or not parents should be forbidden to spank or slap their children .
but the fact is that this new law helped to readjust people 's attitudes toward children - namely , that the social norms of respect and grace that adults expect in their dealings with one another should also be expected in behavior towards children .
such laws herald long-term processes in which attitudes toward children gradually change for the better .
one should n't underestimate their psychological effects .
you said adding children 's rights to the constitution will not prevent child abuse .
is n't money also an issue - as budgets for kindergarten care have been drastically cut and employment is high ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all kids need good schools , tarneden said the gap between the rich and the poor is widening dramatically in germany .
more and more children are being socially excluded and are growing up in poverty and in families in which long-term unemployment reigns .
these children do n't have the role models they need because their parents have resigned themselves to dreadful circumstances , or because they ca n't get the training they need , or ca n't attend decent schools .
it 's precisely in the " bad " city districts where good schools should be located .
a crisis is brewing here , and we believe that tackling these problems now should be a priority .
why do you believe the push for improving children 's rights is coming now ?
the ratification of the unicef convention on the rights of the child a decade and a half ago has had effects over time .
also , people in germany are now discussing the social exclusion of children and how children are growing up in poverty .
we 're realizing that we just ca n't afford to leave kids by the wayside .
we see that in all the talks about poor education in this country .
the third reason , of course , is that all the media attention on these horrible cases of child abuse has prompted politicians to say that action needs to be taken to make germany a more hospitable place for children .
what do you mean exactly by " we 're realizing we ca n't afford to leave children by the wayside . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one in 10 german students leave school without a degree right now , 10 percent of each class of school kids quits before receiving a degree .
that translates into tens of thousands of young people each year .
what are they going to do later ?
how are they going to live ?
we 're living on borrowed time .
not only does that mean major problems for the kids themselves in finding a job , but it presents a huge problem for society as a whole .
would there be a list of requirements to ensure that children are being protected ?
who would keep track of upholding the law should children 's rights be enshrined in the constitution by 2009 , as some expect ?
that 's the big question right now and the major issue that must be discussed .
should there be some sort of agency in each german state to oversee whether children 's rights are being upheld ?
who will report back on the issue ?
how will proposed laws be reviewed as to whether they would help or harm children ?
those are the really exciting questions , but we have n't reached that point yet . louisa schaefer interviewed rudi tarneden send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts shed light on germany 's poverty and welfare woes new studies in germany shed light on the twin problems of growing poverty and a deficit in the child-welfare system that could be related .
experts have spoken out on both issues .
-lrb- 20.10.2006 -rrb- germany plans early warning system to protect children germany 's family minister said an early warning system would go into effect this year to prevent children from being neglected days after the body of two-year-old kevin was found in his father 's freezer in bremen .

" today 's attack is clearly another attempt to sabotage the development of an independent , sovereign and democratic lebanon , " steinmeier said in a statement on tuesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 22.11.2006 " we ca n't afford to leave kids by the wayside " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " strengthening children 's rights helps in taking action against neglect " the german parliament 's commission for children 's concerns this week discussed including children 's rights in the constitution .
in light of recent cases of deaths due to neglect , it 's becoming a pressing issue . dw-world.de spoke with rudi tarneden , a spokesman for unicef deutschland , the german branch of the united nations children 's fund , about what would change in germany if children 's rights were part of the constitution .
dw-world.de : let 's assume that children 's rights will become part of the constitution at some point .
how would those rights be guaranteed ?
rudi tarneden : this past august , during an event hosted by unicef germany and the deutscher kinderschutzbund -lrb- a german lobby organization for the protection of children -rrb- , chancellor angela merkel said for the first time that she could envision including children 's rights in the constitution .
this fall , family minister ursula von der leyen stressed the need again following the cases of child neglect and killing that have recently come to light .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a growing awareness of children 's rights in germany putting children 's rights in the constitution would strengthen young people 's position in society , especially in terms of new policies being drafted - policies that concern children , but also those that affect immigrants and even issues like urban design to make cities more child-friendly .
it would also mean that youth offices could take legal action more quickly and easily in cases of child neglect .
currently , youth office agents are very reluctant to get involved in a family 's private sphere .
parental rights are more respected than children 's rights .
also , there be would a change of attitude from " raising children is a private , family matter and we 'll get involved only in an emergency " to " children and the raising of them are a social concern whereby both the state and parents bear responsibility . "
yet , in the recent cases of child deaths due to neglect , youth offices knew that at least some of the families were high-risk , but they did n't get involved .
were n't those emergencies ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts warn that child neglect and abuse occur in all levels of society that 's the problem .
those are the cases in which everyone is aware of what 's going on , but no one does anything .
if the state were to get more involved , people in society would take a closer look and take action , and vice versa .
unicef recently published a report that focuses on child abuse in industrialized countries .
for germany , the report shows that on the average , two children die per week as the result of abuse or neglect .
but that 's just the tip of the iceberg - there are plenty of children who manage to live , but who suffer physical and psychological violence as they grow up .
they , of course , are not included in those numbers .
i should make clear that laws will not stop child neglect and abuse , but that new laws could give agencies more possibilities for taking action .
things have improved in the past few decades , but child mortality rates due to neglect are still too high .
if laws ca n't do it all , how can people 's attitudes become more attuned to the needs of children ?
in 2000 , a ban on physical punishment to reprimand children was drafted .
there were major discussions on the issue and whether or not parents should be forbidden to spank or slap their children .
but the fact is that this new law helped to readjust people 's attitudes toward children - namely , that the social norms of respect and grace that adults expect in their dealings with one another should also be expected in behavior towards children .
such laws herald long-term processes in which attitudes toward children gradually change for the better .
one should n't underestimate their psychological effects .
you said adding children 's rights to the constitution will not prevent child abuse .
is n't money also an issue - as budgets for kindergarten care have been drastically cut and employment is high ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all kids need good schools , tarneden said the gap between the rich and the poor is widening dramatically in germany .
more and more children are being socially excluded and are growing up in poverty and in families in which long-term unemployment reigns .
these children do n't have the role models they need because their parents have resigned themselves to dreadful circumstances , or because they ca n't get the training they need , or ca n't attend decent schools .
it 's precisely in the " bad " city districts where good schools should be located .
a crisis is brewing here , and we believe that tackling these problems now should be a priority .
why do you believe the push for improving children 's rights is coming now ?
the ratification of the unicef convention on the rights of the child a decade and a half ago has had effects over time .
also , people in germany are now discussing the social exclusion of children and how children are growing up in poverty .
we 're realizing that we just ca n't afford to leave kids by the wayside .
we see that in all the talks about poor education in this country .
the third reason , of course , is that all the media attention on these horrible cases of child abuse has prompted politicians to say that action needs to be taken to make germany a more hospitable place for children .
what do you mean exactly by " we 're realizing we ca n't afford to leave children by the wayside . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one in 10 german students leave school without a degree right now , 10 percent of each class of school kids quits before receiving a degree .
that translates into tens of thousands of young people each year .
what are they going to do later ?
how are they going to live ?
we 're living on borrowed time .
not only does that mean major problems for the kids themselves in finding a job , but it presents a huge problem for society as a whole .
would there be a list of requirements to ensure that children are being protected ?
who would keep track of upholding the law should children 's rights be enshrined in the constitution by 2009 , as some expect ?
that 's the big question right now and the major issue that must be discussed .
should there be some sort of agency in each german state to oversee whether children 's rights are being upheld ?
who will report back on the issue ?
how will proposed laws be reviewed as to whether they would help or harm children ?
those are the really exciting questions , but we have n't reached that point yet . louisa schaefer interviewed rudi tarneden send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts shed light on germany 's poverty and welfare woes new studies in germany shed light on the twin problems of growing poverty and a deficit in the child-welfare system that could be related .

" perceptional spectrum " is one of steinmeier 's favorite phrases and it says a lot about him .
the foreign minister has used his first year in office , first and foremost , to expand his own perceptional spectrum .
while the 50-year-old lawyer previously spent years sitting inside germany 's chancellery as former chancellor gerhard schröder 's chief-of-staff , he took off on a world trip in stages immediately after switching jobs . he visited south america , the arabian peninsula , southeast asia , central asia and north africa - and realized that a purely euro-atlantic approach to foreign policy is no longer sufficient in the 21st century .
the attention steinmeier pays to emerging regions on all five continents expands germany 's world - even if it 's not always clear right away where a common path may lead .
for now , steinmeier is making connections that might come in handy later . his impartiality and his interest in people and topics that he 's unfamiliar with are characteristics that help him in this regard .
his friendly , relaxed way has made him friends abroad and quickly turned him into the most popular politician of the grand coalition at home .
this happened despite his dry and often awkward way of expressing himself .
take " perceptional spectrum " as an example . his first year in office was also an educational year for steinmeier .
three kidnappings - two in iraq and one in yemen - put the top diplomat and his colleagues to the test .
all three had happy endings , largely due to his level-headed crisis management . the troubled german-american relationship was another construction site for the new government of social and christian democrats .
the chancellor took on this issue herself and steinmeier flanked her .
in general , merkel , a christian democrat , and steinmeier , a social democrat , work surprisingly well together . steinmeier heads to the middle east or holds talks about the iranian nuclear program , providing for continuity in german foreign policy by doing so .
merkel on the other hand deals with her mighty counterparts in washington and moscow and makes adjustments to the foreign policy standpoints of her predecessor .
schröder 's confidante steinmeier no longer has to bear responsibility for this . but he will not be able to evade testimony in front of the parliamentary inquiry in the el masri case in which a lebanese-born german claims to have been kidnapped by cia agents and tortured , as he played a crucial role in his capacity as head of the german chancellery . but what 's steinmeier 's strategy ?
he 's more concerned about energy policy than his predecessor as he thinks that long-term security of energy supplies is a central foreign policy issue .
foreign trade policy is naturally also part of his job and he wants to expand contacts with " key regions of the future " that he 's already visited . beyond that , however , it 's hard to see a holistic strategic concept .
questions of the day dominate steinmeier 's agenda too often and he remains vague and lacks differentiation with his politeness .
still , his foreign policy is solid , reliable and good overall . nina werkhäuser is dw-radio 's foreign affairs correspondent in berlin -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's new face abroad frank-walter steinmeier , a close ally of outgoing chancellor schröder , is set to be germany 's new foreign minister .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 22.11.2006 " we ca n't afford to leave kids by the wayside " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " strengthening children 's rights helps in taking action against neglect " the german parliament 's commission for children 's concerns this week discussed including children 's rights in the constitution .
in light of recent cases of deaths due to neglect , it 's becoming a pressing issue . dw-world.de spoke with rudi tarneden , a spokesman for unicef deutschland , the german branch of the united nations children 's fund , about what would change in germany if children 's rights were part of the constitution .
dw-world.de : let 's assume that children 's rights will become part of the constitution at some point .
how would those rights be guaranteed ?
rudi tarneden : this past august , during an event hosted by unicef germany and the deutscher kinderschutzbund -lrb- a german lobby organization for the protection of children -rrb- , chancellor angela merkel said for the first time that she could envision including children 's rights in the constitution .
this fall , family minister ursula von der leyen stressed the need again following the cases of child neglect and killing that have recently come to light .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a growing awareness of children 's rights in germany putting children 's rights in the constitution would strengthen young people 's position in society , especially in terms of new policies being drafted - policies that concern children , but also those that affect immigrants and even issues like urban design to make cities more child-friendly .
it would also mean that youth offices could take legal action more quickly and easily in cases of child neglect .
currently , youth office agents are very reluctant to get involved in a family 's private sphere .
parental rights are more respected than children 's rights .
also , there be would a change of attitude from " raising children is a private , family matter and we 'll get involved only in an emergency " to " children and the raising of them are a social concern whereby both the state and parents bear responsibility . "
yet , in the recent cases of child deaths due to neglect , youth offices knew that at least some of the families were high-risk , but they did n't get involved .
were n't those emergencies ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts warn that child neglect and abuse occur in all levels of society that 's the problem .
those are the cases in which everyone is aware of what 's going on , but no one does anything .
if the state were to get more involved , people in society would take a closer look and take action , and vice versa .
unicef recently published a report that focuses on child abuse in industrialized countries .
for germany , the report shows that on the average , two children die per week as the result of abuse or neglect .
but that 's just the tip of the iceberg - there are plenty of children who manage to live , but who suffer physical and psychological violence as they grow up .
they , of course , are not included in those numbers .
i should make clear that laws will not stop child neglect and abuse , but that new laws could give agencies more possibilities for taking action .
things have improved in the past few decades , but child mortality rates due to neglect are still too high .
if laws ca n't do it all , how can people 's attitudes become more attuned to the needs of children ?
in 2000 , a ban on physical punishment to reprimand children was drafted .
there were major discussions on the issue and whether or not parents should be forbidden to spank or slap their children .
but the fact is that this new law helped to readjust people 's attitudes toward children - namely , that the social norms of respect and grace that adults expect in their dealings with one another should also be expected in behavior towards children .
such laws herald long-term processes in which attitudes toward children gradually change for the better .
one should n't underestimate their psychological effects .
you said adding children 's rights to the constitution will not prevent child abuse .
is n't money also an issue - as budgets for kindergarten care have been drastically cut and employment is high ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all kids need good schools , tarneden said the gap between the rich and the poor is widening dramatically in germany .
more and more children are being socially excluded and are growing up in poverty and in families in which long-term unemployment reigns .
these children do n't have the role models they need because their parents have resigned themselves to dreadful circumstances , or because they ca n't get the training they need , or ca n't attend decent schools .
it 's precisely in the " bad " city districts where good schools should be located .
a crisis is brewing here , and we believe that tackling these problems now should be a priority .
why do you believe the push for improving children 's rights is coming now ?
the ratification of the unicef convention on the rights of the child a decade and a half ago has had effects over time .
also , people in germany are now discussing the social exclusion of children and how children are growing up in poverty .
we 're realizing that we just ca n't afford to leave kids by the wayside .
we see that in all the talks about poor education in this country .
the third reason , of course , is that all the media attention on these horrible cases of child abuse has prompted politicians to say that action needs to be taken to make germany a more hospitable place for children .
what do you mean exactly by " we 're realizing we ca n't afford to leave children by the wayside . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one in 10 german students leave school without a degree right now , 10 percent of each class of school kids quits before receiving a degree .
that translates into tens of thousands of young people each year .
what are they going to do later ?
how are they going to live ?
we 're living on borrowed time .
not only does that mean major problems for the kids themselves in finding a job , but it presents a huge problem for society as a whole .
would there be a list of requirements to ensure that children are being protected ?
who would keep track of upholding the law should children 's rights be enshrined in the constitution by 2009 , as some expect ?
that 's the big question right now and the major issue that must be discussed .
should there be some sort of agency in each german state to oversee whether children 's rights are being upheld ?
who will report back on the issue ?
how will proposed laws be reviewed as to whether they would help or harm children ?
those are the really exciting questions , but we have n't reached that point yet . louisa schaefer interviewed rudi tarneden send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts shed light on germany 's poverty and welfare woes new studies in germany shed light on the twin problems of growing poverty and a deficit in the child-welfare system that could be related .

22 as she took the reins of an unwieldy " grand coalition " government after an inconclusive general election . the result , a marriage of merkel 's conservative christian union and its chief political rival , the social democrats of her predecessor gerhard schröder , has tested her leadership abilities to the limit . lacking schröder 's natural charisma , the trained physicist has instead relied on meticulous preparation , gentle humor and a modest style to lead europe 's most populous country and biggest economic power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : known for her sober approach to government , merkel will still celebrate her one year anniversary merkel , 52 , even dispensed with the champagne traditionally served when the coalition agreement is signed , pouring mineral water instead in a sign of a new sobriety in german politics after the often flamboyant schröder . she will nevertheless throw a small cocktail party on wednesday evening to thank the cabinet " for the good cooperation and good atmosphere " of the last year , her spokesman ulrich wilhelm said . foreign policy sucesses merkel has racked up her biggest triumphs in foreign policy , kicking off the year with a hard-fought compromise on the european union budget that won her fans across the bloc . she also improved germany 's relationship with the bush administration , which was strained after germany 's refusal to join the us-led coalition in iraq . merkel also altered what was seen as schröder 's too-cozy relations with russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has patched up the relationship with us president george w. bush merkel has made a point of wooing president george w. bush and vladimir putin while taking each to task for human rights violations in guantanamo bay and chechnya - stances that have won cheers at home . military missions to monitor the first elections in four decades in the democratic republic of congo and an unprecedented postwar foray into the middle east to halt the flow of arms to hezbollah in lebanon have boosted germany 's stature . and with germany set to take over the presidencies of the group of eight most industrialized nations and the european union on jan .
1 , merkel will find herself under the most intense scrutiny of her career . merkel less popular at home yet at home , surveys show only a third of the country supports merkel 's conservatives , their lowest score since 2000 and the first time that a sitting chancellor has failed to score popularity points from an economic upturn . after initial euphoria , the public has expressed frustration with merkel 's slowly-but-surely " policy of small steps " in which she turns her microscope on each reform issue - health care , pensions , taxes - with hair-splitting intensity . " there is disappointment everywhere that this coalition has not used its large majorities in the lower and upper houses of parliament to perform great deeds , " the conservative daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung said this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sales tax increase from 16 to 19 percent is unpopular in germany beyond this tentative approach , germans are also wary about the resilience of the nascent economic recovery after four years of double-digit unemployment rates . a planned hike in value-added tax in january will make consumer goods more expensive across the board and potentially snuff out the economic upswing . and a growing gap between rich and poor has soured the mood and damaged the credibility of the major parties . dw staff / afp -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel emerges tested but unbowed after first year in office german chancellor angela merkel has had a trying first year in charge , holding together a fractious coalition government , presiding over a fall in unemployment and thawing relations with washington .

the case was later dropped .
weimer said government officials were simply trying to find out who had passed on the information .
he added that this represented a threat to journalists , who could no longer guarantee the anonymity of their sources . government officials on wednesday meanwhile argued that such protection was not possible . " a journalist can commit a crime if he publishes state secrets that have been divulged by a civil servant , " said lutz diwell , a deputy minister in germany 's department of justice . judges , on the other hand , questioned whether journalists could still be held accountable as accomplices once the secrets had been revealed by government officials . a ruling in the case is not expected until 2007 . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press council celebrates 50 years monday is the 50th anniversary of the german press council , an independent and self-regulating organization which was based on the british press council model .

"
he was released last august . neither the german nor the turkish authorities tried to release him from guantanamo and instead shifted responsibility on to the us government , kurnaz told a special european parliament committee investigating charges of illegal us secret service activities in europe . kurnaz was arrested in pakistan two months after the sept.11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states .
he was handed over to us authorities who took him to guantanamo in january 2002 , saying he was suspected of supporting afghanistan 's former taliban rulers . kurnaz told meps that he went to pakistan to " deepen his -lrb- muslim -rrb- faith " but that he had never done anything illegal . " there is no excuse " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurnaz and docke -lrb- right -rrb- during the hearing but germany rejected a us offer to release kurnaz from guantanamo in october 2002 , with washington saying that there was no case against him , his lawyer said . " there is no excuse for this , " bernhard docke told dw-radio .
" i hope that the european parliament will shed light on this . " back in germany , however , authorities " tried to paint me as a liar , though they had decided to leave me in guantanamo , " kurnaz told parliamentarians . the turkish government also " did n't bother at all about me while i was imprisoned , " he said .
" they thought i was a spy for germany . " turkish officials interrogating him in the camp had told him that it was up to the us to release him , kurnaz said .
other guantanamo inmates with turkish citizenship , however , were taken back to turkey , kurnaz claimed . mistreated by germans ? kurnaz also said that german soldiers in afghanistan mistreated him before he was transferred to guantanamo bay .
us forces had handed him over to two members of the german special forces command , ksk , who had pulled his head back , banged his head on the floor and one stamped on him , kurnaz said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ksk members during a training session in germany " they asked me if i knew who they were and then they said , ' we are the ksk , " ' he said , adding that the men had german flags on their uniforms and spoke german with him . " i thought they would have some questions and that they could help me , but they told me i had chosen the wrong side , " kurnaz said . the german defense ministry is currently investigating the claims .
after saying that it had no evidence that german soldiers had interrogated kurnaz , the authority last week admitted that ksk forces had been " in contact " with him , according to german media reports . " it does n't take much imagination -lrb- to believe -rrb- that the ksk soldiers were capable of doing that , " kurnaz said .
" they were there to help the americans , and we know from the abu ghraib case what us soldiers were doing there . " kurnaz also told the european committee that officials from denmark and belgium had visited nationals imprisoned in the guantanamo camp . kurnaz mulls further legal steps bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prisoners at guantanamo a german parliamentary committee is currently studying whether german security agencies breached any german rules while assisting post-2001 us anti-terrorism operations . european parliamentarians earlier this year slammed the german government under former chancellor gerhard schröder for failing to " come clean " over its involvement in the kurnaz case . us authorities never issued an arrest warrant and there was no legal procedure against kurnaz , his lawyer has said .
docke also told dw-radio that his client demanded the truth about the case .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 22.11.2006 opinion : looking beyond the euro-atlantic horizon großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier 's first year in office was a tough one at times , deutsche welle 's nina werkhäuser thinks that it 's been a good one overall . " perceptional spectrum " is one of steinmeier 's favorite phrases and it says a lot about him .
the foreign minister has used his first year in office , first and foremost , to expand his own perceptional spectrum .
while the 50-year-old lawyer previously spent years sitting inside germany 's chancellery as former chancellor gerhard schröder 's chief-of-staff , he took off on a world trip in stages immediately after switching jobs . he visited south america , the arabian peninsula , southeast asia , central asia and north africa - and realized that a purely euro-atlantic approach to foreign policy is no longer sufficient in the 21st century .
the attention steinmeier pays to emerging regions on all five continents expands germany 's world - even if it 's not always clear right away where a common path may lead .
for now , steinmeier is making connections that might come in handy later . his impartiality and his interest in people and topics that he 's unfamiliar with are characteristics that help him in this regard .
his friendly , relaxed way has made him friends abroad and quickly turned him into the most popular politician of the grand coalition at home .
this happened despite his dry and often awkward way of expressing himself .
take " perceptional spectrum " as an example . his first year in office was also an educational year for steinmeier .
three kidnappings - two in iraq and one in yemen - put the top diplomat and his colleagues to the test .
all three had happy endings , largely due to his level-headed crisis management . the troubled german-american relationship was another construction site for the new government of social and christian democrats .
the chancellor took on this issue herself and steinmeier flanked her .
in general , merkel , a christian democrat , and steinmeier , a social democrat , work surprisingly well together . steinmeier heads to the middle east or holds talks about the iranian nuclear program , providing for continuity in german foreign policy by doing so .
merkel on the other hand deals with her mighty counterparts in washington and moscow and makes adjustments to the foreign policy standpoints of her predecessor .
schröder 's confidante steinmeier no longer has to bear responsibility for this . but he will not be able to evade testimony in front of the parliamentary inquiry in the el masri case in which a lebanese-born german claims to have been kidnapped by cia agents and tortured , as he played a crucial role in his capacity as head of the german chancellery . but what 's steinmeier 's strategy ?
he 's more concerned about energy policy than his predecessor as he thinks that long-term security of energy supplies is a central foreign policy issue .
foreign trade policy is naturally also part of his job and he wants to expand contacts with " key regions of the future " that he 's already visited . beyond that , however , it 's hard to see a holistic strategic concept .
questions of the day dominate steinmeier 's agenda too often and he remains vague and lacks differentiation with his politeness .
still , his foreign policy is solid , reliable and good overall . nina werkhäuser is dw-radio 's foreign affairs correspondent in berlin -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's new face abroad frank-walter steinmeier , a close ally of outgoing chancellor schröder , is set to be germany 's new foreign minister .
not much is known about the " silent star in schröder 's team , " who largely acted behind the scenes .
-lrb- 14.10.2005 -rrb- trade matters dominate steinmeier talks in algeria and tunesia business leaders accompanying german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier in the magreb countries , are keen to secure energy deals in liquid gas and oil -lrb- 17.11.2006 -rrb- steinmeier : europe needs to take a closer look at central asia on a trip through central asia , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said on saturday that the european union needs to take a greater interest in the resource-rich former soviet republics .

" after years of stagnation , the country is on the upswing , " merkel said during a general debate on the budget in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german economy is on a six-year high the chancellor also pointed to increasing tax revenue as a sign of the coalition 's " effective " politics . " i think they are good results and we can be happy with them . " merkel said that despite the 3 percent increase in sales tax , which is to be introduced on jan .
1 , there was no evidence of weaker economic growth . however , many business analysts expect the tax increase to put the brakes on already weak consumer spending .
and the business confidence index , which reflects expectations for the german economy , fell again in november to its lowest point in seven years . year too short looking back at her first year as chancellor , merkel said it was a very short period " to prepare a land for the future . " but she said the coalition had enjoyed many successes in this time , such as a reform of the healthcare system , changes to inheritance tax , the introduction of a payment for new parents , and the participation of german soldiers in peacekeeping missions in lebanon and afghanistan . continuing conflicts with the social democrats the grand coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and merkel 's christian democrats took office in november 2005 more than two months after a general election gave neither of germany 's two biggest parties a clear mandate to form a majority government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter struck has been critical of angela merkel the spd 's parliamentary head , peter struck , admitted that after a year , the working relationship between the two coalition partners was difficult at times , but he emphasized there was a " relationship of trust .

22 , 2005 , angela merkel 's life did n't exactly look like that of your average gretel .
as leader of germany 's main opposition party , she had tons of meetings with the more or less mighty .
she just did n't have to pay quite as much attention to hairdos and make-up .
she had to worry less about protocol while walking past soldiers on red carpets .
and , yes , she did n't have to lead a country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sauer -lrb- left -rrb- will join his wife on vacation , but he rarely comes along otherwise that 's all changed a bit over the past 365 days .
she 's now constantly in the limelight .
she 's had her apartment in central berlin retrofitted to comply with security standards worthy of a world leader .
she has even less time for her husband , a chemistry professor named joachim sauer who has decided that he 'd rather focus on his own work than accompany his wife at every occasion . sauer has also decided not to talk about his wife .
the chancellor , on the other hand , apparently feels an obligation to share the odd private insight now and then .
on wednesday , the anniversary of her ascension to the chancellery , merkel did decide to respond to reporters from germany 's bild tabloid , who had asked whether her husband had noted any changes in her . " well , the breakfast that i 'm preparing for us is still the same , " merkel said . munching on pretzels the chancellor still has time to prepare breakfast .
surely there are millions of people with far less responsibility who barely manage to gulp down some coffee before they rush out the door . how does she do it ?
or , what 's even more interesting : what does she serve ?
a traditional german breakfast with meats , cheese , jam and soft-boiled eggs ?
one can only hope that her table looks a little more cheerful than the tupperware-laden arrangement that awaits a certain elizabeth ii in the morning . there 's quite a bit of information on merkel 's favorite dishes .
apparently she enjoys potato soup , roulades , stews and schnitzel , and she makes goose for christmas .
merkel clearly was n't willing to go into the details of her breakfast offerings though . maybe the subject 's a little too touchy for her .
after all , she did concede the conservative candidacy for chancellorship to bavarian premier edmund stoiber over breakfast -lrb- with pretzels -rrb- in 2002 .
a pretty smart move , one could say in hindsight , as stoiber lost the election , making merkel 's bid for the chancellorship possible in the 2005 elections . bildunterschrift : it 's not known whether merkel and stoiber -lrb- right -rrb- also had beer with breakfast in 2002 " i really like breakfast , " she recently told a women 's magazine . no wonder . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de angie admits to bad driving german chancellor angela merkel has been criticized for slamming the brakes on government reform and steering the government in the wrong direction after one year in office .

"
he was released last august . neither the german nor the turkish authorities tried to release him from guantanamo and instead shifted responsibility on to the us government , kurnaz told a special european parliament committee investigating charges of illegal us secret service activities in europe . kurnaz was arrested in pakistan two months after the sept.11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states .
he was handed over to us authorities who took him to guantanamo in january 2002 , saying he was suspected of supporting afghanistan 's former taliban rulers . kurnaz told meps that he went to pakistan to " deepen his -lrb- muslim -rrb- faith " but that he had never done anything illegal . " there is no excuse " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurnaz and docke -lrb- right -rrb- during the hearing but germany rejected a us offer to release kurnaz from guantanamo in october 2002 , with washington saying that there was no case against him , his lawyer said . " there is no excuse for this , " bernhard docke told dw-radio .
" i hope that the european parliament will shed light on this . " back in germany , however , authorities " tried to paint me as a liar , though they had decided to leave me in guantanamo , " kurnaz told parliamentarians . the turkish government also " did n't bother at all about me while i was imprisoned , " he said .
" they thought i was a spy for germany . " turkish officials interrogating him in the camp had told him that it was up to the us to release him , kurnaz said .
other guantanamo inmates with turkish citizenship , however , were taken back to turkey , kurnaz claimed . mistreated by germans ? kurnaz also said that german soldiers in afghanistan mistreated him before he was transferred to guantanamo bay .
us forces had handed him over to two members of the german special forces command , ksk , who had pulled his head back , banged his head on the floor and one stamped on him , kurnaz said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ksk members during a training session in germany " they asked me if i knew who they were and then they said , ' we are the ksk , " ' he said , adding that the men had german flags on their uniforms and spoke german with him . " i thought they would have some questions and that they could help me , but they told me i had chosen the wrong side , " kurnaz said . the german defense ministry is currently investigating the claims .
after saying that it had no evidence that german soldiers had interrogated kurnaz , the authority last week admitted that ksk forces had been " in contact " with him , according to german media reports . " it does n't take much imagination -lrb- to believe -rrb- that the ksk soldiers were capable of doing that , " kurnaz said .
" they were there to help the americans , and we know from the abu ghraib case what us soldiers were doing there . " kurnaz also told the european committee that officials from denmark and belgium had visited nationals imprisoned in the guantanamo camp . kurnaz mulls further legal steps bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prisoners at guantanamo a german parliamentary committee is currently studying whether german security agencies breached any german rules while assisting post-2001 us anti-terrorism operations . european parliamentarians earlier this year slammed the german government under former chancellor gerhard schröder for failing to " come clean " over its involvement in the kurnaz case . us authorities never issued an arrest warrant and there was no legal procedure against kurnaz , his lawyer has said .
docke also told dw-radio that his client demanded the truth about the case . " we 'll decide whether to take further legal steps when we know what happened , " docke said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de former guantanamo prisoner kurnaz reveals extent of torture murat kurnaz , the german-born turk known as the bremen taliban , has spoken publically about the alleged torture he suffered at the hands of the us military in guantanamo bay .

"
he was released last august . neither the german nor the turkish authorities tried to release him from guantanamo and instead shifted responsibility on to the us government , kurnaz told a special european parliament committee investigating charges of illegal us secret service activities in europe . kurnaz was arrested in pakistan two months after the sept.11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states .
he was handed over to us authorities who took him to guantanamo in january 2002 , saying he was suspected of supporting afghanistan 's former taliban rulers . kurnaz told meps that he went to pakistan to " deepen his -lrb- muslim -rrb- faith " but that he had never done anything illegal . " there is no excuse " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurnaz and docke -lrb- right -rrb- during the hearing but germany rejected a us offer to release kurnaz from guantanamo in october 2002 , with washington saying that there was no case against him , his lawyer said . " there is no excuse for this , " bernhard docke told dw-radio .
" i hope that the european parliament will shed light on this . " back in germany , however , authorities " tried to paint me as a liar , though they had decided to leave me in guantanamo , " kurnaz told parliamentarians . the turkish government also " did n't bother at all about me while i was imprisoned , " he said .
" they thought i was a spy for germany . " turkish officials interrogating him in the camp had told him that it was up to the us to release him , kurnaz said .
other guantanamo inmates with turkish citizenship , however , were taken back to turkey , kurnaz claimed . mistreated by germans ? kurnaz also said that german soldiers in afghanistan mistreated him before he was transferred to guantanamo bay .
us forces had handed him over to two members of the german special forces command , ksk , who had pulled his head back , banged his head on the floor and one stamped on him , kurnaz said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ksk members during a training session in germany " they asked me if i knew who they were and then they said , ' we are the ksk , " ' he said , adding that the men had german flags on their uniforms and spoke german with him . " i thought they would have some questions and that they could help me , but they told me i had chosen the wrong side , " kurnaz said . the german defense ministry is currently investigating the claims .
after saying that it had no evidence that german soldiers had interrogated kurnaz , the authority last week admitted that ksk forces had been " in contact " with him , according to german media reports . " it does n't take much imagination -lrb- to believe -rrb- that the ksk soldiers were capable of doing that , " kurnaz said .
" they were there to help the americans , and we know from the abu ghraib case what us soldiers were doing there . " kurnaz also told the european committee that officials from denmark and belgium had visited nationals imprisoned in the guantanamo camp . kurnaz mulls further legal steps bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prisoners at guantanamo a german parliamentary committee is currently studying whether german security agencies breached any german rules while assisting post-2001 us anti-terrorism operations . european parliamentarians earlier this year slammed the german government under former chancellor gerhard schröder for failing to " come clean " over its involvement in the kurnaz case . us authorities never issued an arrest warrant and there was no legal procedure against kurnaz , his lawyer has said .
docke also told dw-radio that his client demanded the truth about the case . " we 'll decide whether to take further legal steps when we know what happened , " docke said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de former guantanamo prisoner kurnaz reveals extent of torture murat kurnaz , the german-born turk known as the bremen taliban , has spoken publically about the alleged torture he suffered at the hands of the us military in guantanamo bay .

in light of recent cases of deaths due to neglect , it 's becoming a pressing issue . dw-world.de spoke with rudi tarneden , a spokesman for unicef deutschland , the german branch of the united nations children 's fund , about what would change in germany if children 's rights were part of the constitution .
dw-world.de : let 's assume that children 's rights will become part of the constitution at some point .
how would those rights be guaranteed ?
rudi tarneden : this past august , during an event hosted by unicef germany and the deutscher kinderschutzbund -lrb- a german lobby organization for the protection of children -rrb- , chancellor angela merkel said for the first time that she could envision including children 's rights in the constitution .
this fall , family minister ursula von der leyen stressed the need again following the cases of child neglect and killing that have recently come to light .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a growing awareness of children 's rights in germany putting children 's rights in the constitution would strengthen young people 's position in society , especially in terms of new policies being drafted - policies that concern children , but also those that affect immigrants and even issues like urban design to make cities more child-friendly .
it would also mean that youth offices could take legal action more quickly and easily in cases of child neglect .
currently , youth office agents are very reluctant to get involved in a family 's private sphere .
parental rights are more respected than children 's rights .
also , there be would a change of attitude from " raising children is a private , family matter and we 'll get involved only in an emergency " to " children and the raising of them are a social concern whereby both the state and parents bear responsibility . "
yet , in the recent cases of child deaths due to neglect , youth offices knew that at least some of the families were high-risk , but they did n't get involved .
were n't those emergencies ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts warn that child neglect and abuse occur in all levels of society that 's the problem .
those are the cases in which everyone is aware of what 's going on , but no one does anything .
if the state were to get more involved , people in society would take a closer look and take action , and vice versa .
unicef recently published a report that focuses on child abuse in industrialized countries .
for germany , the report shows that on the average , two children die per week as the result of abuse or neglect .
but that 's just the tip of the iceberg - there are plenty of children who manage to live , but who suffer physical and psychological violence as they grow up .
they , of course , are not included in those numbers .
i should make clear that laws will not stop child neglect and abuse , but that new laws could give agencies more possibilities for taking action .
things have improved in the past few decades , but child mortality rates due to neglect are still too high .
if laws ca n't do it all , how can people 's attitudes become more attuned to the needs of children ?
in 2000 , a ban on physical punishment to reprimand children was drafted .
there were major discussions on the issue and whether or not parents should be forbidden to spank or slap their children .
but the fact is that this new law helped to readjust people 's attitudes toward children - namely , that the social norms of respect and grace that adults expect in their dealings with one another should also be expected in behavior towards children .
such laws herald long-term processes in which attitudes toward children gradually change for the better .
one should n't underestimate their psychological effects .
you said adding children 's rights to the constitution will not prevent child abuse .
is n't money also an issue - as budgets for kindergarten care have been drastically cut and employment is high ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all kids need good schools , tarneden said the gap between the rich and the poor is widening dramatically in germany .
more and more children are being socially excluded and are growing up in poverty and in families in which long-term unemployment reigns .
these children do n't have the role models they need because their parents have resigned themselves to dreadful circumstances , or because they ca n't get the training they need , or ca n't attend decent schools .
it 's precisely in the " bad " city districts where good schools should be located .
a crisis is brewing here , and we believe that tackling these problems now should be a priority .
why do you believe the push for improving children 's rights is coming now ?
the ratification of the unicef convention on the rights of the child a decade and a half ago has had effects over time .
also , people in germany are now discussing the social exclusion of children and how children are growing up in poverty .
we 're realizing that we just ca n't afford to leave kids by the wayside .
we see that in all the talks about poor education in this country .
the third reason , of course , is that all the media attention on these horrible cases of child abuse has prompted politicians to say that action needs to be taken to make germany a more hospitable place for children .
what do you mean exactly by " we 're realizing we ca n't afford to leave children by the wayside . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one in 10 german students leave school without a degree right now , 10 percent of each class of school kids quits before receiving a degree .
that translates into tens of thousands of young people each year .
what are they going to do later ?
how are they going to live ?
we 're living on borrowed time .
not only does that mean major problems for the kids themselves in finding a job , but it presents a huge problem for society as a whole .
would there be a list of requirements to ensure that children are being protected ?
who would keep track of upholding the law should children 's rights be enshrined in the constitution by 2009 , as some expect ?
that 's the big question right now and the major issue that must be discussed .
should there be some sort of agency in each german state to oversee whether children 's rights are being upheld ?
who will report back on the issue ?
how will proposed laws be reviewed as to whether they would help or harm children ?
those are the really exciting questions , but we have n't reached that point yet . louisa schaefer interviewed rudi tarneden send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts shed light on germany 's poverty and welfare woes new studies in germany shed light on the twin problems of growing poverty and a deficit in the child-welfare system that could be related .

"
he was released last august . neither the german nor the turkish authorities tried to release him from guantanamo and instead shifted responsibility on to the us government , kurnaz told a special european parliament committee investigating charges of illegal us secret service activities in europe . kurnaz was arrested in pakistan two months after the sept.11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states .
he was handed over to us authorities who took him to guantanamo in january 2002 , saying he was suspected of supporting afghanistan 's former taliban rulers . kurnaz told meps that he went to pakistan to " deepen his -lrb- muslim -rrb- faith " but that he had never done anything illegal . " there is no excuse " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurnaz and docke -lrb- right -rrb- during the hearing but germany rejected a us offer to release kurnaz from guantanamo in october 2002 , with washington saying that there was no case against him , his lawyer said . " there is no excuse for this , " bernhard docke told dw-radio .
" i hope that the european parliament will shed light on this . " back in germany , however , authorities " tried to paint me as a liar , though they had decided to leave me in guantanamo , " kurnaz told parliamentarians . the turkish government also " did n't bother at all about me while i was imprisoned , " he said .
" they thought i was a spy for germany . " turkish officials interrogating him in the camp had told him that it was up to the us to release him , kurnaz said .
other guantanamo inmates with turkish citizenship , however , were taken back to turkey , kurnaz claimed . mistreated by germans ? kurnaz also said that german soldiers in afghanistan mistreated him before he was transferred to guantanamo bay .
us forces had handed him over to two members of the german special forces command , ksk , who had pulled his head back , banged his head on the floor and one stamped on him , kurnaz said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ksk members during a training session in germany " they asked me if i knew who they were and then they said , ' we are the ksk , " ' he said , adding that the men had german flags on their uniforms and spoke german with him . " i thought they would have some questions and that they could help me , but they told me i had chosen the wrong side , " kurnaz said . the german defense ministry is currently investigating the claims .
after saying that it had no evidence that german soldiers had interrogated kurnaz , the authority last week admitted that ksk forces had been " in contact " with him , according to german media reports . " it does n't take much imagination -lrb- to believe -rrb- that the ksk soldiers were capable of doing that , " kurnaz said .
" they were there to help the americans , and we know from the abu ghraib case what us soldiers were doing there . " kurnaz also told the european committee that officials from denmark and belgium had visited nationals imprisoned in the guantanamo camp . kurnaz mulls further legal steps bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prisoners at guantanamo a german parliamentary committee is currently studying whether german security agencies breached any german rules while assisting post-2001 us anti-terrorism operations . european parliamentarians earlier this year slammed the german government under former chancellor gerhard schröder for failing to " come clean " over its involvement in the kurnaz case . us authorities never issued an arrest warrant and there was no legal procedure against kurnaz , his lawyer has said .
docke also told dw-radio that his client demanded the truth about the case .

in light of recent cases of deaths due to neglect , it 's becoming a pressing issue . dw-world.de spoke with rudi tarneden , a spokesman for unicef deutschland , the german branch of the united nations children 's fund , about what would change in germany if children 's rights were part of the constitution .
dw-world.de : let 's assume that children 's rights will become part of the constitution at some point .
how would those rights be guaranteed ?
rudi tarneden : this past august , during an event hosted by unicef germany and the deutscher kinderschutzbund -lrb- a german lobby organization for the protection of children -rrb- , chancellor angela merkel said for the first time that she could envision including children 's rights in the constitution .
this fall , family minister ursula von der leyen stressed the need again following the cases of child neglect and killing that have recently come to light .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a growing awareness of children 's rights in germany putting children 's rights in the constitution would strengthen young people 's position in society , especially in terms of new policies being drafted - policies that concern children , but also those that affect immigrants and even issues like urban design to make cities more child-friendly .
it would also mean that youth offices could take legal action more quickly and easily in cases of child neglect .
currently , youth office agents are very reluctant to get involved in a family 's private sphere .
parental rights are more respected than children 's rights .
also , there be would a change of attitude from " raising children is a private , family matter and we 'll get involved only in an emergency " to " children and the raising of them are a social concern whereby both the state and parents bear responsibility . "
yet , in the recent cases of child deaths due to neglect , youth offices knew that at least some of the families were high-risk , but they did n't get involved .
were n't those emergencies ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts warn that child neglect and abuse occur in all levels of society that 's the problem .
those are the cases in which everyone is aware of what 's going on , but no one does anything .
if the state were to get more involved , people in society would take a closer look and take action , and vice versa .
unicef recently published a report that focuses on child abuse in industrialized countries .
for germany , the report shows that on the average , two children die per week as the result of abuse or neglect .
but that 's just the tip of the iceberg - there are plenty of children who manage to live , but who suffer physical and psychological violence as they grow up .
they , of course , are not included in those numbers .
i should make clear that laws will not stop child neglect and abuse , but that new laws could give agencies more possibilities for taking action .
things have improved in the past few decades , but child mortality rates due to neglect are still too high .
if laws ca n't do it all , how can people 's attitudes become more attuned to the needs of children ?
in 2000 , a ban on physical punishment to reprimand children was drafted .
there were major discussions on the issue and whether or not parents should be forbidden to spank or slap their children .
but the fact is that this new law helped to readjust people 's attitudes toward children - namely , that the social norms of respect and grace that adults expect in their dealings with one another should also be expected in behavior towards children .
such laws herald long-term processes in which attitudes toward children gradually change for the better .
one should n't underestimate their psychological effects .
you said adding children 's rights to the constitution will not prevent child abuse .
is n't money also an issue - as budgets for kindergarten care have been drastically cut and employment is high ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all kids need good schools , tarneden said the gap between the rich and the poor is widening dramatically in germany .
more and more children are being socially excluded and are growing up in poverty and in families in which long-term unemployment reigns .
these children do n't have the role models they need because their parents have resigned themselves to dreadful circumstances , or because they ca n't get the training they need , or ca n't attend decent schools .
it 's precisely in the " bad " city districts where good schools should be located .
a crisis is brewing here , and we believe that tackling these problems now should be a priority .
why do you believe the push for improving children 's rights is coming now ?
the ratification of the unicef convention on the rights of the child a decade and a half ago has had effects over time .
also , people in germany are now discussing the social exclusion of children and how children are growing up in poverty .
we 're realizing that we just ca n't afford to leave kids by the wayside .
we see that in all the talks about poor education in this country .
the third reason , of course , is that all the media attention on these horrible cases of child abuse has prompted politicians to say that action needs to be taken to make germany a more hospitable place for children .
what do you mean exactly by " we 're realizing we ca n't afford to leave children by the wayside . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one in 10 german students leave school without a degree right now , 10 percent of each class of school kids quits before receiving a degree .
that translates into tens of thousands of young people each year .
what are they going to do later ?
how are they going to live ?
we 're living on borrowed time .
not only does that mean major problems for the kids themselves in finding a job , but it presents a huge problem for society as a whole .
would there be a list of requirements to ensure that children are being protected ?
who would keep track of upholding the law should children 's rights be enshrined in the constitution by 2009 , as some expect ?
that 's the big question right now and the major issue that must be discussed .
should there be some sort of agency in each german state to oversee whether children 's rights are being upheld ?
who will report back on the issue ?
how will proposed laws be reviewed as to whether they would help or harm children ?
those are the really exciting questions , but we have n't reached that point yet . louisa schaefer interviewed rudi tarneden send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts shed light on germany 's poverty and welfare woes new studies in germany shed light on the twin problems of growing poverty and a deficit in the child-welfare system that could be related .

22 as she took the reins of an unwieldy " grand coalition " government after an inconclusive general election . the result , a marriage of merkel 's conservative christian union and its chief political rival , the social democrats of her predecessor gerhard schröder , has tested her leadership abilities to the limit . lacking schröder 's natural charisma , the trained physicist has instead relied on meticulous preparation , gentle humor and a modest style to lead europe 's most populous country and biggest economic power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : known for her sober approach to government , merkel will still celebrate her one year anniversary merkel , 52 , even dispensed with the champagne traditionally served when the coalition agreement is signed , pouring mineral water instead in a sign of a new sobriety in german politics after the often flamboyant schröder . she will nevertheless throw a small cocktail party on wednesday evening to thank the cabinet " for the good cooperation and good atmosphere " of the last year , her spokesman ulrich wilhelm said . foreign policy sucesses merkel has racked up her biggest triumphs in foreign policy , kicking off the year with a hard-fought compromise on the european union budget that won her fans across the bloc . she also improved germany 's relationship with the bush administration , which was strained after germany 's refusal to join the us-led coalition in iraq . merkel also altered what was seen as schröder 's too-cozy relations with russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has patched up the relationship with us president george w. bush merkel has made a point of wooing president george w. bush and vladimir putin while taking each to task for human rights violations in guantanamo bay and chechnya - stances that have won cheers at home . military missions to monitor the first elections in four decades in the democratic republic of congo and an unprecedented postwar foray into the middle east to halt the flow of arms to hezbollah in lebanon have boosted germany 's stature . and with germany set to take over the presidencies of the group of eight most industrialized nations and the european union on jan .
1 , merkel will find herself under the most intense scrutiny of her career . merkel less popular at home yet at home , surveys show only a third of the country supports merkel 's conservatives , their lowest score since 2000 and the first time that a sitting chancellor has failed to score popularity points from an economic upturn . after initial euphoria , the public has expressed frustration with merkel 's slowly-but-surely " policy of small steps " in which she turns her microscope on each reform issue - health care , pensions , taxes - with hair-splitting intensity . " there is disappointment everywhere that this coalition has not used its large majorities in the lower and upper houses of parliament to perform great deeds , " the conservative daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung said this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sales tax increase from 16 to 19 percent is unpopular in germany beyond this tentative approach , germans are also wary about the resilience of the nascent economic recovery after four years of double-digit unemployment rates . a planned hike in value-added tax in january will make consumer goods more expensive across the board and potentially snuff out the economic upswing . and a growing gap between rich and poor has soured the mood and damaged the credibility of the major parties . dw staff / afp -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel emerges tested but unbowed after first year in office german chancellor angela merkel has had a trying first year in charge , holding together a fractious coalition government , presiding over a fall in unemployment and thawing relations with washington .

foreign trade policy is naturally also part of his job and he wants to expand contacts with " key regions of the future " that he 's already visited . beyond that , however , it 's hard to see a holistic strategic concept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 22.11.2006 " we ca n't afford to leave kids by the wayside " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " strengthening children 's rights helps in taking action against neglect " the german parliament 's commission for children 's concerns this week discussed including children 's rights in the constitution .
in light of recent cases of deaths due to neglect , it 's becoming a pressing issue . dw-world.de spoke with rudi tarneden , a spokesman for unicef deutschland , the german branch of the united nations children 's fund , about what would change in germany if children 's rights were part of the constitution .
dw-world.de : let 's assume that children 's rights will become part of the constitution at some point .
how would those rights be guaranteed ?
rudi tarneden : this past august , during an event hosted by unicef germany and the deutscher kinderschutzbund -lrb- a german lobby organization for the protection of children -rrb- , chancellor angela merkel said for the first time that she could envision including children 's rights in the constitution .
this fall , family minister ursula von der leyen stressed the need again following the cases of child neglect and killing that have recently come to light .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a growing awareness of children 's rights in germany putting children 's rights in the constitution would strengthen young people 's position in society , especially in terms of new policies being drafted - policies that concern children , but also those that affect immigrants and even issues like urban design to make cities more child-friendly .
it would also mean that youth offices could take legal action more quickly and easily in cases of child neglect .
currently , youth office agents are very reluctant to get involved in a family 's private sphere .
parental rights are more respected than children 's rights .
also , there be would a change of attitude from " raising children is a private , family matter and we 'll get involved only in an emergency " to " children and the raising of them are a social concern whereby both the state and parents bear responsibility . "
yet , in the recent cases of child deaths due to neglect , youth offices knew that at least some of the families were high-risk , but they did n't get involved .
were n't those emergencies ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts warn that child neglect and abuse occur in all levels of society that 's the problem .
those are the cases in which everyone is aware of what 's going on , but no one does anything .
if the state were to get more involved , people in society would take a closer look and take action , and vice versa .
unicef recently published a report that focuses on child abuse in industrialized countries .
for germany , the report shows that on the average , two children die per week as the result of abuse or neglect .
but that 's just the tip of the iceberg - there are plenty of children who manage to live , but who suffer physical and psychological violence as they grow up .
they , of course , are not included in those numbers .
i should make clear that laws will not stop child neglect and abuse , but that new laws could give agencies more possibilities for taking action .
things have improved in the past few decades , but child mortality rates due to neglect are still too high .
if laws ca n't do it all , how can people 's attitudes become more attuned to the needs of children ?
in 2000 , a ban on physical punishment to reprimand children was drafted .
there were major discussions on the issue and whether or not parents should be forbidden to spank or slap their children .
but the fact is that this new law helped to readjust people 's attitudes toward children - namely , that the social norms of respect and grace that adults expect in their dealings with one another should also be expected in behavior towards children .
such laws herald long-term processes in which attitudes toward children gradually change for the better .
one should n't underestimate their psychological effects .
you said adding children 's rights to the constitution will not prevent child abuse .
is n't money also an issue - as budgets for kindergarten care have been drastically cut and employment is high ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all kids need good schools , tarneden said the gap between the rich and the poor is widening dramatically in germany .
more and more children are being socially excluded and are growing up in poverty and in families in which long-term unemployment reigns .
these children do n't have the role models they need because their parents have resigned themselves to dreadful circumstances , or because they ca n't get the training they need , or ca n't attend decent schools .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 22.11.2006 " we ca n't afford to leave kids by the wayside " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " strengthening children 's rights helps in taking action against neglect " the german parliament 's commission for children 's concerns this week discussed including children 's rights in the constitution .
in light of recent cases of deaths due to neglect , it 's becoming a pressing issue . dw-world.de spoke with rudi tarneden , a spokesman for unicef deutschland , the german branch of the united nations children 's fund , about what would change in germany if children 's rights were part of the constitution .
dw-world.de : let 's assume that children 's rights will become part of the constitution at some point .
how would those rights be guaranteed ?
rudi tarneden : this past august , during an event hosted by unicef germany and the deutscher kinderschutzbund -lrb- a german lobby organization for the protection of children -rrb- , chancellor angela merkel said for the first time that she could envision including children 's rights in the constitution .
this fall , family minister ursula von der leyen stressed the need again following the cases of child neglect and killing that have recently come to light .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a growing awareness of children 's rights in germany putting children 's rights in the constitution would strengthen young people 's position in society , especially in terms of new policies being drafted - policies that concern children , but also those that affect immigrants and even issues like urban design to make cities more child-friendly .
it would also mean that youth offices could take legal action more quickly and easily in cases of child neglect .
currently , youth office agents are very reluctant to get involved in a family 's private sphere .
parental rights are more respected than children 's rights .
also , there be would a change of attitude from " raising children is a private , family matter and we 'll get involved only in an emergency " to " children and the raising of them are a social concern whereby both the state and parents bear responsibility . "
yet , in the recent cases of child deaths due to neglect , youth offices knew that at least some of the families were high-risk , but they did n't get involved .
were n't those emergencies ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts warn that child neglect and abuse occur in all levels of society that 's the problem .
those are the cases in which everyone is aware of what 's going on , but no one does anything .
if the state were to get more involved , people in society would take a closer look and take action , and vice versa .
unicef recently published a report that focuses on child abuse in industrialized countries .
for germany , the report shows that on the average , two children die per week as the result of abuse or neglect .
but that 's just the tip of the iceberg - there are plenty of children who manage to live , but who suffer physical and psychological violence as they grow up .
they , of course , are not included in those numbers .
i should make clear that laws will not stop child neglect and abuse , but that new laws could give agencies more possibilities for taking action .
things have improved in the past few decades , but child mortality rates due to neglect are still too high .
if laws ca n't do it all , how can people 's attitudes become more attuned to the needs of children ?
in 2000 , a ban on physical punishment to reprimand children was drafted .
there were major discussions on the issue and whether or not parents should be forbidden to spank or slap their children .
but the fact is that this new law helped to readjust people 's attitudes toward children - namely , that the social norms of respect and grace that adults expect in their dealings with one another should also be expected in behavior towards children .
such laws herald long-term processes in which attitudes toward children gradually change for the better .
one should n't underestimate their psychological effects .
you said adding children 's rights to the constitution will not prevent child abuse .
is n't money also an issue - as budgets for kindergarten care have been drastically cut and employment is high ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all kids need good schools , tarneden said the gap between the rich and the poor is widening dramatically in germany .
more and more children are being socially excluded and are growing up in poverty and in families in which long-term unemployment reigns .
these children do n't have the role models they need because their parents have resigned themselves to dreadful circumstances , or because they ca n't get the training they need , or ca n't attend decent schools .
it 's precisely in the " bad " city districts where good schools should be located .
a crisis is brewing here , and we believe that tackling these problems now should be a priority .
why do you believe the push for improving children 's rights is coming now ?
the ratification of the unicef convention on the rights of the child a decade and a half ago has had effects over time .
also , people in germany are now discussing the social exclusion of children and how children are growing up in poverty .
we 're realizing that we just ca n't afford to leave kids by the wayside .
we see that in all the talks about poor education in this country .
the third reason , of course , is that all the media attention on these horrible cases of child abuse has prompted politicians to say that action needs to be taken to make germany a more hospitable place for children .
what do you mean exactly by " we 're realizing we ca n't afford to leave children by the wayside . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one in 10 german students leave school without a degree right now , 10 percent of each class of school kids quits before receiving a degree .
that translates into tens of thousands of young people each year .
what are they going to do later ?
how are they going to live ?
we 're living on borrowed time .
not only does that mean major problems for the kids themselves in finding a job , but it presents a huge problem for society as a whole .

yet , in the recent cases of child deaths due to neglect , youth offices knew that at least some of the families were high-risk , but they did n't get involved .
were n't those emergencies ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts warn that child neglect and abuse occur in all levels of society that 's the problem .
those are the cases in which everyone is aware of what 's going on , but no one does anything .
if the state were to get more involved , people in society would take a closer look and take action , and vice versa .
unicef recently published a report that focuses on child abuse in industrialized countries .
for germany , the report shows that on the average , two children die per week as the result of abuse or neglect .
but that 's just the tip of the iceberg - there are plenty of children who manage to live , but who suffer physical and psychological violence as they grow up .
they , of course , are not included in those numbers .
i should make clear that laws will not stop child neglect and abuse , but that new laws could give agencies more possibilities for taking action .
things have improved in the past few decades , but child mortality rates due to neglect are still too high .
if laws ca n't do it all , how can people 's attitudes become more attuned to the needs of children ?
in 2000 , a ban on physical punishment to reprimand children was drafted .
there were major discussions on the issue and whether or not parents should be forbidden to spank or slap their children .
but the fact is that this new law helped to readjust people 's attitudes toward children - namely , that the social norms of respect and grace that adults expect in their dealings with one another should also be expected in behavior towards children .
such laws herald long-term processes in which attitudes toward children gradually change for the better .
one should n't underestimate their psychological effects .
you said adding children 's rights to the constitution will not prevent child abuse .
is n't money also an issue - as budgets for kindergarten care have been drastically cut and employment is high ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all kids need good schools , tarneden said the gap between the rich and the poor is widening dramatically in germany .
more and more children are being socially excluded and are growing up in poverty and in families in which long-term unemployment reigns .
these children do n't have the role models they need because their parents have resigned themselves to dreadful circumstances , or because they ca n't get the training they need , or ca n't attend decent schools .
it 's precisely in the " bad " city districts where good schools should be located .
a crisis is brewing here , and we believe that tackling these problems now should be a priority .
why do you believe the push for improving children 's rights is coming now ?
the ratification of the unicef convention on the rights of the child a decade and a half ago has had effects over time .
also , people in germany are now discussing the social exclusion of children and how children are growing up in poverty .
we 're realizing that we just ca n't afford to leave kids by the wayside .
we see that in all the talks about poor education in this country .
the third reason , of course , is that all the media attention on these horrible cases of child abuse has prompted politicians to say that action needs to be taken to make germany a more hospitable place for children .
what do you mean exactly by " we 're realizing we ca n't afford to leave children by the wayside . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one in 10 german students leave school without a degree right now , 10 percent of each class of school kids quits before receiving a degree .
that translates into tens of thousands of young people each year .
what are they going to do later ?
how are they going to live ?
we 're living on borrowed time .
not only does that mean major problems for the kids themselves in finding a job , but it presents a huge problem for society as a whole .
would there be a list of requirements to ensure that children are being protected ?
who would keep track of upholding the law should children 's rights be enshrined in the constitution by 2009 , as some expect ?
that 's the big question right now and the major issue that must be discussed .
should there be some sort of agency in each german state to oversee whether children 's rights are being upheld ?
who will report back on the issue ?
how will proposed laws be reviewed as to whether they would help or harm children ?

dw-world.de : let 's assume that children 's rights will become part of the constitution at some point .
how would those rights be guaranteed ?
rudi tarneden : this past august , during an event hosted by unicef germany and the deutscher kinderschutzbund -lrb- a german lobby organization for the protection of children -rrb- , chancellor angela merkel said for the first time that she could envision including children 's rights in the constitution .
this fall , family minister ursula von der leyen stressed the need again following the cases of child neglect and killing that have recently come to light .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a growing awareness of children 's rights in germany putting children 's rights in the constitution would strengthen young people 's position in society , especially in terms of new policies being drafted - policies that concern children , but also those that affect immigrants and even issues like urban design to make cities more child-friendly .
it would also mean that youth offices could take legal action more quickly and easily in cases of child neglect .

"
he was released last august . neither the german nor the turkish authorities tried to release him from guantanamo and instead shifted responsibility on to the us government , kurnaz told a special european parliament committee investigating charges of illegal us secret service activities in europe . kurnaz was arrested in pakistan two months after the sept.11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states .
he was handed over to us authorities who took him to guantanamo in january 2002 , saying he was suspected of supporting afghanistan 's former taliban rulers . kurnaz told meps that he went to pakistan to " deepen his -lrb- muslim -rrb- faith " but that he had never done anything illegal . " there is no excuse " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurnaz and docke -lrb- right -rrb- during the hearing but germany rejected a us offer to release kurnaz from guantanamo in october 2002 , with washington saying that there was no case against him , his lawyer said . " there is no excuse for this , " bernhard docke told dw-radio .
" i hope that the european parliament will shed light on this . " back in germany , however , authorities " tried to paint me as a liar , though they had decided to leave me in guantanamo , " kurnaz told parliamentarians . the turkish government also " did n't bother at all about me while i was imprisoned , " he said .
" they thought i was a spy for germany . " turkish officials interrogating him in the camp had told him that it was up to the us to release him , kurnaz said .
other guantanamo inmates with turkish citizenship , however , were taken back to turkey , kurnaz claimed . mistreated by germans ? kurnaz also said that german soldiers in afghanistan mistreated him before he was transferred to guantanamo bay .
us forces had handed him over to two members of the german special forces command , ksk , who had pulled his head back , banged his head on the floor and one stamped on him , kurnaz said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ksk members during a training session in germany " they asked me if i knew who they were and then they said , ' we are the ksk , " ' he said , adding that the men had german flags on their uniforms and spoke german with him . " i thought they would have some questions and that they could help me , but they told me i had chosen the wrong side , " kurnaz said . the german defense ministry is currently investigating the claims .
after saying that it had no evidence that german soldiers had interrogated kurnaz , the authority last week admitted that ksk forces had been " in contact " with him , according to german media reports . " it does n't take much imagination -lrb- to believe -rrb- that the ksk soldiers were capable of doing that , " kurnaz said .
" they were there to help the americans , and we know from the abu ghraib case what us soldiers were doing there . " kurnaz also told the european committee that officials from denmark and belgium had visited nationals imprisoned in the guantanamo camp . kurnaz mulls further legal steps bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prisoners at guantanamo a german parliamentary committee is currently studying whether german security agencies breached any german rules while assisting post-2001 us anti-terrorism operations . european parliamentarians earlier this year slammed the german government under former chancellor gerhard schröder for failing to " come clean " over its involvement in the kurnaz case . us authorities never issued an arrest warrant and there was no legal procedure against kurnaz , his lawyer has said .
docke also told dw-radio that his client demanded the truth about the case .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 22.11.2006 opinion : looking beyond the euro-atlantic horizon großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier 's first year in office was a tough one at times , deutsche welle 's nina werkhäuser thinks that it 's been a good one overall . " perceptional spectrum " is one of steinmeier 's favorite phrases and it says a lot about him .
the foreign minister has used his first year in office , first and foremost , to expand his own perceptional spectrum .
while the 50-year-old lawyer previously spent years sitting inside germany 's chancellery as former chancellor gerhard schröder 's chief-of-staff , he took off on a world trip in stages immediately after switching jobs . he visited south america , the arabian peninsula , southeast asia , central asia and north africa - and realized that a purely euro-atlantic approach to foreign policy is no longer sufficient in the 21st century .
the attention steinmeier pays to emerging regions on all five continents expands germany 's world - even if it 's not always clear right away where a common path may lead .
for now , steinmeier is making connections that might come in handy later . his impartiality and his interest in people and topics that he 's unfamiliar with are characteristics that help him in this regard .
his friendly , relaxed way has made him friends abroad and quickly turned him into the most popular politician of the grand coalition at home .
this happened despite his dry and often awkward way of expressing himself .
take " perceptional spectrum " as an example . his first year in office was also an educational year for steinmeier .
three kidnappings - two in iraq and one in yemen - put the top diplomat and his colleagues to the test .
all three had happy endings , largely due to his level-headed crisis management . the troubled german-american relationship was another construction site for the new government of social and christian democrats .
the chancellor took on this issue herself and steinmeier flanked her .
in general , merkel , a christian democrat , and steinmeier , a social democrat , work surprisingly well together . steinmeier heads to the middle east or holds talks about the iranian nuclear program , providing for continuity in german foreign policy by doing so .
merkel on the other hand deals with her mighty counterparts in washington and moscow and makes adjustments to the foreign policy standpoints of her predecessor .
schröder 's confidante steinmeier no longer has to bear responsibility for this . but he will not be able to evade testimony in front of the parliamentary inquiry in the el masri case in which a lebanese-born german claims to have been kidnapped by cia agents and tortured , as he played a crucial role in his capacity as head of the german chancellery . but what 's steinmeier 's strategy ?
he 's more concerned about energy policy than his predecessor as he thinks that long-term security of energy supplies is a central foreign policy issue .
foreign trade policy is naturally also part of his job and he wants to expand contacts with " key regions of the future " that he 's already visited . beyond that , however , it 's hard to see a holistic strategic concept .
questions of the day dominate steinmeier 's agenda too often and he remains vague and lacks differentiation with his politeness .
still , his foreign policy is solid , reliable and good overall . nina werkhäuser is dw-radio 's foreign affairs correspondent in berlin -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's new face abroad frank-walter steinmeier , a close ally of outgoing chancellor schröder , is set to be germany 's new foreign minister .
not much is known about the " silent star in schröder 's team , " who largely acted behind the scenes .

the german government has been adamant that the 7.5-percent stake being put up for sale should remain in german hands and must not be allowed to fall into french or russian hands . france is already represented in eads via a 30-percent interest shared by the state holding company sogeade and media group lagardere . russia and spain also have stakes in the aerospace consortium - russia via state-owned bank vneshtorgbank , which bought a 5.02-percent stake in september , and spain through the sepi holding group , which owns 5.48 percent . just after midday wednesday on the paris stock exchange , eads shares were showing a gain of 4.38 percent at 23.83 euros -lrb- $ 30.60 -rrb- , while in frankfurt , daimlerchrysler 's stock were showing a loss of 0.38 percent at 46.66 euros . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus decision on a350 looms amid us-eu trade dispute airbus has said it would not launch a new medium-sized jetliner before completing its restructuring plan .

"
he was released last august . neither the german nor the turkish authorities tried to release him from guantanamo and instead shifted responsibility on to the us government , kurnaz told a special european parliament committee investigating charges of illegal us secret service activities in europe . kurnaz was arrested in pakistan two months after the sept.11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states .
he was handed over to us authorities who took him to guantanamo in january 2002 , saying he was suspected of supporting afghanistan 's former taliban rulers . kurnaz told meps that he went to pakistan to " deepen his -lrb- muslim -rrb- faith " but that he had never done anything illegal . " there is no excuse " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurnaz and docke -lrb- right -rrb- during the hearing but germany rejected a us offer to release kurnaz from guantanamo in october 2002 , with washington saying that there was no case against him , his lawyer said . " there is no excuse for this , " bernhard docke told dw-radio .
" i hope that the european parliament will shed light on this . " back in germany , however , authorities " tried to paint me as a liar , though they had decided to leave me in guantanamo , " kurnaz told parliamentarians . the turkish government also " did n't bother at all about me while i was imprisoned , " he said .
" they thought i was a spy for germany . " turkish officials interrogating him in the camp had told him that it was up to the us to release him , kurnaz said .
other guantanamo inmates with turkish citizenship , however , were taken back to turkey , kurnaz claimed . mistreated by germans ? kurnaz also said that german soldiers in afghanistan mistreated him before he was transferred to guantanamo bay .
us forces had handed him over to two members of the german special forces command , ksk , who had pulled his head back , banged his head on the floor and one stamped on him , kurnaz said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ksk members during a training session in germany " they asked me if i knew who they were and then they said , ' we are the ksk , " ' he said , adding that the men had german flags on their uniforms and spoke german with him . " i thought they would have some questions and that they could help me , but they told me i had chosen the wrong side , " kurnaz said . the german defense ministry is currently investigating the claims .
after saying that it had no evidence that german soldiers had interrogated kurnaz , the authority last week admitted that ksk forces had been " in contact " with him , according to german media reports . " it does n't take much imagination -lrb- to believe -rrb- that the ksk soldiers were capable of doing that , " kurnaz said .
" they were there to help the americans , and we know from the abu ghraib case what us soldiers were doing there . " kurnaz also told the european committee that officials from denmark and belgium had visited nationals imprisoned in the guantanamo camp . kurnaz mulls further legal steps bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prisoners at guantanamo a german parliamentary committee is currently studying whether german security agencies breached any german rules while assisting post-2001 us anti-terrorism operations . european parliamentarians earlier this year slammed the german government under former chancellor gerhard schröder for failing to " come clean " over its involvement in the kurnaz case . us authorities never issued an arrest warrant and there was no legal procedure against kurnaz , his lawyer has said .
docke also told dw-radio that his client demanded the truth about the case . " we 'll decide whether to take further legal steps when we know what happened , " docke said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de former guantanamo prisoner kurnaz reveals extent of torture murat kurnaz , the german-born turk known as the bremen taliban , has spoken publically about the alleged torture he suffered at the hands of the us military in guantanamo bay .

22 as she took the reins of an unwieldy " grand coalition " government after an inconclusive general election . the result , a marriage of merkel 's conservative christian union and its chief political rival , the social democrats of her predecessor gerhard schröder , has tested her leadership abilities to the limit . lacking schröder 's natural charisma , the trained physicist has instead relied on meticulous preparation , gentle humor and a modest style to lead europe 's most populous country and biggest economic power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : known for her sober approach to government , merkel will still celebrate her one year anniversary merkel , 52 , even dispensed with the champagne traditionally served when the coalition agreement is signed , pouring mineral water instead in a sign of a new sobriety in german politics after the often flamboyant schröder . she will nevertheless throw a small cocktail party on wednesday evening to thank the cabinet " for the good cooperation and good atmosphere " of the last year , her spokesman ulrich wilhelm said . foreign policy sucesses merkel has racked up her biggest triumphs in foreign policy , kicking off the year with a hard-fought compromise on the european union budget that won her fans across the bloc . she also improved germany 's relationship with the bush administration , which was strained after germany 's refusal to join the us-led coalition in iraq . merkel also altered what was seen as schröder 's too-cozy relations with russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has patched up the relationship with us president george w. bush merkel has made a point of wooing president george w. bush and vladimir putin while taking each to task for human rights violations in guantanamo bay and chechnya - stances that have won cheers at home . military missions to monitor the first elections in four decades in the democratic republic of congo and an unprecedented postwar foray into the middle east to halt the flow of arms to hezbollah in lebanon have boosted germany 's stature . and with germany set to take over the presidencies of the group of eight most industrialized nations and the european union on jan .
1 , merkel will find herself under the most intense scrutiny of her career . merkel less popular at home yet at home , surveys show only a third of the country supports merkel 's conservatives , their lowest score since 2000 and the first time that a sitting chancellor has failed to score popularity points from an economic upturn . after initial euphoria , the public has expressed frustration with merkel 's slowly-but-surely " policy of small steps " in which she turns her microscope on each reform issue - health care , pensions , taxes - with hair-splitting intensity . " there is disappointment everywhere that this coalition has not used its large majorities in the lower and upper houses of parliament to perform great deeds , " the conservative daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung said this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sales tax increase from 16 to 19 percent is unpopular in germany beyond this tentative approach , germans are also wary about the resilience of the nascent economic recovery after four years of double-digit unemployment rates . a planned hike in value-added tax in january will make consumer goods more expensive across the board and potentially snuff out the economic upswing . and a growing gap between rich and poor has soured the mood and damaged the credibility of the major parties . dw staff / afp -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel emerges tested but unbowed after first year in office german chancellor angela merkel has had a trying first year in charge , holding together a fractious coalition government , presiding over a fall in unemployment and thawing relations with washington .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 22.11.2006 breakfast at angela 's großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surely a cookie is not enough in the morning reviewing her first year as chancellor , angela merkel revealed wednesday that leading a country - surprise , surprise - pretty much turns one 's life upside down .
but there 's at least one thing that 's remained unchanged . let 's face it : even before nov .
22 , 2005 , angela merkel 's life did n't exactly look like that of your average gretel .
as leader of germany 's main opposition party , she had tons of meetings with the more or less mighty .
she just did n't have to pay quite as much attention to hairdos and make-up .
she had to worry less about protocol while walking past soldiers on red carpets .
and , yes , she did n't have to lead a country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sauer -lrb- left -rrb- will join his wife on vacation , but he rarely comes along otherwise that 's all changed a bit over the past 365 days .
she 's now constantly in the limelight .
she 's had her apartment in central berlin retrofitted to comply with security standards worthy of a world leader .
she has even less time for her husband , a chemistry professor named joachim sauer who has decided that he 'd rather focus on his own work than accompany his wife at every occasion . sauer has also decided not to talk about his wife .

22 as she took the reins of an unwieldy " grand coalition " government after an inconclusive general election . the result , a marriage of merkel 's conservative christian union and its chief political rival , the social democrats of her predecessor gerhard schröder , has tested her leadership abilities to the limit . lacking schröder 's natural charisma , the trained physicist has instead relied on meticulous preparation , gentle humor and a modest style to lead europe 's most populous country and biggest economic power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : known for her sober approach to government , merkel will still celebrate her one year anniversary merkel , 52 , even dispensed with the champagne traditionally served when the coalition agreement is signed , pouring mineral water instead in a sign of a new sobriety in german politics after the often flamboyant schröder . she will nevertheless throw a small cocktail party on wednesday evening to thank the cabinet " for the good cooperation and good atmosphere " of the last year , her spokesman ulrich wilhelm said . foreign policy sucesses merkel has racked up her biggest triumphs in foreign policy , kicking off the year with a hard-fought compromise on the european union budget that won her fans across the bloc . she also improved germany 's relationship with the bush administration , which was strained after germany 's refusal to join the us-led coalition in iraq . merkel also altered what was seen as schröder 's too-cozy relations with russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has patched up the relationship with us president george w. bush merkel has made a point of wooing president george w. bush and vladimir putin while taking each to task for human rights violations in guantanamo bay and chechnya - stances that have won cheers at home . military missions to monitor the first elections in four decades in the democratic republic of congo and an unprecedented postwar foray into the middle east to halt the flow of arms to hezbollah in lebanon have boosted germany 's stature . and with germany set to take over the presidencies of the group of eight most industrialized nations and the european union on jan .
1 , merkel will find herself under the most intense scrutiny of her career . merkel less popular at home yet at home , surveys show only a third of the country supports merkel 's conservatives , their lowest score since 2000 and the first time that a sitting chancellor has failed to score popularity points from an economic upturn . after initial euphoria , the public has expressed frustration with merkel 's slowly-but-surely " policy of small steps " in which she turns her microscope on each reform issue - health care , pensions , taxes - with hair-splitting intensity . " there is disappointment everywhere that this coalition has not used its large majorities in the lower and upper houses of parliament to perform great deeds , " the conservative daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung said this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sales tax increase from 16 to 19 percent is unpopular in germany beyond this tentative approach , germans are also wary about the resilience of the nascent economic recovery after four years of double-digit unemployment rates . a planned hike in value-added tax in january will make consumer goods more expensive across the board and potentially snuff out the economic upswing . and a growing gap between rich and poor has soured the mood and damaged the credibility of the major parties . dw staff / afp -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel emerges tested but unbowed after first year in office german chancellor angela merkel has had a trying first year in charge , holding together a fractious coalition government , presiding over a fall in unemployment and thawing relations with washington .
-lrb- 19.11.2006 -rrb- merkel at fault for right-wing rise , opposition says the head of a german opposition political party accused the current government of fuelling right-wing unrest with its policies .

"
he was released last august . neither the german nor the turkish authorities tried to release him from guantanamo and instead shifted responsibility on to the us government , kurnaz told a special european parliament committee investigating charges of illegal us secret service activities in europe . kurnaz was arrested in pakistan two months after the sept.11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states .
he was handed over to us authorities who took him to guantanamo in january 2002 , saying he was suspected of supporting afghanistan 's former taliban rulers . kurnaz told meps that he went to pakistan to " deepen his -lrb- muslim -rrb- faith " but that he had never done anything illegal . " there is no excuse " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurnaz and docke -lrb- right -rrb- during the hearing but germany rejected a us offer to release kurnaz from guantanamo in october 2002 , with washington saying that there was no case against him , his lawyer said . " there is no excuse for this , " bernhard docke told dw-radio .
" i hope that the european parliament will shed light on this . " back in germany , however , authorities " tried to paint me as a liar , though they had decided to leave me in guantanamo , " kurnaz told parliamentarians . the turkish government also " did n't bother at all about me while i was imprisoned , " he said .
" they thought i was a spy for germany . " turkish officials interrogating him in the camp had told him that it was up to the us to release him , kurnaz said .
other guantanamo inmates with turkish citizenship , however , were taken back to turkey , kurnaz claimed . mistreated by germans ? kurnaz also said that german soldiers in afghanistan mistreated him before he was transferred to guantanamo bay .
us forces had handed him over to two members of the german special forces command , ksk , who had pulled his head back , banged his head on the floor and one stamped on him , kurnaz said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ksk members during a training session in germany " they asked me if i knew who they were and then they said , ' we are the ksk , " ' he said , adding that the men had german flags on their uniforms and spoke german with him . " i thought they would have some questions and that they could help me , but they told me i had chosen the wrong side , " kurnaz said . the german defense ministry is currently investigating the claims .
after saying that it had no evidence that german soldiers had interrogated kurnaz , the authority last week admitted that ksk forces had been " in contact " with him , according to german media reports . " it does n't take much imagination -lrb- to believe -rrb- that the ksk soldiers were capable of doing that , " kurnaz said .
" they were there to help the americans , and we know from the abu ghraib case what us soldiers were doing there . " kurnaz also told the european committee that officials from denmark and belgium had visited nationals imprisoned in the guantanamo camp . kurnaz mulls further legal steps bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prisoners at guantanamo a german parliamentary committee is currently studying whether german security agencies breached any german rules while assisting post-2001 us anti-terrorism operations . european parliamentarians earlier this year slammed the german government under former chancellor gerhard schröder for failing to " come clean " over its involvement in the kurnaz case . us authorities never issued an arrest warrant and there was no legal procedure against kurnaz , his lawyer has said .
docke also told dw-radio that his client demanded the truth about the case .

but there 's at least one thing that 's remained unchanged . let 's face it : even before nov .
22 , 2005 , angela merkel 's life did n't exactly look like that of your average gretel .
as leader of germany 's main opposition party , she had tons of meetings with the more or less mighty .
she just did n't have to pay quite as much attention to hairdos and make-up .
she had to worry less about protocol while walking past soldiers on red carpets .
and , yes , she did n't have to lead a country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sauer -lrb- left -rrb- will join his wife on vacation , but he rarely comes along otherwise that 's all changed a bit over the past 365 days .
she 's now constantly in the limelight .
she 's had her apartment in central berlin retrofitted to comply with security standards worthy of a world leader .
she has even less time for her husband , a chemistry professor named joachim sauer who has decided that he 'd rather focus on his own work than accompany his wife at every occasion . sauer has also decided not to talk about his wife .
the chancellor , on the other hand , apparently feels an obligation to share the odd private insight now and then .
on wednesday , the anniversary of her ascension to the chancellery , merkel did decide to respond to reporters from germany 's bild tabloid , who had asked whether her husband had noted any changes in her . " well , the breakfast that i 'm preparing for us is still the same , " merkel said . munching on pretzels the chancellor still has time to prepare breakfast .
surely there are millions of people with far less responsibility who barely manage to gulp down some coffee before they rush out the door . how does she do it ?
or , what 's even more interesting : what does she serve ?
a traditional german breakfast with meats , cheese , jam and soft-boiled eggs ?
one can only hope that her table looks a little more cheerful than the tupperware-laden arrangement that awaits a certain elizabeth ii in the morning . there 's quite a bit of information on merkel 's favorite dishes .
apparently she enjoys potato soup , roulades , stews and schnitzel , and she makes goose for christmas .
merkel clearly was n't willing to go into the details of her breakfast offerings though . maybe the subject 's a little too touchy for her .
after all , she did concede the conservative candidacy for chancellorship to bavarian premier edmund stoiber over breakfast -lrb- with pretzels -rrb- in 2002 .
a pretty smart move , one could say in hindsight , as stoiber lost the election , making merkel 's bid for the chancellorship possible in the 2005 elections . bildunterschrift : it 's not known whether merkel and stoiber -lrb- right -rrb- also had beer with breakfast in 2002 " i really like breakfast , " she recently told a women 's magazine . no wonder . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de angie admits to bad driving german chancellor angela merkel has been criticized for slamming the brakes on government reform and steering the government in the wrong direction after one year in office .

22 , 2005 , angela merkel 's life did n't exactly look like that of your average gretel .
as leader of germany 's main opposition party , she had tons of meetings with the more or less mighty .

she 's had her apartment in central berlin retrofitted to comply with security standards worthy of a world leader .
she has even less time for her husband , a chemistry professor named joachim sauer who has decided that he 'd rather focus on his own work than accompany his wife at every occasion . sauer has also decided not to talk about his wife .
the chancellor , on the other hand , apparently feels an obligation to share the odd private insight now and then .
on wednesday , the anniversary of her ascension to the chancellery , merkel did decide to respond to reporters from germany 's bild tabloid , who had asked whether her husband had noted any changes in her .

a traditional german breakfast with meats , cheese , jam and soft-boiled eggs ?
one can only hope that her table looks a little more cheerful than the tupperware-laden arrangement that awaits a certain elizabeth ii in the morning . there 's quite a bit of information on merkel 's favorite dishes .

" after years of stagnation , the country is on the upswing , " merkel said during a general debate on the budget in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german economy is on a six-year high the chancellor also pointed to increasing tax revenue as a sign of the coalition 's " effective " politics . " i think they are good results and we can be happy with them . " merkel said that despite the 3 percent increase in sales tax , which is to be introduced on jan .
1 , there was no evidence of weaker economic growth . however , many business analysts expect the tax increase to put the brakes on already weak consumer spending .
and the business confidence index , which reflects expectations for the german economy , fell again in november to its lowest point in seven years . year too short looking back at her first year as chancellor , merkel said it was a very short period " to prepare a land for the future . " but she said the coalition had enjoyed many successes in this time , such as a reform of the healthcare system , changes to inheritance tax , the introduction of a payment for new parents , and the participation of german soldiers in peacekeeping missions in lebanon and afghanistan . continuing conflicts with the social democrats the grand coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and merkel 's christian democrats took office in november 2005 more than two months after a general election gave neither of germany 's two biggest parties a clear mandate to form a majority government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter struck has been critical of angela merkel the spd 's parliamentary head , peter struck , admitted that after a year , the working relationship between the two coalition partners was difficult at times , but he emphasized there was a " relationship of trust .

" struck has been attacked by the christian democrats in recent weeks because he has , amongst other things , criticized angela merkel 's working methods . opposition says year wasted the acting chairman of the opposition free democrats , rainer brüderle , said the first year of the coalition " was a squandered year . " he said germany 's economic upsurge was not driven by the government but rather by german industry and business .
factors such as increased exports , the world cup and the hot summer had all contributed to the recovery , he added . " the federal government is neither the father nor the mother of the economic upswing , " brüderle said .

but there 's at least one thing that 's remained unchanged . let 's face it : even before nov .
22 , 2005 , angela merkel 's life did n't exactly look like that of your average gretel .
as leader of germany 's main opposition party , she had tons of meetings with the more or less mighty .
she just did n't have to pay quite as much attention to hairdos and make-up .
she had to worry less about protocol while walking past soldiers on red carpets .
and , yes , she did n't have to lead a country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sauer -lrb- left -rrb- will join his wife on vacation , but he rarely comes along otherwise that 's all changed a bit over the past 365 days .
she 's now constantly in the limelight .
she 's had her apartment in central berlin retrofitted to comply with security standards worthy of a world leader .
she has even less time for her husband , a chemistry professor named joachim sauer who has decided that he 'd rather focus on his own work than accompany his wife at every occasion . sauer has also decided not to talk about his wife .
the chancellor , on the other hand , apparently feels an obligation to share the odd private insight now and then .
on wednesday , the anniversary of her ascension to the chancellery , merkel did decide to respond to reporters from germany 's bild tabloid , who had asked whether her husband had noted any changes in her . " well , the breakfast that i 'm preparing for us is still the same , " merkel said . munching on pretzels the chancellor still has time to prepare breakfast .
surely there are millions of people with far less responsibility who barely manage to gulp down some coffee before they rush out the door . how does she do it ?
or , what 's even more interesting : what does she serve ?
a traditional german breakfast with meats , cheese , jam and soft-boiled eggs ?
one can only hope that her table looks a little more cheerful than the tupperware-laden arrangement that awaits a certain elizabeth ii in the morning . there 's quite a bit of information on merkel 's favorite dishes .
apparently she enjoys potato soup , roulades , stews and schnitzel , and she makes goose for christmas .
merkel clearly was n't willing to go into the details of her breakfast offerings though . maybe the subject 's a little too touchy for her .
after all , she did concede the conservative candidacy for chancellorship to bavarian premier edmund stoiber over breakfast -lrb- with pretzels -rrb- in 2002 .
a pretty smart move , one could say in hindsight , as stoiber lost the election , making merkel 's bid for the chancellorship possible in the 2005 elections . bildunterschrift : it 's not known whether merkel and stoiber -lrb- right -rrb- also had beer with breakfast in 2002 " i really like breakfast , " she recently told a women 's magazine . no wonder . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de angie admits to bad driving german chancellor angela merkel has been criticized for slamming the brakes on government reform and steering the government in the wrong direction after one year in office .
but now there 's a logical explanation .

the former head of the firm 's works council was charged with danger of suppressing evidence . german prosecutors took klaus volkert , the once mighty chief of vw 's workers ' council , into custody on tuesday , citing the danger that he would suppress evidence amid a continuing corruption investigation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hartz was nabbed a week ago the arrest came a week after former vw personnel director peter hartz was charged with 44 counts of breach of trust . the scandal centers on whether vw managers and works council members got illegal privileges , including lavish foreign trips and sex parties paid by the company . central figure volkert has been a central figure in the scandal since it broke some 18 months ago .

prosecutors remanded volkert into custody an arrest was made in the ongoing corruption investigation at german carmaker volkswagen .
the former head of the firm 's works council was charged with danger of suppressing evidence . german prosecutors took klaus volkert , the once mighty chief of vw 's workers ' council , into custody on tuesday , citing the danger that he would suppress evidence amid a continuing corruption investigation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hartz was nabbed a week ago the arrest came a week after former vw personnel director peter hartz was charged with 44 counts of breach of trust . the scandal centers on whether vw managers and works council members got illegal privileges , including lavish foreign trips and sex parties paid by the company . central figure volkert has been a central figure in the scandal since it broke some 18 months ago .
he was suspected of inciting breach of trust . like hartz , volkert resigned last year shortly after accusations against 12 vw managers and members of the workers ' council had been made public .
prosecutors believe he received illegal bonuses worth 2 million euro -lrb- $ 2.6 million -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gebauer , right , denied his guilt at a braunschweig court in 2005 according to the prosecutors ' office in braunschweig , near vw headquarters , volkert hoped to coerce other accused parties at vw - like former personnel manager klaus-joachim gebauer - into giving false statements and suppressing evidence .

"
he was released last august . neither the german nor the turkish authorities tried to release him from guantanamo and instead shifted responsibility on to the us government , kurnaz told a special european parliament committee investigating charges of illegal us secret service activities in europe . kurnaz was arrested in pakistan two months after the sept.11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states .
he was handed over to us authorities who took him to guantanamo in january 2002 , saying he was suspected of supporting afghanistan 's former taliban rulers . kurnaz told meps that he went to pakistan to " deepen his -lrb- muslim -rrb- faith " but that he had never done anything illegal . " there is no excuse " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurnaz and docke -lrb- right -rrb- during the hearing but germany rejected a us offer to release kurnaz from guantanamo in october 2002 , with washington saying that there was no case against him , his lawyer said . " there is no excuse for this , " bernhard docke told dw-radio .
" i hope that the european parliament will shed light on this . " back in germany , however , authorities " tried to paint me as a liar , though they had decided to leave me in guantanamo , " kurnaz told parliamentarians . the turkish government also " did n't bother at all about me while i was imprisoned , " he said .
" they thought i was a spy for germany . " turkish officials interrogating him in the camp had told him that it was up to the us to release him , kurnaz said .
other guantanamo inmates with turkish citizenship , however , were taken back to turkey , kurnaz claimed . mistreated by germans ? kurnaz also said that german soldiers in afghanistan mistreated him before he was transferred to guantanamo bay .
us forces had handed him over to two members of the german special forces command , ksk , who had pulled his head back , banged his head on the floor and one stamped on him , kurnaz said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ksk members during a training session in germany " they asked me if i knew who they were and then they said , ' we are the ksk , " ' he said , adding that the men had german flags on their uniforms and spoke german with him . " i thought they would have some questions and that they could help me , but they told me i had chosen the wrong side , " kurnaz said . the german defense ministry is currently investigating the claims .
after saying that it had no evidence that german soldiers had interrogated kurnaz , the authority last week admitted that ksk forces had been " in contact " with him , according to german media reports . " it does n't take much imagination -lrb- to believe -rrb- that the ksk soldiers were capable of doing that , " kurnaz said .
" they were there to help the americans , and we know from the abu ghraib case what us soldiers were doing there . " kurnaz also told the european committee that officials from denmark and belgium had visited nationals imprisoned in the guantanamo camp . kurnaz mulls further legal steps bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prisoners at guantanamo a german parliamentary committee is currently studying whether german security agencies breached any german rules while assisting post-2001 us anti-terrorism operations . european parliamentarians earlier this year slammed the german government under former chancellor gerhard schröder for failing to " come clean " over its involvement in the kurnaz case . us authorities never issued an arrest warrant and there was no legal procedure against kurnaz , his lawyer has said .
docke also told dw-radio that his client demanded the truth about the case . " we 'll decide whether to take further legal steps when we know what happened , " docke said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de former guantanamo prisoner kurnaz reveals extent of torture murat kurnaz , the german-born turk known as the bremen taliban , has spoken publically about the alleged torture he suffered at the hands of the us military in guantanamo bay .

councillors approved the project , which involves building flood defence walls and embankments to protect 500 homes .
the city has suffered five significant floods between 1982 and 2005 .
in march , the ea said funds were no longer available for this current financial year .
there has been no announcement on when work will start .
however , the ea said it wanted to secure planning permission so once funding became available it would be able to begin the detailed design of the scheme straight away .
' adverse impact ' the proposals include the river laver flood storage site at birkby nab and works at borrage lane , alma weir , fisher green and north bridge .
the development will result in the loss of more than 200 trees within the ripon conservation area .
recommending approval , harrogate borough council planning officer mark williams conceded the flood defences would have a major adverse impact on the landscape and had the potential to harm the ecology of the river and surrounding land .
" however , the proposed development would bring major significant social and economic benefits to the area , including the protection of domestic and commercial properties , and the long-term protection of the historic environment of ripon , " he said .
" considerable weight needs to be attached to these benefits , which are a material planning consideration and in this instance warrant setting aside local planning policies . "

a conversation between tony blair and the friends of the earth director tony juniper about the government 's climate change bill has been posted on the environmental group 's website .
cynics have argued the bill is a statutory manifestation of the panic brought on within the labour party by the way david cameron and the tories have seized the environmental agenda .
but officials within downing street argue this bill has been on the cards for some time , and that new labour were promising to cut greenhouse gas emissions way before the conservatives had climate change at the heart of their political agenda .
central to this parliamentary point scoring has been the environmental group , friends of the earth , which has moved from being considered dangerously wacky a few years ago , to now being wooed by all party leaders .
challenge mr cameron asked to share a platform with the group earlier this year to campaign for the climate change bill , and now tony blair has launched a debate on their website .
but do they like what mr blair says ?
well , the prime minister is obviously keen for the greens to be his friends as well as the planet 's .
" i suspect i share many more views on climate change with friends of the earth supporters than you might imagine , " he begins .
" i am fully aware of just how serious a challenge it is to our planet and way of life .
i agree as well there is a huge amount more to do both at home and internationally to cut emissions .
" above all , i share your view that there is very little time to waste .
there is , i promise you , no complacency in government .
" we recognise that we have little time before climate change becomes irreversible and possibly catastrophic . "
carbon emissions so far , so environmentally sound , the green groups would say .
the prime minister then goes on to talk about the uk 's record on reducing carbon emissions - not brilliant , but we are " on course to double our promised cuts in greenhouse gases .
no other country will get anywhere near this reduction . "
" we also intend , " he continues , " to put in place a raft of new measures , including new targets for renewable energy and energy efficiency , which friends of the earth support , and replacing nuclear plants which it does not - to continue progress towards our long-term goal of a 60 % reduction by 2050 . "
ah , the nuclear question - that 's likely to elicit a very unfriendly response from the friends .
one of the key demands of environmental groups - and , it has to be said , the other main political parties - when campaigning for a climate change bill was that there should be annual targets for reductions in greenhouse gases - and again , the prime minister knows he is going to upset them .
campaigners have called for carbon cuts for a long time " i know friends of the earth are disappointed that annual targets for reductions will not be part of the bill , " he said .
" a year is too short a period with too many factors such as a cold winter or a sudden hike in energy prices outside government control to make this a meaningful trigger for action . "
" the cold winter of 2001 , for example , saw emissions increase by 3 % over the previous year only to drop back again to the same level within 12 months .
" so annual targets would force action to be taken which could hit both families and business to tackle a problem which may already be disappearing by the time the measures are put in place . "
so , what does the politician 's green group of choice think of all this ?
the director of friends of the earth , tony juniper , replies in fairly trenchant terms .
' patchy record ' " i welcome that fact that you , prime minister , recognise the threat posed by climate change , as thankfully all our major political parties do now , " he says .
" unfortunately the problem has not been seeing the threat but making changes to address it .
" you make much of the government 's record to date on cutting carbon emissions but the figures reveal a more patchy record .
" for example , you say you are committed to cutting emissions of the main greenhouse gas , carbon dioxide , by 20 % by 2010 .
" unfortunately i do n't see how this will happen .
between 1990 and 2005 we managed only a 5 % reduction in carbon dioxide emissions .
the hard fact is our current approach simply is n't working .

a conversation between tony blair and the friends of the earth director tony juniper about the government 's climate change bill has been posted on the environmental group 's website .
cynics have argued the bill is a statutory manifestation of the panic brought on within the labour party by the way david cameron and the tories have seized the environmental agenda .
but officials within downing street argue this bill has been on the cards for some time , and that new labour were promising to cut greenhouse gas emissions way before the conservatives had climate change at the heart of their political agenda .
central to this parliamentary point scoring has been the environmental group , friends of the earth , which has moved from being considered dangerously wacky a few years ago , to now being wooed by all party leaders .
challenge mr cameron asked to share a platform with the group earlier this year to campaign for the climate change bill , and now tony blair has launched a debate on their website .
but do they like what mr blair says ?
well , the prime minister is obviously keen for the greens to be his friends as well as the planet 's .
" i suspect i share many more views on climate change with friends of the earth supporters than you might imagine , " he begins .
" i am fully aware of just how serious a challenge it is to our planet and way of life .
i agree as well there is a huge amount more to do both at home and internationally to cut emissions .
" above all , i share your view that there is very little time to waste .
there is , i promise you , no complacency in government .
" we recognise that we have little time before climate change becomes irreversible and possibly catastrophic . "
carbon emissions so far , so environmentally sound , the green groups would say .
the prime minister then goes on to talk about the uk 's record on reducing carbon emissions - not brilliant , but we are " on course to double our promised cuts in greenhouse gases .
no other country will get anywhere near this reduction . "
" we also intend , " he continues , " to put in place a raft of new measures , including new targets for renewable energy and energy efficiency , which friends of the earth support , and replacing nuclear plants which it does not - to continue progress towards our long-term goal of a 60 % reduction by 2050 . "
ah , the nuclear question - that 's likely to elicit a very unfriendly response from the friends .
one of the key demands of environmental groups - and , it has to be said , the other main political parties - when campaigning for a climate change bill was that there should be annual targets for reductions in greenhouse gases - and again , the prime minister knows he is going to upset them .
campaigners have called for carbon cuts for a long time " i know friends of the earth are disappointed that annual targets for reductions will not be part of the bill , " he said .
" a year is too short a period with too many factors such as a cold winter or a sudden hike in energy prices outside government control to make this a meaningful trigger for action . "
" the cold winter of 2001 , for example , saw emissions increase by 3 % over the previous year only to drop back again to the same level within 12 months .
" so annual targets would force action to be taken which could hit both families and business to tackle a problem which may already be disappearing by the time the measures are put in place . "
so , what does the politician 's green group of choice think of all this ?
the director of friends of the earth , tony juniper , replies in fairly trenchant terms .
' patchy record ' " i welcome that fact that you , prime minister , recognise the threat posed by climate change , as thankfully all our major political parties do now , " he says .
" unfortunately the problem has not been seeing the threat but making changes to address it .
" you make much of the government 's record to date on cutting carbon emissions but the figures reveal a more patchy record .
" for example , you say you are committed to cutting emissions of the main greenhouse gas , carbon dioxide , by 20 % by 2010 .
" unfortunately i do n't see how this will happen .
between 1990 and 2005 we managed only a 5 % reduction in carbon dioxide emissions .
the hard fact is our current approach simply is n't working .
we need a new one .
tony juniper director , friends of the earth " to meet this target , we must now cut carbon emissions almost 10 times as fast .
is that really possible ?
" and thank goodness we are on track to meet our kyoto target , but doubling it looks doubtful .
" it has taken six years to cut our kyoto emissions by 1 % - to double the target we need a 10 % cut in the next five years .

campaigners have called for carbon cuts for a long time " i know friends of the earth are disappointed that annual targets for reductions will not be part of the bill , " he said .
" a year is too short a period with too many factors such as a cold winter or a sudden hike in energy prices outside government control to make this a meaningful trigger for action . "
" the cold winter of 2001 , for example , saw emissions increase by 3 % over the previous year only to drop back again to the same level within 12 months .
" so annual targets would force action to be taken which could hit both families and business to tackle a problem which may already be disappearing by the time the measures are put in place . "
so , what does the politician 's green group of choice think of all this ?
the director of friends of the earth , tony juniper , replies in fairly trenchant terms .
' patchy record ' " i welcome that fact that you , prime minister , recognise the threat posed by climate change , as thankfully all our major political parties do now , " he says .
" unfortunately the problem has not been seeing the threat but making changes to address it .
" you make much of the government 's record to date on cutting carbon emissions but the figures reveal a more patchy record .
" for example , you say you are committed to cutting emissions of the main greenhouse gas , carbon dioxide , by 20 % by 2010 .
" unfortunately i do n't see how this will happen .
between 1990 and 2005 we managed only a 5 % reduction in carbon dioxide emissions .
the hard fact is our current approach simply is n't working .
we need a new one .
tony juniper director , friends of the earth " to meet this target , we must now cut carbon emissions almost 10 times as fast .
is that really possible ?
" and thank goodness we are on track to meet our kyoto target , but doubling it looks doubtful .
" it has taken six years to cut our kyoto emissions by 1 % - to double the target we need a 10 % cut in the next five years .
" the hard fact is our current approach simply is n't working .
we need a new one . "
in other words , your approach is n't working , prime minister , and you need a new one ...
investments and he does n't think much of the prime minister 's arguments against annual targets .
mr juniper said they " are needed to ensure that we remain on track to deliver the small cuts that in the end will add up to big ones " .
he added : " right now we have some good targets , but they are all in the future .
when the future arrives and we find that we did n't meet them , then it is too late .
the damage to the climate will be done . "
on to the nuclear issue : " yes , we disagree on nuclear .
but not for the reasons you probably think .
" our major argument against nuclear is that we could cut carbon emissions more cheaply and quickly if investments were instead encouraged in energy efficiency and renewable power , " he said .
" of course there are serious worries about waste , accidents and terrorist threats .
weighing those risks against climate change is never going to be easy but as alternatives to nuclear would be more effective , we actually do n't need to . "
political debate but after taking mr blair to task , mr juniper does ends with warm words - but he 's not going to let that point on annual targets go : " you are one of very few world leaders who has seen the scale of threat and who has advocated action .
" you have been successful in establishing a political debate that has helped to create perhaps our last chance to avoid the worst effects of rapid global warming .
" seizing the opportunity provided by the new bill , enacting annual targets , and in so doing showing the world that you and the british people are serious about protecting our way of life , would be an act of leadership that would rally the full support of friends of the earth , and most of the wider environmental community .
" if you act boldly here , if you lead in britain , then the rest of the world will very likely follow you . "

a conversation between tony blair and the friends of the earth director tony juniper about the government 's climate change bill has been posted on the environmental group 's website .
cynics have argued the bill is a statutory manifestation of the panic brought on within the labour party by the way david cameron and the tories have seized the environmental agenda .

well , the prime minister is obviously keen for the greens to be his friends as well as the planet 's .
" i suspect i share many more views on climate change with friends of the earth supporters than you might imagine , " he begins .
" i am fully aware of just how serious a challenge it is to our planet and way of life .
i agree as well there is a huge amount more to do both at home and internationally to cut emissions .
" above all , i share your view that there is very little time to waste .
there is , i promise you , no complacency in government .
" we recognise that we have little time before climate change becomes irreversible and possibly catastrophic . "
carbon emissions so far , so environmentally sound , the green groups would say .
the prime minister then goes on to talk about the uk 's record on reducing carbon emissions - not brilliant , but we are " on course to double our promised cuts in greenhouse gases .
no other country will get anywhere near this reduction . "
" we also intend , " he continues , " to put in place a raft of new measures , including new targets for renewable energy and energy efficiency , which friends of the earth support , and replacing nuclear plants which it does not - to continue progress towards our long-term goal of a 60 % reduction by 2050 .

but do they like what mr blair says ?
well , the prime minister is obviously keen for the greens to be his friends as well as the planet 's .
" i suspect i share many more views on climate change with friends of the earth supporters than you might imagine , " he begins .
" i am fully aware of just how serious a challenge it is to our planet and way of life .
i agree as well there is a huge amount more to do both at home and internationally to cut emissions .
" above all , i share your view that there is very little time to waste .
there is , i promise you , no complacency in government .
" we recognise that we have little time before climate change becomes irreversible and possibly catastrophic . "
carbon emissions so far , so environmentally sound , the green groups would say .
the prime minister then goes on to talk about the uk 's record on reducing carbon emissions - not brilliant , but we are " on course to double our promised cuts in greenhouse gases .
no other country will get anywhere near this reduction . "
" we also intend , " he continues , " to put in place a raft of new measures , including new targets for renewable energy and energy efficiency , which friends of the earth support , and replacing nuclear plants which it does not - to continue progress towards our long-term goal of a 60 % reduction by 2050 . "
ah , the nuclear question - that 's likely to elicit a very unfriendly response from the friends .
one of the key demands of environmental groups - and , it has to be said , the other main political parties - when campaigning for a climate change bill was that there should be annual targets for reductions in greenhouse gases - and again , the prime minister knows he is going to upset them .
campaigners have called for carbon cuts for a long time " i know friends of the earth are disappointed that annual targets for reductions will not be part of the bill , " he said .
" a year is too short a period with too many factors such as a cold winter or a sudden hike in energy prices outside government control to make this a meaningful trigger for action . "
" the cold winter of 2001 , for example , saw emissions increase by 3 % over the previous year only to drop back again to the same level within 12 months .
" so annual targets would force action to be taken which could hit both families and business to tackle a problem which may already be disappearing by the time the measures are put in place . "
so , what does the politician 's green group of choice think of all this ?
the director of friends of the earth , tony juniper , replies in fairly trenchant terms .
' patchy record ' " i welcome that fact that you , prime minister , recognise the threat posed by climate change , as thankfully all our major political parties do now , " he says .
" unfortunately the problem has not been seeing the threat but making changes to address it .
" you make much of the government 's record to date on cutting carbon emissions but the figures reveal a more patchy record .
" for example , you say you are committed to cutting emissions of the main greenhouse gas , carbon dioxide , by 20 % by 2010 .
" unfortunately i do n't see how this will happen .
between 1990 and 2005 we managed only a 5 % reduction in carbon dioxide emissions .
the hard fact is our current approach simply is n't working .
we need a new one .
tony juniper director , friends of the earth " to meet this target , we must now cut carbon emissions almost 10 times as fast .
is that really possible ?
" and thank goodness we are on track to meet our kyoto target , but doubling it looks doubtful .
" it has taken six years to cut our kyoto emissions by 1 % - to double the target we need a 10 % cut in the next five years .
" the hard fact is our current approach simply is n't working .
we need a new one . "
in other words , your approach is n't working , prime minister , and you need a new one ...
investments and he does n't think much of the prime minister 's arguments against annual targets .
mr juniper said they " are needed to ensure that we remain on track to deliver the small cuts that in the end will add up to big ones " .
he added : " right now we have some good targets , but they are all in the future .
when the future arrives and we find that we did n't meet them , then it is too late .
the damage to the climate will be done . "
on to the nuclear issue : " yes , we disagree on nuclear .
but not for the reasons you probably think .
" our major argument against nuclear is that we could cut carbon emissions more cheaply and quickly if investments were instead encouraged in energy efficiency and renewable power , " he said .
" of course there are serious worries about waste , accidents and terrorist threats .
weighing those risks against climate change is never going to be easy but as alternatives to nuclear would be more effective , we actually do n't need to . "
political debate but after taking mr blair to task , mr juniper does ends with warm words - but he 's not going to let that point on annual targets go : " you are one of very few world leaders who has seen the scale of threat and who has advocated action .
" you have been successful in establishing a political debate that has helped to create perhaps our last chance to avoid the worst effects of rapid global warming .
" seizing the opportunity provided by the new bill , enacting annual targets , and in so doing showing the world that you and the british people are serious about protecting our way of life , would be an act of leadership that would rally the full support of friends of the earth , and most of the wider environmental community .
" if you act boldly here , if you lead in britain , then the rest of the world will very likely follow you . "
the idea is that these are the opening positions in a web-based debate to which everyone can respond - go to www.foe.co.uk if you want to take part .

scientists say levels have been stable for about seven years following a steep rise during the last century .
researchers believe the slowdown may be due to measures aimed at reducing the release of methane from gas pipelines , paddy fields and landfill sites .
the findings are published in the journal geophysical research letters .
the study also found that major forest fires , such as occurred in indonesia in 1997 and 1998 , produce significant quantities of methane . "
if one really tightens emissions , we will gain some ground on global warming " sherwood rowland " methane is not as significant a greenhouse gas as carbon dioxide , but its effects are important , " said sherwood rowland from the university of california at irvine , us .
" the world needs to work hard to reduce emissions of all greenhouse gases . "
professor rowland was a member of the four-person team on this project , and a nobel laureate for his work on the ozone layer .
breaking down methane is the second most important gas contributing to the human-made greenhouse effect after carbon dioxide .
current concentrations are about 150 % above pre-industrial levels .
but because methane is broken down relatively easily , atmospheric concentrations would return to pre-industrial levels within about a decade if the various sources of production linked to human activities could be eliminated .
this has led some scientists and policymakers to suggest that cutting emissions of methane could be a more effective way of curbing climate change than focusing on carbon dioxide .
measures adopted in various parts of the world include sealing leaks in gas pipelines , capturing and using methane from landfill sites and farm effluent , and changing farming practices to reduce emissions from rice paddies .
the latest research suggests these measures are working , with concentrations unchanged over the last seven years .
if this trend continues , it suggests that temperature rises over the next few decades could be marginally lower than previously predicted , even though emissions of other greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide are rising .
" if one really tightens emissions , the amount of methane in the atmosphere 10 years from now could be less than it is today , " observed professor rowland .
" we will gain some ground on global warming if methane is not as large a contributor in the future as it has been in the past century . "

" the world needs to work hard to reduce emissions of all greenhouse gases . "
professor rowland was a member of the four-person team on this project , and a nobel laureate for his work on the ozone layer .
breaking down methane is the second most important gas contributing to the human-made greenhouse effect after carbon dioxide .
current concentrations are about 150 % above pre-industrial levels .
but because methane is broken down relatively easily , atmospheric concentrations would return to pre-industrial levels within about a decade if the various sources of production linked to human activities could be eliminated .
this has led some scientists and policymakers to suggest that cutting emissions of methane could be a more effective way of curbing climate change than focusing on carbon dioxide .
measures adopted in various parts of the world include sealing leaks in gas pipelines , capturing and using methane from landfill sites and farm effluent , and changing farming practices to reduce emissions from rice paddies .
the latest research suggests these measures are working , with concentrations unchanged over the last seven years .
if this trend continues , it suggests that temperature rises over the next few decades could be marginally lower than previously predicted , even though emissions of other greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide are rising .
" if one really tightens emissions , the amount of methane in the atmosphere 10 years from now could be less than it is today , " observed professor rowland .
" we will gain some ground on global warming if methane is not as large a contributor in the future as it has been in the past century . "

by moira constable chief executive , the rural housing trust more and more people are following their dream and moving out of the urban areas , either in pursuit of a much-vaunted lifestyle idyll or to invest in a second home .
it is no coincidence that at the same time , local people are deserting the villages where the houses once occupied by their parents and grandparents have become too expensive for them .
there is no choice for them to exercise .
whilst freedom to move around and second home ownership in themselves are no bad things , they come at the expense of sustainability in rural areas .
if you are a newcomer to village life , surely you want to have a drink in the pub , buy a loaf of bread in the village shop or send your kids to the local school .
if you are a long-time country dweller , these ingredients of village life together with the church , the post office , and the cricket club are not just a pretty backdrop , but the vehicles for social interaction , the fabric which binds you with the rest of the community .
so , village services , businesses and social activities need custom and support as well as people to work in them .
local affordability villages that become exclusive settlements for the wealthy risk losing everything that attracted the new inhabitants there in the first place .
villages do n't need any old housing ; they need affordable housing .
they need it for local people .
urgently .
accepting that some house-building must take place to meet the needs of local people in villages is the first step to progress .
society then needs to overcome the knee-jerk reaction to house-building : shock , horror , absolutely not , and reject the idea that all affordable housing equals cheap and nasty housing .
these days , quality standards for housing association development in rural areas are very high and parish councils demand small-scale , sensitive development . "
right to buy policies have taught us what happens when housing , which is meant to be affordable , is bought out . "
housing associations must keep the confidence of local residents .
the rural community will understandably not support village housing schemes if guarantees on affordability and " homes for local people only " claims can not be kept .
right to buy policies have taught us what happens when housing which is meant to be affordable is bought out .
similarly , why should landowners give up land , often at vastly reduced prices , for such housing when the homes are not retained for the community in perpetuity ?
fortunately , these guarantees do currently exist in villages and it is important to keep them .
it is a mistaken belief that all green belt land is beautiful , to be retained without question .
where there is clear evidence of local housing need and where new housing would benefit the village , it is perfectly possible to build on the green belt under current planning policy .
local involvement it is a question of balance and compromise .
from the developer 's viewpoint , clearly we must be sensitive to local feeling .
gaining community acceptance is so much easier if you are open , if you involve parish councils and provide opportunities for local people to have their say .
design is important .
the successful housing of the future will pay close attention to architectural detail and layout and respect the local style .
increasingly in villages , it is not just people on low incomes who need help but also people in relatively well-paid jobs who still can not afford a home .
the housing of the future will therefore include opportunities for part-ownership as well as renting to reflect the wider make-up of the local community .
finally , sustainability is not all about bus frequency and proximity to facilities .
it is people who make a village sustainable .
ask a young family , removed from the resources and facilities available in towns and cities , what sustainability means and they will say being close to other family members for support .
the same goes for older people who have come to rely upon the informal social networks that are so characteristic of village life .
rural housing is so much more than bricks and mortar .
it 's about maintaining the kinds of villages we have come to expect .

by moira constable chief executive , the rural housing trust affordable rural housing is an issue for the local communities more and more people are following their dream and moving out of the urban areas , either in pursuit of a much-vaunted lifestyle idyll or to invest in a second home .
it is no coincidence that at the same time , local people are deserting the villages where the houses once occupied by their parents and grandparents have become too expensive for them .
there is no choice for them to exercise .
whilst freedom to move around and second home ownership in themselves are no bad things , they come at the expense of sustainability in rural areas .
if you are a newcomer to village life , surely you want to have a drink in the pub , buy a loaf of bread in the village shop or send your kids to the local school .
if you are a long-time country dweller , these ingredients of village life together with the church , the post office , and the cricket club are not just a pretty backdrop , but the vehicles for social interaction , the fabric which binds you with the rest of the community .
so , village services , businesses and social activities need custom and support as well as people to work in them .
local affordability villages that become exclusive settlements for the wealthy risk losing everything that attracted the new inhabitants there in the first place .
villages do n't need any old housing ; they need affordable housing .
they need it for local people .
urgently .
accepting that some house-building must take place to meet the needs of local people in villages is the first step to progress .
society then needs to overcome the knee-jerk reaction to house-building : shock , horror , absolutely not , and reject the idea that all affordable housing equals cheap and nasty housing .
these days , quality standards for housing association development in rural areas are very high and parish councils demand small-scale , sensitive development .
right to buy policies have taught us what happens when housing , which is meant to be affordable , is bought out .
housing associations must keep the confidence of local residents .
the rural community will understandably not support village housing schemes if guarantees on affordability and " homes for local people only " claims can not be kept .

the wife of the indonesian president was at the airport to welcome the animals , who were confiscated from bangkok 's safari world two years ago .
they were due back in september , but a thai military coup thwarted that plan .
they are now heading to a jungle reserve on the island of borneo , where they will undergo medical tests .
the orangutans , sporting boxing gloves and brightly-coloured shorts , had been a feature at the safari world park for decades .
the animals are heading for a reserve in borneo but the practice was stopped in 2004 as international pressure mounted , and the animals were confiscated shortly afterwards .
five other animals belonging to the original troop have remained in thailand for medical treatment , but are also due to return home .
" we are very happy to get the orangutans back , " said the president 's wife , kristiani yudhoyono .
" they belong to our vast nation , therefore we have to take them back to their habitat in a proper way . "
under threat experts estimate that there are only 60,000 of the animals left in the wild on borneo and sumatra .
forestry clearance and illegal trading seriously threaten the species , and some estimates suggest those remaining could all but disappear in the course of the next decade .
forest fires , which some believe are a direct result of clearing the land for oil palm plantations , are also taking their toll .

in her first television interview since her split with sir paul mccartney , she told us entertainment show extra she would never marry again .
the 38-year-old former model , who lost a leg in a motorbike accident in 1993 , said she had been " vilified " .
" i would rather someone come up and chop off all my limbs than go through what i went through , " she said .
she added : " it 's a fact because if your limbs are chopped off you ... get another limb and there 's light at the end of the tunnel .
i would never go through this again heather mills " when you 're vilified for doing nothing but falling in love with an icon ...
i 'd rather have all of my limbs cut off that 's the god 's honest truth . "
' unconditional love ' asked if she would ever marry again , lady mccartney replied : " never .
i 'm not saying that i would n't fall madly in love or have a soul mate or anything like that , but i would never go through this again .
" it 's too devastating .
i mean most people know divorce is devastating anyway , but to go through it so publicly even when you have n't said a word or done anything . "
she insisted in the interview , which is being broadcast over several nights , that she had only been motivated by " unconditional love " in marrying the ex-beatle .
and she said she had not spoken about the split until now because she was concerned for the welfare of the couple 's three-year-old daughter beatrice .

a union plea for the deal to be delayed until it had been studied further was upheld by a paris court on tuesday .
the court also upheld a former ruling that the merger should be stopped until gdf 's european works council had expressed its views on the deal .
union members and france 's main opposition party say the merger will push energy prices up and cost jobs .
' shortest timeframe ' the two firms said they would continue to work on the deal , which requires the french government to reduce its share in gdf significantly , from some 70 % to about a third .
" the merger project between the gaz de france and suez remains the most pertinent for the future of our companies , " the companies said .
" we plan to implement it in the shortest possible timeframe whilst respecting all stakeholders ' interests . "
a merger , which recently gained conditional approval from the eu , would create a company with a market capitalisation of about 80bn euros -lrb- $ 102bn ; £ 54bn -rrb- .
french budget minister jean-francois cope told french television that the court 's decision would postpone the deal by " some weeks , or months but not more " .
since first being suggested , the merger plan has caused controversy .
some analysts viewed the merger move by france as a defensive way to prevent italy 's utility firm enel from acquiring suez .
while france 's main opposition party has fiercely opposed the merger , the government has argued that france needs a national energy firm to strengthen its position in negotiating deals internationally .
however , disagreement has also been evident between the two firms over the details of the deal , with suez wanting better terms .

a union plea for the deal to be delayed until it had been studied further was upheld by a paris court on tuesday .
the court also upheld a former ruling that the merger should be stopped until gdf 's european works council had expressed its views on the deal .
union members and france 's main opposition party say the merger will push energy prices up and cost jobs .
' shortest timeframe ' the two firms said they would continue to work on the deal , which requires the french government to reduce its share in gdf significantly , from some 70 % to about a third .
" the merger project between the gaz de france and suez remains the most pertinent for the future of our companies , " the companies said .
" we plan to implement it in the shortest possible timeframe whilst respecting all stakeholders ' interests . "
a merger , which recently gained conditional approval from the eu , would create a company with a market capitalisation of about 80bn euros -lrb- $ 102bn ; £ 54bn -rrb- .
french budget minister jean-francois cope told french television that the court 's decision would postpone the deal by " some weeks , or months but not more " .
since first being suggested , the merger plan has caused controversy .
some analysts viewed the merger move by france as a defensive way to prevent italy 's utility firm enel from acquiring suez .
while france 's main opposition party has fiercely opposed the merger , the government has argued that france needs a national energy firm to strengthen its position in negotiating deals internationally .
however , disagreement has also been evident between the two firms over the details of the deal , with suez wanting better terms .
