of that total , 1.8 billion will come from eumetsat , the organization that operates europe 's system of meteorological satellites .
most of the remainder will be provided by the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- . the esa says the metop satellites promise " data of unprecedented accuracy and resolution on a host of different variables , such as temperature and humidity , wind speed and direction over the ocean , ozone and trace gases . " that will make " a huge contribution to global weather forecasting and climate monitoring capabilities , " it said . being able to predict the weather reliably can help mitigate the effects of extreme weather conditions - which appear to be on the increase - and therefore save lives . complementary systems the large metop-a satellite - 17.6 meters -lrb- 58 feet -rrb- long once its power-producing solar panels are deployed - is designed to complement eumetsat 's meteosat satellites , which have been beaming weather data back to earth since 1978 . meteosats circle the earth above the equator at very high altitude - 36,000 kilometers -lrb- 22,000 miles -rrb- - and in geostationary orbit .

thanks to the tilting of the earth 's own orbit , they will cover a different slice of the planet every time . " the two systems are complementary because there are lots of measurements that ca n't be done in geostationary orbit , " explained marc cohen , metop program manager at eumetsat . the launch of metop will also mark the start of cooperation between europe and the us national oceanic and atmospheric administration -lrb- noaa -rrb- .
the european and us satellites will operate in complementary orbits to give maximum coverage , with the metop giving morning information and its us counterpart data collected in the afternoon . until the launch of metop , only the us was able to provide the kind of data that polar-orbiting satellites gather . extreme weather the prime use of the metop satellites , the first of which will travel into space aboard a russian soyuz rocket , lies in its instruments , five of which are new european instruments .
these will provide high-resolution images , temperature and humidity measurements , and monitor both ozone levels and ocean winds . the other instruments are provided by noaa and france 's centre national d 'etudes spatiales -lrb- cnes -rrb- . the most sophisticated of all is the infrared atmospheric sounding interferometer -lrb- iasi -rrb- , which esa says should offer meteorologists data " of unprecedented accuracy and resolution on atmospheric temperature and humidity , with which to improve weather prediction .

at first , not a lot of them agree with the operation and how hezbollah started with such an adventure , knowing what the reaction from the israelis would be .
at the end of the day , these people , the lebanese people , are paying the price of the war . however , every day that the bombing continues , people are more and more shocked and horrified by the magnitude of the reaction .
they are seeing their houses destroyed and their businesses closed and their people transferred from one region to another .
because of all the suffering they are witnessing , they can not accept to live with what is happening . what are the people most concerned about at the moment ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people are concerned violence may continue for months they are concerned that things could get worse .
that more people will be transferred from the south and that electricity plants could be the next target .
up to now the electricity plants have been avoided , which was not the case in 1996 .
but if the situation gets worse , i 'm afraid this could be the next target .
people are afraid the situation will continue for weeks or months .
lebanon does not have the capability to stand such a long war . how much of everyday life is still continuing ? it depends on the area .
in some areas that have been avoided , where there is not a massive presence of hezbollah , they are witnessing very timid activity .
however , all the bridges and main roads that connect one region to another have been systematically targeted by the bombing over the last few days .
regions are cut off from each other , which freezes the all economic activity .
what remains is a very local activity in the regions that are not the primary target of the bombing . do you have access to necessities like food and water ? it also depends on the region .
some regions , like in the southern part of beirut are completely devastated .
they are receiving aid and help from other regions .
here you can witness solidarity between lebanese across religions and communities to help each other , even though they do n't agree on the political level about what is happening .
despite the fact that they had , or still have , disagreements about the role and nature of the resistance .
among the population , you can see signs of solidarity among the people . do you have any access to information about what is happening around you ? we still have some access to the internet and some access through satellite to international broadcast networks , but this could stop if electricity goes away or more infrastructure is targeted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roads and bridges have been destroyed , making it difficult to flee there are reports of people trying to flee lebanon .
have you seen people trying to leave the area ? people are moving from one area to another .
lebanon is still under a blockade from the sea and the air .
at first some people could flee the country through syria , but now this is more and more difficult because the air bombings are targeting the main roads and main bridges .
what we are witnessing is a transfer of the population from one area to another , and this is done on purpose .
i think one of the aims of the operation is to push the population towards an area to create psychological and popular pressure on the hezbollah leadership to comply with the ceasefire conditions . what do you think is the motivation behind the bombing ? i think it started with the single objective of freeing the two soldiers who were captured , but now more and more we see there are signs to put in place a new equation that is more in favor of israelis ' security and for the security of their northern frontiers . it is true that it is a reaction to an operation that was led by hezbollah , but it seems clear that it was planned beforehand and that the objective is to come up with a new balance of power that is more favorable to the israelis and secures their borders . what do you think are the chances that violence could spread to syria ? it is my personal analysis , but i can not believe that israel today is capable of opening three fronts at the same time .
they have a war still going on in gaza , and they have been kind of forced to open another front in lebanon , and i hardly believe that they are willing to open a third front in syria . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fear violence could spread beyond lebanon and gaza what do you think are the chances of a ceasefire ? for the time being , zero . i believe that the peak of violence has not been reached yet .
this could take two or three more days . what do you think will happen when the peak of violence is reached ? there is a general feeling you can sense among international institutions that they are waiting for some radical changes on the ground .
such as israel succeeding in putting into place a buffer zone at the border . it will be drastic change either in the internal public opinion or in terms of international pressure to say , " listen guys , you have to do this . " what international organizations do you think need to increase pressure to bring about a ceasefire ? i think the pressure started with a call from the un and tony blair that they are ready to send an international force to the border between israel and lebanon .
i think pressure should also come from either the un or the united states of america with its traditional allies of france and germany . sean sinico interviewed sami nader send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu renews call for restraint in middle east european union foreign ministers are scrambling to find diplomatic solutions to halt the fighting between israel and hezbollah , as the escalating crisis risks setting the middle east aflame .

" the festival is getting bigger and bigger , " indian director and prolific film music composer naresh sharma told the afp news agency .
" people are really interested in indian film . " this year , the event drew 7,500 visitors , a thousand more than in 2005 , but below the 10,000 expected . the audience is a mixture of devotees who avidly follow the careers of their favorite stars such as actress aishwarya rai , and industry players who come to look at the latest offerings from the world 's second biggest cinema industry after hollywood . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : love plays the lead role in many bollywood productions bollywood 's two european camps " on the one hand you have those who know the names of all the indian actors , and on the other hand those who want to keep up do date with bollywood , " program director wiebke reiss said . the german festival program did its best to cater to both groups . in four days , some 100 films were shown , ranging from the next big features and a large number of documentaries to short horror films and a retrospective of the works of raj kapoor , an indian cinema idol of the 1950s . women came dressed in flowing silk saris and traditional jewelery as thousands of filmgoers sampled the spicy punjabi and gujurati cuisine on offer at a bazaar set up for the festival . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bollywood is becoming a regular feature on german television goal is to find new german viewers but weiss said the idea was also to convert those who believed that indian cinema had little more to offer than curry westerns or kitschy dramas , often up to three hours long , where love plays the lead role and characters regularly burst into song and dance . these films - big on sentiment but coy about sex - have found a following well beyond india , notably in the arab world where they pose far fewer problems for the censors than standard hollywood fare . german television channels have warmed up to the charm of indian cinema , with the cable channel rtl ii snapping up a number of titles .

at first , not a lot of them agree with the operation and how hezbollah started with such an adventure , knowing what the reaction from the israelis would be .
at the end of the day , these people , the lebanese people , are paying the price of the war . however , every day that the bombing continues , people are more and more shocked and horrified by the magnitude of the reaction .
they are seeing their houses destroyed and their businesses closed and their people transferred from one region to another .
because of all the suffering they are witnessing , they can not accept to live with what is happening . what are the people most concerned about at the moment ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people are concerned violence may continue for months they are concerned that things could get worse .
that more people will be transferred from the south and that electricity plants could be the next target .
up to now the electricity plants have been avoided , which was not the case in 1996 .
but if the situation gets worse , i 'm afraid this could be the next target .
people are afraid the situation will continue for weeks or months .
lebanon does not have the capability to stand such a long war . how much of everyday life is still continuing ? it depends on the area .
in some areas that have been avoided , where there is not a massive presence of hezbollah , they are witnessing very timid activity .
however , all the bridges and main roads that connect one region to another have been systematically targeted by the bombing over the last few days .
regions are cut off from each other , which freezes the all economic activity .
what remains is a very local activity in the regions that are not the primary target of the bombing . do you have access to necessities like food and water ? it also depends on the region .
some regions , like in the southern part of beirut are completely devastated .
they are receiving aid and help from other regions .
here you can witness solidarity between lebanese across religions and communities to help each other , even though they do n't agree on the political level about what is happening .
despite the fact that they had , or still have , disagreements about the role and nature of the resistance .
among the population , you can see signs of solidarity among the people . do you have any access to information about what is happening around you ? we still have some access to the internet and some access through satellite to international broadcast networks , but this could stop if electricity goes away or more infrastructure is targeted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roads and bridges have been destroyed , making it difficult to flee there are reports of people trying to flee lebanon .
have you seen people trying to leave the area ? people are moving from one area to another .
lebanon is still under a blockade from the sea and the air .
at first some people could flee the country through syria , but now this is more and more difficult because the air bombings are targeting the main roads and main bridges .
what we are witnessing is a transfer of the population from one area to another , and this is done on purpose .
i think one of the aims of the operation is to push the population towards an area to create psychological and popular pressure on the hezbollah leadership to comply with the ceasefire conditions . what do you think is the motivation behind the bombing ? i think it started with the single objective of freeing the two soldiers who were captured , but now more and more we see there are signs to put in place a new equation that is more in favor of israelis ' security and for the security of their northern frontiers . it is true that it is a reaction to an operation that was led by hezbollah , but it seems clear that it was planned beforehand and that the objective is to come up with a new balance of power that is more favorable to the israelis and secures their borders . what do you think are the chances that violence could spread to syria ? it is my personal analysis , but i can not believe that israel today is capable of opening three fronts at the same time .
they have a war still going on in gaza , and they have been kind of forced to open another front in lebanon , and i hardly believe that they are willing to open a third front in syria . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fear violence could spread beyond lebanon and gaza what do you think are the chances of a ceasefire ? for the time being , zero . i believe that the peak of violence has not been reached yet .
this could take two or three more days . what do you think will happen when the peak of violence is reached ? there is a general feeling you can sense among international institutions that they are waiting for some radical changes on the ground .
such as israel succeeding in putting into place a buffer zone at the border . it will be drastic change either in the internal public opinion or in terms of international pressure to say , " listen guys , you have to do this . " what international organizations do you think need to increase pressure to bring about a ceasefire ? i think the pressure started with a call from the un and tony blair that they are ready to send an international force to the border between israel and lebanon .
i think pressure should also come from either the un or the united states of america with its traditional allies of france and germany . sean sinico interviewed sami nader send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu renews call for restraint in middle east european union foreign ministers are scrambling to find diplomatic solutions to halt the fighting between israel and hezbollah , as the escalating crisis risks setting the middle east aflame .

of that total , 1.8 billion will come from eumetsat , the organization that operates europe 's system of meteorological satellites .
most of the remainder will be provided by the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- . the esa says the metop satellites promise " data of unprecedented accuracy and resolution on a host of different variables , such as temperature and humidity , wind speed and direction over the ocean , ozone and trace gases . " that will make " a huge contribution to global weather forecasting and climate monitoring capabilities , " it said . being able to predict the weather reliably can help mitigate the effects of extreme weather conditions - which appear to be on the increase - and therefore save lives . complementary systems the large metop-a satellite - 17.6 meters -lrb- 58 feet -rrb- long once its power-producing solar panels are deployed - is designed to complement eumetsat 's meteosat satellites , which have been beaming weather data back to earth since 1978 . meteosats circle the earth above the equator at very high altitude - 36,000 kilometers -lrb- 22,000 miles -rrb- - and in geostationary orbit .
they afford scientists a wide-angle view of the earth but are unable to see certain portions of the planet . bildunterschrift : a map measuring changes in water temperature in the pacific ocean during 1997 's hurricane " el nino " by contrast , the metops will orbit at just 800-850 kilometers -lrb- 500-525 miles -rrb- over the earth , overflying the north and south poles 14 times every 24 hours .
thanks to the tilting of the earth 's own orbit , they will cover a different slice of the planet every time . " the two systems are complementary because there are lots of measurements that ca n't be done in geostationary orbit , " explained marc cohen , metop program manager at eumetsat . the launch of metop will also mark the start of cooperation between europe and the us national oceanic and atmospheric administration -lrb- noaa -rrb- .
the european and us satellites will operate in complementary orbits to give maximum coverage , with the metop giving morning information and its us counterpart data collected in the afternoon . until the launch of metop , only the us was able to provide the kind of data that polar-orbiting satellites gather . extreme weather the prime use of the metop satellites , the first of which will travel into space aboard a russian soyuz rocket , lies in its instruments , five of which are new european instruments .
these will provide high-resolution images , temperature and humidity measurements , and monitor both ozone levels and ocean winds . the other instruments are provided by noaa and france 's centre national d 'etudes spatiales -lrb- cnes -rrb- . the most sophisticated of all is the infrared atmospheric sounding interferometer -lrb- iasi -rrb- , which esa says should offer meteorologists data " of unprecedented accuracy and resolution on atmospheric temperature and humidity , with which to improve weather prediction . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : extreme weather incidents are on the rise the launch of metop is particularly timely given the apparent increase in extreme weather conditions , from devastating droughts in africa and floods in europe to hurricane katrina and the asian tsunami .
on monday , a tsunami hit the coast of java after an earthquake in the pacific ocean . data from metop may also help settle some of the raging debates on climate change , at a time of warnings from conservationists that the arctic ice cap is melting so fast that polar bears may disappear from the wild this century . the launch of metop-a , scheduled for 18:28 central european time -lrb- 16:28 gmt -rrb- on july 17 , will be broadcasted live on eumetsat 's web site . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european space agency launches competition for us europe congratulated itself wednesday with the launch of the first test satellite of the galileo navigation system , designed to rival the us system and put global positioning into civilian hands .

" i am convinced that now is the time for us to make a political decision , whatever it might be , " brazilian president luis ignacio lula da silva said after a early monday meeting with us president george w. bush , where he urged a redoubling of efforts to break the trade impasse .
" we can not leave it in the hands of our negotiators only . " the elusive agreement , which has been under discussion for five years , has repeatedly stalled on issues such as how much the us will cut its farm subsidies , how far the european union will go in reducing its tariffs on farm imports and the readiness of developing countries to significantly reduce barriers to industrial and service products . on monday , trade representatives from the eu , the us , brazil , india , japan and australia are heading to world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- headquarters in geneva to continue talks .
eu trade commissioner peter mandelson was also ready to head to geneva on monday night . " we do not have the luxury of postponing this any longer , " mandelson said in brussels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pascal lamy has his work cut out for him over the next four weeks on sunday , g8 leaders agreed that they would ask wto leader pascal lamy to broker a compromise within the next four weeks . " we gave a mandate to our respective negotiators to come to an agreement on modalities within one month , " said eu commission president jose manuel barosso . if no breakthrough comes in the new few weeks , analysts say the entire round could be put on ice for several years .
the us president 's power to " fast track " trade deals without a vote in congress expires at the middle of next year . energy divisions on the issue of energy , g8 leaders were not able to come to agreement in several areas . one major point of contention in the area of energy security has been russia 's refusal to ratify the energy charter treaty , which governs energy investment and transit issues in europe , russia and other countries .
while russia agreed in principle to open and transparent energy markets , it did not agree to ratify the charter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : going electric : presidents putin and bush , condoleezza rice and russian defense minister ivanov are n't burning fossil fuels here europeans have pressed hard at previous g8 meetings for russia to ratify the treaty , but the energy security statement on sunday was limited to a vague affirmation of the document 's free-market principles . divisions over the use of nuclear energy , an increasingly important issue as the west seeks alternatives to oil and gas , and the kyoto protocol , which the us has refused to sign , were also clearly reflected in the g8 energy security statement sunday . " we recognize that g8 members pursue different ways to achieve energy security and the goals of climate protection , " the statement 's section on nuclear power begins , basically agreeing to disagree . democracy discussion leaders at the summit met on sunday night for a dinner during which they had " a frank discussion " with russian president vladimir putin over his country 's democratic development , according to a diplomat there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters on sunday in st. petersburg , defying a ban on unapproved protests critics of putin in russia and in the west often say his six years in power have been marked by a clampdown on the mass media , decreasing toleration for dissent and a centralization of power in the kremlin .
some have gone so far as to say that russia is not ready for a full place at the g8 table . the diplomat told reuters that at the dinner , putin gave an account of developments inside russia .
in such situations , putin has in the past said that democracy is developing in russia according to the country 's own culture , history and traditions . putin did take the opportunity to assure colleagues he would not change the russian constitution to seek a third term in office as some had feared . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g8 demands end to israeli assaults , militant attacks g8 leaders have called for " an end to israeli military operations " in the middle east and a halt to the shelling by militants of israeli territory after struggling to come up with a unified response to the crisis .

an eads spokesman said that the plane 's industrial launch , or the start of a350 production , could be expected in the " next months . "
meanwhile , the cost of developing the mid-sized jet could more than double to about $ 10.0 billion -lrb- 7.9 billion euros -rrb- , thomas enders , co-chief executive of airbus ' parent company eads -lrb- european aeronautics defence and space company -rrb- , said sunday , confirming recent media reports .
the original cost had been put at an estimated $ 4 billion .
enders was speaking during a weekend seminar held by eads in bath , southwest england , ahead of the week-long farnborough airshow .
german boss admits errors go back years earlier , in an interview with a german newspaper enders also admitted that errors in the construction of the airbus a380 super jumbo passenger jet go back several years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enders said there were problems with the a380 production in hamburg " we made errors in the construction of the a380 , we need more time -lrb- for work -rrb- on the electrical system , " enders told the daily bild on saturday .
" the errors were made several years ago . "
the german co-chief of eads , the parent company of toulouse-based airbus , said the problem with the a380 was mainly at the hamburg factory where the passenger cabin 's electrical system is installed .
but he added that the hamburg facility " is only one part of the production chain " and that he did not want to blame any particular person .
the shock announcement last month of delivery delays for the 555-seat a380 sparked a leadership crisis at eads , which resulted in the departure of enders ' former co-chairman noel forgeard , who has been replaced by frenchman louis gallois .
enders said in 2007 airbus would deliver nine a380s , the world 's largest commercial airliner , but he could not promise that there would not be new delays in delivery " even with the best will in the world . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the a380 , the world 's largest commercial airliner , at an air show in berlin " we have a problem finding enough qualified personnel , and we have more than 2,000 planes on order for the next few years , " he said .
building trust gallois acknowledged that eads needed to rebuild trust after its recent management crisis caused by delays to the airbus a380 super jumbo .
" disclosure and trust is clear , it is our mandate .
we have clearly to rebuild trust and confidence from our shareholders , " gallois said in farnborough .
gallois replaced frenchman noel forgeard .
the latter had been under intense pressure to quit since it was revealed he sold eads shares worth millions of euros nearly three months before the group had on june 13 announced delays to the a380 .
the wide-body a350 , which in its current design can carry between 250 and 300 passengers , is being overhauled to make it bigger and more fuel efficient .
some analysts believe it will re-emerge as the a370 and could see an enlarged fuselage .
us aircraft giant boeing is winning the race in the long-haul market with the 787 , which is being marketed to airlines as a fuel efficient , medium-sized jet .
meanwhile streiff , who is french , was named head of airbus earlier this month .
he replaced the german gustav humbert , who resigned after airbus announced it had run into manufacturing problems with its a380 super jumbo jet that would delay deliveries of the world 's largest passenger aircraft .
news of the delays saw 5.5 billion euros briefly wiped off the market value of eads , which owns 80 percent of airbus .
restoring eads ' image eads ' finances are set to take a further financial hit in the coming months owing to the increased spending on the a350 and penalties it must pay customers for delayed deliveries of the a380 , which is set to enter service in 2007 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eads is facing bad news on the financial front the company could be forced soon also to pay 2.75 billion euros for the 20 percent of airbus it does not own .
bae systems has served eads with a formal notice permitting the british group to exercise an option to sell eads its 20-percent stake in airbus .
enders told journalists in bath that the management crisis was over .
but he added : " undoubtedly the reputation of this company has suffered , so has the confidence of customers and investors .
the project that triggered this crisis , the a380 , needs to be fixed . "
following the a380 debacle , gallois told journalists that his first task was to help restore the reputation of eads " to the highest standard .

an eads spokesman said that the plane 's industrial launch , or the start of a350 production , could be expected in the " next months . "
meanwhile , the cost of developing the mid-sized jet could more than double to about $ 10.0 billion -lrb- 7.9 billion euros -rrb- , thomas enders , co-chief executive of airbus ' parent company eads -lrb- european aeronautics defence and space company -rrb- , said sunday , confirming recent media reports .
the original cost had been put at an estimated $ 4 billion .
enders was speaking during a weekend seminar held by eads in bath , southwest england , ahead of the week-long farnborough airshow .

" the festival is getting bigger and bigger , " indian director and prolific film music composer naresh sharma told the afp news agency .
" people are really interested in indian film . " this year , the event drew 7,500 visitors , a thousand more than in 2005 , but below the 10,000 expected . the audience is a mixture of devotees who avidly follow the careers of their favorite stars such as actress aishwarya rai , and industry players who come to look at the latest offerings from the world 's second biggest cinema industry after hollywood . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : love plays the lead role in many bollywood productions bollywood 's two european camps " on the one hand you have those who know the names of all the indian actors , and on the other hand those who want to keep up do date with bollywood , " program director wiebke reiss said . the german festival program did its best to cater to both groups . in four days , some 100 films were shown , ranging from the next big features and a large number of documentaries to short horror films and a retrospective of the works of raj kapoor , an indian cinema idol of the 1950s . women came dressed in flowing silk saris and traditional jewelery as thousands of filmgoers sampled the spicy punjabi and gujurati cuisine on offer at a bazaar set up for the festival . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bollywood is becoming a regular feature on german television goal is to find new german viewers but weiss said the idea was also to convert those who believed that indian cinema had little more to offer than curry westerns or kitschy dramas , often up to three hours long , where love plays the lead role and characters regularly burst into song and dance . these films - big on sentiment but coy about sex - have found a following well beyond india , notably in the arab world where they pose far fewer problems for the censors than standard hollywood fare . german television channels have warmed up to the charm of indian cinema , with the cable channel rtl ii snapping up a number of titles .
but the country 's cinemas are another story .

" we still need to make european distributors aware of indian films and convince them that these works can win the hearts of the public here . " she singled out " mixed doubles " by director rajat kapoor as a film with a universal theme that could do well in germany .
it deals with the difficulty of keeping the passion alive after 10 years of marriage . the organizers plan to keep expanding the festival .

" the festival is getting bigger and bigger , " indian director and prolific film music composer naresh sharma told the afp news agency .
" people are really interested in indian film . " this year , the event drew 7,500 visitors , a thousand more than in 2005 , but below the 10,000 expected . the audience is a mixture of devotees who avidly follow the careers of their favorite stars such as actress aishwarya rai , and industry players who come to look at the latest offerings from the world 's second biggest cinema industry after hollywood . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : love plays the lead role in many bollywood productions bollywood 's two european camps " on the one hand you have those who know the names of all the indian actors , and on the other hand those who want to keep up do date with bollywood , " program director wiebke reiss said . the german festival program did its best to cater to both groups . in four days , some 100 films were shown , ranging from the next big features and a large number of documentaries to short horror films and a retrospective of the works of raj kapoor , an indian cinema idol of the 1950s . women came dressed in flowing silk saris and traditional jewelery as thousands of filmgoers sampled the spicy punjabi and gujurati cuisine on offer at a bazaar set up for the festival . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bollywood is becoming a regular feature on german television goal is to find new german viewers but weiss said the idea was also to convert those who believed that indian cinema had little more to offer than curry westerns or kitschy dramas , often up to three hours long , where love plays the lead role and characters regularly burst into song and dance . these films - big on sentiment but coy about sex - have found a following well beyond india , notably in the arab world where they pose far fewer problems for the censors than standard hollywood fare . german television channels have warmed up to the charm of indian cinema , with the cable channel rtl ii snapping up a number of titles .
but the country 's cinemas are another story .
at the moment there are about 15 features showing and 30 for rent at video stores . language makes finding new audiences difficult bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some universal themes could do well in germany " in order to sell indian works in germany , the films have to be dubbed , and this is very expensive , " reiss said .
" we still need to make european distributors aware of indian films and convince them that these works can win the hearts of the public here . " she singled out " mixed doubles " by director rajat kapoor as a film with a universal theme that could do well in germany .
it deals with the difficulty of keeping the passion alive after 10 years of marriage . the organizers plan to keep expanding the festival .

an eads spokesman said that the plane 's industrial launch , or the start of a350 production , could be expected in the " next months . "
meanwhile , the cost of developing the mid-sized jet could more than double to about $ 10.0 billion -lrb- 7.9 billion euros -rrb- , thomas enders , co-chief executive of airbus ' parent company eads -lrb- european aeronautics defence and space company -rrb- , said sunday , confirming recent media reports .
the original cost had been put at an estimated $ 4 billion .
enders was speaking during a weekend seminar held by eads in bath , southwest england , ahead of the week-long farnborough airshow .
german boss admits errors go back years earlier , in an interview with a german newspaper enders also admitted that errors in the construction of the airbus a380 super jumbo passenger jet go back several years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enders said there were problems with the a380 production in hamburg " we made errors in the construction of the a380 , we need more time -lrb- for work -rrb- on the electrical system , " enders told the daily bild on saturday .
" the errors were made several years ago . "
the german co-chief of eads , the parent company of toulouse-based airbus , said the problem with the a380 was mainly at the hamburg factory where the passenger cabin 's electrical system is installed .
but he added that the hamburg facility " is only one part of the production chain " and that he did not want to blame any particular person .
the shock announcement last month of delivery delays for the 555-seat a380 sparked a leadership crisis at eads , which resulted in the departure of enders ' former co-chairman noel forgeard , who has been replaced by frenchman louis gallois .
enders said in 2007 airbus would deliver nine a380s , the world 's largest commercial airliner , but he could not promise that there would not be new delays in delivery " even with the best will in the world . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the a380 , the world 's largest commercial airliner , at an air show in berlin " we have a problem finding enough qualified personnel , and we have more than 2,000 planes on order for the next few years , " he said .
building trust gallois acknowledged that eads needed to rebuild trust after its recent management crisis caused by delays to the airbus a380 super jumbo .
" disclosure and trust is clear , it is our mandate .
we have clearly to rebuild trust and confidence from our shareholders , " gallois said in farnborough .
gallois replaced frenchman noel forgeard .
the latter had been under intense pressure to quit since it was revealed he sold eads shares worth millions of euros nearly three months before the group had on june 13 announced delays to the a380 .
the wide-body a350 , which in its current design can carry between 250 and 300 passengers , is being overhauled to make it bigger and more fuel efficient .
some analysts believe it will re-emerge as the a370 and could see an enlarged fuselage .
us aircraft giant boeing is winning the race in the long-haul market with the 787 , which is being marketed to airlines as a fuel efficient , medium-sized jet .
meanwhile streiff , who is french , was named head of airbus earlier this month .
he replaced the german gustav humbert , who resigned after airbus announced it had run into manufacturing problems with its a380 super jumbo jet that would delay deliveries of the world 's largest passenger aircraft .
news of the delays saw 5.5 billion euros briefly wiped off the market value of eads , which owns 80 percent of airbus .
restoring eads ' image eads ' finances are set to take a further financial hit in the coming months owing to the increased spending on the a350 and penalties it must pay customers for delayed deliveries of the a380 , which is set to enter service in 2007 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eads is facing bad news on the financial front the company could be forced soon also to pay 2.75 billion euros for the 20 percent of airbus it does not own .
bae systems has served eads with a formal notice permitting the british group to exercise an option to sell eads its 20-percent stake in airbus .
enders told journalists in bath that the management crisis was over .
but he added : " undoubtedly the reputation of this company has suffered , so has the confidence of customers and investors .
the project that triggered this crisis , the a380 , needs to be fixed . "
following the a380 debacle , gallois told journalists that his first task was to help restore the reputation of eads " to the highest standard .

despite the fact that they had , or still have , disagreements about the role and nature of the resistance .
among the population , you can see signs of solidarity among the people . do you have any access to information about what is happening around you ? we still have some access to the internet and some access through satellite to international broadcast networks , but this could stop if electricity goes away or more infrastructure is targeted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roads and bridges have been destroyed , making it difficult to flee there are reports of people trying to flee lebanon .
have you seen people trying to leave the area ? people are moving from one area to another .
lebanon is still under a blockade from the sea and the air .
at first some people could flee the country through syria , but now this is more and more difficult because the air bombings are targeting the main roads and main bridges .
what we are witnessing is a transfer of the population from one area to another , and this is done on purpose .
i think one of the aims of the operation is to push the population towards an area to create psychological and popular pressure on the hezbollah leadership to comply with the ceasefire conditions . what do you think is the motivation behind the bombing ? i think it started with the single objective of freeing the two soldiers who were captured , but now more and more we see there are signs to put in place a new equation that is more in favor of israelis ' security and for the security of their northern frontiers . it is true that it is a reaction to an operation that was led by hezbollah , but it seems clear that it was planned beforehand and that the objective is to come up with a new balance of power that is more favorable to the israelis and secures their borders . what do you think are the chances that violence could spread to syria ? it is my personal analysis , but i can not believe that israel today is capable of opening three fronts at the same time .
they have a war still going on in gaza , and they have been kind of forced to open another front in lebanon , and i hardly believe that they are willing to open a third front in syria . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fear violence could spread beyond lebanon and gaza what do you think are the chances of a ceasefire ? for the time being , zero . i believe that the peak of violence has not been reached yet .
this could take two or three more days . what do you think will happen when the peak of violence is reached ? there is a general feeling you can sense among international institutions that they are waiting for some radical changes on the ground .
such as israel succeeding in putting into place a buffer zone at the border . it will be drastic change either in the internal public opinion or in terms of international pressure to say , " listen guys , you have to do this . " what international organizations do you think need to increase pressure to bring about a ceasefire ? i think the pressure started with a call from the un and tony blair that they are ready to send an international force to the border between israel and lebanon .
i think pressure should also come from either the un or the united states of america with its traditional allies of france and germany . sean sinico interviewed sami nader send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu renews call for restraint in middle east european union foreign ministers are scrambling to find diplomatic solutions to halt the fighting between israel and hezbollah , as the escalating crisis risks setting the middle east aflame .

the death toll has climbed to over 160 , with civilians bearing the brunt of the conflict . " the un needs time and space to make sure we have the troops - well-trained , well-equipped troops - to go in quite quickly , " annan said .
" the sooner decisions are taken by the -lrb- un -rrb- security council , the better it is . " annan said a team of un officials in the crisis region would report to the security council by the end of the week .
he urged countries not to delay sending troops for the planned middle east peace operation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annan with german chancellor merkel and eu commission president barroso at the g8 summit annan , however , gave no indication of the number of troops required , nor any deadlines for the deployment . merkel , chirac welcome idea annan 's proposal has been largely welcomed by g8 leaders . german chancellor angela merkel said the g8 was determined to strengthen lebanon 's central government as part of efforts to end hezbollah rocket attacks on israel . " i think it make sense to have such a force based there , " merkel said , adding that she envisaged expanding the current un operation in southern lebanon . some 1,991 un soldiers have been based in lebanon since 1978 .
called unifil , the force has patrolled the hilly roads bordering on israel in its white vehicles but proved powerless to rein in guerrillas or stem israeli retaliation . the force proved ineffective when israel invaded lebanon in 1982 to flush out palestinian fighters who had attacked its northern border settlements .
unifil 's mandate was to verify an israeli withdrawal , restore international peace and security , and assist the government of lebanon " in ensuring the return of its effective authority in the area . " french president jacques chirac also backed the idea of a new force in lebanon and called for setting up a surveillance border along the israeli-lebanese border . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a flattened apartment building in beirut " we can not allow things to go on as they are .
we have to have a means of repression and surveillance , " chirac said . he added that the force 's mandate should include disarming hezbollah militias who have been launching rocket attacks on israel . blair : force should have more bite finland , which currently heads the european union presidency , also said the eu and its member states would be ready to participate in a un peacekeeping force for lebanon .
but it stressed that such a force is only an idea for the moment . british prime minister tony blair also appeared to back the idea of an international force .
blair said monday that the proposed force must have more bite and " far greater " numbers than the current un observer mission already there . " the mission will have to be far more specific and clearer , and the force employed will have to be far greater , " blair told reporters , adding however that it would " take time " for it to deploy . european external affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner called the notion of a temporary buffer force an " interesting proposal . " us , israel not convinced however , many doubt whether sending a new force to the region could halt the current violence . the united states was cautious , saying it wanted to hear the recommendations of a un fact-finding mission and israel dismissed talk of a multilateral security presence as premature . meanwhile , intense diplomacy aimed at ending the bloodshed is under way with france 's prime minister dominique de villepin flying to beirut shortly after a visit by the european union 's chief diplomat , javier solana , to the lebanese capital . the un security council also picked up talks from saturday when it failed to reach agreement on a call for a ceasefire between israel and hezbollah . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu renews call for restraint in middle east european union foreign ministers are scrambling to find diplomatic solutions to halt the fighting between israel and hezbollah , as the escalating crisis risks setting the middle east aflame .

" i am convinced that now is the time for us to make a political decision , whatever it might be , " brazilian president luis ignacio lula da silva said after a early monday meeting with us president george w. bush , where he urged a redoubling of efforts to break the trade impasse .
" we can not leave it in the hands of our negotiators only . " the elusive agreement , which has been under discussion for five years , has repeatedly stalled on issues such as how much the us will cut its farm subsidies , how far the european union will go in reducing its tariffs on farm imports and the readiness of developing countries to significantly reduce barriers to industrial and service products . on monday , trade representatives from the eu , the us , brazil , india , japan and australia are heading to world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- headquarters in geneva to continue talks .

the us president 's power to " fast track " trade deals without a vote in congress expires at the middle of next year . energy divisions on the issue of energy , g8 leaders were not able to come to agreement in several areas . one major point of contention in the area of energy security has been russia 's refusal to ratify the energy charter treaty , which governs energy investment and transit issues in europe , russia and other countries .

" we recognize that g8 members pursue different ways to achieve energy security and the goals of climate protection , " the statement 's section on nuclear power begins , basically agreeing to disagree . democracy discussion leaders at the summit met on sunday night for a dinner during which they had " a frank discussion " with russian president vladimir putin over his country 's democratic development , according to a diplomat there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters on sunday in st. petersburg , defying a ban on unapproved protests critics of putin in russia and in the west often say his six years in power have been marked by a clampdown on the mass media , decreasing toleration for dissent and a centralization of power in the kremlin .
some have gone so far as to say that russia is not ready for a full place at the g8 table . the diplomat told reuters that at the dinner , putin gave an account of developments inside russia .
in such situations , putin has in the past said that democracy is developing in russia according to the country 's own culture , history and traditions . putin did take the opportunity to assure colleagues he would not change the russian constitution to seek a third term in office as some had feared . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g8 demands end to israeli assaults , militant attacks g8 leaders have called for " an end to israeli military operations " in the middle east and a halt to the shelling by militants of israeli territory after struggling to come up with a unified response to the crisis .

of that total , 1.8 billion will come from eumetsat , the organization that operates europe 's system of meteorological satellites .
most of the remainder will be provided by the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- . the esa says the metop satellites promise " data of unprecedented accuracy and resolution on a host of different variables , such as temperature and humidity , wind speed and direction over the ocean , ozone and trace gases . " that will make " a huge contribution to global weather forecasting and climate monitoring capabilities , " it said . being able to predict the weather reliably can help mitigate the effects of extreme weather conditions - which appear to be on the increase - and therefore save lives . complementary systems the large metop-a satellite - 17.6 meters -lrb- 58 feet -rrb- long once its power-producing solar panels are deployed - is designed to complement eumetsat 's meteosat satellites , which have been beaming weather data back to earth since 1978 . meteosats circle the earth above the equator at very high altitude - 36,000 kilometers -lrb- 22,000 miles -rrb- - and in geostationary orbit .
they afford scientists a wide-angle view of the earth but are unable to see certain portions of the planet . bildunterschrift : a map measuring changes in water temperature in the pacific ocean during 1997 's hurricane " el nino " by contrast , the metops will orbit at just 800-850 kilometers -lrb- 500-525 miles -rrb- over the earth , overflying the north and south poles 14 times every 24 hours .
thanks to the tilting of the earth 's own orbit , they will cover a different slice of the planet every time . " the two systems are complementary because there are lots of measurements that ca n't be done in geostationary orbit , " explained marc cohen , metop program manager at eumetsat . the launch of metop will also mark the start of cooperation between europe and the us national oceanic and atmospheric administration -lrb- noaa -rrb- .
the european and us satellites will operate in complementary orbits to give maximum coverage , with the metop giving morning information and its us counterpart data collected in the afternoon . until the launch of metop , only the us was able to provide the kind of data that polar-orbiting satellites gather . extreme weather the prime use of the metop satellites , the first of which will travel into space aboard a russian soyuz rocket , lies in its instruments , five of which are new european instruments .
these will provide high-resolution images , temperature and humidity measurements , and monitor both ozone levels and ocean winds . the other instruments are provided by noaa and france 's centre national d 'etudes spatiales -lrb- cnes -rrb- . the most sophisticated of all is the infrared atmospheric sounding interferometer -lrb- iasi -rrb- , which esa says should offer meteorologists data " of unprecedented accuracy and resolution on atmospheric temperature and humidity , with which to improve weather prediction . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : extreme weather incidents are on the rise the launch of metop is particularly timely given the apparent increase in extreme weather conditions , from devastating droughts in africa and floods in europe to hurricane katrina and the asian tsunami .
on monday , a tsunami hit the coast of java after an earthquake in the pacific ocean . data from metop may also help settle some of the raging debates on climate change , at a time of warnings from conservationists that the arctic ice cap is melting so fast that polar bears may disappear from the wild this century . the launch of metop-a , scheduled for 18:28 central european time -lrb- 16:28 gmt -rrb- on july 17 , will be broadcasted live on eumetsat 's web site . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european space agency launches competition for us europe congratulated itself wednesday with the launch of the first test satellite of the galileo navigation system , designed to rival the us system and put global positioning into civilian hands .

" the two systems are complementary because there are lots of measurements that ca n't be done in geostationary orbit , " explained marc cohen , metop program manager at eumetsat . the launch of metop will also mark the start of cooperation between europe and the us national oceanic and atmospheric administration -lrb- noaa -rrb- .
the european and us satellites will operate in complementary orbits to give maximum coverage , with the metop giving morning information and its us counterpart data collected in the afternoon . until the launch of metop , only the us was able to provide the kind of data that polar-orbiting satellites gather . extreme weather the prime use of the metop satellites , the first of which will travel into space aboard a russian soyuz rocket , lies in its instruments , five of which are new european instruments .
these will provide high-resolution images , temperature and humidity measurements , and monitor both ozone levels and ocean winds . the other instruments are provided by noaa and france 's centre national d 'etudes spatiales -lrb- cnes -rrb- . the most sophisticated of all is the infrared atmospheric sounding interferometer -lrb- iasi -rrb- , which esa says should offer meteorologists data " of unprecedented accuracy and resolution on atmospheric temperature and humidity , with which to improve weather prediction .

the death toll has climbed to over 160 , with civilians bearing the brunt of the conflict . " the un needs time and space to make sure we have the troops - well-trained , well-equipped troops - to go in quite quickly , " annan said .
" the sooner decisions are taken by the -lrb- un -rrb- security council , the better it is . " annan said a team of un officials in the crisis region would report to the security council by the end of the week .
he urged countries not to delay sending troops for the planned middle east peace operation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annan with german chancellor merkel and eu commission president barroso at the g8 summit annan , however , gave no indication of the number of troops required , nor any deadlines for the deployment . merkel , chirac welcome idea annan 's proposal has been largely welcomed by g8 leaders . german chancellor angela merkel said the g8 was determined to strengthen lebanon 's central government as part of efforts to end hezbollah rocket attacks on israel . " i think it make sense to have such a force based there , " merkel said , adding that she envisaged expanding the current un operation in southern lebanon . some 1,991 un soldiers have been based in lebanon since 1978 .
called unifil , the force has patrolled the hilly roads bordering on israel in its white vehicles but proved powerless to rein in guerrillas or stem israeli retaliation . the force proved ineffective when israel invaded lebanon in 1982 to flush out palestinian fighters who had attacked its northern border settlements .
unifil 's mandate was to verify an israeli withdrawal , restore international peace and security , and assist the government of lebanon " in ensuring the return of its effective authority in the area . " french president jacques chirac also backed the idea of a new force in lebanon and called for setting up a surveillance border along the israeli-lebanese border . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a flattened apartment building in beirut " we can not allow things to go on as they are .
we have to have a means of repression and surveillance , " chirac said . he added that the force 's mandate should include disarming hezbollah militias who have been launching rocket attacks on israel . blair : force should have more bite finland , which currently heads the european union presidency , also said the eu and its member states would be ready to participate in a un peacekeeping force for lebanon .
but it stressed that such a force is only an idea for the moment . british prime minister tony blair also appeared to back the idea of an international force .
blair said monday that the proposed force must have more bite and " far greater " numbers than the current un observer mission already there . " the mission will have to be far more specific and clearer , and the force employed will have to be far greater , " blair told reporters , adding however that it would " take time " for it to deploy . european external affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner called the notion of a temporary buffer force an " interesting proposal . " us , israel not convinced however , many doubt whether sending a new force to the region could halt the current violence . the united states was cautious , saying it wanted to hear the recommendations of a un fact-finding mission and israel dismissed talk of a multilateral security presence as premature . meanwhile , intense diplomacy aimed at ending the bloodshed is under way with france 's prime minister dominique de villepin flying to beirut shortly after a visit by the european union 's chief diplomat , javier solana , to the lebanese capital . the un security council also picked up talks from saturday when it failed to reach agreement on a call for a ceasefire between israel and hezbollah . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu renews call for restraint in middle east european union foreign ministers are scrambling to find diplomatic solutions to halt the fighting between israel and hezbollah , as the escalating crisis risks setting the middle east aflame .

" i am convinced that now is the time for us to make a political decision , whatever it might be , " brazilian president luis ignacio lula da silva said after a early monday meeting with us president george w. bush , where he urged a redoubling of efforts to break the trade impasse .
" we can not leave it in the hands of our negotiators only . " the elusive agreement , which has been under discussion for five years , has repeatedly stalled on issues such as how much the us will cut its farm subsidies , how far the european union will go in reducing its tariffs on farm imports and the readiness of developing countries to significantly reduce barriers to industrial and service products . on monday , trade representatives from the eu , the us , brazil , india , japan and australia are heading to world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- headquarters in geneva to continue talks .
eu trade commissioner peter mandelson was also ready to head to geneva on monday night .

the us president 's power to " fast track " trade deals without a vote in congress expires at the middle of next year . energy divisions on the issue of energy , g8 leaders were not able to come to agreement in several areas . one major point of contention in the area of energy security has been russia 's refusal to ratify the energy charter treaty , which governs energy investment and transit issues in europe , russia and other countries .
while russia agreed in principle to open and transparent energy markets , it did not agree to ratify the charter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : going electric : presidents putin and bush , condoleezza rice and russian defense minister ivanov are n't burning fossil fuels here europeans have pressed hard at previous g8 meetings for russia to ratify the treaty , but the energy security statement on sunday was limited to a vague affirmation of the document 's free-market principles . divisions over the use of nuclear energy , an increasingly important issue as the west seeks alternatives to oil and gas , and the kyoto protocol , which the us has refused to sign , were also clearly reflected in the g8 energy security statement sunday . " we recognize that g8 members pursue different ways to achieve energy security and the goals of climate protection , " the statement 's section on nuclear power begins , basically agreeing to disagree . democracy discussion leaders at the summit met on sunday night for a dinner during which they had " a frank discussion " with russian president vladimir putin over his country 's democratic development , according to a diplomat there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters on sunday in st. petersburg , defying a ban on unapproved protests critics of putin in russia and in the west often say his six years in power have been marked by a clampdown on the mass media , decreasing toleration for dissent and a centralization of power in the kremlin .
some have gone so far as to say that russia is not ready for a full place at the g8 table . the diplomat told reuters that at the dinner , putin gave an account of developments inside russia .
in such situations , putin has in the past said that democracy is developing in russia according to the country 's own culture , history and traditions . putin did take the opportunity to assure colleagues he would not change the russian constitution to seek a third term in office as some had feared . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g8 demands end to israeli assaults , militant attacks g8 leaders have called for " an end to israeli military operations " in the middle east and a halt to the shelling by militants of israeli territory after struggling to come up with a unified response to the crisis .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.07.2006 " the lebanese people are paying the price of the war " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the violence has claimed many lives sami nader , an international relations teacher at st. joseph university in beirut , spoke with dw-world.de about the situation on the ground in lebanon and the motivation behind the continuing violence in the middle east . sami nader spoke with dw-world.de via telephone from his home about 20 kilometers -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- from the center of the bombing in southern beirut . dw-world.de : what are people around you saying about the bombing that is taking place ? sami nader : the people are really horrified by what 's taking place .
at first , not a lot of them agree with the operation and how hezbollah started with such an adventure , knowing what the reaction from the israelis would be .
at the end of the day , these people , the lebanese people , are paying the price of the war . however , every day that the bombing continues , people are more and more shocked and horrified by the magnitude of the reaction .
they are seeing their houses destroyed and their businesses closed and their people transferred from one region to another .
because of all the suffering they are witnessing , they can not accept to live with what is happening . what are the people most concerned about at the moment ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people are concerned violence may continue for months they are concerned that things could get worse .
that more people will be transferred from the south and that electricity plants could be the next target .
up to now the electricity plants have been avoided , which was not the case in 1996 .
but if the situation gets worse , i 'm afraid this could be the next target .
people are afraid the situation will continue for weeks or months .
lebanon does not have the capability to stand such a long war . how much of everyday life is still continuing ? it depends on the area .
in some areas that have been avoided , where there is not a massive presence of hezbollah , they are witnessing very timid activity .
however , all the bridges and main roads that connect one region to another have been systematically targeted by the bombing over the last few days .
regions are cut off from each other , which freezes the all economic activity .
what remains is a very local activity in the regions that are not the primary target of the bombing . do you have access to necessities like food and water ? it also depends on the region .
some regions , like in the southern part of beirut are completely devastated .
they are receiving aid and help from other regions .
here you can witness solidarity between lebanese across religions and communities to help each other , even though they do n't agree on the political level about what is happening .
despite the fact that they had , or still have , disagreements about the role and nature of the resistance .
among the population , you can see signs of solidarity among the people . do you have any access to information about what is happening around you ? we still have some access to the internet and some access through satellite to international broadcast networks , but this could stop if electricity goes away or more infrastructure is targeted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roads and bridges have been destroyed , making it difficult to flee there are reports of people trying to flee lebanon .
have you seen people trying to leave the area ? people are moving from one area to another .
lebanon is still under a blockade from the sea and the air .
at first some people could flee the country through syria , but now this is more and more difficult because the air bombings are targeting the main roads and main bridges .
what we are witnessing is a transfer of the population from one area to another , and this is done on purpose .
i think one of the aims of the operation is to push the population towards an area to create psychological and popular pressure on the hezbollah leadership to comply with the ceasefire conditions . what do you think is the motivation behind the bombing ? i think it started with the single objective of freeing the two soldiers who were captured , but now more and more we see there are signs to put in place a new equation that is more in favor of israelis ' security and for the security of their northern frontiers . it is true that it is a reaction to an operation that was led by hezbollah , but it seems clear that it was planned beforehand and that the objective is to come up with a new balance of power that is more favorable to the israelis and secures their borders . what do you think are the chances that violence could spread to syria ? it is my personal analysis , but i can not believe that israel today is capable of opening three fronts at the same time .
they have a war still going on in gaza , and they have been kind of forced to open another front in lebanon , and i hardly believe that they are willing to open a third front in syria . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fear violence could spread beyond lebanon and gaza what do you think are the chances of a ceasefire ? for the time being , zero . i believe that the peak of violence has not been reached yet .
this could take two or three more days . what do you think will happen when the peak of violence is reached ? there is a general feeling you can sense among international institutions that they are waiting for some radical changes on the ground .
such as israel succeeding in putting into place a buffer zone at the border . it will be drastic change either in the internal public opinion or in terms of international pressure to say , " listen guys , you have to do this . " what international organizations do you think need to increase pressure to bring about a ceasefire ? i think the pressure started with a call from the un and tony blair that they are ready to send an international force to the border between israel and lebanon .
i think pressure should also come from either the un or the united states of america with its traditional allies of france and germany . sean sinico interviewed sami nader send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu renews call for restraint in middle east european union foreign ministers are scrambling to find diplomatic solutions to halt the fighting between israel and hezbollah , as the escalating crisis risks setting the middle east aflame .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus on business european commission proposes air fare transparency rules high priced raw materials make recycled rubbish attractive major management shake-up at bmw german family firm fights off tourism giants business -pipe- 17.07.2006 airbus to unveil new a350 plane design großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus has had a turbulent time with the a350 admitting that the cost of developing its troubled a350 will more than double , european group airbus will on monday disclose new design plans for the plane at an air show near london . airbus will unveil new plans for the a350 , which it launched in 2005 as a direct rival to boeing 's 787 dreamliner but which has been poorly received by potential customers , at the farnborough near london on monday .
an eads spokesman said that the plane 's industrial launch , or the start of a350 production , could be expected in the " next months . "
meanwhile , the cost of developing the mid-sized jet could more than double to about $ 10.0 billion -lrb- 7.9 billion euros -rrb- , thomas enders , co-chief executive of airbus ' parent company eads -lrb- european aeronautics defence and space company -rrb- , said sunday , confirming recent media reports .
the original cost had been put at an estimated $ 4 billion .
enders was speaking during a weekend seminar held by eads in bath , southwest england , ahead of the week-long farnborough airshow .
german boss admits errors go back years earlier , in an interview with a german newspaper enders also admitted that errors in the construction of the airbus a380 super jumbo passenger jet go back several years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enders said there were problems with the a380 production in hamburg " we made errors in the construction of the a380 , we need more time -lrb- for work -rrb- on the electrical system , " enders told the daily bild on saturday .
" the errors were made several years ago . "
the german co-chief of eads , the parent company of toulouse-based airbus , said the problem with the a380 was mainly at the hamburg factory where the passenger cabin 's electrical system is installed .
but he added that the hamburg facility " is only one part of the production chain " and that he did not want to blame any particular person .
the shock announcement last month of delivery delays for the 555-seat a380 sparked a leadership crisis at eads , which resulted in the departure of enders ' former co-chairman noel forgeard , who has been replaced by frenchman louis gallois .
enders said in 2007 airbus would deliver nine a380s , the world 's largest commercial airliner , but he could not promise that there would not be new delays in delivery " even with the best will in the world . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the a380 , the world 's largest commercial airliner , at an air show in berlin " we have a problem finding enough qualified personnel , and we have more than 2,000 planes on order for the next few years , " he said .
building trust gallois acknowledged that eads needed to rebuild trust after its recent management crisis caused by delays to the airbus a380 super jumbo .
" disclosure and trust is clear , it is our mandate .
we have clearly to rebuild trust and confidence from our shareholders , " gallois said in farnborough .
gallois replaced frenchman noel forgeard .
the latter had been under intense pressure to quit since it was revealed he sold eads shares worth millions of euros nearly three months before the group had on june 13 announced delays to the a380 .
the wide-body a350 , which in its current design can carry between 250 and 300 passengers , is being overhauled to make it bigger and more fuel efficient .
some analysts believe it will re-emerge as the a370 and could see an enlarged fuselage .
us aircraft giant boeing is winning the race in the long-haul market with the 787 , which is being marketed to airlines as a fuel efficient , medium-sized jet .
meanwhile streiff , who is french , was named head of airbus earlier this month .
he replaced the german gustav humbert , who resigned after airbus announced it had run into manufacturing problems with its a380 super jumbo jet that would delay deliveries of the world 's largest passenger aircraft .
news of the delays saw 5.5 billion euros briefly wiped off the market value of eads , which owns 80 percent of airbus .
restoring eads ' image eads ' finances are set to take a further financial hit in the coming months owing to the increased spending on the a350 and penalties it must pay customers for delayed deliveries of the a380 , which is set to enter service in 2007 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eads is facing bad news on the financial front the company could be forced soon also to pay 2.75 billion euros for the 20 percent of airbus it does not own .
bae systems has served eads with a formal notice permitting the british group to exercise an option to sell eads its 20-percent stake in airbus .
enders told journalists in bath that the management crisis was over .
but he added : " undoubtedly the reputation of this company has suffered , so has the confidence of customers and investors .
the project that triggered this crisis , the a380 , needs to be fixed . "
following the a380 debacle , gallois told journalists that his first task was to help restore the reputation of eads " to the highest standard .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus on business european commission proposes air fare transparency rules high priced raw materials make recycled rubbish attractive major management shake-up at bmw german family firm fights off tourism giants business -pipe- 17.07.2006 airbus to unveil new a350 plane design großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus has had a turbulent time with the a350 admitting that the cost of developing its troubled a350 will more than double , european group airbus will on monday disclose new design plans for the plane at an air show near london . airbus will unveil new plans for the a350 , which it launched in 2005 as a direct rival to boeing 's 787 dreamliner but which has been poorly received by potential customers , at the farnborough near london on monday .
an eads spokesman said that the plane 's industrial launch , or the start of a350 production , could be expected in the " next months . "
meanwhile , the cost of developing the mid-sized jet could more than double to about $ 10.0 billion -lrb- 7.9 billion euros -rrb- , thomas enders , co-chief executive of airbus ' parent company eads -lrb- european aeronautics defence and space company -rrb- , said sunday , confirming recent media reports .
the original cost had been put at an estimated $ 4 billion .
enders was speaking during a weekend seminar held by eads in bath , southwest england , ahead of the week-long farnborough airshow .
german boss admits errors go back years earlier , in an interview with a german newspaper enders also admitted that errors in the construction of the airbus a380 super jumbo passenger jet go back several years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enders said there were problems with the a380 production in hamburg " we made errors in the construction of the a380 , we need more time -lrb- for work -rrb- on the electrical system , " enders told the daily bild on saturday .
" the errors were made several years ago . "
the german co-chief of eads , the parent company of toulouse-based airbus , said the problem with the a380 was mainly at the hamburg factory where the passenger cabin 's electrical system is installed .
but he added that the hamburg facility " is only one part of the production chain " and that he did not want to blame any particular person .
the shock announcement last month of delivery delays for the 555-seat a380 sparked a leadership crisis at eads , which resulted in the departure of enders ' former co-chairman noel forgeard , who has been replaced by frenchman louis gallois .
enders said in 2007 airbus would deliver nine a380s , the world 's largest commercial airliner , but he could not promise that there would not be new delays in delivery " even with the best will in the world . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the a380 , the world 's largest commercial airliner , at an air show in berlin " we have a problem finding enough qualified personnel , and we have more than 2,000 planes on order for the next few years , " he said .
building trust gallois acknowledged that eads needed to rebuild trust after its recent management crisis caused by delays to the airbus a380 super jumbo .
" disclosure and trust is clear , it is our mandate .
we have clearly to rebuild trust and confidence from our shareholders , " gallois said in farnborough .
gallois replaced frenchman noel forgeard .
the latter had been under intense pressure to quit since it was revealed he sold eads shares worth millions of euros nearly three months before the group had on june 13 announced delays to the a380 .
the wide-body a350 , which in its current design can carry between 250 and 300 passengers , is being overhauled to make it bigger and more fuel efficient .
some analysts believe it will re-emerge as the a370 and could see an enlarged fuselage .
us aircraft giant boeing is winning the race in the long-haul market with the 787 , which is being marketed to airlines as a fuel efficient , medium-sized jet .
meanwhile streiff , who is french , was named head of airbus earlier this month .
he replaced the german gustav humbert , who resigned after airbus announced it had run into manufacturing problems with its a380 super jumbo jet that would delay deliveries of the world 's largest passenger aircraft .
news of the delays saw 5.5 billion euros briefly wiped off the market value of eads , which owns 80 percent of airbus .
restoring eads ' image eads ' finances are set to take a further financial hit in the coming months owing to the increased spending on the a350 and penalties it must pay customers for delayed deliveries of the a380 , which is set to enter service in 2007 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eads is facing bad news on the financial front the company could be forced soon also to pay 2.75 billion euros for the 20 percent of airbus it does not own .
bae systems has served eads with a formal notice permitting the british group to exercise an option to sell eads its 20-percent stake in airbus .
enders told journalists in bath that the management crisis was over .
but he added : " undoubtedly the reputation of this company has suffered , so has the confidence of customers and investors .
the project that triggered this crisis , the a380 , needs to be fixed . "
following the a380 debacle , gallois told journalists that his first task was to help restore the reputation of eads " to the highest standard .

at first , not a lot of them agree with the operation and how hezbollah started with such an adventure , knowing what the reaction from the israelis would be .
at the end of the day , these people , the lebanese people , are paying the price of the war . however , every day that the bombing continues , people are more and more shocked and horrified by the magnitude of the reaction .
they are seeing their houses destroyed and their businesses closed and their people transferred from one region to another .
because of all the suffering they are witnessing , they can not accept to live with what is happening . what are the people most concerned about at the moment ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people are concerned violence may continue for months they are concerned that things could get worse .
that more people will be transferred from the south and that electricity plants could be the next target .
up to now the electricity plants have been avoided , which was not the case in 1996 .
but if the situation gets worse , i 'm afraid this could be the next target .
people are afraid the situation will continue for weeks or months .
lebanon does not have the capability to stand such a long war . how much of everyday life is still continuing ? it depends on the area .
in some areas that have been avoided , where there is not a massive presence of hezbollah , they are witnessing very timid activity .
however , all the bridges and main roads that connect one region to another have been systematically targeted by the bombing over the last few days .
regions are cut off from each other , which freezes the all economic activity .
what remains is a very local activity in the regions that are not the primary target of the bombing . do you have access to necessities like food and water ? it also depends on the region .
some regions , like in the southern part of beirut are completely devastated .
they are receiving aid and help from other regions .
here you can witness solidarity between lebanese across religions and communities to help each other , even though they do n't agree on the political level about what is happening .
despite the fact that they had , or still have , disagreements about the role and nature of the resistance .
among the population , you can see signs of solidarity among the people . do you have any access to information about what is happening around you ? we still have some access to the internet and some access through satellite to international broadcast networks , but this could stop if electricity goes away or more infrastructure is targeted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roads and bridges have been destroyed , making it difficult to flee there are reports of people trying to flee lebanon .
have you seen people trying to leave the area ? people are moving from one area to another .
lebanon is still under a blockade from the sea and the air .
at first some people could flee the country through syria , but now this is more and more difficult because the air bombings are targeting the main roads and main bridges .
what we are witnessing is a transfer of the population from one area to another , and this is done on purpose .
i think one of the aims of the operation is to push the population towards an area to create psychological and popular pressure on the hezbollah leadership to comply with the ceasefire conditions . what do you think is the motivation behind the bombing ? i think it started with the single objective of freeing the two soldiers who were captured , but now more and more we see there are signs to put in place a new equation that is more in favor of israelis ' security and for the security of their northern frontiers . it is true that it is a reaction to an operation that was led by hezbollah , but it seems clear that it was planned beforehand and that the objective is to come up with a new balance of power that is more favorable to the israelis and secures their borders . what do you think are the chances that violence could spread to syria ? it is my personal analysis , but i can not believe that israel today is capable of opening three fronts at the same time .
they have a war still going on in gaza , and they have been kind of forced to open another front in lebanon , and i hardly believe that they are willing to open a third front in syria . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fear violence could spread beyond lebanon and gaza what do you think are the chances of a ceasefire ? for the time being , zero . i believe that the peak of violence has not been reached yet .
this could take two or three more days . what do you think will happen when the peak of violence is reached ? there is a general feeling you can sense among international institutions that they are waiting for some radical changes on the ground .
such as israel succeeding in putting into place a buffer zone at the border . it will be drastic change either in the internal public opinion or in terms of international pressure to say , " listen guys , you have to do this . " what international organizations do you think need to increase pressure to bring about a ceasefire ? i think the pressure started with a call from the un and tony blair that they are ready to send an international force to the border between israel and lebanon .

an eads spokesman said that the plane 's industrial launch , or the start of a350 production , could be expected in the " next months . "
meanwhile , the cost of developing the mid-sized jet could more than double to about $ 10.0 billion -lrb- 7.9 billion euros -rrb- , thomas enders , co-chief executive of airbus ' parent company eads -lrb- european aeronautics defence and space company -rrb- , said sunday , confirming recent media reports .
the original cost had been put at an estimated $ 4 billion .
enders was speaking during a weekend seminar held by eads in bath , southwest england , ahead of the week-long farnborough airshow .
german boss admits errors go back years earlier , in an interview with a german newspaper enders also admitted that errors in the construction of the airbus a380 super jumbo passenger jet go back several years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enders said there were problems with the a380 production in hamburg " we made errors in the construction of the a380 , we need more time -lrb- for work -rrb- on the electrical system , " enders told the daily bild on saturday .
" the errors were made several years ago . "
the german co-chief of eads , the parent company of toulouse-based airbus , said the problem with the a380 was mainly at the hamburg factory where the passenger cabin 's electrical system is installed .
but he added that the hamburg facility " is only one part of the production chain " and that he did not want to blame any particular person .
the shock announcement last month of delivery delays for the 555-seat a380 sparked a leadership crisis at eads , which resulted in the departure of enders ' former co-chairman noel forgeard , who has been replaced by frenchman louis gallois .
enders said in 2007 airbus would deliver nine a380s , the world 's largest commercial airliner , but he could not promise that there would not be new delays in delivery " even with the best will in the world . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the a380 , the world 's largest commercial airliner , at an air show in berlin " we have a problem finding enough qualified personnel , and we have more than 2,000 planes on order for the next few years , " he said .
building trust gallois acknowledged that eads needed to rebuild trust after its recent management crisis caused by delays to the airbus a380 super jumbo .
" disclosure and trust is clear , it is our mandate .
we have clearly to rebuild trust and confidence from our shareholders , " gallois said in farnborough .

the death toll has climbed to over 160 , with civilians bearing the brunt of the conflict . " the un needs time and space to make sure we have the troops - well-trained , well-equipped troops - to go in quite quickly , " annan said .
" the sooner decisions are taken by the -lrb- un -rrb- security council , the better it is . " annan said a team of un officials in the crisis region would report to the security council by the end of the week .
he urged countries not to delay sending troops for the planned middle east peace operation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annan with german chancellor merkel and eu commission president barroso at the g8 summit annan , however , gave no indication of the number of troops required , nor any deadlines for the deployment . merkel , chirac welcome idea annan 's proposal has been largely welcomed by g8 leaders . german chancellor angela merkel said the g8 was determined to strengthen lebanon 's central government as part of efforts to end hezbollah rocket attacks on israel . " i think it make sense to have such a force based there , " merkel said , adding that she envisaged expanding the current un operation in southern lebanon . some 1,991 un soldiers have been based in lebanon since 1978 .
called unifil , the force has patrolled the hilly roads bordering on israel in its white vehicles but proved powerless to rein in guerrillas or stem israeli retaliation . the force proved ineffective when israel invaded lebanon in 1982 to flush out palestinian fighters who had attacked its northern border settlements .
unifil 's mandate was to verify an israeli withdrawal , restore international peace and security , and assist the government of lebanon " in ensuring the return of its effective authority in the area . " french president jacques chirac also backed the idea of a new force in lebanon and called for setting up a surveillance border along the israeli-lebanese border . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a flattened apartment building in beirut " we can not allow things to go on as they are .
we have to have a means of repression and surveillance , " chirac said . he added that the force 's mandate should include disarming hezbollah militias who have been launching rocket attacks on israel . blair : force should have more bite finland , which currently heads the european union presidency , also said the eu and its member states would be ready to participate in a un peacekeeping force for lebanon .
but it stressed that such a force is only an idea for the moment . british prime minister tony blair also appeared to back the idea of an international force .
blair said monday that the proposed force must have more bite and " far greater " numbers than the current un observer mission already there . " the mission will have to be far more specific and clearer , and the force employed will have to be far greater , " blair told reporters , adding however that it would " take time " for it to deploy . european external affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner called the notion of a temporary buffer force an " interesting proposal . " us , israel not convinced however , many doubt whether sending a new force to the region could halt the current violence . the united states was cautious , saying it wanted to hear the recommendations of a un fact-finding mission and israel dismissed talk of a multilateral security presence as premature . meanwhile , intense diplomacy aimed at ending the bloodshed is under way with france 's prime minister dominique de villepin flying to beirut shortly after a visit by the european union 's chief diplomat , javier solana , to the lebanese capital . the un security council also picked up talks from saturday when it failed to reach agreement on a call for a ceasefire between israel and hezbollah . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu renews call for restraint in middle east european union foreign ministers are scrambling to find diplomatic solutions to halt the fighting between israel and hezbollah , as the escalating crisis risks setting the middle east aflame .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.07.2006 europe launches satellite to boost climate research großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a computer simluation of the advanced weather satellite the most complex earth observation satellite ever to be placed into orbit is to be launched monday as part of a 15-year program to improve the accuracy of weather forecasting and our understanding of climate change . the first of three huge polar-orbiting metop -lrb- meteorological operational -rrb- satellites is to be fired into space on monday from russia 's baikonur cosmodrome in kazakhstan . metop-a , weighing more than four tons , is the most complex satellite of its kind , boasting around a dozen instruments for measuring weather patterns and transmitting back data . it will be the first of three metop satellites to be launched roughly five years apart over the coming years at a cost of 2.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- .
of that total , 1.8 billion will come from eumetsat , the organization that operates europe 's system of meteorological satellites .
most of the remainder will be provided by the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- . the esa says the metop satellites promise " data of unprecedented accuracy and resolution on a host of different variables , such as temperature and humidity , wind speed and direction over the ocean , ozone and trace gases . " that will make " a huge contribution to global weather forecasting and climate monitoring capabilities , " it said . being able to predict the weather reliably can help mitigate the effects of extreme weather conditions - which appear to be on the increase - and therefore save lives . complementary systems the large metop-a satellite - 17.6 meters -lrb- 58 feet -rrb- long once its power-producing solar panels are deployed - is designed to complement eumetsat 's meteosat satellites , which have been beaming weather data back to earth since 1978 . meteosats circle the earth above the equator at very high altitude - 36,000 kilometers -lrb- 22,000 miles -rrb- - and in geostationary orbit .
they afford scientists a wide-angle view of the earth but are unable to see certain portions of the planet . bildunterschrift : a map measuring changes in water temperature in the pacific ocean during 1997 's hurricane " el nino " by contrast , the metops will orbit at just 800-850 kilometers -lrb- 500-525 miles -rrb- over the earth , overflying the north and south poles 14 times every 24 hours .
thanks to the tilting of the earth 's own orbit , they will cover a different slice of the planet every time . " the two systems are complementary because there are lots of measurements that ca n't be done in geostationary orbit , " explained marc cohen , metop program manager at eumetsat . the launch of metop will also mark the start of cooperation between europe and the us national oceanic and atmospheric administration -lrb- noaa -rrb- .
the european and us satellites will operate in complementary orbits to give maximum coverage , with the metop giving morning information and its us counterpart data collected in the afternoon . until the launch of metop , only the us was able to provide the kind of data that polar-orbiting satellites gather . extreme weather the prime use of the metop satellites , the first of which will travel into space aboard a russian soyuz rocket , lies in its instruments , five of which are new european instruments .
these will provide high-resolution images , temperature and humidity measurements , and monitor both ozone levels and ocean winds . the other instruments are provided by noaa and france 's centre national d 'etudes spatiales -lrb- cnes -rrb- . the most sophisticated of all is the infrared atmospheric sounding interferometer -lrb- iasi -rrb- , which esa says should offer meteorologists data " of unprecedented accuracy and resolution on atmospheric temperature and humidity , with which to improve weather prediction . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : extreme weather incidents are on the rise the launch of metop is particularly timely given the apparent increase in extreme weather conditions , from devastating droughts in africa and floods in europe to hurricane katrina and the asian tsunami .
on monday , a tsunami hit the coast of java after an earthquake in the pacific ocean . data from metop may also help settle some of the raging debates on climate change , at a time of warnings from conservationists that the arctic ice cap is melting so fast that polar bears may disappear from the wild this century . the launch of metop-a , scheduled for 18:28 central european time -lrb- 16:28 gmt -rrb- on july 17 , will be broadcasted live on eumetsat 's web site . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european space agency launches competition for us europe congratulated itself wednesday with the launch of the first test satellite of the galileo navigation system , designed to rival the us system and put global positioning into civilian hands .

of that total , 1.8 billion will come from eumetsat , the organization that operates europe 's system of meteorological satellites .
most of the remainder will be provided by the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- . the esa says the metop satellites promise " data of unprecedented accuracy and resolution on a host of different variables , such as temperature and humidity , wind speed and direction over the ocean , ozone and trace gases . " that will make " a huge contribution to global weather forecasting and climate monitoring capabilities , " it said . being able to predict the weather reliably can help mitigate the effects of extreme weather conditions - which appear to be on the increase - and therefore save lives . complementary systems the large metop-a satellite - 17.6 meters -lrb- 58 feet -rrb- long once its power-producing solar panels are deployed - is designed to complement eumetsat 's meteosat satellites , which have been beaming weather data back to earth since 1978 . meteosats circle the earth above the equator at very high altitude - 36,000 kilometers -lrb- 22,000 miles -rrb- - and in geostationary orbit .
they afford scientists a wide-angle view of the earth but are unable to see certain portions of the planet . bildunterschrift : a map measuring changes in water temperature in the pacific ocean during 1997 's hurricane " el nino " by contrast , the metops will orbit at just 800-850 kilometers -lrb- 500-525 miles -rrb- over the earth , overflying the north and south poles 14 times every 24 hours .
thanks to the tilting of the earth 's own orbit , they will cover a different slice of the planet every time . " the two systems are complementary because there are lots of measurements that ca n't be done in geostationary orbit , " explained marc cohen , metop program manager at eumetsat . the launch of metop will also mark the start of cooperation between europe and the us national oceanic and atmospheric administration -lrb- noaa -rrb- .
the european and us satellites will operate in complementary orbits to give maximum coverage , with the metop giving morning information and its us counterpart data collected in the afternoon . until the launch of metop , only the us was able to provide the kind of data that polar-orbiting satellites gather . extreme weather the prime use of the metop satellites , the first of which will travel into space aboard a russian soyuz rocket , lies in its instruments , five of which are new european instruments .
these will provide high-resolution images , temperature and humidity measurements , and monitor both ozone levels and ocean winds . the other instruments are provided by noaa and france 's centre national d 'etudes spatiales -lrb- cnes -rrb- . the most sophisticated of all is the infrared atmospheric sounding interferometer -lrb- iasi -rrb- , which esa says should offer meteorologists data " of unprecedented accuracy and resolution on atmospheric temperature and humidity , with which to improve weather prediction . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : extreme weather incidents are on the rise the launch of metop is particularly timely given the apparent increase in extreme weather conditions , from devastating droughts in africa and floods in europe to hurricane katrina and the asian tsunami .
on monday , a tsunami hit the coast of java after an earthquake in the pacific ocean . data from metop may also help settle some of the raging debates on climate change , at a time of warnings from conservationists that the arctic ice cap is melting so fast that polar bears may disappear from the wild this century . the launch of metop-a , scheduled for 18:28 central european time -lrb- 16:28 gmt -rrb- on july 17 , will be broadcasted live on eumetsat 's web site . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european space agency launches competition for us europe congratulated itself wednesday with the launch of the first test satellite of the galileo navigation system , designed to rival the us system and put global positioning into civilian hands .

" the festival is getting bigger and bigger , " indian director and prolific film music composer naresh sharma told the afp news agency .
" people are really interested in indian film . " this year , the event drew 7,500 visitors , a thousand more than in 2005 , but below the 10,000 expected . the audience is a mixture of devotees who avidly follow the careers of their favorite stars such as actress aishwarya rai , and industry players who come to look at the latest offerings from the world 's second biggest cinema industry after hollywood . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : love plays the lead role in many bollywood productions bollywood 's two european camps " on the one hand you have those who know the names of all the indian actors , and on the other hand those who want to keep up do date with bollywood , " program director wiebke reiss said . the german festival program did its best to cater to both groups . in four days , some 100 films were shown , ranging from the next big features and a large number of documentaries to short horror films and a retrospective of the works of raj kapoor , an indian cinema idol of the 1950s . women came dressed in flowing silk saris and traditional jewelery as thousands of filmgoers sampled the spicy punjabi and gujurati cuisine on offer at a bazaar set up for the festival . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bollywood is becoming a regular feature on german television goal is to find new german viewers but weiss said the idea was also to convert those who believed that indian cinema had little more to offer than curry westerns or kitschy dramas , often up to three hours long , where love plays the lead role and characters regularly burst into song and dance . these films - big on sentiment but coy about sex - have found a following well beyond india , notably in the arab world where they pose far fewer problems for the censors than standard hollywood fare . german television channels have warmed up to the charm of indian cinema , with the cable channel rtl ii snapping up a number of titles .
but the country 's cinemas are another story .
at the moment there are about 15 features showing and 30 for rent at video stores . language makes finding new audiences difficult bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some universal themes could do well in germany " in order to sell indian works in germany , the films have to be dubbed , and this is very expensive , " reiss said .
" we still need to make european distributors aware of indian films and convince them that these works can win the hearts of the public here . " she singled out " mixed doubles " by director rajat kapoor as a film with a universal theme that could do well in germany .
it deals with the difficulty of keeping the passion alive after 10 years of marriage . the organizers plan to keep expanding the festival .

" we ca n't just sit here with our arms crossed , " said miguel angel moratinos , a former eu envoy to the middle east .
" this circle of violence , which could lead to an irreversible situation , can not continue . " " now it is the time for restraint and time for thinking very clearly and deeply about losing control of an already dangerous situation , " added swedish foreign minister jan eliasson .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at least 20 people have died in northern israel from air attacks the death toll in lebanon topped 160 people from a six-day offensive launched by israel after two of its soldiers were captured by members of the syrian-and iranian-backed militia hezbollah .
casualties also mounted in israel as militants poured rocket fire over the border . governments worldwide were attempting monday to evacuate their nationals from lebanon , a tricky task as beirut 's airport has been repeatedly bombed .
prime minister fuad siniora has declared lebanon a " disaster zone " and appealed for urgent international help for a country that was slowly rebuilding after a devastating 15-year civil war and the end of a three-decade syrian military presence . coming together leaders of the g8 industrial nations called sunday for an immediate middle east ceasefire .
russian president vladimir putin , host of the g8 summit , said that leaders wanted a rapid halt to middle east bloodshed , adding that moscow was using its contacts in the region to secure the release of two israeli soldiers captured by hezbollah militants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the participants of the g8 summit issued a joint statement on the conflict but putin was sober about the chances for middle east peace : " so far efforts to bring about a ceasefire have come to nothing .
i ca n't say we can be very optimistic , but i hope reason will prevail . " the two-page g8 statement called on " extremists " to immediately halt their attacks while underlining that it was " critical that israel , while exercizing the right to defend itself , be mindful of the strategic and humanitarian consequences of its actions . "
g8 countries set out four conditions that must be met by all sides : the return of israeli soldiers in gaza and lebanon unharmed ; an end to the shelling of israeli territory ; an end to israeli military operations and the early withdrawal of israeli forces from gaza ; the release of arrested palestinian ministers and parliamentarians .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.07.2006 g8 leaders end summit with focus on trade großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monday 's talk in the tsarist-era palace was all about trade the leaders of the group of eight ended their three-day summit in russia with a push to salvage global free-trade talks that are teetering on the verge of collapse . despite differences in other areas , the world 's leading industrial powers presented a unified front on monday in an attempt to move forward stalled global trade talks , which aim to reduce barriers to world trade . presidents and prime ministers from the group of eight industralized countries invited heads of state from brazil , china , india , mexico and south africa to the table in st. petersburg to breathe new life into the so-called doha round of trade negotiations and spur movement from entrenched positions . " i am convinced that now is the time for us to make a political decision , whatever it might be , " brazilian president luis ignacio lula da silva said after a early monday meeting with us president george w. bush , where he urged a redoubling of efforts to break the trade impasse .
" we can not leave it in the hands of our negotiators only . " the elusive agreement , which has been under discussion for five years , has repeatedly stalled on issues such as how much the us will cut its farm subsidies , how far the european union will go in reducing its tariffs on farm imports and the readiness of developing countries to significantly reduce barriers to industrial and service products . on monday , trade representatives from the eu , the us , brazil , india , japan and australia are heading to world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- headquarters in geneva to continue talks .
eu trade commissioner peter mandelson was also ready to head to geneva on monday night . " we do not have the luxury of postponing this any longer , " mandelson said in brussels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pascal lamy has his work cut out for him over the next four weeks on sunday , g8 leaders agreed that they would ask wto leader pascal lamy to broker a compromise within the next four weeks . " we gave a mandate to our respective negotiators to come to an agreement on modalities within one month , " said eu commission president jose manuel barosso . if no breakthrough comes in the new few weeks , analysts say the entire round could be put on ice for several years .
the us president 's power to " fast track " trade deals without a vote in congress expires at the middle of next year . energy divisions on the issue of energy , g8 leaders were not able to come to agreement in several areas . one major point of contention in the area of energy security has been russia 's refusal to ratify the energy charter treaty , which governs energy investment and transit issues in europe , russia and other countries .
while russia agreed in principle to open and transparent energy markets , it did not agree to ratify the charter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : going electric : presidents putin and bush , condoleezza rice and russian defense minister ivanov are n't burning fossil fuels here europeans have pressed hard at previous g8 meetings for russia to ratify the treaty , but the energy security statement on sunday was limited to a vague affirmation of the document 's free-market principles . divisions over the use of nuclear energy , an increasingly important issue as the west seeks alternatives to oil and gas , and the kyoto protocol , which the us has refused to sign , were also clearly reflected in the g8 energy security statement sunday . " we recognize that g8 members pursue different ways to achieve energy security and the goals of climate protection , " the statement 's section on nuclear power begins , basically agreeing to disagree . democracy discussion leaders at the summit met on sunday night for a dinner during which they had " a frank discussion " with russian president vladimir putin over his country 's democratic development , according to a diplomat there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters on sunday in st. petersburg , defying a ban on unapproved protests critics of putin in russia and in the west often say his six years in power have been marked by a clampdown on the mass media , decreasing toleration for dissent and a centralization of power in the kremlin .
some have gone so far as to say that russia is not ready for a full place at the g8 table . the diplomat told reuters that at the dinner , putin gave an account of developments inside russia .
in such situations , putin has in the past said that democracy is developing in russia according to the country 's own culture , history and traditions . putin did take the opportunity to assure colleagues he would not change the russian constitution to seek a third term in office as some had feared . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g8 demands end to israeli assaults , militant attacks g8 leaders have called for " an end to israeli military operations " in the middle east and a halt to the shelling by militants of israeli territory after struggling to come up with a unified response to the crisis .

" the festival is getting bigger and bigger , " indian director and prolific film music composer naresh sharma told the afp news agency .
" people are really interested in indian film . " this year , the event drew 7,500 visitors , a thousand more than in 2005 , but below the 10,000 expected . the audience is a mixture of devotees who avidly follow the careers of their favorite stars such as actress aishwarya rai , and industry players who come to look at the latest offerings from the world 's second biggest cinema industry after hollywood . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : love plays the lead role in many bollywood productions bollywood 's two european camps " on the one hand you have those who know the names of all the indian actors , and on the other hand those who want to keep up do date with bollywood , " program director wiebke reiss said . the german festival program did its best to cater to both groups . in four days , some 100 films were shown , ranging from the next big features and a large number of documentaries to short horror films and a retrospective of the works of raj kapoor , an indian cinema idol of the 1950s . women came dressed in flowing silk saris and traditional jewelery as thousands of filmgoers sampled the spicy punjabi and gujurati cuisine on offer at a bazaar set up for the festival . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bollywood is becoming a regular feature on german television goal is to find new german viewers but weiss said the idea was also to convert those who believed that indian cinema had little more to offer than curry westerns or kitschy dramas , often up to three hours long , where love plays the lead role and characters regularly burst into song and dance . these films - big on sentiment but coy about sex - have found a following well beyond india , notably in the arab world where they pose far fewer problems for the censors than standard hollywood fare . german television channels have warmed up to the charm of indian cinema , with the cable channel rtl ii snapping up a number of titles .
but the country 's cinemas are another story .
at the moment there are about 15 features showing and 30 for rent at video stores . language makes finding new audiences difficult bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some universal themes could do well in germany " in order to sell indian works in germany , the films have to be dubbed , and this is very expensive , " reiss said .
" we still need to make european distributors aware of indian films and convince them that these works can win the hearts of the public here . " she singled out " mixed doubles " by director rajat kapoor as a film with a universal theme that could do well in germany .
it deals with the difficulty of keeping the passion alive after 10 years of marriage . the organizers plan to keep expanding the festival .

" we ca n't just sit here with our arms crossed , " said miguel angel moratinos , a former eu envoy to the middle east .
" this circle of violence , which could lead to an irreversible situation , can not continue . " " now it is the time for restraint and time for thinking very clearly and deeply about losing control of an already dangerous situation , " added swedish foreign minister jan eliasson .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at least 20 people have died in northern israel from air attacks the death toll in lebanon topped 160 people from a six-day offensive launched by israel after two of its soldiers were captured by members of the syrian-and iranian-backed militia hezbollah .
casualties also mounted in israel as militants poured rocket fire over the border . governments worldwide were attempting monday to evacuate their nationals from lebanon , a tricky task as beirut 's airport has been repeatedly bombed .
prime minister fuad siniora has declared lebanon a " disaster zone " and appealed for urgent international help for a country that was slowly rebuilding after a devastating 15-year civil war and the end of a three-decade syrian military presence . coming together leaders of the g8 industrial nations called sunday for an immediate middle east ceasefire .
russian president vladimir putin , host of the g8 summit , said that leaders wanted a rapid halt to middle east bloodshed , adding that moscow was using its contacts in the region to secure the release of two israeli soldiers captured by hezbollah militants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the participants of the g8 summit issued a joint statement on the conflict but putin was sober about the chances for middle east peace : " so far efforts to bring about a ceasefire have come to nothing .
i ca n't say we can be very optimistic , but i hope reason will prevail . " the two-page g8 statement called on " extremists " to immediately halt their attacks while underlining that it was " critical that israel , while exercizing the right to defend itself , be mindful of the strategic and humanitarian consequences of its actions . "
g8 countries set out four conditions that must be met by all sides : the return of israeli soldiers in gaza and lebanon unharmed ; an end to the shelling of israeli territory ; an end to israeli military operations and the early withdrawal of israeli forces from gaza ; the release of arrested palestinian ministers and parliamentarians .

at first , not a lot of them agree with the operation and how hezbollah started with such an adventure , knowing what the reaction from the israelis would be .
at the end of the day , these people , the lebanese people , are paying the price of the war . however , every day that the bombing continues , people are more and more shocked and horrified by the magnitude of the reaction .
they are seeing their houses destroyed and their businesses closed and their people transferred from one region to another .
because of all the suffering they are witnessing , they can not accept to live with what is happening . what are the people most concerned about at the moment ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people are concerned violence may continue for months they are concerned that things could get worse .
that more people will be transferred from the south and that electricity plants could be the next target .
up to now the electricity plants have been avoided , which was not the case in 1996 .
but if the situation gets worse , i 'm afraid this could be the next target .
people are afraid the situation will continue for weeks or months .
lebanon does not have the capability to stand such a long war . how much of everyday life is still continuing ? it depends on the area .
in some areas that have been avoided , where there is not a massive presence of hezbollah , they are witnessing very timid activity .
however , all the bridges and main roads that connect one region to another have been systematically targeted by the bombing over the last few days .
regions are cut off from each other , which freezes the all economic activity .
what remains is a very local activity in the regions that are not the primary target of the bombing . do you have access to necessities like food and water ? it also depends on the region .
some regions , like in the southern part of beirut are completely devastated .
they are receiving aid and help from other regions .
here you can witness solidarity between lebanese across religions and communities to help each other , even though they do n't agree on the political level about what is happening .
despite the fact that they had , or still have , disagreements about the role and nature of the resistance .
among the population , you can see signs of solidarity among the people . do you have any access to information about what is happening around you ? we still have some access to the internet and some access through satellite to international broadcast networks , but this could stop if electricity goes away or more infrastructure is targeted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roads and bridges have been destroyed , making it difficult to flee there are reports of people trying to flee lebanon .
have you seen people trying to leave the area ? people are moving from one area to another .
lebanon is still under a blockade from the sea and the air .
at first some people could flee the country through syria , but now this is more and more difficult because the air bombings are targeting the main roads and main bridges .
what we are witnessing is a transfer of the population from one area to another , and this is done on purpose .
i think one of the aims of the operation is to push the population towards an area to create psychological and popular pressure on the hezbollah leadership to comply with the ceasefire conditions . what do you think is the motivation behind the bombing ? i think it started with the single objective of freeing the two soldiers who were captured , but now more and more we see there are signs to put in place a new equation that is more in favor of israelis ' security and for the security of their northern frontiers . it is true that it is a reaction to an operation that was led by hezbollah , but it seems clear that it was planned beforehand and that the objective is to come up with a new balance of power that is more favorable to the israelis and secures their borders . what do you think are the chances that violence could spread to syria ? it is my personal analysis , but i can not believe that israel today is capable of opening three fronts at the same time .
they have a war still going on in gaza , and they have been kind of forced to open another front in lebanon , and i hardly believe that they are willing to open a third front in syria . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fear violence could spread beyond lebanon and gaza what do you think are the chances of a ceasefire ? for the time being , zero . i believe that the peak of violence has not been reached yet .

such as israel succeeding in putting into place a buffer zone at the border . it will be drastic change either in the internal public opinion or in terms of international pressure to say , " listen guys , you have to do this . " what international organizations do you think need to increase pressure to bring about a ceasefire ? i think the pressure started with a call from the un and tony blair that they are ready to send an international force to the border between israel and lebanon .

at first , not a lot of them agree with the operation and how hezbollah started with such an adventure , knowing what the reaction from the israelis would be .
at the end of the day , these people , the lebanese people , are paying the price of the war . however , every day that the bombing continues , people are more and more shocked and horrified by the magnitude of the reaction .
they are seeing their houses destroyed and their businesses closed and their people transferred from one region to another .
because of all the suffering they are witnessing , they can not accept to live with what is happening . what are the people most concerned about at the moment ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people are concerned violence may continue for months they are concerned that things could get worse .
that more people will be transferred from the south and that electricity plants could be the next target .
up to now the electricity plants have been avoided , which was not the case in 1996 .
but if the situation gets worse , i 'm afraid this could be the next target .
people are afraid the situation will continue for weeks or months .
lebanon does not have the capability to stand such a long war . how much of everyday life is still continuing ? it depends on the area .
in some areas that have been avoided , where there is not a massive presence of hezbollah , they are witnessing very timid activity .
however , all the bridges and main roads that connect one region to another have been systematically targeted by the bombing over the last few days .
regions are cut off from each other , which freezes the all economic activity .
what remains is a very local activity in the regions that are not the primary target of the bombing . do you have access to necessities like food and water ? it also depends on the region .
some regions , like in the southern part of beirut are completely devastated .
they are receiving aid and help from other regions .
here you can witness solidarity between lebanese across religions and communities to help each other , even though they do n't agree on the political level about what is happening .
despite the fact that they had , or still have , disagreements about the role and nature of the resistance .
among the population , you can see signs of solidarity among the people . do you have any access to information about what is happening around you ? we still have some access to the internet and some access through satellite to international broadcast networks , but this could stop if electricity goes away or more infrastructure is targeted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roads and bridges have been destroyed , making it difficult to flee there are reports of people trying to flee lebanon .
have you seen people trying to leave the area ? people are moving from one area to another .
lebanon is still under a blockade from the sea and the air .
at first some people could flee the country through syria , but now this is more and more difficult because the air bombings are targeting the main roads and main bridges .
what we are witnessing is a transfer of the population from one area to another , and this is done on purpose .
i think one of the aims of the operation is to push the population towards an area to create psychological and popular pressure on the hezbollah leadership to comply with the ceasefire conditions . what do you think is the motivation behind the bombing ? i think it started with the single objective of freeing the two soldiers who were captured , but now more and more we see there are signs to put in place a new equation that is more in favor of israelis ' security and for the security of their northern frontiers . it is true that it is a reaction to an operation that was led by hezbollah , but it seems clear that it was planned beforehand and that the objective is to come up with a new balance of power that is more favorable to the israelis and secures their borders . what do you think are the chances that violence could spread to syria ? it is my personal analysis , but i can not believe that israel today is capable of opening three fronts at the same time .

" i am convinced that now is the time for us to make a political decision , whatever it might be , " brazilian president luis ignacio lula da silva said after a early monday meeting with us president george w. bush , where he urged a redoubling of efforts to break the trade impasse .
" we can not leave it in the hands of our negotiators only . " the elusive agreement , which has been under discussion for five years , has repeatedly stalled on issues such as how much the us will cut its farm subsidies , how far the european union will go in reducing its tariffs on farm imports and the readiness of developing countries to significantly reduce barriers to industrial and service products . on monday , trade representatives from the eu , the us , brazil , india , japan and australia are heading to world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- headquarters in geneva to continue talks .

" we can not leave it in the hands of our negotiators only . " the elusive agreement , which has been under discussion for five years , has repeatedly stalled on issues such as how much the us will cut its farm subsidies , how far the european union will go in reducing its tariffs on farm imports and the readiness of developing countries to significantly reduce barriers to industrial and service products . on monday , trade representatives from the eu , the us , brazil , india , japan and australia are heading to world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- headquarters in geneva to continue talks .

" we ca n't just sit here with our arms crossed , " said miguel angel moratinos , a former eu envoy to the middle east .
" this circle of violence , which could lead to an irreversible situation , can not continue . " " now it is the time for restraint and time for thinking very clearly and deeply about losing control of an already dangerous situation , " added swedish foreign minister jan eliasson .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the participants of the g8 summit issued a joint statement on the conflict but putin was sober about the chances for middle east peace : " so far efforts to bring about a ceasefire have come to nothing .
i ca n't say we can be very optimistic , but i hope reason will prevail . " the two-page g8 statement called on " extremists " to immediately halt their attacks while underlining that it was " critical that israel , while exercizing the right to defend itself , be mindful of the strategic and humanitarian consequences of its actions . "
g8 countries set out four conditions that must be met by all sides : the return of israeli soldiers in gaza and lebanon unharmed ; an end to the shelling of israeli territory ; an end to israeli military operations and the early withdrawal of israeli forces from gaza ; the release of arrested palestinian ministers and parliamentarians .

the death toll has climbed to over 160 , with civilians bearing the brunt of the conflict . " the un needs time and space to make sure we have the troops - well-trained , well-equipped troops - to go in quite quickly , " annan said .
" the sooner decisions are taken by the -lrb- un -rrb- security council , the better it is . " annan said a team of un officials in the crisis region would report to the security council by the end of the week .
he urged countries not to delay sending troops for the planned middle east peace operation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annan with german chancellor merkel and eu commission president barroso at the g8 summit annan , however , gave no indication of the number of troops required , nor any deadlines for the deployment . merkel , chirac welcome idea annan 's proposal has been largely welcomed by g8 leaders . german chancellor angela merkel said the g8 was determined to strengthen lebanon 's central government as part of efforts to end hezbollah rocket attacks on israel . " i think it make sense to have such a force based there , " merkel said , adding that she envisaged expanding the current un operation in southern lebanon . some 1,991 un soldiers have been based in lebanon since 1978 .
called unifil , the force has patrolled the hilly roads bordering on israel in its white vehicles but proved powerless to rein in guerrillas or stem israeli retaliation . the force proved ineffective when israel invaded lebanon in 1982 to flush out palestinian fighters who had attacked its northern border settlements .
unifil 's mandate was to verify an israeli withdrawal , restore international peace and security , and assist the government of lebanon " in ensuring the return of its effective authority in the area . " french president jacques chirac also backed the idea of a new force in lebanon and called for setting up a surveillance border along the israeli-lebanese border . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a flattened apartment building in beirut " we can not allow things to go on as they are .
we have to have a means of repression and surveillance , " chirac said . he added that the force 's mandate should include disarming hezbollah militias who have been launching rocket attacks on israel . blair : force should have more bite finland , which currently heads the european union presidency , also said the eu and its member states would be ready to participate in a un peacekeeping force for lebanon .
but it stressed that such a force is only an idea for the moment . british prime minister tony blair also appeared to back the idea of an international force .
blair said monday that the proposed force must have more bite and " far greater " numbers than the current un observer mission already there . " the mission will have to be far more specific and clearer , and the force employed will have to be far greater , " blair told reporters , adding however that it would " take time " for it to deploy . european external affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner called the notion of a temporary buffer force an " interesting proposal . " us , israel not convinced however , many doubt whether sending a new force to the region could halt the current violence . the united states was cautious , saying it wanted to hear the recommendations of a un fact-finding mission and israel dismissed talk of a multilateral security presence as premature . meanwhile , intense diplomacy aimed at ending the bloodshed is under way with france 's prime minister dominique de villepin flying to beirut shortly after a visit by the european union 's chief diplomat , javier solana , to the lebanese capital . the un security council also picked up talks from saturday when it failed to reach agreement on a call for a ceasefire between israel and hezbollah . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu renews call for restraint in middle east european union foreign ministers are scrambling to find diplomatic solutions to halt the fighting between israel and hezbollah , as the escalating crisis risks setting the middle east aflame .

of that total , 1.8 billion will come from eumetsat , the organization that operates europe 's system of meteorological satellites .
most of the remainder will be provided by the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- . the esa says the metop satellites promise " data of unprecedented accuracy and resolution on a host of different variables , such as temperature and humidity , wind speed and direction over the ocean , ozone and trace gases .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus on business european commission proposes air fare transparency rules high priced raw materials make recycled rubbish attractive major management shake-up at bmw german family firm fights off tourism giants business -pipe- 17.07.2006 airbus to unveil new a350 plane design großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus has had a turbulent time with the a350 admitting that the cost of developing its troubled a350 will more than double , european group airbus will on monday disclose new design plans for the plane at an air show near london . airbus will unveil new plans for the a350 , which it launched in 2005 as a direct rival to boeing 's 787 dreamliner but which has been poorly received by potential customers , at the farnborough near london on monday .
an eads spokesman said that the plane 's industrial launch , or the start of a350 production , could be expected in the " next months . "
meanwhile , the cost of developing the mid-sized jet could more than double to about $ 10.0 billion -lrb- 7.9 billion euros -rrb- , thomas enders , co-chief executive of airbus ' parent company eads -lrb- european aeronautics defence and space company -rrb- , said sunday , confirming recent media reports .
the original cost had been put at an estimated $ 4 billion .
enders was speaking during a weekend seminar held by eads in bath , southwest england , ahead of the week-long farnborough airshow .
german boss admits errors go back years earlier , in an interview with a german newspaper enders also admitted that errors in the construction of the airbus a380 super jumbo passenger jet go back several years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enders said there were problems with the a380 production in hamburg " we made errors in the construction of the a380 , we need more time -lrb- for work -rrb- on the electrical system , " enders told the daily bild on saturday .
" the errors were made several years ago . "
the german co-chief of eads , the parent company of toulouse-based airbus , said the problem with the a380 was mainly at the hamburg factory where the passenger cabin 's electrical system is installed .
but he added that the hamburg facility " is only one part of the production chain " and that he did not want to blame any particular person .
the shock announcement last month of delivery delays for the 555-seat a380 sparked a leadership crisis at eads , which resulted in the departure of enders ' former co-chairman noel forgeard , who has been replaced by frenchman louis gallois .
enders said in 2007 airbus would deliver nine a380s , the world 's largest commercial airliner , but he could not promise that there would not be new delays in delivery " even with the best will in the world . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the a380 , the world 's largest commercial airliner , at an air show in berlin " we have a problem finding enough qualified personnel , and we have more than 2,000 planes on order for the next few years , " he said .
building trust gallois acknowledged that eads needed to rebuild trust after its recent management crisis caused by delays to the airbus a380 super jumbo .
" disclosure and trust is clear , it is our mandate .
we have clearly to rebuild trust and confidence from our shareholders , " gallois said in farnborough .
gallois replaced frenchman noel forgeard .
the latter had been under intense pressure to quit since it was revealed he sold eads shares worth millions of euros nearly three months before the group had on june 13 announced delays to the a380 .
the wide-body a350 , which in its current design can carry between 250 and 300 passengers , is being overhauled to make it bigger and more fuel efficient .
some analysts believe it will re-emerge as the a370 and could see an enlarged fuselage .
us aircraft giant boeing is winning the race in the long-haul market with the 787 , which is being marketed to airlines as a fuel efficient , medium-sized jet .
meanwhile streiff , who is french , was named head of airbus earlier this month .
he replaced the german gustav humbert , who resigned after airbus announced it had run into manufacturing problems with its a380 super jumbo jet that would delay deliveries of the world 's largest passenger aircraft .
news of the delays saw 5.5 billion euros briefly wiped off the market value of eads , which owns 80 percent of airbus .
restoring eads ' image eads ' finances are set to take a further financial hit in the coming months owing to the increased spending on the a350 and penalties it must pay customers for delayed deliveries of the a380 , which is set to enter service in 2007 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eads is facing bad news on the financial front the company could be forced soon also to pay 2.75 billion euros for the 20 percent of airbus it does not own .
bae systems has served eads with a formal notice permitting the british group to exercise an option to sell eads its 20-percent stake in airbus .
enders told journalists in bath that the management crisis was over .
but he added : " undoubtedly the reputation of this company has suffered , so has the confidence of customers and investors .
the project that triggered this crisis , the a380 , needs to be fixed . "

an eads spokesman said that the plane 's industrial launch , or the start of a350 production , could be expected in the " next months . "
meanwhile , the cost of developing the mid-sized jet could more than double to about $ 10.0 billion -lrb- 7.9 billion euros -rrb- , thomas enders , co-chief executive of airbus ' parent company eads -lrb- european aeronautics defence and space company -rrb- , said sunday , confirming recent media reports .
the original cost had been put at an estimated $ 4 billion .
enders was speaking during a weekend seminar held by eads in bath , southwest england , ahead of the week-long farnborough airshow .
german boss admits errors go back years earlier , in an interview with a german newspaper enders also admitted that errors in the construction of the airbus a380 super jumbo passenger jet go back several years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enders said there were problems with the a380 production in hamburg " we made errors in the construction of the a380 , we need more time -lrb- for work -rrb- on the electrical system , " enders told the daily bild on saturday .
" the errors were made several years ago . "
the german co-chief of eads , the parent company of toulouse-based airbus , said the problem with the a380 was mainly at the hamburg factory where the passenger cabin 's electrical system is installed .
but he added that the hamburg facility " is only one part of the production chain " and that he did not want to blame any particular person .
the shock announcement last month of delivery delays for the 555-seat a380 sparked a leadership crisis at eads , which resulted in the departure of enders ' former co-chairman noel forgeard , who has been replaced by frenchman louis gallois .
enders said in 2007 airbus would deliver nine a380s , the world 's largest commercial airliner , but he could not promise that there would not be new delays in delivery " even with the best will in the world . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the a380 , the world 's largest commercial airliner , at an air show in berlin " we have a problem finding enough qualified personnel , and we have more than 2,000 planes on order for the next few years , " he said .
building trust gallois acknowledged that eads needed to rebuild trust after its recent management crisis caused by delays to the airbus a380 super jumbo .
" disclosure and trust is clear , it is our mandate .
we have clearly to rebuild trust and confidence from our shareholders , " gallois said in farnborough .
gallois replaced frenchman noel forgeard .
the latter had been under intense pressure to quit since it was revealed he sold eads shares worth millions of euros nearly three months before the group had on june 13 announced delays to the a380 .
the wide-body a350 , which in its current design can carry between 250 and 300 passengers , is being overhauled to make it bigger and more fuel efficient .
some analysts believe it will re-emerge as the a370 and could see an enlarged fuselage .
us aircraft giant boeing is winning the race in the long-haul market with the 787 , which is being marketed to airlines as a fuel efficient , medium-sized jet .
meanwhile streiff , who is french , was named head of airbus earlier this month .
he replaced the german gustav humbert , who resigned after airbus announced it had run into manufacturing problems with its a380 super jumbo jet that would delay deliveries of the world 's largest passenger aircraft .
news of the delays saw 5.5 billion euros briefly wiped off the market value of eads , which owns 80 percent of airbus .
restoring eads ' image eads ' finances are set to take a further financial hit in the coming months owing to the increased spending on the a350 and penalties it must pay customers for delayed deliveries of the a380 , which is set to enter service in 2007 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eads is facing bad news on the financial front the company could be forced soon also to pay 2.75 billion euros for the 20 percent of airbus it does not own .
bae systems has served eads with a formal notice permitting the british group to exercise an option to sell eads its 20-percent stake in airbus .
enders told journalists in bath that the management crisis was over .
but he added : " undoubtedly the reputation of this company has suffered , so has the confidence of customers and investors .
the project that triggered this crisis , the a380 , needs to be fixed . "

at first , not a lot of them agree with the operation and how hezbollah started with such an adventure , knowing what the reaction from the israelis would be .
at the end of the day , these people , the lebanese people , are paying the price of the war . however , every day that the bombing continues , people are more and more shocked and horrified by the magnitude of the reaction .
they are seeing their houses destroyed and their businesses closed and their people transferred from one region to another .
because of all the suffering they are witnessing , they can not accept to live with what is happening . what are the people most concerned about at the moment ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people are concerned violence may continue for months they are concerned that things could get worse .
that more people will be transferred from the south and that electricity plants could be the next target .
up to now the electricity plants have been avoided , which was not the case in 1996 .
but if the situation gets worse , i 'm afraid this could be the next target .
people are afraid the situation will continue for weeks or months .
lebanon does not have the capability to stand such a long war . how much of everyday life is still continuing ? it depends on the area .
in some areas that have been avoided , where there is not a massive presence of hezbollah , they are witnessing very timid activity .
however , all the bridges and main roads that connect one region to another have been systematically targeted by the bombing over the last few days .
regions are cut off from each other , which freezes the all economic activity .
what remains is a very local activity in the regions that are not the primary target of the bombing . do you have access to necessities like food and water ? it also depends on the region .
some regions , like in the southern part of beirut are completely devastated .
they are receiving aid and help from other regions .
here you can witness solidarity between lebanese across religions and communities to help each other , even though they do n't agree on the political level about what is happening .
despite the fact that they had , or still have , disagreements about the role and nature of the resistance .
among the population , you can see signs of solidarity among the people . do you have any access to information about what is happening around you ? we still have some access to the internet and some access through satellite to international broadcast networks , but this could stop if electricity goes away or more infrastructure is targeted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roads and bridges have been destroyed , making it difficult to flee there are reports of people trying to flee lebanon .
have you seen people trying to leave the area ? people are moving from one area to another .
lebanon is still under a blockade from the sea and the air .
at first some people could flee the country through syria , but now this is more and more difficult because the air bombings are targeting the main roads and main bridges .
what we are witnessing is a transfer of the population from one area to another , and this is done on purpose .
i think one of the aims of the operation is to push the population towards an area to create psychological and popular pressure on the hezbollah leadership to comply with the ceasefire conditions . what do you think is the motivation behind the bombing ? i think it started with the single objective of freeing the two soldiers who were captured , but now more and more we see there are signs to put in place a new equation that is more in favor of israelis ' security and for the security of their northern frontiers . it is true that it is a reaction to an operation that was led by hezbollah , but it seems clear that it was planned beforehand and that the objective is to come up with a new balance of power that is more favorable to the israelis and secures their borders . what do you think are the chances that violence could spread to syria ? it is my personal analysis , but i can not believe that israel today is capable of opening three fronts at the same time .
they have a war still going on in gaza , and they have been kind of forced to open another front in lebanon , and i hardly believe that they are willing to open a third front in syria . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fear violence could spread beyond lebanon and gaza what do you think are the chances of a ceasefire ? for the time being , zero . i believe that the peak of violence has not been reached yet .
this could take two or three more days . what do you think will happen when the peak of violence is reached ? there is a general feeling you can sense among international institutions that they are waiting for some radical changes on the ground .
such as israel succeeding in putting into place a buffer zone at the border . it will be drastic change either in the internal public opinion or in terms of international pressure to say , " listen guys , you have to do this . " what international organizations do you think need to increase pressure to bring about a ceasefire ? i think the pressure started with a call from the un and tony blair that they are ready to send an international force to the border between israel and lebanon .
i think pressure should also come from either the un or the united states of america with its traditional allies of france and germany . sean sinico interviewed sami nader send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu renews call for restraint in middle east european union foreign ministers are scrambling to find diplomatic solutions to halt the fighting between israel and hezbollah , as the escalating crisis risks setting the middle east aflame .

an eads spokesman said that the plane 's industrial launch , or the start of a350 production , could be expected in the " next months . "
meanwhile , the cost of developing the mid-sized jet could more than double to about $ 10.0 billion -lrb- 7.9 billion euros -rrb- , thomas enders , co-chief executive of airbus ' parent company eads -lrb- european aeronautics defence and space company -rrb- , said sunday , confirming recent media reports .
the original cost had been put at an estimated $ 4 billion .
enders was speaking during a weekend seminar held by eads in bath , southwest england , ahead of the week-long farnborough airshow .
german boss admits errors go back years earlier , in an interview with a german newspaper enders also admitted that errors in the construction of the airbus a380 super jumbo passenger jet go back several years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enders said there were problems with the a380 production in hamburg " we made errors in the construction of the a380 , we need more time -lrb- for work -rrb- on the electrical system , " enders told the daily bild on saturday .
" the errors were made several years ago . "
the german co-chief of eads , the parent company of toulouse-based airbus , said the problem with the a380 was mainly at the hamburg factory where the passenger cabin 's electrical system is installed .
but he added that the hamburg facility " is only one part of the production chain " and that he did not want to blame any particular person .
the shock announcement last month of delivery delays for the 555-seat a380 sparked a leadership crisis at eads , which resulted in the departure of enders ' former co-chairman noel forgeard , who has been replaced by frenchman louis gallois .
enders said in 2007 airbus would deliver nine a380s , the world 's largest commercial airliner , but he could not promise that there would not be new delays in delivery " even with the best will in the world . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the a380 , the world 's largest commercial airliner , at an air show in berlin " we have a problem finding enough qualified personnel , and we have more than 2,000 planes on order for the next few years , " he said .
building trust gallois acknowledged that eads needed to rebuild trust after its recent management crisis caused by delays to the airbus a380 super jumbo .
" disclosure and trust is clear , it is our mandate .
we have clearly to rebuild trust and confidence from our shareholders , " gallois said in farnborough .
gallois replaced frenchman noel forgeard .
the latter had been under intense pressure to quit since it was revealed he sold eads shares worth millions of euros nearly three months before the group had on june 13 announced delays to the a380 .
the wide-body a350 , which in its current design can carry between 250 and 300 passengers , is being overhauled to make it bigger and more fuel efficient .
some analysts believe it will re-emerge as the a370 and could see an enlarged fuselage .
us aircraft giant boeing is winning the race in the long-haul market with the 787 , which is being marketed to airlines as a fuel efficient , medium-sized jet .
meanwhile streiff , who is french , was named head of airbus earlier this month .
he replaced the german gustav humbert , who resigned after airbus announced it had run into manufacturing problems with its a380 super jumbo jet that would delay deliveries of the world 's largest passenger aircraft .
news of the delays saw 5.5 billion euros briefly wiped off the market value of eads , which owns 80 percent of airbus .
restoring eads ' image eads ' finances are set to take a further financial hit in the coming months owing to the increased spending on the a350 and penalties it must pay customers for delayed deliveries of the a380 , which is set to enter service in 2007 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eads is facing bad news on the financial front the company could be forced soon also to pay 2.75 billion euros for the 20 percent of airbus it does not own .
bae systems has served eads with a formal notice permitting the british group to exercise an option to sell eads its 20-percent stake in airbus .
enders told journalists in bath that the management crisis was over .
but he added : " undoubtedly the reputation of this company has suffered , so has the confidence of customers and investors .
the project that triggered this crisis , the a380 , needs to be fixed . "
following the a380 debacle , gallois told journalists that his first task was to help restore the reputation of eads " to the highest standard .

the death toll has climbed to over 160 , with civilians bearing the brunt of the conflict . " the un needs time and space to make sure we have the troops - well-trained , well-equipped troops - to go in quite quickly , " annan said .

but it stressed that such a force is only an idea for the moment . british prime minister tony blair also appeared to back the idea of an international force .
blair said monday that the proposed force must have more bite and " far greater " numbers than the current un observer mission already there . " the mission will have to be far more specific and clearer , and the force employed will have to be far greater , " blair told reporters , adding however that it would " take time " for it to deploy . european external affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner called the notion of a temporary buffer force an " interesting proposal . " us , israel not convinced however , many doubt whether sending a new force to the region could halt the current violence . the united states was cautious , saying it wanted to hear the recommendations of a un fact-finding mission and israel dismissed talk of a multilateral security presence as premature . meanwhile , intense diplomacy aimed at ending the bloodshed is under way with france 's prime minister dominique de villepin flying to beirut shortly after a visit by the european union 's chief diplomat , javier solana , to the lebanese capital . the un security council also picked up talks from saturday when it failed to reach agreement on a call for a ceasefire between israel and hezbollah . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu renews call for restraint in middle east european union foreign ministers are scrambling to find diplomatic solutions to halt the fighting between israel and hezbollah , as the escalating crisis risks setting the middle east aflame .

" i am convinced that now is the time for us to make a political decision , whatever it might be , " brazilian president luis ignacio lula da silva said after a early monday meeting with us president george w. bush , where he urged a redoubling of efforts to break the trade impasse .
" we can not leave it in the hands of our negotiators only . " the elusive agreement , which has been under discussion for five years , has repeatedly stalled on issues such as how much the us will cut its farm subsidies , how far the european union will go in reducing its tariffs on farm imports and the readiness of developing countries to significantly reduce barriers to industrial and service products . on monday , trade representatives from the eu , the us , brazil , india , japan and australia are heading to world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- headquarters in geneva to continue talks .
eu trade commissioner peter mandelson was also ready to head to geneva on monday night . " we do not have the luxury of postponing this any longer , " mandelson said in brussels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pascal lamy has his work cut out for him over the next four weeks on sunday , g8 leaders agreed that they would ask wto leader pascal lamy to broker a compromise within the next four weeks . " we gave a mandate to our respective negotiators to come to an agreement on modalities within one month , " said eu commission president jose manuel barosso . if no breakthrough comes in the new few weeks , analysts say the entire round could be put on ice for several years .
the us president 's power to " fast track " trade deals without a vote in congress expires at the middle of next year . energy divisions on the issue of energy , g8 leaders were not able to come to agreement in several areas . one major point of contention in the area of energy security has been russia 's refusal to ratify the energy charter treaty , which governs energy investment and transit issues in europe , russia and other countries .
while russia agreed in principle to open and transparent energy markets , it did not agree to ratify the charter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : going electric : presidents putin and bush , condoleezza rice and russian defense minister ivanov are n't burning fossil fuels here europeans have pressed hard at previous g8 meetings for russia to ratify the treaty , but the energy security statement on sunday was limited to a vague affirmation of the document 's free-market principles . divisions over the use of nuclear energy , an increasingly important issue as the west seeks alternatives to oil and gas , and the kyoto protocol , which the us has refused to sign , were also clearly reflected in the g8 energy security statement sunday . " we recognize that g8 members pursue different ways to achieve energy security and the goals of climate protection , " the statement 's section on nuclear power begins , basically agreeing to disagree . democracy discussion leaders at the summit met on sunday night for a dinner during which they had " a frank discussion " with russian president vladimir putin over his country 's democratic development , according to a diplomat there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters on sunday in st. petersburg , defying a ban on unapproved protests critics of putin in russia and in the west often say his six years in power have been marked by a clampdown on the mass media , decreasing toleration for dissent and a centralization of power in the kremlin .
some have gone so far as to say that russia is not ready for a full place at the g8 table . the diplomat told reuters that at the dinner , putin gave an account of developments inside russia .
in such situations , putin has in the past said that democracy is developing in russia according to the country 's own culture , history and traditions . putin did take the opportunity to assure colleagues he would not change the russian constitution to seek a third term in office as some had feared . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g8 demands end to israeli assaults , militant attacks g8 leaders have called for " an end to israeli military operations " in the middle east and a halt to the shelling by militants of israeli territory after struggling to come up with a unified response to the crisis .

the death toll has climbed to over 160 , with civilians bearing the brunt of the conflict . " the un needs time and space to make sure we have the troops - well-trained , well-equipped troops - to go in quite quickly , " annan said .

" i think it make sense to have such a force based there , " merkel said , adding that she envisaged expanding the current un operation in southern lebanon . some 1,991 un soldiers have been based in lebanon since 1978 .
called unifil , the force has patrolled the hilly roads bordering on israel in its white vehicles but proved powerless to rein in guerrillas or stem israeli retaliation . the force proved ineffective when israel invaded lebanon in 1982 to flush out palestinian fighters who had attacked its northern border settlements .
unifil 's mandate was to verify an israeli withdrawal , restore international peace and security , and assist the government of lebanon " in ensuring the return of its effective authority in the area .

the death toll has climbed to over 160 , with civilians bearing the brunt of the conflict . " the un needs time and space to make sure we have the troops - well-trained , well-equipped troops - to go in quite quickly , " annan said .
" the sooner decisions are taken by the -lrb- un -rrb- security council , the better it is . " annan said a team of un officials in the crisis region would report to the security council by the end of the week .
he urged countries not to delay sending troops for the planned middle east peace operation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annan with german chancellor merkel and eu commission president barroso at the g8 summit annan , however , gave no indication of the number of troops required , nor any deadlines for the deployment . merkel , chirac welcome idea annan 's proposal has been largely welcomed by g8 leaders . german chancellor angela merkel said the g8 was determined to strengthen lebanon 's central government as part of efforts to end hezbollah rocket attacks on israel . " i think it make sense to have such a force based there , " merkel said , adding that she envisaged expanding the current un operation in southern lebanon . some 1,991 un soldiers have been based in lebanon since 1978 .
called unifil , the force has patrolled the hilly roads bordering on israel in its white vehicles but proved powerless to rein in guerrillas or stem israeli retaliation . the force proved ineffective when israel invaded lebanon in 1982 to flush out palestinian fighters who had attacked its northern border settlements .
unifil 's mandate was to verify an israeli withdrawal , restore international peace and security , and assist the government of lebanon " in ensuring the return of its effective authority in the area . " french president jacques chirac also backed the idea of a new force in lebanon and called for setting up a surveillance border along the israeli-lebanese border . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a flattened apartment building in beirut " we can not allow things to go on as they are .
we have to have a means of repression and surveillance , " chirac said . he added that the force 's mandate should include disarming hezbollah militias who have been launching rocket attacks on israel . blair : force should have more bite finland , which currently heads the european union presidency , also said the eu and its member states would be ready to participate in a un peacekeeping force for lebanon .
but it stressed that such a force is only an idea for the moment . british prime minister tony blair also appeared to back the idea of an international force .
blair said monday that the proposed force must have more bite and " far greater " numbers than the current un observer mission already there . " the mission will have to be far more specific and clearer , and the force employed will have to be far greater , " blair told reporters , adding however that it would " take time " for it to deploy . european external affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner called the notion of a temporary buffer force an " interesting proposal . " us , israel not convinced however , many doubt whether sending a new force to the region could halt the current violence . the united states was cautious , saying it wanted to hear the recommendations of a un fact-finding mission and israel dismissed talk of a multilateral security presence as premature . meanwhile , intense diplomacy aimed at ending the bloodshed is under way with france 's prime minister dominique de villepin flying to beirut shortly after a visit by the european union 's chief diplomat , javier solana , to the lebanese capital . the un security council also picked up talks from saturday when it failed to reach agreement on a call for a ceasefire between israel and hezbollah . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu renews call for restraint in middle east european union foreign ministers are scrambling to find diplomatic solutions to halt the fighting between israel and hezbollah , as the escalating crisis risks setting the middle east aflame .

" i am convinced that now is the time for us to make a political decision , whatever it might be , " brazilian president luis ignacio lula da silva said after a early monday meeting with us president george w. bush , where he urged a redoubling of efforts to break the trade impasse .
" we can not leave it in the hands of our negotiators only . " the elusive agreement , which has been under discussion for five years , has repeatedly stalled on issues such as how much the us will cut its farm subsidies , how far the european union will go in reducing its tariffs on farm imports and the readiness of developing countries to significantly reduce barriers to industrial and service products . on monday , trade representatives from the eu , the us , brazil , india , japan and australia are heading to world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- headquarters in geneva to continue talks .
eu trade commissioner peter mandelson was also ready to head to geneva on monday night . " we do not have the luxury of postponing this any longer , " mandelson said in brussels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pascal lamy has his work cut out for him over the next four weeks on sunday , g8 leaders agreed that they would ask wto leader pascal lamy to broker a compromise within the next four weeks . " we gave a mandate to our respective negotiators to come to an agreement on modalities within one month , " said eu commission president jose manuel barosso . if no breakthrough comes in the new few weeks , analysts say the entire round could be put on ice for several years .
the us president 's power to " fast track " trade deals without a vote in congress expires at the middle of next year . energy divisions on the issue of energy , g8 leaders were not able to come to agreement in several areas . one major point of contention in the area of energy security has been russia 's refusal to ratify the energy charter treaty , which governs energy investment and transit issues in europe , russia and other countries .
while russia agreed in principle to open and transparent energy markets , it did not agree to ratify the charter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : going electric : presidents putin and bush , condoleezza rice and russian defense minister ivanov are n't burning fossil fuels here europeans have pressed hard at previous g8 meetings for russia to ratify the treaty , but the energy security statement on sunday was limited to a vague affirmation of the document 's free-market principles . divisions over the use of nuclear energy , an increasingly important issue as the west seeks alternatives to oil and gas , and the kyoto protocol , which the us has refused to sign , were also clearly reflected in the g8 energy security statement sunday . " we recognize that g8 members pursue different ways to achieve energy security and the goals of climate protection , " the statement 's section on nuclear power begins , basically agreeing to disagree . democracy discussion leaders at the summit met on sunday night for a dinner during which they had " a frank discussion " with russian president vladimir putin over his country 's democratic development , according to a diplomat there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters on sunday in st. petersburg , defying a ban on unapproved protests critics of putin in russia and in the west often say his six years in power have been marked by a clampdown on the mass media , decreasing toleration for dissent and a centralization of power in the kremlin .
some have gone so far as to say that russia is not ready for a full place at the g8 table . the diplomat told reuters that at the dinner , putin gave an account of developments inside russia .
in such situations , putin has in the past said that democracy is developing in russia according to the country 's own culture , history and traditions . putin did take the opportunity to assure colleagues he would not change the russian constitution to seek a third term in office as some had feared . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g8 demands end to israeli assaults , militant attacks g8 leaders have called for " an end to israeli military operations " in the middle east and a halt to the shelling by militants of israeli territory after struggling to come up with a unified response to the crisis .

at first , not a lot of them agree with the operation and how hezbollah started with such an adventure , knowing what the reaction from the israelis would be .
at the end of the day , these people , the lebanese people , are paying the price of the war . however , every day that the bombing continues , people are more and more shocked and horrified by the magnitude of the reaction .
they are seeing their houses destroyed and their businesses closed and their people transferred from one region to another .
because of all the suffering they are witnessing , they can not accept to live with what is happening . what are the people most concerned about at the moment ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people are concerned violence may continue for months they are concerned that things could get worse .
that more people will be transferred from the south and that electricity plants could be the next target .
up to now the electricity plants have been avoided , which was not the case in 1996 .
but if the situation gets worse , i 'm afraid this could be the next target .
people are afraid the situation will continue for weeks or months .
lebanon does not have the capability to stand such a long war . how much of everyday life is still continuing ? it depends on the area .
in some areas that have been avoided , where there is not a massive presence of hezbollah , they are witnessing very timid activity .
however , all the bridges and main roads that connect one region to another have been systematically targeted by the bombing over the last few days .
regions are cut off from each other , which freezes the all economic activity .
what remains is a very local activity in the regions that are not the primary target of the bombing . do you have access to necessities like food and water ? it also depends on the region .
some regions , like in the southern part of beirut are completely devastated .
they are receiving aid and help from other regions .
here you can witness solidarity between lebanese across religions and communities to help each other , even though they do n't agree on the political level about what is happening .
despite the fact that they had , or still have , disagreements about the role and nature of the resistance .
among the population , you can see signs of solidarity among the people . do you have any access to information about what is happening around you ? we still have some access to the internet and some access through satellite to international broadcast networks , but this could stop if electricity goes away or more infrastructure is targeted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roads and bridges have been destroyed , making it difficult to flee there are reports of people trying to flee lebanon .
have you seen people trying to leave the area ? people are moving from one area to another .
lebanon is still under a blockade from the sea and the air .
at first some people could flee the country through syria , but now this is more and more difficult because the air bombings are targeting the main roads and main bridges .
what we are witnessing is a transfer of the population from one area to another , and this is done on purpose .
i think one of the aims of the operation is to push the population towards an area to create psychological and popular pressure on the hezbollah leadership to comply with the ceasefire conditions . what do you think is the motivation behind the bombing ? i think it started with the single objective of freeing the two soldiers who were captured , but now more and more we see there are signs to put in place a new equation that is more in favor of israelis ' security and for the security of their northern frontiers . it is true that it is a reaction to an operation that was led by hezbollah , but it seems clear that it was planned beforehand and that the objective is to come up with a new balance of power that is more favorable to the israelis and secures their borders . what do you think are the chances that violence could spread to syria ? it is my personal analysis , but i can not believe that israel today is capable of opening three fronts at the same time .
they have a war still going on in gaza , and they have been kind of forced to open another front in lebanon , and i hardly believe that they are willing to open a third front in syria . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fear violence could spread beyond lebanon and gaza what do you think are the chances of a ceasefire ? for the time being , zero . i believe that the peak of violence has not been reached yet .
this could take two or three more days . what do you think will happen when the peak of violence is reached ? there is a general feeling you can sense among international institutions that they are waiting for some radical changes on the ground .
such as israel succeeding in putting into place a buffer zone at the border . it will be drastic change either in the internal public opinion or in terms of international pressure to say , " listen guys , you have to do this . " what international organizations do you think need to increase pressure to bring about a ceasefire ? i think the pressure started with a call from the un and tony blair that they are ready to send an international force to the border between israel and lebanon .

at first , not a lot of them agree with the operation and how hezbollah started with such an adventure , knowing what the reaction from the israelis would be .
at the end of the day , these people , the lebanese people , are paying the price of the war . however , every day that the bombing continues , people are more and more shocked and horrified by the magnitude of the reaction .
they are seeing their houses destroyed and their businesses closed and their people transferred from one region to another .
because of all the suffering they are witnessing , they can not accept to live with what is happening . what are the people most concerned about at the moment ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people are concerned violence may continue for months they are concerned that things could get worse .
that more people will be transferred from the south and that electricity plants could be the next target .
up to now the electricity plants have been avoided , which was not the case in 1996 .
but if the situation gets worse , i 'm afraid this could be the next target .
people are afraid the situation will continue for weeks or months .
lebanon does not have the capability to stand such a long war . how much of everyday life is still continuing ? it depends on the area .
in some areas that have been avoided , where there is not a massive presence of hezbollah , they are witnessing very timid activity .
however , all the bridges and main roads that connect one region to another have been systematically targeted by the bombing over the last few days .
regions are cut off from each other , which freezes the all economic activity .
what remains is a very local activity in the regions that are not the primary target of the bombing . do you have access to necessities like food and water ? it also depends on the region .
some regions , like in the southern part of beirut are completely devastated .
they are receiving aid and help from other regions .
here you can witness solidarity between lebanese across religions and communities to help each other , even though they do n't agree on the political level about what is happening .
despite the fact that they had , or still have , disagreements about the role and nature of the resistance .
among the population , you can see signs of solidarity among the people . do you have any access to information about what is happening around you ? we still have some access to the internet and some access through satellite to international broadcast networks , but this could stop if electricity goes away or more infrastructure is targeted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roads and bridges have been destroyed , making it difficult to flee there are reports of people trying to flee lebanon .
have you seen people trying to leave the area ? people are moving from one area to another .
lebanon is still under a blockade from the sea and the air .
at first some people could flee the country through syria , but now this is more and more difficult because the air bombings are targeting the main roads and main bridges .
what we are witnessing is a transfer of the population from one area to another , and this is done on purpose .
i think one of the aims of the operation is to push the population towards an area to create psychological and popular pressure on the hezbollah leadership to comply with the ceasefire conditions . what do you think is the motivation behind the bombing ? i think it started with the single objective of freeing the two soldiers who were captured , but now more and more we see there are signs to put in place a new equation that is more in favor of israelis ' security and for the security of their northern frontiers . it is true that it is a reaction to an operation that was led by hezbollah , but it seems clear that it was planned beforehand and that the objective is to come up with a new balance of power that is more favorable to the israelis and secures their borders . what do you think are the chances that violence could spread to syria ? it is my personal analysis , but i can not believe that israel today is capable of opening three fronts at the same time .
they have a war still going on in gaza , and they have been kind of forced to open another front in lebanon , and i hardly believe that they are willing to open a third front in syria . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fear violence could spread beyond lebanon and gaza what do you think are the chances of a ceasefire ? for the time being , zero . i believe that the peak of violence has not been reached yet .
this could take two or three more days . what do you think will happen when the peak of violence is reached ? there is a general feeling you can sense among international institutions that they are waiting for some radical changes on the ground .
such as israel succeeding in putting into place a buffer zone at the border . it will be drastic change either in the internal public opinion or in terms of international pressure to say , " listen guys , you have to do this . " what international organizations do you think need to increase pressure to bring about a ceasefire ? i think the pressure started with a call from the un and tony blair that they are ready to send an international force to the border between israel and lebanon .

i think one of the aims of the operation is to push the population towards an area to create psychological and popular pressure on the hezbollah leadership to comply with the ceasefire conditions . what do you think is the motivation behind the bombing ? i think it started with the single objective of freeing the two soldiers who were captured , but now more and more we see there are signs to put in place a new equation that is more in favor of israelis ' security and for the security of their northern frontiers . it is true that it is a reaction to an operation that was led by hezbollah , but it seems clear that it was planned beforehand and that the objective is to come up with a new balance of power that is more favorable to the israelis and secures their borders . what do you think are the chances that violence could spread to syria ? it is my personal analysis , but i can not believe that israel today is capable of opening three fronts at the same time .

at first , not a lot of them agree with the operation and how hezbollah started with such an adventure , knowing what the reaction from the israelis would be .
at the end of the day , these people , the lebanese people , are paying the price of the war . however , every day that the bombing continues , people are more and more shocked and horrified by the magnitude of the reaction .
they are seeing their houses destroyed and their businesses closed and their people transferred from one region to another .
because of all the suffering they are witnessing , they can not accept to live with what is happening . what are the people most concerned about at the moment ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people are concerned violence may continue for months they are concerned that things could get worse .
that more people will be transferred from the south and that electricity plants could be the next target .
up to now the electricity plants have been avoided , which was not the case in 1996 .
but if the situation gets worse , i 'm afraid this could be the next target .
people are afraid the situation will continue for weeks or months .
lebanon does not have the capability to stand such a long war . how much of everyday life is still continuing ? it depends on the area .
in some areas that have been avoided , where there is not a massive presence of hezbollah , they are witnessing very timid activity .
however , all the bridges and main roads that connect one region to another have been systematically targeted by the bombing over the last few days .
regions are cut off from each other , which freezes the all economic activity .
what remains is a very local activity in the regions that are not the primary target of the bombing . do you have access to necessities like food and water ? it also depends on the region .

" i am convinced that now is the time for us to make a political decision , whatever it might be , " brazilian president luis ignacio lula da silva said after a early monday meeting with us president george w. bush , where he urged a redoubling of efforts to break the trade impasse .
" we can not leave it in the hands of our negotiators only . " the elusive agreement , which has been under discussion for five years , has repeatedly stalled on issues such as how much the us will cut its farm subsidies , how far the european union will go in reducing its tariffs on farm imports and the readiness of developing countries to significantly reduce barriers to industrial and service products . on monday , trade representatives from the eu , the us , brazil , india , japan and australia are heading to world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- headquarters in geneva to continue talks .

the us president 's power to " fast track " trade deals without a vote in congress expires at the middle of next year . energy divisions on the issue of energy , g8 leaders were not able to come to agreement in several areas . one major point of contention in the area of energy security has been russia 's refusal to ratify the energy charter treaty , which governs energy investment and transit issues in europe , russia and other countries .

the us president 's power to " fast track " trade deals without a vote in congress expires at the middle of next year . energy divisions on the issue of energy , g8 leaders were not able to come to agreement in several areas . one major point of contention in the area of energy security has been russia 's refusal to ratify the energy charter treaty , which governs energy investment and transit issues in europe , russia and other countries .
while russia agreed in principle to open and transparent energy markets , it did not agree to ratify the charter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : going electric : presidents putin and bush , condoleezza rice and russian defense minister ivanov are n't burning fossil fuels here europeans have pressed hard at previous g8 meetings for russia to ratify the treaty , but the energy security statement on sunday was limited to a vague affirmation of the document 's free-market principles . divisions over the use of nuclear energy , an increasingly important issue as the west seeks alternatives to oil and gas , and the kyoto protocol , which the us has refused to sign , were also clearly reflected in the g8 energy security statement sunday . " we recognize that g8 members pursue different ways to achieve energy security and the goals of climate protection , " the statement 's section on nuclear power begins , basically agreeing to disagree . democracy discussion leaders at the summit met on sunday night for a dinner during which they had " a frank discussion " with russian president vladimir putin over his country 's democratic development , according to a diplomat there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters on sunday in st. petersburg , defying a ban on unapproved protests critics of putin in russia and in the west often say his six years in power have been marked by a clampdown on the mass media , decreasing toleration for dissent and a centralization of power in the kremlin .
some have gone so far as to say that russia is not ready for a full place at the g8 table . the diplomat told reuters that at the dinner , putin gave an account of developments inside russia .
in such situations , putin has in the past said that democracy is developing in russia according to the country 's own culture , history and traditions . putin did take the opportunity to assure colleagues he would not change the russian constitution to seek a third term in office as some had feared . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g8 demands end to israeli assaults , militant attacks g8 leaders have called for " an end to israeli military operations " in the middle east and a halt to the shelling by militants of israeli territory after struggling to come up with a unified response to the crisis .

of that total , 1.8 billion will come from eumetsat , the organization that operates europe 's system of meteorological satellites .
most of the remainder will be provided by the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- . the esa says the metop satellites promise " data of unprecedented accuracy and resolution on a host of different variables , such as temperature and humidity , wind speed and direction over the ocean , ozone and trace gases . " that will make " a huge contribution to global weather forecasting and climate monitoring capabilities , " it said . being able to predict the weather reliably can help mitigate the effects of extreme weather conditions - which appear to be on the increase - and therefore save lives . complementary systems the large metop-a satellite - 17.6 meters -lrb- 58 feet -rrb- long once its power-producing solar panels are deployed - is designed to complement eumetsat 's meteosat satellites , which have been beaming weather data back to earth since 1978 . meteosats circle the earth above the equator at very high altitude - 36,000 kilometers -lrb- 22,000 miles -rrb- - and in geostationary orbit .
they afford scientists a wide-angle view of the earth but are unable to see certain portions of the planet . bildunterschrift : a map measuring changes in water temperature in the pacific ocean during 1997 's hurricane " el nino " by contrast , the metops will orbit at just 800-850 kilometers -lrb- 500-525 miles -rrb- over the earth , overflying the north and south poles 14 times every 24 hours .
thanks to the tilting of the earth 's own orbit , they will cover a different slice of the planet every time . " the two systems are complementary because there are lots of measurements that ca n't be done in geostationary orbit , " explained marc cohen , metop program manager at eumetsat . the launch of metop will also mark the start of cooperation between europe and the us national oceanic and atmospheric administration -lrb- noaa -rrb- .
the european and us satellites will operate in complementary orbits to give maximum coverage , with the metop giving morning information and its us counterpart data collected in the afternoon . until the launch of metop , only the us was able to provide the kind of data that polar-orbiting satellites gather . extreme weather the prime use of the metop satellites , the first of which will travel into space aboard a russian soyuz rocket , lies in its instruments , five of which are new european instruments .
these will provide high-resolution images , temperature and humidity measurements , and monitor both ozone levels and ocean winds . the other instruments are provided by noaa and france 's centre national d 'etudes spatiales -lrb- cnes -rrb- . the most sophisticated of all is the infrared atmospheric sounding interferometer -lrb- iasi -rrb- , which esa says should offer meteorologists data " of unprecedented accuracy and resolution on atmospheric temperature and humidity , with which to improve weather prediction . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : extreme weather incidents are on the rise the launch of metop is particularly timely given the apparent increase in extreme weather conditions , from devastating droughts in africa and floods in europe to hurricane katrina and the asian tsunami .
on monday , a tsunami hit the coast of java after an earthquake in the pacific ocean . data from metop may also help settle some of the raging debates on climate change , at a time of warnings from conservationists that the arctic ice cap is melting so fast that polar bears may disappear from the wild this century . the launch of metop-a , scheduled for 18:28 central european time -lrb- 16:28 gmt -rrb- on july 17 , will be broadcasted live on eumetsat 's web site . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european space agency launches competition for us europe congratulated itself wednesday with the launch of the first test satellite of the galileo navigation system , designed to rival the us system and put global positioning into civilian hands .

an eads spokesman said that the plane 's industrial launch , or the start of a350 production , could be expected in the " next months . "
meanwhile , the cost of developing the mid-sized jet could more than double to about $ 10.0 billion -lrb- 7.9 billion euros -rrb- , thomas enders , co-chief executive of airbus ' parent company eads -lrb- european aeronautics defence and space company -rrb- , said sunday , confirming recent media reports .
the original cost had been put at an estimated $ 4 billion .
enders was speaking during a weekend seminar held by eads in bath , southwest england , ahead of the week-long farnborough airshow .
german boss admits errors go back years earlier , in an interview with a german newspaper enders also admitted that errors in the construction of the airbus a380 super jumbo passenger jet go back several years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enders said there were problems with the a380 production in hamburg " we made errors in the construction of the a380 , we need more time -lrb- for work -rrb- on the electrical system , " enders told the daily bild on saturday .
" the errors were made several years ago . "
the german co-chief of eads , the parent company of toulouse-based airbus , said the problem with the a380 was mainly at the hamburg factory where the passenger cabin 's electrical system is installed .
but he added that the hamburg facility " is only one part of the production chain " and that he did not want to blame any particular person .
the shock announcement last month of delivery delays for the 555-seat a380 sparked a leadership crisis at eads , which resulted in the departure of enders ' former co-chairman noel forgeard , who has been replaced by frenchman louis gallois .
enders said in 2007 airbus would deliver nine a380s , the world 's largest commercial airliner , but he could not promise that there would not be new delays in delivery " even with the best will in the world . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the a380 , the world 's largest commercial airliner , at an air show in berlin " we have a problem finding enough qualified personnel , and we have more than 2,000 planes on order for the next few years , " he said .
building trust gallois acknowledged that eads needed to rebuild trust after its recent management crisis caused by delays to the airbus a380 super jumbo .
" disclosure and trust is clear , it is our mandate .
we have clearly to rebuild trust and confidence from our shareholders , " gallois said in farnborough .
gallois replaced frenchman noel forgeard .
the latter had been under intense pressure to quit since it was revealed he sold eads shares worth millions of euros nearly three months before the group had on june 13 announced delays to the a380 .
the wide-body a350 , which in its current design can carry between 250 and 300 passengers , is being overhauled to make it bigger and more fuel efficient .
some analysts believe it will re-emerge as the a370 and could see an enlarged fuselage .

an eads spokesman said that the plane 's industrial launch , or the start of a350 production , could be expected in the " next months . "
meanwhile , the cost of developing the mid-sized jet could more than double to about $ 10.0 billion -lrb- 7.9 billion euros -rrb- , thomas enders , co-chief executive of airbus ' parent company eads -lrb- european aeronautics defence and space company -rrb- , said sunday , confirming recent media reports .
the original cost had been put at an estimated $ 4 billion .
enders was speaking during a weekend seminar held by eads in bath , southwest england , ahead of the week-long farnborough airshow .
german boss admits errors go back years earlier , in an interview with a german newspaper enders also admitted that errors in the construction of the airbus a380 super jumbo passenger jet go back several years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enders said there were problems with the a380 production in hamburg " we made errors in the construction of the a380 , we need more time -lrb- for work -rrb- on the electrical system , " enders told the daily bild on saturday .
" the errors were made several years ago . "
the german co-chief of eads , the parent company of toulouse-based airbus , said the problem with the a380 was mainly at the hamburg factory where the passenger cabin 's electrical system is installed .
but he added that the hamburg facility " is only one part of the production chain " and that he did not want to blame any particular person .
the shock announcement last month of delivery delays for the 555-seat a380 sparked a leadership crisis at eads , which resulted in the departure of enders ' former co-chairman noel forgeard , who has been replaced by frenchman louis gallois .
enders said in 2007 airbus would deliver nine a380s , the world 's largest commercial airliner , but he could not promise that there would not be new delays in delivery " even with the best will in the world . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the a380 , the world 's largest commercial airliner , at an air show in berlin " we have a problem finding enough qualified personnel , and we have more than 2,000 planes on order for the next few years , " he said .
building trust gallois acknowledged that eads needed to rebuild trust after its recent management crisis caused by delays to the airbus a380 super jumbo .
" disclosure and trust is clear , it is our mandate .
we have clearly to rebuild trust and confidence from our shareholders , " gallois said in farnborough .
gallois replaced frenchman noel forgeard .
the latter had been under intense pressure to quit since it was revealed he sold eads shares worth millions of euros nearly three months before the group had on june 13 announced delays to the a380 .
the wide-body a350 , which in its current design can carry between 250 and 300 passengers , is being overhauled to make it bigger and more fuel efficient .
some analysts believe it will re-emerge as the a370 and could see an enlarged fuselage .
us aircraft giant boeing is winning the race in the long-haul market with the 787 , which is being marketed to airlines as a fuel efficient , medium-sized jet .
meanwhile streiff , who is french , was named head of airbus earlier this month .
he replaced the german gustav humbert , who resigned after airbus announced it had run into manufacturing problems with its a380 super jumbo jet that would delay deliveries of the world 's largest passenger aircraft .
news of the delays saw 5.5 billion euros briefly wiped off the market value of eads , which owns 80 percent of airbus .
restoring eads ' image eads ' finances are set to take a further financial hit in the coming months owing to the increased spending on the a350 and penalties it must pay customers for delayed deliveries of the a380 , which is set to enter service in 2007 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eads is facing bad news on the financial front the company could be forced soon also to pay 2.75 billion euros for the 20 percent of airbus it does not own .

enders told journalists in bath that the management crisis was over .
but he added : " undoubtedly the reputation of this company has suffered , so has the confidence of customers and investors .

an eads spokesman said that the plane 's industrial launch , or the start of a350 production , could be expected in the " next months . "
meanwhile , the cost of developing the mid-sized jet could more than double to about $ 10.0 billion -lrb- 7.9 billion euros -rrb- , thomas enders , co-chief executive of airbus ' parent company eads -lrb- european aeronautics defence and space company -rrb- , said sunday , confirming recent media reports .
the original cost had been put at an estimated $ 4 billion .
enders was speaking during a weekend seminar held by eads in bath , southwest england , ahead of the week-long farnborough airshow .
german boss admits errors go back years earlier , in an interview with a german newspaper enders also admitted that errors in the construction of the airbus a380 super jumbo passenger jet go back several years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enders said there were problems with the a380 production in hamburg " we made errors in the construction of the a380 , we need more time -lrb- for work -rrb- on the electrical system , " enders told the daily bild on saturday .
" the errors were made several years ago . "
the german co-chief of eads , the parent company of toulouse-based airbus , said the problem with the a380 was mainly at the hamburg factory where the passenger cabin 's electrical system is installed .
but he added that the hamburg facility " is only one part of the production chain " and that he did not want to blame any particular person .
the shock announcement last month of delivery delays for the 555-seat a380 sparked a leadership crisis at eads , which resulted in the departure of enders ' former co-chairman noel forgeard , who has been replaced by frenchman louis gallois .
enders said in 2007 airbus would deliver nine a380s , the world 's largest commercial airliner , but he could not promise that there would not be new delays in delivery " even with the best will in the world . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the a380 , the world 's largest commercial airliner , at an air show in berlin " we have a problem finding enough qualified personnel , and we have more than 2,000 planes on order for the next few years , " he said .
building trust gallois acknowledged that eads needed to rebuild trust after its recent management crisis caused by delays to the airbus a380 super jumbo .
" disclosure and trust is clear , it is our mandate .
we have clearly to rebuild trust and confidence from our shareholders , " gallois said in farnborough .
gallois replaced frenchman noel forgeard .
the latter had been under intense pressure to quit since it was revealed he sold eads shares worth millions of euros nearly three months before the group had on june 13 announced delays to the a380 .
the wide-body a350 , which in its current design can carry between 250 and 300 passengers , is being overhauled to make it bigger and more fuel efficient .
some analysts believe it will re-emerge as the a370 and could see an enlarged fuselage .
us aircraft giant boeing is winning the race in the long-haul market with the 787 , which is being marketed to airlines as a fuel efficient , medium-sized jet .
meanwhile streiff , who is french , was named head of airbus earlier this month .
he replaced the german gustav humbert , who resigned after airbus announced it had run into manufacturing problems with its a380 super jumbo jet that would delay deliveries of the world 's largest passenger aircraft .
news of the delays saw 5.5 billion euros briefly wiped off the market value of eads , which owns 80 percent of airbus .
restoring eads ' image eads ' finances are set to take a further financial hit in the coming months owing to the increased spending on the a350 and penalties it must pay customers for delayed deliveries of the a380 , which is set to enter service in 2007 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eads is facing bad news on the financial front the company could be forced soon also to pay 2.75 billion euros for the 20 percent of airbus it does not own .
bae systems has served eads with a formal notice permitting the british group to exercise an option to sell eads its 20-percent stake in airbus .
enders told journalists in bath that the management crisis was over .
but he added : " undoubtedly the reputation of this company has suffered , so has the confidence of customers and investors .
the project that triggered this crisis , the a380 , needs to be fixed . "
following the a380 debacle , gallois told journalists that his first task was to help restore the reputation of eads " to the highest standard .

" i am convinced that now is the time for us to make a political decision , whatever it might be , " brazilian president luis ignacio lula da silva said after a early monday meeting with us president george w. bush , where he urged a redoubling of efforts to break the trade impasse .
" we can not leave it in the hands of our negotiators only . " the elusive agreement , which has been under discussion for five years , has repeatedly stalled on issues such as how much the us will cut its farm subsidies , how far the european union will go in reducing its tariffs on farm imports and the readiness of developing countries to significantly reduce barriers to industrial and service products . on monday , trade representatives from the eu , the us , brazil , india , japan and australia are heading to world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- headquarters in geneva to continue talks .

the death toll has climbed to over 160 , with civilians bearing the brunt of the conflict . " the un needs time and space to make sure we have the troops - well-trained , well-equipped troops - to go in quite quickly , " annan said .
" the sooner decisions are taken by the -lrb- un -rrb- security council , the better it is . " annan said a team of un officials in the crisis region would report to the security council by the end of the week .
he urged countries not to delay sending troops for the planned middle east peace operation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annan with german chancellor merkel and eu commission president barroso at the g8 summit annan , however , gave no indication of the number of troops required , nor any deadlines for the deployment . merkel , chirac welcome idea annan 's proposal has been largely welcomed by g8 leaders . german chancellor angela merkel said the g8 was determined to strengthen lebanon 's central government as part of efforts to end hezbollah rocket attacks on israel . " i think it make sense to have such a force based there , " merkel said , adding that she envisaged expanding the current un operation in southern lebanon . some 1,991 un soldiers have been based in lebanon since 1978 .
called unifil , the force has patrolled the hilly roads bordering on israel in its white vehicles but proved powerless to rein in guerrillas or stem israeli retaliation . the force proved ineffective when israel invaded lebanon in 1982 to flush out palestinian fighters who had attacked its northern border settlements .
unifil 's mandate was to verify an israeli withdrawal , restore international peace and security , and assist the government of lebanon " in ensuring the return of its effective authority in the area . " french president jacques chirac also backed the idea of a new force in lebanon and called for setting up a surveillance border along the israeli-lebanese border . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a flattened apartment building in beirut " we can not allow things to go on as they are .
we have to have a means of repression and surveillance , " chirac said . he added that the force 's mandate should include disarming hezbollah militias who have been launching rocket attacks on israel . blair : force should have more bite finland , which currently heads the european union presidency , also said the eu and its member states would be ready to participate in a un peacekeeping force for lebanon .
but it stressed that such a force is only an idea for the moment . british prime minister tony blair also appeared to back the idea of an international force .
blair said monday that the proposed force must have more bite and " far greater " numbers than the current un observer mission already there . " the mission will have to be far more specific and clearer , and the force employed will have to be far greater , " blair told reporters , adding however that it would " take time " for it to deploy . european external affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner called the notion of a temporary buffer force an " interesting proposal . " us , israel not convinced however , many doubt whether sending a new force to the region could halt the current violence . the united states was cautious , saying it wanted to hear the recommendations of a un fact-finding mission and israel dismissed talk of a multilateral security presence as premature . meanwhile , intense diplomacy aimed at ending the bloodshed is under way with france 's prime minister dominique de villepin flying to beirut shortly after a visit by the european union 's chief diplomat , javier solana , to the lebanese capital . the un security council also picked up talks from saturday when it failed to reach agreement on a call for a ceasefire between israel and hezbollah . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu renews call for restraint in middle east european union foreign ministers are scrambling to find diplomatic solutions to halt the fighting between israel and hezbollah , as the escalating crisis risks setting the middle east aflame .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.07.2006 g8 leaders end summit with focus on trade großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monday 's talk in the tsarist-era palace was all about trade the leaders of the group of eight ended their three-day summit in russia with a push to salvage global free-trade talks that are teetering on the verge of collapse . despite differences in other areas , the world 's leading industrial powers presented a unified front on monday in an attempt to move forward stalled global trade talks , which aim to reduce barriers to world trade . presidents and prime ministers from the group of eight industralized countries invited heads of state from brazil , china , india , mexico and south africa to the table in st. petersburg to breathe new life into the so-called doha round of trade negotiations and spur movement from entrenched positions . " i am convinced that now is the time for us to make a political decision , whatever it might be , " brazilian president luis ignacio lula da silva said after a early monday meeting with us president george w. bush , where he urged a redoubling of efforts to break the trade impasse .
" we can not leave it in the hands of our negotiators only . " the elusive agreement , which has been under discussion for five years , has repeatedly stalled on issues such as how much the us will cut its farm subsidies , how far the european union will go in reducing its tariffs on farm imports and the readiness of developing countries to significantly reduce barriers to industrial and service products . on monday , trade representatives from the eu , the us , brazil , india , japan and australia are heading to world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- headquarters in geneva to continue talks .
eu trade commissioner peter mandelson was also ready to head to geneva on monday night . " we do not have the luxury of postponing this any longer , " mandelson said in brussels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pascal lamy has his work cut out for him over the next four weeks on sunday , g8 leaders agreed that they would ask wto leader pascal lamy to broker a compromise within the next four weeks . " we gave a mandate to our respective negotiators to come to an agreement on modalities within one month , " said eu commission president jose manuel barosso . if no breakthrough comes in the new few weeks , analysts say the entire round could be put on ice for several years .
the us president 's power to " fast track " trade deals without a vote in congress expires at the middle of next year . energy divisions on the issue of energy , g8 leaders were not able to come to agreement in several areas . one major point of contention in the area of energy security has been russia 's refusal to ratify the energy charter treaty , which governs energy investment and transit issues in europe , russia and other countries .
while russia agreed in principle to open and transparent energy markets , it did not agree to ratify the charter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : going electric : presidents putin and bush , condoleezza rice and russian defense minister ivanov are n't burning fossil fuels here europeans have pressed hard at previous g8 meetings for russia to ratify the treaty , but the energy security statement on sunday was limited to a vague affirmation of the document 's free-market principles . divisions over the use of nuclear energy , an increasingly important issue as the west seeks alternatives to oil and gas , and the kyoto protocol , which the us has refused to sign , were also clearly reflected in the g8 energy security statement sunday . " we recognize that g8 members pursue different ways to achieve energy security and the goals of climate protection , " the statement 's section on nuclear power begins , basically agreeing to disagree . democracy discussion leaders at the summit met on sunday night for a dinner during which they had " a frank discussion " with russian president vladimir putin over his country 's democratic development , according to a diplomat there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters on sunday in st. petersburg , defying a ban on unapproved protests critics of putin in russia and in the west often say his six years in power have been marked by a clampdown on the mass media , decreasing toleration for dissent and a centralization of power in the kremlin .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus on business european commission proposes air fare transparency rules high priced raw materials make recycled rubbish attractive major management shake-up at bmw german family firm fights off tourism giants business -pipe- 17.07.2006 airbus to unveil new a350 plane design großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus has had a turbulent time with the a350 admitting that the cost of developing its troubled a350 will more than double , european group airbus will on monday disclose new design plans for the plane at an air show near london . airbus will unveil new plans for the a350 , which it launched in 2005 as a direct rival to boeing 's 787 dreamliner but which has been poorly received by potential customers , at the farnborough near london on monday .
an eads spokesman said that the plane 's industrial launch , or the start of a350 production , could be expected in the " next months . "
meanwhile , the cost of developing the mid-sized jet could more than double to about $ 10.0 billion -lrb- 7.9 billion euros -rrb- , thomas enders , co-chief executive of airbus ' parent company eads -lrb- european aeronautics defence and space company -rrb- , said sunday , confirming recent media reports .
the original cost had been put at an estimated $ 4 billion .
enders was speaking during a weekend seminar held by eads in bath , southwest england , ahead of the week-long farnborough airshow .
german boss admits errors go back years earlier , in an interview with a german newspaper enders also admitted that errors in the construction of the airbus a380 super jumbo passenger jet go back several years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enders said there were problems with the a380 production in hamburg " we made errors in the construction of the a380 , we need more time -lrb- for work -rrb- on the electrical system , " enders told the daily bild on saturday .
" the errors were made several years ago . "
the german co-chief of eads , the parent company of toulouse-based airbus , said the problem with the a380 was mainly at the hamburg factory where the passenger cabin 's electrical system is installed .
but he added that the hamburg facility " is only one part of the production chain " and that he did not want to blame any particular person .
the shock announcement last month of delivery delays for the 555-seat a380 sparked a leadership crisis at eads , which resulted in the departure of enders ' former co-chairman noel forgeard , who has been replaced by frenchman louis gallois .
enders said in 2007 airbus would deliver nine a380s , the world 's largest commercial airliner , but he could not promise that there would not be new delays in delivery " even with the best will in the world . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the a380 , the world 's largest commercial airliner , at an air show in berlin " we have a problem finding enough qualified personnel , and we have more than 2,000 planes on order for the next few years , " he said .
building trust gallois acknowledged that eads needed to rebuild trust after its recent management crisis caused by delays to the airbus a380 super jumbo .
" disclosure and trust is clear , it is our mandate .
we have clearly to rebuild trust and confidence from our shareholders , " gallois said in farnborough .
gallois replaced frenchman noel forgeard .
the latter had been under intense pressure to quit since it was revealed he sold eads shares worth millions of euros nearly three months before the group had on june 13 announced delays to the a380 .
the wide-body a350 , which in its current design can carry between 250 and 300 passengers , is being overhauled to make it bigger and more fuel efficient .
some analysts believe it will re-emerge as the a370 and could see an enlarged fuselage .
us aircraft giant boeing is winning the race in the long-haul market with the 787 , which is being marketed to airlines as a fuel efficient , medium-sized jet .
meanwhile streiff , who is french , was named head of airbus earlier this month .
he replaced the german gustav humbert , who resigned after airbus announced it had run into manufacturing problems with its a380 super jumbo jet that would delay deliveries of the world 's largest passenger aircraft .
news of the delays saw 5.5 billion euros briefly wiped off the market value of eads , which owns 80 percent of airbus .
restoring eads ' image eads ' finances are set to take a further financial hit in the coming months owing to the increased spending on the a350 and penalties it must pay customers for delayed deliveries of the a380 , which is set to enter service in 2007 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eads is facing bad news on the financial front the company could be forced soon also to pay 2.75 billion euros for the 20 percent of airbus it does not own .
bae systems has served eads with a formal notice permitting the british group to exercise an option to sell eads its 20-percent stake in airbus .
enders told journalists in bath that the management crisis was over .
but he added : " undoubtedly the reputation of this company has suffered , so has the confidence of customers and investors .
the project that triggered this crisis , the a380 , needs to be fixed . "
following the a380 debacle , gallois told journalists that his first task was to help restore the reputation of eads " to the highest standard .

at first , not a lot of them agree with the operation and how hezbollah started with such an adventure , knowing what the reaction from the israelis would be .
at the end of the day , these people , the lebanese people , are paying the price of the war . however , every day that the bombing continues , people are more and more shocked and horrified by the magnitude of the reaction .
they are seeing their houses destroyed and their businesses closed and their people transferred from one region to another .
because of all the suffering they are witnessing , they can not accept to live with what is happening . what are the people most concerned about at the moment ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people are concerned violence may continue for months they are concerned that things could get worse .
that more people will be transferred from the south and that electricity plants could be the next target .
up to now the electricity plants have been avoided , which was not the case in 1996 .
but if the situation gets worse , i 'm afraid this could be the next target .
people are afraid the situation will continue for weeks or months .
lebanon does not have the capability to stand such a long war . how much of everyday life is still continuing ? it depends on the area .
in some areas that have been avoided , where there is not a massive presence of hezbollah , they are witnessing very timid activity .
however , all the bridges and main roads that connect one region to another have been systematically targeted by the bombing over the last few days .
regions are cut off from each other , which freezes the all economic activity .
what remains is a very local activity in the regions that are not the primary target of the bombing . do you have access to necessities like food and water ? it also depends on the region .
some regions , like in the southern part of beirut are completely devastated .
they are receiving aid and help from other regions .
here you can witness solidarity between lebanese across religions and communities to help each other , even though they do n't agree on the political level about what is happening .
despite the fact that they had , or still have , disagreements about the role and nature of the resistance .
among the population , you can see signs of solidarity among the people . do you have any access to information about what is happening around you ? we still have some access to the internet and some access through satellite to international broadcast networks , but this could stop if electricity goes away or more infrastructure is targeted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roads and bridges have been destroyed , making it difficult to flee there are reports of people trying to flee lebanon .
have you seen people trying to leave the area ? people are moving from one area to another .
lebanon is still under a blockade from the sea and the air .
at first some people could flee the country through syria , but now this is more and more difficult because the air bombings are targeting the main roads and main bridges .
what we are witnessing is a transfer of the population from one area to another , and this is done on purpose .
i think one of the aims of the operation is to push the population towards an area to create psychological and popular pressure on the hezbollah leadership to comply with the ceasefire conditions . what do you think is the motivation behind the bombing ? i think it started with the single objective of freeing the two soldiers who were captured , but now more and more we see there are signs to put in place a new equation that is more in favor of israelis ' security and for the security of their northern frontiers . it is true that it is a reaction to an operation that was led by hezbollah , but it seems clear that it was planned beforehand and that the objective is to come up with a new balance of power that is more favorable to the israelis and secures their borders . what do you think are the chances that violence could spread to syria ? it is my personal analysis , but i can not believe that israel today is capable of opening three fronts at the same time .
they have a war still going on in gaza , and they have been kind of forced to open another front in lebanon , and i hardly believe that they are willing to open a third front in syria . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fear violence could spread beyond lebanon and gaza what do you think are the chances of a ceasefire ? for the time being , zero . i believe that the peak of violence has not been reached yet .
this could take two or three more days . what do you think will happen when the peak of violence is reached ? there is a general feeling you can sense among international institutions that they are waiting for some radical changes on the ground .
such as israel succeeding in putting into place a buffer zone at the border . it will be drastic change either in the internal public opinion or in terms of international pressure to say , " listen guys , you have to do this . " what international organizations do you think need to increase pressure to bring about a ceasefire ? i think the pressure started with a call from the un and tony blair that they are ready to send an international force to the border between israel and lebanon .

at first , not a lot of them agree with the operation and how hezbollah started with such an adventure , knowing what the reaction from the israelis would be .
at the end of the day , these people , the lebanese people , are paying the price of the war . however , every day that the bombing continues , people are more and more shocked and horrified by the magnitude of the reaction .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.07.2006 europe launches satellite to boost climate research großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a computer simluation of the advanced weather satellite the most complex earth observation satellite ever to be placed into orbit is to be launched monday as part of a 15-year program to improve the accuracy of weather forecasting and our understanding of climate change . the first of three huge polar-orbiting metop -lrb- meteorological operational -rrb- satellites is to be fired into space on monday from russia 's baikonur cosmodrome in kazakhstan . metop-a , weighing more than four tons , is the most complex satellite of its kind , boasting around a dozen instruments for measuring weather patterns and transmitting back data . it will be the first of three metop satellites to be launched roughly five years apart over the coming years at a cost of 2.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- .
of that total , 1.8 billion will come from eumetsat , the organization that operates europe 's system of meteorological satellites .
most of the remainder will be provided by the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- . the esa says the metop satellites promise " data of unprecedented accuracy and resolution on a host of different variables , such as temperature and humidity , wind speed and direction over the ocean , ozone and trace gases . " that will make " a huge contribution to global weather forecasting and climate monitoring capabilities , " it said . being able to predict the weather reliably can help mitigate the effects of extreme weather conditions - which appear to be on the increase - and therefore save lives . complementary systems the large metop-a satellite - 17.6 meters -lrb- 58 feet -rrb- long once its power-producing solar panels are deployed - is designed to complement eumetsat 's meteosat satellites , which have been beaming weather data back to earth since 1978 . meteosats circle the earth above the equator at very high altitude - 36,000 kilometers -lrb- 22,000 miles -rrb- - and in geostationary orbit .
they afford scientists a wide-angle view of the earth but are unable to see certain portions of the planet . bildunterschrift : a map measuring changes in water temperature in the pacific ocean during 1997 's hurricane " el nino " by contrast , the metops will orbit at just 800-850 kilometers -lrb- 500-525 miles -rrb- over the earth , overflying the north and south poles 14 times every 24 hours .
thanks to the tilting of the earth 's own orbit , they will cover a different slice of the planet every time . " the two systems are complementary because there are lots of measurements that ca n't be done in geostationary orbit , " explained marc cohen , metop program manager at eumetsat . the launch of metop will also mark the start of cooperation between europe and the us national oceanic and atmospheric administration -lrb- noaa -rrb- .
the european and us satellites will operate in complementary orbits to give maximum coverage , with the metop giving morning information and its us counterpart data collected in the afternoon . until the launch of metop , only the us was able to provide the kind of data that polar-orbiting satellites gather . extreme weather the prime use of the metop satellites , the first of which will travel into space aboard a russian soyuz rocket , lies in its instruments , five of which are new european instruments .
these will provide high-resolution images , temperature and humidity measurements , and monitor both ozone levels and ocean winds . the other instruments are provided by noaa and france 's centre national d 'etudes spatiales -lrb- cnes -rrb- . the most sophisticated of all is the infrared atmospheric sounding interferometer -lrb- iasi -rrb- , which esa says should offer meteorologists data " of unprecedented accuracy and resolution on atmospheric temperature and humidity , with which to improve weather prediction . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : extreme weather incidents are on the rise the launch of metop is particularly timely given the apparent increase in extreme weather conditions , from devastating droughts in africa and floods in europe to hurricane katrina and the asian tsunami .
on monday , a tsunami hit the coast of java after an earthquake in the pacific ocean . data from metop may also help settle some of the raging debates on climate change , at a time of warnings from conservationists that the arctic ice cap is melting so fast that polar bears may disappear from the wild this century . the launch of metop-a , scheduled for 18:28 central european time -lrb- 16:28 gmt -rrb- on july 17 , will be broadcasted live on eumetsat 's web site . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european space agency launches competition for us europe congratulated itself wednesday with the launch of the first test satellite of the galileo navigation system , designed to rival the us system and put global positioning into civilian hands .

" the festival is getting bigger and bigger , " indian director and prolific film music composer naresh sharma told the afp news agency .
" people are really interested in indian film . " this year , the event drew 7,500 visitors , a thousand more than in 2005 , but below the 10,000 expected . the audience is a mixture of devotees who avidly follow the careers of their favorite stars such as actress aishwarya rai , and industry players who come to look at the latest offerings from the world 's second biggest cinema industry after hollywood . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : love plays the lead role in many bollywood productions bollywood 's two european camps " on the one hand you have those who know the names of all the indian actors , and on the other hand those who want to keep up do date with bollywood , " program director wiebke reiss said . the german festival program did its best to cater to both groups . in four days , some 100 films were shown , ranging from the next big features and a large number of documentaries to short horror films and a retrospective of the works of raj kapoor , an indian cinema idol of the 1950s . women came dressed in flowing silk saris and traditional jewelery as thousands of filmgoers sampled the spicy punjabi and gujurati cuisine on offer at a bazaar set up for the festival . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bollywood is becoming a regular feature on german television goal is to find new german viewers but weiss said the idea was also to convert those who believed that indian cinema had little more to offer than curry westerns or kitschy dramas , often up to three hours long , where love plays the lead role and characters regularly burst into song and dance . these films - big on sentiment but coy about sex - have found a following well beyond india , notably in the arab world where they pose far fewer problems for the censors than standard hollywood fare . german television channels have warmed up to the charm of indian cinema , with the cable channel rtl ii snapping up a number of titles .

" we still need to make european distributors aware of indian films and convince them that these works can win the hearts of the public here . " she singled out " mixed doubles " by director rajat kapoor as a film with a universal theme that could do well in germany .
it deals with the difficulty of keeping the passion alive after 10 years of marriage . the organizers plan to keep expanding the festival .

" we ca n't just sit here with our arms crossed , " said miguel angel moratinos , a former eu envoy to the middle east .
" this circle of violence , which could lead to an irreversible situation , can not continue . " " now it is the time for restraint and time for thinking very clearly and deeply about losing control of an already dangerous situation , " added swedish foreign minister jan eliasson .

i ca n't say we can be very optimistic , but i hope reason will prevail . " the two-page g8 statement called on " extremists " to immediately halt their attacks while underlining that it was " critical that israel , while exercizing the right to defend itself , be mindful of the strategic and humanitarian consequences of its actions . "
g8 countries set out four conditions that must be met by all sides : the return of israeli soldiers in gaza and lebanon unharmed ; an end to the shelling of israeli territory ; an end to israeli military operations and the early withdrawal of israeli forces from gaza ; the release of arrested palestinian ministers and parliamentarians .
they also said the united nations should study the possible deployment of an international security force in the region .

an eads spokesman said that the plane 's industrial launch , or the start of a350 production , could be expected in the " next months . "
meanwhile , the cost of developing the mid-sized jet could more than double to about $ 10.0 billion -lrb- 7.9 billion euros -rrb- , thomas enders , co-chief executive of airbus ' parent company eads -lrb- european aeronautics defence and space company -rrb- , said sunday , confirming recent media reports .
the original cost had been put at an estimated $ 4 billion .
enders was speaking during a weekend seminar held by eads in bath , southwest england , ahead of the week-long farnborough airshow .
german boss admits errors go back years earlier , in an interview with a german newspaper enders also admitted that errors in the construction of the airbus a380 super jumbo passenger jet go back several years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enders said there were problems with the a380 production in hamburg " we made errors in the construction of the a380 , we need more time -lrb- for work -rrb- on the electrical system , " enders told the daily bild on saturday .
" the errors were made several years ago . "
the german co-chief of eads , the parent company of toulouse-based airbus , said the problem with the a380 was mainly at the hamburg factory where the passenger cabin 's electrical system is installed .
but he added that the hamburg facility " is only one part of the production chain " and that he did not want to blame any particular person .
the shock announcement last month of delivery delays for the 555-seat a380 sparked a leadership crisis at eads , which resulted in the departure of enders ' former co-chairman noel forgeard , who has been replaced by frenchman louis gallois .
enders said in 2007 airbus would deliver nine a380s , the world 's largest commercial airliner , but he could not promise that there would not be new delays in delivery " even with the best will in the world . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the a380 , the world 's largest commercial airliner , at an air show in berlin " we have a problem finding enough qualified personnel , and we have more than 2,000 planes on order for the next few years , " he said .
building trust gallois acknowledged that eads needed to rebuild trust after its recent management crisis caused by delays to the airbus a380 super jumbo .
" disclosure and trust is clear , it is our mandate .
we have clearly to rebuild trust and confidence from our shareholders , " gallois said in farnborough .
gallois replaced frenchman noel forgeard .
the latter had been under intense pressure to quit since it was revealed he sold eads shares worth millions of euros nearly three months before the group had on june 13 announced delays to the a380 .
the wide-body a350 , which in its current design can carry between 250 and 300 passengers , is being overhauled to make it bigger and more fuel efficient .
some analysts believe it will re-emerge as the a370 and could see an enlarged fuselage .
us aircraft giant boeing is winning the race in the long-haul market with the 787 , which is being marketed to airlines as a fuel efficient , medium-sized jet .
meanwhile streiff , who is french , was named head of airbus earlier this month .
he replaced the german gustav humbert , who resigned after airbus announced it had run into manufacturing problems with its a380 super jumbo jet that would delay deliveries of the world 's largest passenger aircraft .
news of the delays saw 5.5 billion euros briefly wiped off the market value of eads , which owns 80 percent of airbus .
restoring eads ' image eads ' finances are set to take a further financial hit in the coming months owing to the increased spending on the a350 and penalties it must pay customers for delayed deliveries of the a380 , which is set to enter service in 2007 .

but it stressed that such a force is only an idea for the moment . british prime minister tony blair also appeared to back the idea of an international force .
blair said monday that the proposed force must have more bite and " far greater " numbers than the current un observer mission already there . " the mission will have to be far more specific and clearer , and the force employed will have to be far greater , " blair told reporters , adding however that it would " take time " for it to deploy . european external affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner called the notion of a temporary buffer force an " interesting proposal .

of that total , 1.8 billion will come from eumetsat , the organization that operates europe 's system of meteorological satellites .
most of the remainder will be provided by the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- . the esa says the metop satellites promise " data of unprecedented accuracy and resolution on a host of different variables , such as temperature and humidity , wind speed and direction over the ocean , ozone and trace gases . " that will make " a huge contribution to global weather forecasting and climate monitoring capabilities , " it said . being able to predict the weather reliably can help mitigate the effects of extreme weather conditions - which appear to be on the increase - and therefore save lives . complementary systems the large metop-a satellite - 17.6 meters -lrb- 58 feet -rrb- long once its power-producing solar panels are deployed - is designed to complement eumetsat 's meteosat satellites , which have been beaming weather data back to earth since 1978 . meteosats circle the earth above the equator at very high altitude - 36,000 kilometers -lrb- 22,000 miles -rrb- - and in geostationary orbit .
they afford scientists a wide-angle view of the earth but are unable to see certain portions of the planet . bildunterschrift : a map measuring changes in water temperature in the pacific ocean during 1997 's hurricane " el nino " by contrast , the metops will orbit at just 800-850 kilometers -lrb- 500-525 miles -rrb- over the earth , overflying the north and south poles 14 times every 24 hours .
thanks to the tilting of the earth 's own orbit , they will cover a different slice of the planet every time . " the two systems are complementary because there are lots of measurements that ca n't be done in geostationary orbit , " explained marc cohen , metop program manager at eumetsat . the launch of metop will also mark the start of cooperation between europe and the us national oceanic and atmospheric administration -lrb- noaa -rrb- .
the european and us satellites will operate in complementary orbits to give maximum coverage , with the metop giving morning information and its us counterpart data collected in the afternoon . until the launch of metop , only the us was able to provide the kind of data that polar-orbiting satellites gather . extreme weather the prime use of the metop satellites , the first of which will travel into space aboard a russian soyuz rocket , lies in its instruments , five of which are new european instruments .
these will provide high-resolution images , temperature and humidity measurements , and monitor both ozone levels and ocean winds . the other instruments are provided by noaa and france 's centre national d 'etudes spatiales -lrb- cnes -rrb- . the most sophisticated of all is the infrared atmospheric sounding interferometer -lrb- iasi -rrb- , which esa says should offer meteorologists data " of unprecedented accuracy and resolution on atmospheric temperature and humidity , with which to improve weather prediction . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : extreme weather incidents are on the rise the launch of metop is particularly timely given the apparent increase in extreme weather conditions , from devastating droughts in africa and floods in europe to hurricane katrina and the asian tsunami .
on monday , a tsunami hit the coast of java after an earthquake in the pacific ocean . data from metop may also help settle some of the raging debates on climate change , at a time of warnings from conservationists that the arctic ice cap is melting so fast that polar bears may disappear from the wild this century . the launch of metop-a , scheduled for 18:28 central european time -lrb- 16:28 gmt -rrb- on july 17 , will be broadcasted live on eumetsat 's web site . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european space agency launches competition for us europe congratulated itself wednesday with the launch of the first test satellite of the galileo navigation system , designed to rival the us system and put global positioning into civilian hands .

an eads spokesman said that the plane 's industrial launch , or the start of a350 production , could be expected in the " next months . "
meanwhile , the cost of developing the mid-sized jet could more than double to about $ 10.0 billion -lrb- 7.9 billion euros -rrb- , thomas enders , co-chief executive of airbus ' parent company eads -lrb- european aeronautics defence and space company -rrb- , said sunday , confirming recent media reports .
the original cost had been put at an estimated $ 4 billion .
enders was speaking during a weekend seminar held by eads in bath , southwest england , ahead of the week-long farnborough airshow .
german boss admits errors go back years earlier , in an interview with a german newspaper enders also admitted that errors in the construction of the airbus a380 super jumbo passenger jet go back several years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enders said there were problems with the a380 production in hamburg " we made errors in the construction of the a380 , we need more time -lrb- for work -rrb- on the electrical system , " enders told the daily bild on saturday .
" the errors were made several years ago . "
the german co-chief of eads , the parent company of toulouse-based airbus , said the problem with the a380 was mainly at the hamburg factory where the passenger cabin 's electrical system is installed .
but he added that the hamburg facility " is only one part of the production chain " and that he did not want to blame any particular person .
the shock announcement last month of delivery delays for the 555-seat a380 sparked a leadership crisis at eads , which resulted in the departure of enders ' former co-chairman noel forgeard , who has been replaced by frenchman louis gallois .
enders said in 2007 airbus would deliver nine a380s , the world 's largest commercial airliner , but he could not promise that there would not be new delays in delivery " even with the best will in the world . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the a380 , the world 's largest commercial airliner , at an air show in berlin " we have a problem finding enough qualified personnel , and we have more than 2,000 planes on order for the next few years , " he said .

" disclosure and trust is clear , it is our mandate .
we have clearly to rebuild trust and confidence from our shareholders , " gallois said in farnborough .
gallois replaced frenchman noel forgeard .
the latter had been under intense pressure to quit since it was revealed he sold eads shares worth millions of euros nearly three months before the group had on june 13 announced delays to the a380 .
the wide-body a350 , which in its current design can carry between 250 and 300 passengers , is being overhauled to make it bigger and more fuel efficient .
some analysts believe it will re-emerge as the a370 and could see an enlarged fuselage .
us aircraft giant boeing is winning the race in the long-haul market with the 787 , which is being marketed to airlines as a fuel efficient , medium-sized jet .
meanwhile streiff , who is french , was named head of airbus earlier this month .
he replaced the german gustav humbert , who resigned after airbus announced it had run into manufacturing problems with its a380 super jumbo jet that would delay deliveries of the world 's largest passenger aircraft .
news of the delays saw 5.5 billion euros briefly wiped off the market value of eads , which owns 80 percent of airbus .

an eads spokesman said that the plane 's industrial launch , or the start of a350 production , could be expected in the " next months . "
meanwhile , the cost of developing the mid-sized jet could more than double to about $ 10.0 billion -lrb- 7.9 billion euros -rrb- , thomas enders , co-chief executive of airbus ' parent company eads -lrb- european aeronautics defence and space company -rrb- , said sunday , confirming recent media reports .
the original cost had been put at an estimated $ 4 billion .
enders was speaking during a weekend seminar held by eads in bath , southwest england , ahead of the week-long farnborough airshow .
german boss admits errors go back years earlier , in an interview with a german newspaper enders also admitted that errors in the construction of the airbus a380 super jumbo passenger jet go back several years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enders said there were problems with the a380 production in hamburg " we made errors in the construction of the a380 , we need more time -lrb- for work -rrb- on the electrical system , " enders told the daily bild on saturday .
" the errors were made several years ago . "
the german co-chief of eads , the parent company of toulouse-based airbus , said the problem with the a380 was mainly at the hamburg factory where the passenger cabin 's electrical system is installed .
but he added that the hamburg facility " is only one part of the production chain " and that he did not want to blame any particular person .
the shock announcement last month of delivery delays for the 555-seat a380 sparked a leadership crisis at eads , which resulted in the departure of enders ' former co-chairman noel forgeard , who has been replaced by frenchman louis gallois .
enders said in 2007 airbus would deliver nine a380s , the world 's largest commercial airliner , but he could not promise that there would not be new delays in delivery " even with the best will in the world . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the a380 , the world 's largest commercial airliner , at an air show in berlin " we have a problem finding enough qualified personnel , and we have more than 2,000 planes on order for the next few years , " he said .
building trust gallois acknowledged that eads needed to rebuild trust after its recent management crisis caused by delays to the airbus a380 super jumbo .
" disclosure and trust is clear , it is our mandate .
we have clearly to rebuild trust and confidence from our shareholders , " gallois said in farnborough .
gallois replaced frenchman noel forgeard .
the latter had been under intense pressure to quit since it was revealed he sold eads shares worth millions of euros nearly three months before the group had on june 13 announced delays to the a380 .
the wide-body a350 , which in its current design can carry between 250 and 300 passengers , is being overhauled to make it bigger and more fuel efficient .
some analysts believe it will re-emerge as the a370 and could see an enlarged fuselage .
us aircraft giant boeing is winning the race in the long-haul market with the 787 , which is being marketed to airlines as a fuel efficient , medium-sized jet .
meanwhile streiff , who is french , was named head of airbus earlier this month .
he replaced the german gustav humbert , who resigned after airbus announced it had run into manufacturing problems with its a380 super jumbo jet that would delay deliveries of the world 's largest passenger aircraft .
news of the delays saw 5.5 billion euros briefly wiped off the market value of eads , which owns 80 percent of airbus .
restoring eads ' image eads ' finances are set to take a further financial hit in the coming months owing to the increased spending on the a350 and penalties it must pay customers for delayed deliveries of the a380 , which is set to enter service in 2007 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eads is facing bad news on the financial front the company could be forced soon also to pay 2.75 billion euros for the 20 percent of airbus it does not own .
bae systems has served eads with a formal notice permitting the british group to exercise an option to sell eads its 20-percent stake in airbus .
enders told journalists in bath that the management crisis was over .
but he added : " undoubtedly the reputation of this company has suffered , so has the confidence of customers and investors .
the project that triggered this crisis , the a380 , needs to be fixed . "
following the a380 debacle , gallois told journalists that his first task was to help restore the reputation of eads " to the highest standard .

" the festival is getting bigger and bigger , " indian director and prolific film music composer naresh sharma told the afp news agency .
" people are really interested in indian film . " this year , the event drew 7,500 visitors , a thousand more than in 2005 , but below the 10,000 expected . the audience is a mixture of devotees who avidly follow the careers of their favorite stars such as actress aishwarya rai , and industry players who come to look at the latest offerings from the world 's second biggest cinema industry after hollywood . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : love plays the lead role in many bollywood productions bollywood 's two european camps " on the one hand you have those who know the names of all the indian actors , and on the other hand those who want to keep up do date with bollywood , " program director wiebke reiss said . the german festival program did its best to cater to both groups . in four days , some 100 films were shown , ranging from the next big features and a large number of documentaries to short horror films and a retrospective of the works of raj kapoor , an indian cinema idol of the 1950s . women came dressed in flowing silk saris and traditional jewelery as thousands of filmgoers sampled the spicy punjabi and gujurati cuisine on offer at a bazaar set up for the festival . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bollywood is becoming a regular feature on german television goal is to find new german viewers but weiss said the idea was also to convert those who believed that indian cinema had little more to offer than curry westerns or kitschy dramas , often up to three hours long , where love plays the lead role and characters regularly burst into song and dance . these films - big on sentiment but coy about sex - have found a following well beyond india , notably in the arab world where they pose far fewer problems for the censors than standard hollywood fare . german television channels have warmed up to the charm of indian cinema , with the cable channel rtl ii snapping up a number of titles .

it deals with the difficulty of keeping the passion alive after 10 years of marriage . the organizers plan to keep expanding the festival .

the death toll has climbed to over 160 , with civilians bearing the brunt of the conflict . " the un needs time and space to make sure we have the troops - well-trained , well-equipped troops - to go in quite quickly , " annan said .
" the sooner decisions are taken by the -lrb- un -rrb- security council , the better it is . " annan said a team of un officials in the crisis region would report to the security council by the end of the week .
he urged countries not to delay sending troops for the planned middle east peace operation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annan with german chancellor merkel and eu commission president barroso at the g8 summit annan , however , gave no indication of the number of troops required , nor any deadlines for the deployment . merkel , chirac welcome idea annan 's proposal has been largely welcomed by g8 leaders . german chancellor angela merkel said the g8 was determined to strengthen lebanon 's central government as part of efforts to end hezbollah rocket attacks on israel . " i think it make sense to have such a force based there , " merkel said , adding that she envisaged expanding the current un operation in southern lebanon . some 1,991 un soldiers have been based in lebanon since 1978 .
called unifil , the force has patrolled the hilly roads bordering on israel in its white vehicles but proved powerless to rein in guerrillas or stem israeli retaliation . the force proved ineffective when israel invaded lebanon in 1982 to flush out palestinian fighters who had attacked its northern border settlements .
unifil 's mandate was to verify an israeli withdrawal , restore international peace and security , and assist the government of lebanon " in ensuring the return of its effective authority in the area . " french president jacques chirac also backed the idea of a new force in lebanon and called for setting up a surveillance border along the israeli-lebanese border . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a flattened apartment building in beirut " we can not allow things to go on as they are .
we have to have a means of repression and surveillance , " chirac said . he added that the force 's mandate should include disarming hezbollah militias who have been launching rocket attacks on israel . blair : force should have more bite finland , which currently heads the european union presidency , also said the eu and its member states would be ready to participate in a un peacekeeping force for lebanon .
but it stressed that such a force is only an idea for the moment . british prime minister tony blair also appeared to back the idea of an international force .
blair said monday that the proposed force must have more bite and " far greater " numbers than the current un observer mission already there . " the mission will have to be far more specific and clearer , and the force employed will have to be far greater , " blair told reporters , adding however that it would " take time " for it to deploy . european external affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner called the notion of a temporary buffer force an " interesting proposal . " us , israel not convinced however , many doubt whether sending a new force to the region could halt the current violence . the united states was cautious , saying it wanted to hear the recommendations of a un fact-finding mission and israel dismissed talk of a multilateral security presence as premature . meanwhile , intense diplomacy aimed at ending the bloodshed is under way with france 's prime minister dominique de villepin flying to beirut shortly after a visit by the european union 's chief diplomat , javier solana , to the lebanese capital . the un security council also picked up talks from saturday when it failed to reach agreement on a call for a ceasefire between israel and hezbollah . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu renews call for restraint in middle east european union foreign ministers are scrambling to find diplomatic solutions to halt the fighting between israel and hezbollah , as the escalating crisis risks setting the middle east aflame .

at first , not a lot of them agree with the operation and how hezbollah started with such an adventure , knowing what the reaction from the israelis would be .
at the end of the day , these people , the lebanese people , are paying the price of the war . however , every day that the bombing continues , people are more and more shocked and horrified by the magnitude of the reaction .
they are seeing their houses destroyed and their businesses closed and their people transferred from one region to another .
because of all the suffering they are witnessing , they can not accept to live with what is happening . what are the people most concerned about at the moment ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people are concerned violence may continue for months they are concerned that things could get worse .
that more people will be transferred from the south and that electricity plants could be the next target .
up to now the electricity plants have been avoided , which was not the case in 1996 .
but if the situation gets worse , i 'm afraid this could be the next target .
people are afraid the situation will continue for weeks or months .
lebanon does not have the capability to stand such a long war . how much of everyday life is still continuing ? it depends on the area .
in some areas that have been avoided , where there is not a massive presence of hezbollah , they are witnessing very timid activity .
however , all the bridges and main roads that connect one region to another have been systematically targeted by the bombing over the last few days .
regions are cut off from each other , which freezes the all economic activity .
what remains is a very local activity in the regions that are not the primary target of the bombing . do you have access to necessities like food and water ? it also depends on the region .
some regions , like in the southern part of beirut are completely devastated .
they are receiving aid and help from other regions .
here you can witness solidarity between lebanese across religions and communities to help each other , even though they do n't agree on the political level about what is happening .
despite the fact that they had , or still have , disagreements about the role and nature of the resistance .
among the population , you can see signs of solidarity among the people . do you have any access to information about what is happening around you ? we still have some access to the internet and some access through satellite to international broadcast networks , but this could stop if electricity goes away or more infrastructure is targeted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roads and bridges have been destroyed , making it difficult to flee there are reports of people trying to flee lebanon .
have you seen people trying to leave the area ? people are moving from one area to another .
lebanon is still under a blockade from the sea and the air .
at first some people could flee the country through syria , but now this is more and more difficult because the air bombings are targeting the main roads and main bridges .
what we are witnessing is a transfer of the population from one area to another , and this is done on purpose .
i think one of the aims of the operation is to push the population towards an area to create psychological and popular pressure on the hezbollah leadership to comply with the ceasefire conditions . what do you think is the motivation behind the bombing ? i think it started with the single objective of freeing the two soldiers who were captured , but now more and more we see there are signs to put in place a new equation that is more in favor of israelis ' security and for the security of their northern frontiers . it is true that it is a reaction to an operation that was led by hezbollah , but it seems clear that it was planned beforehand and that the objective is to come up with a new balance of power that is more favorable to the israelis and secures their borders . what do you think are the chances that violence could spread to syria ? it is my personal analysis , but i can not believe that israel today is capable of opening three fronts at the same time .
they have a war still going on in gaza , and they have been kind of forced to open another front in lebanon , and i hardly believe that they are willing to open a third front in syria . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fear violence could spread beyond lebanon and gaza what do you think are the chances of a ceasefire ? for the time being , zero . i believe that the peak of violence has not been reached yet .

" what international organizations do you think need to increase pressure to bring about a ceasefire ? i think the pressure started with a call from the un and tony blair that they are ready to send an international force to the border between israel and lebanon .

the death toll has climbed to over 160 , with civilians bearing the brunt of the conflict . " the un needs time and space to make sure we have the troops - well-trained , well-equipped troops - to go in quite quickly , " annan said .
" the sooner decisions are taken by the -lrb- un -rrb- security council , the better it is . " annan said a team of un officials in the crisis region would report to the security council by the end of the week .
he urged countries not to delay sending troops for the planned middle east peace operation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annan with german chancellor merkel and eu commission president barroso at the g8 summit annan , however , gave no indication of the number of troops required , nor any deadlines for the deployment . merkel , chirac welcome idea annan 's proposal has been largely welcomed by g8 leaders . german chancellor angela merkel said the g8 was determined to strengthen lebanon 's central government as part of efforts to end hezbollah rocket attacks on israel . " i think it make sense to have such a force based there , " merkel said , adding that she envisaged expanding the current un operation in southern lebanon . some 1,991 un soldiers have been based in lebanon since 1978 .
called unifil , the force has patrolled the hilly roads bordering on israel in its white vehicles but proved powerless to rein in guerrillas or stem israeli retaliation . the force proved ineffective when israel invaded lebanon in 1982 to flush out palestinian fighters who had attacked its northern border settlements .
unifil 's mandate was to verify an israeli withdrawal , restore international peace and security , and assist the government of lebanon " in ensuring the return of its effective authority in the area . " french president jacques chirac also backed the idea of a new force in lebanon and called for setting up a surveillance border along the israeli-lebanese border . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a flattened apartment building in beirut " we can not allow things to go on as they are .
we have to have a means of repression and surveillance , " chirac said . he added that the force 's mandate should include disarming hezbollah militias who have been launching rocket attacks on israel . blair : force should have more bite finland , which currently heads the european union presidency , also said the eu and its member states would be ready to participate in a un peacekeeping force for lebanon .
but it stressed that such a force is only an idea for the moment . british prime minister tony blair also appeared to back the idea of an international force .
blair said monday that the proposed force must have more bite and " far greater " numbers than the current un observer mission already there . " the mission will have to be far more specific and clearer , and the force employed will have to be far greater , " blair told reporters , adding however that it would " take time " for it to deploy . european external affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner called the notion of a temporary buffer force an " interesting proposal . " us , israel not convinced however , many doubt whether sending a new force to the region could halt the current violence . the united states was cautious , saying it wanted to hear the recommendations of a un fact-finding mission and israel dismissed talk of a multilateral security presence as premature . meanwhile , intense diplomacy aimed at ending the bloodshed is under way with france 's prime minister dominique de villepin flying to beirut shortly after a visit by the european union 's chief diplomat , javier solana , to the lebanese capital . the un security council also picked up talks from saturday when it failed to reach agreement on a call for a ceasefire between israel and hezbollah . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu renews call for restraint in middle east european union foreign ministers are scrambling to find diplomatic solutions to halt the fighting between israel and hezbollah , as the escalating crisis risks setting the middle east aflame .

the death toll has climbed to over 160 , with civilians bearing the brunt of the conflict . " the un needs time and space to make sure we have the troops - well-trained , well-equipped troops - to go in quite quickly , " annan said .
" the sooner decisions are taken by the -lrb- un -rrb- security council , the better it is . " annan said a team of un officials in the crisis region would report to the security council by the end of the week .
he urged countries not to delay sending troops for the planned middle east peace operation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annan with german chancellor merkel and eu commission president barroso at the g8 summit annan , however , gave no indication of the number of troops required , nor any deadlines for the deployment . merkel , chirac welcome idea annan 's proposal has been largely welcomed by g8 leaders . german chancellor angela merkel said the g8 was determined to strengthen lebanon 's central government as part of efforts to end hezbollah rocket attacks on israel . " i think it make sense to have such a force based there , " merkel said , adding that she envisaged expanding the current un operation in southern lebanon . some 1,991 un soldiers have been based in lebanon since 1978 .
called unifil , the force has patrolled the hilly roads bordering on israel in its white vehicles but proved powerless to rein in guerrillas or stem israeli retaliation . the force proved ineffective when israel invaded lebanon in 1982 to flush out palestinian fighters who had attacked its northern border settlements .
unifil 's mandate was to verify an israeli withdrawal , restore international peace and security , and assist the government of lebanon " in ensuring the return of its effective authority in the area . " french president jacques chirac also backed the idea of a new force in lebanon and called for setting up a surveillance border along the israeli-lebanese border . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a flattened apartment building in beirut " we can not allow things to go on as they are .
we have to have a means of repression and surveillance , " chirac said . he added that the force 's mandate should include disarming hezbollah militias who have been launching rocket attacks on israel . blair : force should have more bite finland , which currently heads the european union presidency , also said the eu and its member states would be ready to participate in a un peacekeeping force for lebanon .
but it stressed that such a force is only an idea for the moment . british prime minister tony blair also appeared to back the idea of an international force .

" i am convinced that now is the time for us to make a political decision , whatever it might be , " brazilian president luis ignacio lula da silva said after a early monday meeting with us president george w. bush , where he urged a redoubling of efforts to break the trade impasse .
" we can not leave it in the hands of our negotiators only . " the elusive agreement , which has been under discussion for five years , has repeatedly stalled on issues such as how much the us will cut its farm subsidies , how far the european union will go in reducing its tariffs on farm imports and the readiness of developing countries to significantly reduce barriers to industrial and service products . on monday , trade representatives from the eu , the us , brazil , india , japan and australia are heading to world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- headquarters in geneva to continue talks .

the us president 's power to " fast track " trade deals without a vote in congress expires at the middle of next year . energy divisions on the issue of energy , g8 leaders were not able to come to agreement in several areas . one major point of contention in the area of energy security has been russia 's refusal to ratify the energy charter treaty , which governs energy investment and transit issues in europe , russia and other countries .

" we recognize that g8 members pursue different ways to achieve energy security and the goals of climate protection , " the statement 's section on nuclear power begins , basically agreeing to disagree . democracy discussion leaders at the summit met on sunday night for a dinner during which they had " a frank discussion " with russian president vladimir putin over his country 's democratic development , according to a diplomat there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters on sunday in st. petersburg , defying a ban on unapproved protests critics of putin in russia and in the west often say his six years in power have been marked by a clampdown on the mass media , decreasing toleration for dissent and a centralization of power in the kremlin .

an eads spokesman said that the plane 's industrial launch , or the start of a350 production , could be expected in the " next months . "
meanwhile , the cost of developing the mid-sized jet could more than double to about $ 10.0 billion -lrb- 7.9 billion euros -rrb- , thomas enders , co-chief executive of airbus ' parent company eads -lrb- european aeronautics defence and space company -rrb- , said sunday , confirming recent media reports .
the original cost had been put at an estimated $ 4 billion .
enders was speaking during a weekend seminar held by eads in bath , southwest england , ahead of the week-long farnborough airshow .
german boss admits errors go back years earlier , in an interview with a german newspaper enders also admitted that errors in the construction of the airbus a380 super jumbo passenger jet go back several years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enders said there were problems with the a380 production in hamburg " we made errors in the construction of the a380 , we need more time -lrb- for work -rrb- on the electrical system , " enders told the daily bild on saturday .
" the errors were made several years ago . "
the german co-chief of eads , the parent company of toulouse-based airbus , said the problem with the a380 was mainly at the hamburg factory where the passenger cabin 's electrical system is installed .
but he added that the hamburg facility " is only one part of the production chain " and that he did not want to blame any particular person .
the shock announcement last month of delivery delays for the 555-seat a380 sparked a leadership crisis at eads , which resulted in the departure of enders ' former co-chairman noel forgeard , who has been replaced by frenchman louis gallois .
enders said in 2007 airbus would deliver nine a380s , the world 's largest commercial airliner , but he could not promise that there would not be new delays in delivery " even with the best will in the world . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the a380 , the world 's largest commercial airliner , at an air show in berlin " we have a problem finding enough qualified personnel , and we have more than 2,000 planes on order for the next few years , " he said .
building trust gallois acknowledged that eads needed to rebuild trust after its recent management crisis caused by delays to the airbus a380 super jumbo .
" disclosure and trust is clear , it is our mandate .
we have clearly to rebuild trust and confidence from our shareholders , " gallois said in farnborough .
gallois replaced frenchman noel forgeard .
the latter had been under intense pressure to quit since it was revealed he sold eads shares worth millions of euros nearly three months before the group had on june 13 announced delays to the a380 .
the wide-body a350 , which in its current design can carry between 250 and 300 passengers , is being overhauled to make it bigger and more fuel efficient .
some analysts believe it will re-emerge as the a370 and could see an enlarged fuselage .
us aircraft giant boeing is winning the race in the long-haul market with the 787 , which is being marketed to airlines as a fuel efficient , medium-sized jet .
meanwhile streiff , who is french , was named head of airbus earlier this month .
he replaced the german gustav humbert , who resigned after airbus announced it had run into manufacturing problems with its a380 super jumbo jet that would delay deliveries of the world 's largest passenger aircraft .
news of the delays saw 5.5 billion euros briefly wiped off the market value of eads , which owns 80 percent of airbus .
restoring eads ' image eads ' finances are set to take a further financial hit in the coming months owing to the increased spending on the a350 and penalties it must pay customers for delayed deliveries of the a380 , which is set to enter service in 2007 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.07.2006 europe launches satellite to boost climate research großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a computer simluation of the advanced weather satellite the most complex earth observation satellite ever to be placed into orbit is to be launched monday as part of a 15-year program to improve the accuracy of weather forecasting and our understanding of climate change . the first of three huge polar-orbiting metop -lrb- meteorological operational -rrb- satellites is to be fired into space on monday from russia 's baikonur cosmodrome in kazakhstan . metop-a , weighing more than four tons , is the most complex satellite of its kind , boasting around a dozen instruments for measuring weather patterns and transmitting back data . it will be the first of three metop satellites to be launched roughly five years apart over the coming years at a cost of 2.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- .
of that total , 1.8 billion will come from eumetsat , the organization that operates europe 's system of meteorological satellites .
most of the remainder will be provided by the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- . the esa says the metop satellites promise " data of unprecedented accuracy and resolution on a host of different variables , such as temperature and humidity , wind speed and direction over the ocean , ozone and trace gases . " that will make " a huge contribution to global weather forecasting and climate monitoring capabilities , " it said . being able to predict the weather reliably can help mitigate the effects of extreme weather conditions - which appear to be on the increase - and therefore save lives . complementary systems the large metop-a satellite - 17.6 meters -lrb- 58 feet -rrb- long once its power-producing solar panels are deployed - is designed to complement eumetsat 's meteosat satellites , which have been beaming weather data back to earth since 1978 . meteosats circle the earth above the equator at very high altitude - 36,000 kilometers -lrb- 22,000 miles -rrb- - and in geostationary orbit .
they afford scientists a wide-angle view of the earth but are unable to see certain portions of the planet . bildunterschrift : a map measuring changes in water temperature in the pacific ocean during 1997 's hurricane " el nino " by contrast , the metops will orbit at just 800-850 kilometers -lrb- 500-525 miles -rrb- over the earth , overflying the north and south poles 14 times every 24 hours .
thanks to the tilting of the earth 's own orbit , they will cover a different slice of the planet every time . " the two systems are complementary because there are lots of measurements that ca n't be done in geostationary orbit , " explained marc cohen , metop program manager at eumetsat . the launch of metop will also mark the start of cooperation between europe and the us national oceanic and atmospheric administration -lrb- noaa -rrb- .
the european and us satellites will operate in complementary orbits to give maximum coverage , with the metop giving morning information and its us counterpart data collected in the afternoon . until the launch of metop , only the us was able to provide the kind of data that polar-orbiting satellites gather . extreme weather the prime use of the metop satellites , the first of which will travel into space aboard a russian soyuz rocket , lies in its instruments , five of which are new european instruments .
these will provide high-resolution images , temperature and humidity measurements , and monitor both ozone levels and ocean winds . the other instruments are provided by noaa and france 's centre national d 'etudes spatiales -lrb- cnes -rrb- . the most sophisticated of all is the infrared atmospheric sounding interferometer -lrb- iasi -rrb- , which esa says should offer meteorologists data " of unprecedented accuracy and resolution on atmospheric temperature and humidity , with which to improve weather prediction . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : extreme weather incidents are on the rise the launch of metop is particularly timely given the apparent increase in extreme weather conditions , from devastating droughts in africa and floods in europe to hurricane katrina and the asian tsunami .
on monday , a tsunami hit the coast of java after an earthquake in the pacific ocean . data from metop may also help settle some of the raging debates on climate change , at a time of warnings from conservationists that the arctic ice cap is melting so fast that polar bears may disappear from the wild this century . the launch of metop-a , scheduled for 18:28 central european time -lrb- 16:28 gmt -rrb- on july 17 , will be broadcasted live on eumetsat 's web site . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european space agency launches competition for us europe congratulated itself wednesday with the launch of the first test satellite of the galileo navigation system , designed to rival the us system and put global positioning into civilian hands .

of that total , 1.8 billion will come from eumetsat , the organization that operates europe 's system of meteorological satellites .
most of the remainder will be provided by the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- . the esa says the metop satellites promise " data of unprecedented accuracy and resolution on a host of different variables , such as temperature and humidity , wind speed and direction over the ocean , ozone and trace gases . " that will make " a huge contribution to global weather forecasting and climate monitoring capabilities , " it said . being able to predict the weather reliably can help mitigate the effects of extreme weather conditions - which appear to be on the increase - and therefore save lives . complementary systems the large metop-a satellite - 17.6 meters -lrb- 58 feet -rrb- long once its power-producing solar panels are deployed - is designed to complement eumetsat 's meteosat satellites , which have been beaming weather data back to earth since 1978 . meteosats circle the earth above the equator at very high altitude - 36,000 kilometers -lrb- 22,000 miles -rrb- - and in geostationary orbit .
they afford scientists a wide-angle view of the earth but are unable to see certain portions of the planet . bildunterschrift : a map measuring changes in water temperature in the pacific ocean during 1997 's hurricane " el nino " by contrast , the metops will orbit at just 800-850 kilometers -lrb- 500-525 miles -rrb- over the earth , overflying the north and south poles 14 times every 24 hours .
thanks to the tilting of the earth 's own orbit , they will cover a different slice of the planet every time . " the two systems are complementary because there are lots of measurements that ca n't be done in geostationary orbit , " explained marc cohen , metop program manager at eumetsat . the launch of metop will also mark the start of cooperation between europe and the us national oceanic and atmospheric administration -lrb- noaa -rrb- .
the european and us satellites will operate in complementary orbits to give maximum coverage , with the metop giving morning information and its us counterpart data collected in the afternoon . until the launch of metop , only the us was able to provide the kind of data that polar-orbiting satellites gather . extreme weather the prime use of the metop satellites , the first of which will travel into space aboard a russian soyuz rocket , lies in its instruments , five of which are new european instruments .
these will provide high-resolution images , temperature and humidity measurements , and monitor both ozone levels and ocean winds . the other instruments are provided by noaa and france 's centre national d 'etudes spatiales -lrb- cnes -rrb- . the most sophisticated of all is the infrared atmospheric sounding interferometer -lrb- iasi -rrb- , which esa says should offer meteorologists data " of unprecedented accuracy and resolution on atmospheric temperature and humidity , with which to improve weather prediction . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : extreme weather incidents are on the rise the launch of metop is particularly timely given the apparent increase in extreme weather conditions , from devastating droughts in africa and floods in europe to hurricane katrina and the asian tsunami .
on monday , a tsunami hit the coast of java after an earthquake in the pacific ocean . data from metop may also help settle some of the raging debates on climate change , at a time of warnings from conservationists that the arctic ice cap is melting so fast that polar bears may disappear from the wild this century . the launch of metop-a , scheduled for 18:28 central european time -lrb- 16:28 gmt -rrb- on july 17 , will be broadcasted live on eumetsat 's web site . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : european space agency launches competition for us europe congratulated itself wednesday with the launch of the first test satellite of the galileo navigation system , designed to rival the us system and put global positioning into civilian hands .

the pipe will link two liquefied natural gas -lrb- lng -rrb- terminals at milford haven with the national network .
critics claim the project has been surrounded in secrecy and have questioned the need for it .
but the company said it would be vital for the energy needs of the uk for many years .
phase one , which runs 120km -lrb- 75 miles -rrb- from milford haven to the neath valley , is set to be completed in a year .
phase two - for which planning permission is yet to be granted by the department of trade and industry - would extend further east to gloucestershire , cutting a corner of the brecon beacons national park .
a huge amount of work is going into laying the pipe .
enlarge image the national grid has come in for criticism from some people living near the pipeline , and last week representatives of communities affected along the length of the route met in cross hands .
some residents in the swansea valley village of trebanos are concerned about blasting needed to run the pipe under an old quarry .
there is opposition in cilfrew where a pressure station is due to be built , and there are others fighting the route through the beacons .
the safe haven network , set up to promote their interests , wants the whole project called in by the welsh assembly government .
' vital component ' but the national grid 's senior project manager david mercer told bbc wales that although the project was the largest single link the company had built , it was similar to those 30 years ago when the uk 's main network was put in place .
pipeline facts will supply 20 % of the uk 's gas needs crosses 16 roads , 40 rivers and streams and nine railway lines 1,300 people working on it , over half from south wales 23,000 sections of pipe between 12 - 18m long uses 242,000 tonnes of steel " the high pressure national transmission system in the uk has been in operation in the uk for over 35 years and we have never had a serious incident on our system .
" it 's a very safe system built to the highest internationally recognised standards .
" this pipeline is needed to connect the two lng terminals at milford haven with our existing gas network .
" some of that gas will supply south wales and some of that gas will go into england .
" what is vital to say is that new gas infrastructure in west wales will aid development and it will give opportunities for industry and users of gas to create business opportunities .
" a key part of the government 's policy is to have diversity of supply and a secure gas supply both for electricity generation and for home and industry is a vital component for that and will continue to be for many years in the future .
" i 'm disappointed if people feel we have not communicated as well as we have done .
" we have a large communications team on this project and we worked very hard to inform communities before construction started . "

mayor ken livingstone has been welcoming the russians to london unless , that is , you prefer its old russian rival , the mariinsky theatre of st petersburg - or kirov as it is still commonly known - which is also coming to town .
the two are performing a few streets from each other , offering a unique chance to sample the best of russian ballet and opera in one place .
is that too much ballet ?
each theatre has picked a programme reflecting its own character and strengths , minimising the risk of repetition .
could we not have more football instead ?
men in shorts - as opposed to men in tights - feature in one of the mariinsky 's ballets .
the golden age concerns a football match between soviet and " capitalist " teams .

it 's called civilisation .
c j howden send us your comments for the mariinsky , competing for a fat profit does not appear to be the aim of this july visit .
but the fact it will be playing the coliseum while the bolshoi does covent garden , invites match comparisons .
so how are the team selections looking ?
proud heritage if you decided to see just one of the performances , " you should definitely opt for the bolshoi " , says its director alexei ratmansky .
not a pair of shorts in sight in the bolshoi 's pharaoh 's daughter ...
" our troupe is in fine form and the repertoire we are bringing is full of variety , including three which are completely new for the city .
" covent garden 's stage , the wings , everything is good for staging a ballet . "
he says that the bolshoi season is meant to mark 50 years since its first tour of london , and is showcasing the best of its work with such classics as swan lake and don quixote .
while any great theatre must act as a museum to some extent , it must keep staging new work , adds mr ratmansky .
his top tip for the london season are some of the bolshoi 's youngest ballet stars , like natalia osipova and denis matvienko .
something different if one theatre is celebrating a 50th anniversary , the mariinsky is marking a 100th one - soviet composer dmitri shostakovich 's birth . ... and not a tutu to be seen in the mariinsky 's golden age the bolshoi also has shostakovich centenary productions in moscow , and is premiering his ballet the bright stream in london .
but the mariinsky 's repertoire at the coliseum consists solely of the work of st petersburg 's native son , much of it barely known outside russia .
footballing ballet-dancers ?
maybe ...
but what about the bedbug ?
the nose ?
cheryomushki ?
paul cardwell , a director of the uk-based mariinsky theatre trust , says the focus of this tour is not to achieve the kind of commercial success seen in well-known ballets like the nutcracker .
" this is a much more interesting tour because the work is unknown , " he says .
" but i think that audiences now know russian companies , and they would be interested to see the other stuff they do . "
he suggests uk sponsorship is allowing the mariinsky to take a certain amount of risk at the box office .
the charity set up to promote the mariinsky shows the loyalty it inspires in the uk .
the work of chief conductor valery gergiev to keep it thriving through years of economic turmoil enjoys wide respect .
he is conducting the mariinsky through the entire wagner ring cycle in baden baden , germany , before raising his baton for shostakovich .
two greats asked to identify a mariinsky highlight , mr cardwell mentions a ballet set to the leningrad symphony - music traditionally associated with the wartime siege of the city .
but he adds that he is looking forward to seeing the bolshoi in london , too .
alexei ratmansky is similarly respectful towards " the opposition " .
" it would be wrong to speculate about which theatre is better because the kirov and the bolshoi are both very important theatres , " he says .
" it is just a question of what you prefer . "
the mariinsky performs at english national opera coliseum 20-29 july , and the bolshoi at the royal opera house covent garden 25 july-19 august .
big dance week runs from 15-23 july .

the raids come after a hezbollah rocket attack killed eight israelis in haifa .
israeli prime minister ehud olmert warned that the haifa attack would have " far-reaching consequences " .
beirut 's port and northern suburbs were also hit overnight .
about 130 lebanese have been killed since israeli operations began on wednesday .
early on monday , israeli air strikes targeted tripoli , lebanon 's second-largest city located in the north , and baalbek in the east .
the target in abdeh was about 6km -lrb- four miles -rrb- south of the border with syria .
mid-east crisis map voices from the conflict beirut 's displaced families ten lebanese soldiers were reported injured in the strike that killed eight of their colleagues .
the israeli military said it had been targeting radar stations in abdeh because they were used by hezbollah to hit an israeli ship on friday , the associated press news agency reported .
the port of beirut also came under attack , as well as fuel tanks in dawra in the northern suburbs .
at least two people are believed to have died in the raids on the capital .
the israeli air strikes began after hezbollah seized two israeli soldiers during a raid into israel on wednesday .
twelve israeli civilians have been killed by hezbollah rockets since fighting began - including the eight killed in haifa .
in other developments : the israeli army said hezbollah rockets fired from lebanon have struck deeper into israel than ever before , hitting the town of afula , 50km -lrb- 33 miles -rrb- south of the border , and the outskirts of nazareth israeli air strikes late on sunday set fuel tanks ablaze at beirut 's international airport hezbollah leader hassan nasrallah said the battle against israel was " just at the beginning " , in his first televised appearance since the offensive began iran 's foreign ministry denied israeli allegations that it supplied missiles to hezbollah top european union and united nations officials have arrived in beirut for talks on the crisis . "

israel rattled at least 16 died in israeli air strikes on sunday the city of tyre , while attacks on a border village killed seven canadians of lebanese origin who were on a family holiday .
have your say " hezbollah , syria and iran are using our country as a battleground against israel " nayef , beirut send us your comments day by day : crisis unfolds canada said it had begun organising evacuation plans for the estimated 40,000 canadians in lebanon .
the strikes came hours after the haifa rocket attack , which killed eight members of a train repair crew .
correspondents say the large death-count in a strike on israel 's third-largest city has rattled the whole country .
israel 's death toll from the fighting stands at 24 overall .
israel has carried out a heavy bombing campaign across lebanon , hitting hezbollah sites , but also a wide range of civilian targets .
us security teams have landed at the us embassy in beirut to start planning the evacuation of americans .
foreign nationals have been leaving lebanon to escape the violence .
as the violence has escalated the number of locals attempting to flee has grown , but with the israelis targeting the border areas and nearby roads , this has become increasingly difficult .

mccarthy , the uk 's biggest builder of retirement homes , said the offer represented a good deal for investors .

aldersgate is the investment vehicle of billionaire brothers simon and david reuben .
share boost the firm 's shares shot up on news of the rival bids .
they rose 106 pence - or 11 % - to 1048p in early trading .
on friday , the firm 's shares had closed at 942 pence , valuing the company at £ 960m -lrb- $ 1.76bn -rrb- .
mccarthy announced it had been approached by two prospective suitors last month .

data on all of the leading consumer isps in the uk were collected by internet testing firm epitiro .
the firm used software that connected to services every 15 minutes to test various features including download times and connection failures .
results from 10 locations around the uk identified bt as top followed by virgin , demon , aol and then orange .
the survey did not take into account broadband provided by cable companies such as ntl telewest .
epitiro has been conducting tests of broadband services for the last three years .
the information that it collects is normally sold back to telecoms providers and isps .
the report is the first time that results have been released to the public .
in terms of internet performance , bt yahoo topped the overall rankings for the period april to june 2006 , " said gavin johns , managing director of epitiro .
" bt was also found to provide the fastest service as a percentage of its theoretical maximum . "
even though isps may offer 2mbps or 4mbps services , consumers will never receive a service that reaches these theoretical speeds .
factors such as the amount of people using the web or the age of cables connecting a house to the network slow down the connection .

multiple isps are compared at each location to make sure that factors such as distance from telephone exchanges do not influence the results .
the same speed services from different isps are compared together .
each agent tests 10 different aspects of a service every 15 minutes .
these include the time it takes to connect to a service provider , how long it takes to download a website or how long it takes to upload content to the web .
